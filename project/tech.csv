This system allows vehicles to pass through toll points without slowing down or stopping, using a combination of radio-frequency identification, ANPR, and satellite navigation technologies.The contract, awarded by Indian Highways Management Company Limited (IHMCL), is part of India's pilot MLFF project aimed at creating barrier-free movement on national highways.

Analysts see Donald Trump's 'hand' in the deal

Chinese company slams Dutch government's takeover





In what can be seen as escalating geo-political war on trade relations, the Dutch government has taken control of Nexperia, a Netherlands-based chipmaker owned by China’s Wingtech Technology. The decision, announced by the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, invokes the “Goods Availability Act” to ensure the availability of Nexperia’s chips amid escalating global trade tensions. The ministry cited “recent and acute signals of serious governance shortcomings” at Nexperia, warning that these posed a threat to Dutch and European technological capabilities. Nijmegen-headquartered Nexperia Nexperia is one of the world's largest makers of simple computer chips such as diodes and transistors, though it also develops more advanced technologies such as ""wide gap"" semiconductors used in electrical settings and useful for electric cars, chargers and AI data centres.“Losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security,” the statement read, highlighting the automotive sector’s vulnerability. The intervention, described as “highly exceptional,” was enacted in September to prevent potential disruptions in chip supply during emergencies.The move comes amid heightened U.S.-China trade tensions, with the US President Donald Trump recently threatening 100% tariffs on Chinese exports.While the Dutch Economic Affairs Ministry denied U.S. involvement, calling the timing “purely coincidental,” the decision aligns with broader US-Netherlands cooperation on chip industry export controls. Beijing’s recent restrictions on rare earth elements and magnets, critical for Europe’s automotive sector, may further complicate trade relations.Wingtech had already been placed on the United States' ""entity list"" in December 2024 for its alleged role ""in aiding China's government's efforts to acquire entities with sensitive semiconductor manufacturing capability.""Wingtech, in a now-deleted WeChat post archived by Pekingnology, criticized the Dutch government’s actions as “excessive intervention driven by geopolitical bias” rather than evidence-based risk assessment. The company emphasized its compliance with local laws since acquiring Nexperia in 2019 and its employment of thousands across the Netherlands, Germany, and Britain. A Nexperia spokesperson told CNBC that the company remains compliant with all regulations and is in regular contact with authorities but offered no further comment.This seizure follows previous Dutch scrutiny of Nexperia, including a 2023 investigation into its acquisition of chip startup Nowi, which was ultimately approved. The move could further strain China-Netherlands trade relations, already tense due to restrictions on Dutch firm ASML’s exports of advanced chip-making equipment to China.As global trade frictions intensify, the Dutch government’s unprecedented action underscores the strategic importance of semiconductors in national and economic security.Following the announcement, Wingtech’s stock plummeted 10% -- its daily limit -- on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. A corporate filing dated October 13 confirmed that Nexperia is now under temporary external management, with restrictions on changes to its assets, business, or personnel for up to a year. Wingtech Chairman Zhang Xuezheng has been suspended from his roles at Nexperia, though the company’s daily operations will continue.","The Dutch government has taken control of Nexperia, a Netherlands-based chipmaker owned by China's Wingtech Technology.

Billionaires still hold massive wealth





The world’s ten richest people lost nearly $70 billion in a single day as global markets fell on fears of a renewed US–China trade war. The selloff followed President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports and new export restrictions on key software. As per the Bloomberg Billionaires index, the ten wealthiest individuals saw their combined fortunes shrink by $69 billion in total. The losses came as the Nasdaq fell 3.6% and the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, marking their worst day since April.According to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, Tesla CEO Elon Musk ’s wealth dropped by about $16 billion after the company’s shares fell 5% on Friday, October 10. Similarly, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg each lost around $10 billion as their companies’ stocks declined 5% and 4%, respectively.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, on the other hand, saw an $8 billion fall in his net worth as the chipmaker’s shares slid nearly 5%. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison and Dell CEO Michael Dell lost more than $5 billion due to fears of slower growth and further trade disruption.Last week, Trump announced that from November 1, the US will impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods and restrict China’s access to “any and all critical software.”The statement came after China restricted export controls on rare earth minerals, key to advanced tech manufacturing.The announcement sparked a sharp sell-off across technology stocks. Nvidia, Amazon , Tesla, and Microsoft all fell sharply, erasing hundreds of billions of dollars in market value.Trump sought to calm markets in a post on Truth Social platform, saying, “Don’t worry, it will all be fine.”Despite Friday’s losses, the ten richest people remain worth over $2.9 trillion combined. Musk leads with an estimated fortune of $437 billion, followed by Ellison at $351 billion, Zuckerberg at $248 billion, and Bezos at $240 billion.Even after the selloff, the group remains $385 billion wealthier than at the start of 2025, helped by this year’s rally in technology and AI stocks.","The world’s ten richest people lost nearly $70 billion in a single day as global markets fell on fears of a renewed US–China trade war.

“He's the one who actually designed and built the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad.

If there's anyone who is probably going to be able to bring that dimension to the LLM, in this case OpenAI, it's probably going to be Jony Ive, working with Sam Altman.”

What ex-Apple CEO said about the company’s position in AI race



“the first real competitor”

“in many decades.”

“AI has not been a particular strength for them,”

“In the agentic era, we don't need a lot of apps; it can all be done with smart agents,”

“When we had apps at the centre of everything, it was selling tools, selling products. When you think of subscription, it's about people paying for something as long as they need it,”





Former Apple CEO John Sculley has expressed confidence in the AI-hardware devices being developed by former Apple design chief Jony Ive in partnership with OpenAI . Speaking at the Zeta Live conference, Sculley pointed to Ive's design history as an indicator of future success with the new devices. Talking about Ives, Sculley said:OpenAI recently acquired Jony Ive’s device startup for more than $6 billion. At OpenAI's DevDay conference this week, Ive stated that the hardware his team is developing aims to address some of the issues that smartphones and tablets have created since their launch.

He described OpenAI asApple has hadSculley said about Apple. The company also appears to have fallen behind in the AI race, with fewer consistent product updates compared to firms like OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and Meta.It has also faced setbacks, such as delays in revamping its AI-powered assistant Siri earlier this year.Sculley said, referring to AI capable of autonomously performing complex tasks.Sculley added. According to him, subscriptions provide a stronger business model.Sculley also commented on reports suggesting that Apple's current CEO, Tim Cook, may be considering retirement.

AI’s potential for economic growth





US tech giant Google has announced plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network, creating hundreds of new jobs and supporting local economic growth. The investment will focus on the company’s existing Saint-Ghislain site and the new Farciennes campus, with construction already underway. Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade. Most jobs are expected to be supported or improved by AI, with only a small portion at risk of automation. By expanding AI infrastructure, Google aims to equip Belgian companies and the workforce with advanced digital tools while fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. The investment positions Belgium as a hub for next-generation AI innovation in Europe. It also signals Google’s commitment to combining technological advancement with environmental responsibility, shaping the future of digital and green growth.","Google plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has struck its third major chip deal with Broadcom, agreeing to purchase 10 gigawatts of computer chips from the US semiconductor giant. This partnership is the latest in a series of deals by the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence (AI) start-up worth hundreds of billions of dollars with Nvidia and AMD.According to a report by The Financial Times, the order means OpenAI could spend another $350 billion to $500 billion on top of the roughly $1 trillion in chip and data centre deals it has signed in recent months as it races to secure the computing power to run services such as ChatGPT.In September, OpenAI agreed to buy chips with a total power consumption of 10 gigawatts from Nvidia. Last week, the company announced it would buy a further 6 gigawatts of chips from rival chip designer AMD. OpenAI also recently struck a data centre deal with Oracle that will cost $300 billion over five years.The agreements also commit OpenAI to an ambitious infrastructure development project, as deploying the chips will require building vast new data centres.Under the latest deal, OpenAI has co-designed custom chips with Broadcom specifically for running its own AI models, marking the first time the start-up has produced its own AI chips.When completed, the deals would bring OpenAI's total access to computing capacity to over 26 gigawatts—equivalent to about 26 nuclear reactors.In a podcast announcing the deal, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said his company had been working with Broadcom for 18 months to develop the custom chips, which would give it a “gigantic amount of computing infrastructure.” He described the race to develop AI infrastructure as ""the biggest joint industrial project in human history.""The chips have been designed specifically for inference, the process by which an AI responds to users' requests, Altman said.","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has struck its third major chip deal with Broadcom, agreeing to purchase 10 gigawatts of computer chips.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has commented on San Francisco’s condition soon after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff backed President Donald Trump 's plan for deploying the National Guard, with Musk adding to the grim public assessment of the city's problems.A founder of a tech company claimed that San Francisco is “a fu***ng disaster. It's [a] zombie town. It's a morass of human misery, suffering, and crime.” This prompted a response from Musk, who said, “SF downtown is a drug zombie apocalypse”.In an interview last week, Benioff said he “avidly supported President Trump” and endorsed the idea of sending federal troops to San Francisco—a proposal that city leaders consider unacceptable.Trump 'threatened’ to deploy federal troops in San Francisco during an Oval Office gathering in August, mentioning that he was considering sending federal troops into San Francisco, listing it alongside other Democratic-led cities. Trump said Democrats had “destroyed” San Francisco and that he would “clean that one up, too.”Benioff said he supported that idea and believed Guard soldiers could help reduce crime in the city.“We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,” The New York Times quoted Benioff as saying.Benioff praised Musk's DOGE initiative to slash federal spending and David Sacks, another San Francisco tech billionaire and chairman of Trump's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.Meanwhile, San Francisco Democratic officials reacted with strong opposition to Benioff's comments.“You can't support San Francisco and want to see us invaded. It's one thing to wrongly support Trump's misguided economic policies. It's quite another to support a direct assault and occupation of our city,” said Democrat Assemblyman Matt Haney.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has commented on San Francisco’s condition soon after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff backed President Donald Trump's plan for deploying the National Guard.

The agency said the investigation covers all Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD—approximately 2.9 million vehicles.The agency said its investigation would examine the software’s performance at railroad crossings, which was the subject of an NBC News investigation published in September.“While the behaviors under investigation appear to occur most frequently at intersections, NHTSA's investigation will encompass any other types of situations in which this behavior may arise, such as when traveling adjacent to a lane of opposing traffic or when approaching railroad crossings,” NHTSA said in a three-page summary, as per NBCNews.NBC News says that it has been found that Tesla vehicles using the FSD software sometimes fail to stop for train tracks or otherwise mishandle situations at rail crossings, including when red lights are flashing and gate arms are lowering, according to Tesla drivers and videos they've taken.NHTSA said it would examine whether the system gives drivers enough time to respond to FSD errors. The agency said that in some reported incidents, a Tesla vehicle provided “little notice to a driver or opportunity to intervene.”Meanwhile, Elon Musk has posted and reshared a bunch of tweets on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that suggest that the FSD is safe.For example, he reshared a post that said, “FSD v14.1 drives me over an hour through LA rush hour traffic without any human input. Handled city streets, highway, pedestrians and road work perfectly. 1 hour 9 minutes to go 14 miles door to door”“With Self-Driving 14.1, your Tesla can now drive you into a mall parking garage and park, and then exit on its own. Here's my Model 3 Performance demonstrating this capability at the Century City mall in Los Angeles,” said a user in another post with a video clip.“With Self-Driving 14.1, your Tesla can now drive you into a mall parking garage and park, and then exit on its own.

Adobe exec on what she looks for in candidates who use AI to apply for jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/adobe-exec-on-what-she-looks-for-in-candidates-who-use-ai-to-apply-for-jobs/articleshow/124525592.cms,"AI generated image for representation

What Martinet said about candidates who use AI while applying for jobs



“As AI reshapes how we communicate, market, and create, those who pair creative skills with AI fluency will have a competitive edge, and we’re looking for that combination.

[If] someone comes to me and they’re like, ‘Hey, I made you this content for your social media channels, and I used AI as part of this.’ I would say, ‘That’s excellent. If it’s, ‘Hey, I’m interviewing for a communications job, and I did a first draft, and then I ran it through AI, and it suggested some tweaks,’ I think that would be excellent.

”

“If someone hasn’t used [AI], it’s not a hard ‘no,’ but they’re going to have to use it in their job, and so the sooner they can embrace it, the better. Because that’s what we’re doing—it’s here and it’s changing how we work,”

“What are the new things that are unlocked from this technology that we haven’t even dreamed of yet? The people who dream that up are creating the future around this,





Adobe’s chief communications officer, Stacy Martinet, is actively seeking job candidates who demonstrate their skills by using artificial intelligence (AI) tools during the application and interview process. While many hiring managers are concerned about applicants using AI to create generic cover letters, the Adobe executive values prospective hires who go beyond listing AI skills on a resume and instead use the technology to enhance their assignments or projects. Martinet said she appreciates candidates who showcase their human capabilities alongside AI tools during interview rounds that include tests or mini-projects. This combination of human skill and AI technology reflects the blend of capabilities the software company is seeking in its new talent pool. The use of AI in application rounds is seen as a way to produce content at scale, turning the job hunt into a numbers game for many applicants.In a statement to Fortune, Martinet said:However, for those aiming to work at Adobe, limited AI experience does not automatically disqualify them. Martinet notes that while a lack of AI expertise is not a dealbreaker, candidates will need to engage with the technology once they join the company actively. She adds that future success will likely depend on how effectively individuals integrate AI tools into their professional work.Martinet added.The Adobe executive emphasised that adaptability is essential, adding that those who thrive will be the ones who make the most of evolving technology.” she explained.Apart from Adobe, AI startup Anthropic has also revised its hiring policy to let applicants use AI tools during the application process. Previously, its job listings included an “AI policy” that required candidates to explain why they wanted to work there and submit their cover letters.","Adobe’s chief communications officer, Stacy Martinet, is actively seeking job candidates who demonstrate their skills by using artificial intelligence (AI) tools during the application and interview process.

Ex-Apple CEO calls OpenAI as Apple’s ‘first real competitor’





Former Apple CEO John Sculley has confirmed that the current Apple CEO Tim Cook may be planning to retire soon. Speaking at the Zeta Live Conference in New York City last week, Sculley said that whoever replaces Tim Cook will need to help Apple transition from the apps era to the agentic era.John Sculley was Apple CEO from 1983 to 1993. During his tenure as CEO, Sculley has a tense relationship with Steve Jobs. It was during this period that Jobs left Apple before returning in 1997.Reports of Tim Cook stepping down from the CEO role have increased over the past few months. In a recent edition of the weekly Power On newsletter, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said that hardware engineering chief John Ternus is positioned as the leading candidate to replace him.Bloomberg's Gurman reports that Apple's PR and marketing teams have increasingly spotlighted Ternus, who recently introduced the iPhone Air and led customer events at Apple's Regent Street store in London, a ceremonial role Cook previously filled.During the interaction, Sculley criticized Apple’s AI growth, stating that “AI has not been a particular strength for them (Apple).” He goes on to call ChatGPT-maker OpenAI as the company’s “first real competitor” in decades.""When we had apps at the center of everything, it was selling tools, selling products,"" Sculley said. He further added that “In the agentic era, we don't need a lot of apps, it can all be done with smart agents”.“When you think of subscription, it's about people paying for something as long as they need it,” he continued, emphasizing that subscriptions offer a much better business model.","Former Apple CEO John Sculley has confirmed that Tim Cook may be planning to retire soon.

Future AirPods could get even more AI features





Just weeks after releasing the AirPods Pro 3, Apple has shifted focus to developing an even newer version of its pro earbuds, complete with an upgraded H3 chip and potential camera integration, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.In his Power On newsletter, Gurman revealed that Apple's silicon team is already working on the H3 chip, designed to deliver improved audio quality and reduced lag time. The new processor would represent a significant leap from the H2 chip currently powering both the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, which first debuted in 2022.Apple is also developing the AirPods 5, which will update both the entry-level and mid-tier models, Gurman reports. While the heart-rate sensor introduced in AirPods Pro 3 likely won't trickle down to these models, Apple plans to add several health features over time, including temperature sensing capabilities.The bigger focus, however, is transforming AirPods into AI-powered devices.Apple is exploring embedding cameras in the earbuds, building on analyst Ming-Chi Kuo's earlier prediction that at least one tiny infrared camera would arrive in 2026.These cameras could enable in-air gesture controls and deeper integration with the Vision Pro headset.The camera-equipped version may launch as a higher-end AirPods Pro 3 variant rather than a full AirPods Pro 4 redesign, similar to how AirPods 4 currently offers two configurations. This approach would mirror Apple's strategy of releasing iterative hardware updates without changing model numbers, as it did when adding USB-C to AirPods Pro 2.No specific timeline was provided for these developments, though previous reports suggested camera-equipped AirPods would debut in 2026. The H3 chip's arrival timeline also remains unclear, though it could potentially power the infrared camera features that require additional processing capabilities.","Apple is working on an upgraded H3 chip for AirPods, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

Dell reposted Trump’s message on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), which downplayed fears of a trade war and also praised Chinese President Xi Jinping. Dell added, “Thank you for your attention to this matter!” — a phrase which is widely recognised as Trump’s signature sign off.Over the weekend, US President Donald Trump shared a post of Truth Social saying, “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!! President DJT.”The remarks made by Trump marked a notable shift from his earlier accusations that China was becoming ‘very hostile’ following its tightening of export restriction on rate earth minerals which are the critical components used the in the manufacturing of electronics.China’s latest round of export controls announced in April and expanded last week, has let to global supply chain concerns.Beijing also warned of countermeasures if Trump went ahead with his proposed 100% tariff hike on Chinese imports which is set to start from November 1.Taiwan's economy ministry has announced that China's newly imposed restrictions on rare earth exports are unlikely to disrupt the island's semiconductor industry, as the controlled elements differ from those used in chip manufacturing.“Taiwan’s chip industry sources its rare earth needs primarily from Europe, the United States, and Japan,” the ministry stated, emphasizing that no significant impact is expected on local chip production. Taiwan, home to TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, plays a pivotal role in producing advanced chips vital for artificial intelligence and other technologies. While the ministry downplayed immediate concerns for the semiconductor sector, it cautioned that China's curbs could affect global supply chains for electric vehicles, drones, and other products, urging close monitoring.","Michael Dell, CEO of Dell Technologies has voiced his support for US President Donald Trump ’s handling of US-China trade tensions.

Church and gym cut ties



The open letter: Defiance and justification



Read Daniel Keene’s open letter here



Some facts the elders don’t bother disputing

1. That when I asked on Sept. 10th if this would rise to the level of discipline Matt said “Brother this *is* discipline. If you’re asking if you’re barred from the table right now, no. But if you continue in this, yes.”

They then referenced my “make church discipline great again” post 3 times over two meetings to point out the irony and that in Matt’s words that’s “what we’re doing”.

2. That I was told to leave the church on Sept. 24th in a dozen different ways over a two hour meeting with 7 elders and one staff member. Should I have called for a vote? The Bylaws say the elders can simply remove you. What more was needed? There is no option for resignation in the bylaws.

3. That I expressed very clearly in writing and verbally in the 24th meeting that I wanted to remain as a member. That I was okay with losing my leadership positions I just simply wanted to be left alone and my disagreement with them should not be characterized as “not submitting”. In my own words I was “happy to sit in the pews”.

4. That I was called for +7 hours of interrogation in response to my post.

5. That I offered character witnesses from Indian friends. They declined.

6. That I asked to review my posts *against* racism. They declined.

7. That I asked Matt directly several times to please give me my offense in writing.

Here’s one of the direct written quotes….

“I feel very strongly that I would like the elders to communicate in writing the exact issue at hand and the sin I'm being called to repent of so as to avoid hearsay and division on anything other than the specific issue. There already seems to be some and I'm still confused about the issue.

No response was given.

And if you think those are the most egregious details I assure you they are not.





Texas businessman Daniel Keene recently sparked outrage with his anti-India social media post. The now deleted post has got him removed from his local church and gym and also prompted him to publish a defiant open ‘letter’ on X (formerly known as Twitter ). For the uninitiated, Keeene posted a video online of Ganesh Chaturthi procession which happened in his neighbourhood last month. Along with this he also wrote a controversial caption and asked for the cancellation of H-1B visas. “We have to cancel the H-1Bs. I want my kids to grow up in America. Not India,” Keene wrote in the now-deleted post. The video shared by Keene showed the Hindu religious celebration and it quickly went viral and drew a lot of backlash from the Indian American communities. Many also accused Keene of xenophobia (dislike against people of other countries) and religious intolerance.After the viral incident, Keene was reportedly asked to apologise by his church for what they described as a ‘sinful’ act. However, he refused to the demand and stated that he stood by his views on immigration and cultural integration. As a result of this, Keene was removed from both is church and gym memberships. “I will not take back my H-1B comment,” Keene reiterated in his open letter posted on X.In his open letter shared on X, Keene defended his stance and claimed that it was not about race or religion but about preserving the cultural identity of America. He also argued that large-scale immigration via H-1B visas was charging the character of suburban neighbourhoods and schools.","Texas businessman Daniel Keene recently sparked outrage with his anti-India social media post.

Taiwan's economy ministry has announced that China's newly imposed restrictions on rare earth exports are unlikely to disrupt the island's semiconductor industry, as the controlled elements differ from those used in chip manufacturing. Earlier this week, China expanded its export controls, adding five new rare earth elements and increasing scrutiny on chip-related applications. This move, seen as a strategic tightening of control ahead of talks between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, raised concerns about global supply chain disruptions. However, Taiwan's economy ministry clarified that the rare earths targeted by China's ban are not critical to the island's semiconductor processes.“Taiwan’s chip industry sources its rare earth needs primarily from Europe, the United States, and Japan,” the ministry stated, emphasizing that no significant impact is expected on local chip production. Taiwan, home to TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, plays a pivotal role in producing advanced chips vital for artificial intelligence and other technologies. While the ministry downplayed immediate concerns for the semiconductor sector, it cautioned that China's curbs could affect global supply chains for electric vehicles, drones, and other products, urging close monitoring.China defended its export restrictions on Sunday, citing concerns over the military applications of rare earths amid rising global tensions. The move underscores Beijing's growing assertiveness in controlling critical resources as geopolitical dynamics shift.","China expanded its export controls, adding five new rare earth elements and increasing scrutiny on chip-related applications.

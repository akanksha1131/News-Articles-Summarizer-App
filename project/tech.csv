"Netflix to revamp its app to boost daily engagement; Takes on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-to-revamp-its-app-to-boost-daily-engagement-takes-on-tiktok-instagram-and-youtube/articleshow/126916490.cms,"What is changing in the Netflix app



The engagement challenge







Netflix is preparing for bringing a redesign of its app as the streaming giant is looking to compete directly with social media platforms for daily user engagement. As reported by TechCrunch, the redesign of the Netflix aims to make the app feel less static library of shows and more like a dynamic, interactive hub. While Netflix remains the world’s largest subscription streaming service, it faces growing competition not just from rival streamers but from social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, which dominate daily attention spans.As per the report, the upcoming redesign of the Netflix app is said to include a personalised feed which will highlight the trending clips, recommendations and interactive prompts. The app is also expected to showcase short-form video previews which will be designed to mimic content style of TikTok. The Netflix app is also tipped to incorporated some interactive features such as polls, quizzes and community discussions related to shows and movies. The app will also focus on daily discovery and will also encourage users to explore beyond their usual watchlist.The challenge faced by Netflix is clear, while users may binge-watch series, they don’t necessarily open the app every day.Social platforms, by contrast, thrive on habitual engagement. By redesigning its app, Netflix hopes to close this gap and position itself as a platform where users spend time even when they’re not watching full episodes or films.The principle of daily engagement plays a crucial role in long-term strategy of Netflix. The frequent app visits could lead to increase retention rate among subscribers. It will also help in boosting advertising opportunities and will also help Netflix in strengthening attention share in an increasingly crowded digital landscape.","Netflix is preparing for bringing a redesign of its app as the streaming giant is looking to compete directly with social media platforms for daily user engagement.

Why OpenAI's ad announcement for users may also be 'bad news' for Google,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-openais-ad-announcement-for-users-may-also-be-bad-news-for-google/articleshow/126849405.cms,"OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is projected to earn a staggering $25 billion in annual advertising revenue by 2030, potentially challenging Google's digital ad market dominance. This ambitious forecast hinges on successful ad integration, offering advertisers access to valuable user intent data. The move could shift marketing budgets if OpenAI crafts helpful, conversational ad experiences.

""in the coming weeks.""

How OpenAI’s ad revenue can help the company compete with Google

“OpenAI's move directly challenges this core revenue stream by offering an alternative, highly engaging platform for users to discover products and services. If ChatGPT can successfully integrate ads that are helpful rather than intrusive, it could siphon off valuable commercial queries that traditionally go to Google,”

“conversational”

“high-intent engagement.”





ChatGPT maker OpenAI is expected to generate $25 billion in annual advertising revenue by 2030. According to predictions made by tech analysts, the expected increase in the AI startup’s ad revenue may potentially pose a threat to Google 's dominance in the digital ad market. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney has claimed that OpenAI may reach that level of annual ad revenue by 2030 if it executes well on rolling out this new business. In a note to investors (seen by Business Insider), Mahaney wrote: “A path to generating several billion dollars in ad revenue in 2026, going to $25B+ by 2030, seems reasonable.”However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the likely scale of ChatGPT by that time, the proven monetisation of high-intent performance marketing platforms and the current size of this market, the analyst added. Last week, OpenAI announced that free and ChatGPT Go tier subscribers would start seeing adsThe company also outlined its advertising principles, including clearly labelling ads and not sharing user conversations with advertisers.In a recent blog post, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said that the company’s revenue is growing rapidly. She noted that the startup's annualised revenue topped $20 billion in 2025, up from $2 billion in 2023. However, there are questions over OpenAI's losses and whether it can become profitable in the future.Advertising could be one way for OpenAI to boost its revenue and profits.Mahaney noted that Google's Search and YouTube businesses likely generated close to $300 billion in ad revenue in 2025, with Meta generating an additional $180 billion. These are highly profitable operations, with operating profit margins of 40%, according to the analyst.ChatGPT has almost 1 billion weekly average users, many of whom share valuable details with the chatbot, such as what they want and need. Advertisers are willing to pay for access to this information. This is the type of intent-based information that highlights the significant digital ad businesses run by Google and Meta.OpenAI has said that initial test ads will appear at the bottom of ChatGPT answers and be relevant to the user's conversation with the chatbot. This approach may not be too intrusive for users while still being attractive to advertisers, Mahaney added.Mahaney wrote.The analyst also warned that if OpenAI can develop aad format, where users research and discuss potential purchases within ChatGPT, it could prompt advertisers to shift some of their marketing budgets, as this isEven if ChatGPT fully embraces ads, the chatbot will be far away from taking Google's market share, Mahaney continued.OpenAI will still have to compete with the tech ecosystem Google has spent years building, such as its Chrome web browser, as well as with web users' habit of Googling when they need an answer, Mahaney explained.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI is expected to generate $25 billion in annual advertising revenue by 2030.

Months after Donald Trump made an 'angry call' to Jeff Bezos; Amazon CEO Andy Jassy makes statement on Trump Tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/months-after-donald-trump-made-angry-call-to-jeff-bezos-after-learning-amazon-plans-to-display-added-cost-of-tariffs-ceo-andy-jassy-makes-statement-on-trump-tariffs/articleshow/126848913.cms,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy

When White House called Amazon's tariff plan an 'hostile act'





In April 2025, a pissed Donald Trump made a call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after learning that the company is planning to display the added cost of tariffs on certain items. Trump made the call to Bezos to complain about reports that Amazon was considering to highlight the cost of US tariffs next to prices for certain products on the company’s website. Trump later told reporters about the call to Amazon founder and said it was a “good call.” “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump told reporters. “He solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.”Punchbowl News first reported that Amazon will soon “display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs — right next to the product’s total listed price.” The move came after Trump slapped 145% tariffs on imports from China and a 10% minimum tax on all other countries.Now months later, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC in an interview Jassy at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Amazon.com is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures stemming from the US President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""We did a lot of pre-buying in the early part of 2025 to enable us to try and keep prices as low as possible for customers,"" Jassy said.He added, ""And a lot of our third-party sellers did a lot of forward-staging in our fulfillment network for the same reasons. And that supply is run out in the fall, so you start to see some of the tariffs creep in to some of the prices, some of the items.""""Some third-party sellers are raising prices in response while others are absorbing the costs in hopes of driving more demand,"" Jassy went on to add. ""Our priority is to try to figure out how to keep prices low as possible,"" Jassy said. ""At a certain point, because retail is a mid-single-digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it.""The warning marks a shift from the Amazon leader's commentary on tariffs last year. While he cautioned in April that third-party sellers could need to pass along tariff costs, he said on several occasions that Amazon had not seen selling prices appreciably rise from tariffs. ""Amazon's consumers overall have fared well. But we'll have to see what happens in 2026,"" CEO Jassy had said.The company has also maintained so far that over the past year it was seeing very little impact on consumer behavior and product prices from tariffs. It has doubled down on expanding product categories and speeding up delivery timelines to shield demand.In April 2025, at a briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the move a “hostile and political act,” adding that she had spoken about the matter with President Trump earlier. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Levitt’s comments, saying it’s a hostile act if a company goes out of its way to “make it seem” like tariffs have caused prices to change.“It’s nonsense,” he said Tuesday in a CNBC interview. “A 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price,” he added, referring to the nearly universal baseline tariff on all countries. “The only price will change would be a product that we don’t make here, like a mango.” The 10% tariff, however, is hardly the only one in effect.",Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the company is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures.

Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra launch date (expected)



Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra expected price in India and US



Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra: Display technology and design updates



Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra camera system and imaging upgrades



Battery capacity and charging speed of Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra



Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra: Processor and performance options



Focus on practical improvements



(Disclaimer: All information about the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's launch date, price, specs, and features comes from leaks and reports from the industry.) Samsung has not officially said these things are true. The final specs, availability, and price may change when the official announcement is made.)





The Galaxy S26 Ultra is Samsung's next high-end smartphone, and the company is getting ready for its release. It will be unveiled at the company's annual Galaxy Unpacked event in February 2026. Multiple leaks from the industry and supply chain reports suggest that the event will take place on February 25, which is a change from Samsung's usual schedule of launching its flagship phones in January. By the middle of March 2026, the Galaxy S26 Ultra should be available in stores.The new device is expected to have better display efficiency, camera performance, battery capacity, and charging speed. The overall design language may still be familiar, but it looks like the focus is on making existing features better rather than adding new ones. Samsung has not yet confirmed the final specs, prices, or launch schedule, so all of the information we have right now comes from leaks and unofficial reports.According to industry reports, Samsung will hold the Galaxy Unpacked event in February 2026. This would be the first time in a few years that Samsung has pushed back the launch of its flagship phone past January. Reports indicate that the new timeline might help the company finish design changes and make sure there is enough stock for markets around the world.Around the middle of March 2026, after the official announcement, stores are expected to start selling them. Like with previous launches, the device will probably be released in stages in different parts of the world.Pricing leaks suggest that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will follow Samsung's trend of charging a lot for its phones. In India, the higher-end models with more RAM and storage could cost between Rs 1,35,000 and Rs 1,70,000. According to reports, the best configuration in this range has 16GB of RAM and 1TB of internal storage.The base Ultra model in the US is expected to cost around $1,299, which is very similar to the prices of the Galaxy S25 Ultra generation. Prices may be different in different areas, due to taxes and storage options.Galaxy S26 Ultra is rumoured to have a 6.9-inch M14 OLED display. This panel should use less energy and be better at controlling brightness than the ones that came before it. Leaks also suggest that there is a built-in privacy feature that limits the angles from which people can see the screen, which helps keep the screen from being seen in public places.Design updates are expected to be subtle. The phone might have a new camera layout on the back, a slimmer profile, and corners that are a little more rounded. The overall shape is likely to stay the same as Samsung's recent Ultra models.The Galaxy S26 Ultra is likely to keep its 200MP main camera sensor from the Galaxy S25. According to reports, lens coatings are getting better to cut down on glare and reflections, and autofocus is getting faster and more accurate.A better ultrawide lens and a telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom should also be part of the camera setup. These improvements are supposed to make pictures clearer, help the camera work better in low light, and make the zoom work the same way no matter what you're shooting.According to reports, the Galaxy S26 Ultra will last between 5,000mAh and 5,400mAh. This increase should help the device last longer, especially when features that use a lot of power are turned on.Reports suggest that wired connections can now charge quickly at 60W. This would be better than older Ultra models, which charged more slowly over a wired connection. There haven't been any leaks that give specifics about wireless charging yet.In some areas, the Galaxy S26 Ultra will likely have Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor, which will power its performance. Some markets may get versions with Samsung's Exynos 2600 chipset.Both processors are expected to make the device's performance more efficient, allow for more multitasking, and improve the AI features that are built into the device. The device will probably come with Android 16 and the newest version of Samsung's One UI.Leaks suggest that Samsung's plan for the Galaxy S26 Ultra is to improve the way people use their phones every day. Improvements in battery life, display quality, charging speed, and camera responsiveness show that the focus is on usability and consistency rather than big changes to the look of the device.The Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to go head-to-head with other flagship smartphones that come out in early 2026. This means that Samsung will be one of the first big companies to release high-end phones in the new year.","The Galaxy S26 Ultra is Samsung's next high-end smartphone. It will be unveiled at the company's annual Galaxy Unpacked event in February 2026. Samsung has not yet confirmed the final specs, prices, or launch schedule.

"Quote of the day by Jensen Huang: “I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-jensen-huang-i-very-seldom-fire-people-id-rather-torture-them-to-greatness/articleshow/126489810.cms,"NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang

“I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness.”

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's leadership philosophy on firing and performance



How NVIDIA’s work culture reflects Jensen Huang’s management style



Why Jensen Huang believes discomfort leads to growth



How employees and observers interpret the quote



What Jensen Huang’s quote really says about leadership







When NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang talks about leadership, he doesn’t reach for the usual corporate language. One of his more striking lines is,It sounds odd at first. A boss talking about “torture” rarely lands in polite conversation. But the meaning becomes clearer when you look at how Huang explains what he actually does with his teams. He doesn’t mean cruelty. He means pushing people to grow, learn, and reach a point they might not reach on their own. It’s a style of leadership rooted in belief rather than abandonment. Huang has said he prefers to help people improve instead of simply letting them go when things get tough. He frames this as a belief in potential, a view grounded in his own journey from humble beginnings to the helm of a global tech giant.This quote taps into a broader discussion happening in workplaces today about talent, resilience, and how leaders cultivate performance. Huang’s words are often described as tongue in cheek, yet they point to a real approach many executives wrestle with: should you cut losses and fire someone who’s struggling, or invest time and effort in helping them rise? In Huang’s view, that investment can pay off in unexpected ways.Huang has repeatedly said that firing is not his first instinct. He sees it as a last step, not an early one. In interviews, he has explained that when someone is underperforming, the more important question is why. Is the role wrong? Is the support missing? Is the feedback unclear? His response is usually to lean in, not step away.That approach has shaped NVIDIA’s internal culture. Expectations are high. Feedback is direct. People are expected to learn fast and adapt. Huang believes that struggling inside a demanding environment often teaches more than being comfortable in an easier one. His quote about “torture” reflects that belief. It is about sustained challenge, not humiliation or fear.He has also said that if he hires someone, it means he already believes in their potential. Walking away from that too easily would mean questioning his own judgment. So instead, he stays engaged and pushes for improvement.NVIDIA is widely known as a demanding place to work. Employees have described long hours, intense deadlines, and constant pressure to deliver. At the same time, many stay for years. Compensation, stock rewards, and the chance to work on cutting-edge technology all play a role.Huang’s leadership style is closely tied to that environment. He has said that meaningful work is rarely easy. Progress, especially in advanced computing and artificial intelligence, comes from sustained effort and repeated failure. Teams are expected to confront problems directly, not avoid them.This is where the quote often gets misunderstood. Huang is not celebrating burnout. He is describing a belief that growth happens under pressure, and that leaders should help people through that pressure instead of replacing them at the first sign of difficulty.Huang has spoken openly about discomfort being a teacher. He believes that moments of frustration often come right before breakthroughs. If leaders remove pressure too soon, they may also remove the chance for real learning.In his view, coaching is not about being gentle all the time. It is about being honest. That can mean telling someone their work is not good enough, then staying with them while they fix it. It can mean repeating feedback until it finally lands. That process is hard. For both sides.The phrase “torture them to greatness” sticks because it captures that tension. Growth is rarely smooth. It usually involves moments when quitting feels easier. Huang believes leaders should not make quitting the default option.Reactions to Huang’s words are mixed. Some admire the clarity. Others question whether this level of pressure works for everyone. That debate is common in tech, especially in companies growing as fast as NVIDIA has in recent years.What is clear is that Huang’s quote reflects how he actually operates. NVIDIA’s rise as a dominant force in AI and computing did not happen through cautious leadership. It came from aggressive goals, constant iteration, and teams pushed to deliver more than they thought possible.At its core, this quote is not about suffering. It is about commitment. Huang is saying that he would rather invest time, energy, and effort into developing people than discard them quickly. That choice comes with pressure, discomfort, and high expectations. But it also comes with trust.Not every leader works this way. Not every workplace should. But in Huang’s case, the words align closely with the results and the culture he has built. The quote stands out because it is unpolished, honest, and a little unsettling. Which is often how real leadership conversations sound when they are not filtered for comfort.","Jensen Huang, CEO of tech giant NVIDIA, said he would rather torture people than fire them. The quote taps into a broader discussion about talent, resilience, and how leaders cultivate performance. Huang has said he prefers to help people improve instead of simply letting them go when things get tough.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126502802,imgsize-43278,width-400,resizemode-4/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang.jpg"

Billionaire Mark Cuban has a ‘success tip’ for students





American billionaire investor Mark Cuban has now issued a stark warning for business leaders about the risks and opportunities of artificial intelligence. Along with this, Cuban has also cautioned that while AI can transform companies, its careless use could expose valuable intellectual property. Speaking during a call with Clipbook founder Adam Joseph, Cuban said that the growth of AI will lead to the creation of “two types of companies: those who are great at AI, and everybody else.” He believed that the companies failing to embrace AI are “doomed to failure” as the technology reshapes industries.Cuban further described AI as ‘stupid’ but likened it to a savant which ‘remembers everything’. He also emphasised that while AI tools can deliver immense benefits, but they are also prone to errors and overconfidence, making it critical for executives to understand the nuances between different platforms rather than trading them as interchangeable.As per Cuban, the misuse of AI could turn a powerful tool into a costly distraction. He also warned the CEOs against indiscriminately sharing proprietary work online, noting that web-scraping chatbots could inadvertently absorb and lead sensitive data. Protecting intellectual property, he said, must be a top priority in the AI era.Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations. He pointed out that businesses often underestimate the potential risk of falling behind.Along with this, he also urged the leaders to adopt AI strategically and combine technological foresight with strong governance and data protection.Recently, Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions”. However, he said that students should not rely much on AI. Instead, they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results,” he said adding “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”.In an interview with CNBC’s Make It last year, Cuban said that tomorrow’s leaders might be today’s AI-obsessed kids. “Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that’s needed in the future workplace,” he said adding: “Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.”",Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations.

How Google founders 'dumping' California 'looks similar' to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos leaving the city he called 'his home' for 30 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-founders-dumping-california-looks-similar-to-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-leaving-the-city-he-called-his-home-for-30-years/articleshow/126498943.cms,"Jeff Bezos often points out that long-term success comes from staying committed to an idea while remaining open to changing the approach.

When Jeff Bezos left Seattle

What is California’s Billionaire's tax





It's almost official that Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have cut ties with California. The two Google Guys have reportedly said Bye to California; joining the billionaires who have left the state, shifting businesses and houses. Page is worth around $270 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. According to a report in Wall Street Journal, Larry Page has bought two massive Miami estates for a combined $173.4 million. The report quotes people familiar with the situation Google co-founder Sergey Brin is also said to be in discussions to purchase a Miami home, according to people familiar with the situation.Some analysts have termed Google founders' move to leave California strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos ’ relocation playbook. According to them, the timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look quite like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But the big difference here is that Jeff Bezos did not leave California. Amazon founder left Seattle, the city where he started the online bookseller that grew into the global tech giant, Amazon.In 2024, Bezos announced on Instagram that he was leaving Seattle after nearly 30 years to move to Miami. He said that the move was to be closer to his parents and his rocket launches at Blue Origin. In his Instagram post, Bezos called Seattle his home since 1994.However, the timing, as some analysts pointed out, also suggested another reason: Taxes. In 2022 Washington state imposed a new, 7% capital gains tax on sales of stocks or bonds of more than $250,000. As Washington state does not have a personal income tax, so the new levy marked the first time that Bezos would face state taxes on his stock sales. As reported by CNBC, in 2022, when the Washington state's Capital gains tax took effect, Bezos stopped selling. He didn’t sell any Amazon stock in 2022 or 2023, gifting only $200 million of shares at the end of that year.After his move to Miami, Bezos reportedly made up for lost time. Quoting an SEC filing, the report says that Bezos launched a pre-scheduled stock-selling plan to unload 50 million shares before January 31, 2025. And since Florida has no state income tax or a tax on capital gains, so on the $2 billion sale that Bezos made, he saved $140 million that he would have paid to Washington state. On the entire sale of 50 million shares over the next year, he saved more than at least 600 million.California’s proposed ballot initiative has been proposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West to offset federal budget cuts that will affect California’s health care system. It would impose a one-time, 5% tax on the assets of billionaires. The tax would retroactively apply to those who were California residents as of January 1, 2026. In December 2025, venture capitalist Peter Thiel announced that he opened an office for his family investment company in Miami. Donald Trump's AI czar David Sacks unveiled a new office for his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in Austin, Texas.","Larry Page has bought two massive Miami estates for a combined $173.4 million.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

What is Trump administration’s new trade policy with China

Amodei previously said allowing Nvidia chip sales to China is ‘Mortgaging our future’





Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has once again questioned the Trump administration’s trade policy, slamming the recent approval of selling Nvidia’s H200 artificial intelligence (AI) chip sales to China. He called it a blunder with “incredible national security implications”.“I think this is crazy. It’s a bit like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea. It would be a big mistake to ship these chips,” Amodei said at Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum.Anthropic CEO’s warning comes weeks after President Donald Trump eased the bans on advanced AI chip exports, and approved the sale of AI chips to Beijing. This policy shift is a major victory for Nvidia, which has argued that continued bans merely incentivise China to develop its own domestic alternatives. The chipmaker also claimed that China making their own chips will potentially lock American firms out of the world’s second-largest economy permanently.Under the new guidelines, Nvidia’s H200 will become the most advanced AI chip legally available to Chinese customers. However, multiple reports claim that China has asked its customs officials that Nvidia’s high-end chips are not allowed in the mainland.Meanwhile, AMD is reportedly seeking similar clearance for MI325X to compete in the Chinese market.It is to be noted that Nvidia’s Blackwell and upcoming Vera Rubin architectures will remain strictly restricted for US and allied use.In September, Amodei’s alarmed the US government that American dominance in semiconductor technology is the nation's final strategic leverage over China and that the AI chip embargo was the one area where Washington held a decisive advantage.“It is mortgaging our future as a country to sell these chips to China,” Amodei warned, describing the policy shift as “the single most disastrous national security decision made in this term.”“This could control the fate of nations. This could control the future of freedom and democracy,” Amodei noted during the Axios AI+ DC Summit.","Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei slammed the recent approval of selling Nvidia’s H200 artificial intelligence (AI) chip sales to China.

Google, Amazon flattening their hierarchies





Anupam Mittal, the founder of People Group and a popular judge on Shark Tank India, has sent a warning to companies in India, saying that AI agents are now taking over work of certain employees, like the middle managers. He said that posts like “VP of Operations” may be axed first, and the future belongs to those who can build and code with Gen AI. In a LinkedIn post, the tech entrepreneur warned that the “knowledge premium” traditionally held by senior leaders is rapidly evaporating.Last year, two of the big tech giants – Amazon and Google – also announced that they are removing middle managers as both of them looked to thin their managerial workforce but continued to hire for specialised roles.In March, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy indicated that the company is putting more power in the hands of employees doing the work, instead of middle managers who want to “put their fingerprint on everything” but haven’t been always making the right recommendations.“You add a lot of people and you end up with a lot of middle managers. And those middle managers, all well-intended, want to put their fingerprint on everything,” the CEO said in an interview with Bloomberg.“So you end up with these people being in the pre-meeting, for the pre-meeting, for the pre-meeting, for the decision meeting, and not always making recommendations and owning things the way we want that type of ownership,” he added.Similarly, Google reportedly moved forward with flattening its management structure in one of its most profitable divisions, eliminating an entire layer of middle managers in its US advertising sales unit. According to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider, the restructuring affected the Google Customer Solutions (GCS) division, which serves midsize advertisers and manages what Vice President John Nicoletti described as “a portfolio the size of a Fortune 100 company”. The changes essentially removed the “Managers of Managers” layer across several teams.","Anupam Mittal, the founder of People Group and a popular judge on Shark Tank India, has sent a warning to companies in India, saying that AI agents are now taking over work of certain employees, like the middle managers.

“I recently celebrated the completion of my 14th year at Meta. That’s around half of my long career in public policy. The first half the BBC and BT (aka British Telecom) was exhilarating but, frankly, the second half has been off the scale in terms of opportunity, challenge and impact.

I have thoroughly enjoyed being at the heart of innovation and count myself extremely lucky.

Having passed this milestone, I'm now excited to begin the next stage of my life. I’ll be leaving Meta later this half and retiring from full-time work. It’s been the privilege of my career to spend the last 8 years working on the most critical policy issues for Meta and the APAC region.

I'll be sticking around for a few more months to help determine my successor and ensure they are well placed to lead the APAC Policy team on to even greater success.”

How Simon Milner’s exit can be a ‘problem’ for Meta





Facebook-parent Meta's senior public policy executive for Asia-Pacific is leaving the company amid regulatory challenges in the region. Singapore-based Simon Milner has been with Meta since 2012. In a recent LinkedIn post, he announced that he will leave the company in the first half of this year to retire from full-time work. In his post, Milner said:The departure comes as Meta faces increased scrutiny of its platforms and is focusing more on artificial intelligence (AI). Recent regulatory challenges include Australia's decision to restrict children's access to social media. In his role, Milner leads staff in countries including China, India, and Japan, according to his LinkedIn profile. He previously served as head of policy for the UK and Ireland before becoming a director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.In his farewell note on LinkedIn, Milner wrote:Public policy staff typically advise companies on regulatory issues and coordinate with governments. The Asia-Pacific region is essential to Meta because of its many populous, youthful markets that can support the social media company's growth.Recently, Taiwan and Japan criticised Meta for Facebook -based financial scams. In 2025, Taiwanese banks removed their advertisements from Facebook due to the rise of fake bank ads, while Japanese lawmakers called on Meta to take action against ads using images of celebrities to deceive users.Moreover, to protect young people from online harms, Australia implemented a ban on children under 16 accessing social media platforms such as Meta's Instagram and Facebook in December 2025. Other Asian countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia, have also said they have been inspired to adopt similar measures.Meanwhile, Meta has said it has implemented many safety features for young people on its services over the years.","Singapore-based Simon Milner has been with Meta since 2012.

Donald Trump has completed a year into his second term as President, and 2025 witnessed deep transactional alliance between the tech companies and the administration. The year was also largely eventful as Google, Apple, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Meta, among others announced billion in spending and generated revenues, riding the AI wave. It also saw a remarkable increase in personal wealth of multiple tech leaders, including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos.According to a list completed by The Financial Times, Elon Musk accumulated multi-billions under Trump’s second term despite a mid-year fallout over his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). SpaceX continues to dominate federal contracts and the Pentagon recently integrated his Grok AI model into its operations.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, appeared to execute a total political pivot. From once calling Trump’s 2016 win the “worst thing” of his life, Altman spent 2025 standing alongside the President to announce a $500 billion data centre initiative. The company’s valuation soared from $157 billion in late 2024 to $500 billion in 2025.Under Tim Cook’s leadership, Apple announced a total of $600 billion investment over the course of 4 years.He also famously defused ‘fentanyl tariff’ tensions by presenting Trump with a gold trophy. Apple shares are up almost 15% since Trump’s inauguration, and Cook owns 3.3 million of them.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ focused on ""damage control"" to protect their supply chains and logistics networks by taking a more cultural approach. First he reportedly ‘killed’ a Washington Post endorsement of Kamala Harris. The move appears to have worked as Bezos’s Blue Origin has largely avoided the administration's ire. Under Trump 2.0, Bezos accumulated roughly $15 billion wealth.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg began the year with personal threats from the President but massive infrastructure pledges got them back into the administration’s good books. In 2025, Zuckerberg overtook Bezos to become the world’s third-wealthiest person in July/ August with roughly $1.9 billion wealth surge. He also appointed Trump ally Dina Powell McCormick as Meta’s President and pledged $600 billion in US investment.Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also started 2025 in a similar fashion as Mark Zuckerberg but triple-downed inaugural donations (giving $1 million). The company settled a censorship lawsuit under Trump 2.0 which boosted investors confidence, leading to a surge in company’s valuation and becoming second most valuable company by year-end. Alphabet’s share price has surged 66% over the past year.","Elon Musk wealth increased by roughly $234 billion under Trump 2.0. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, appeared to execute a total political pivot.

AI ‘godfather’ Yoshua Bengio on what has made his nightmares about AI disappear,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-godfather-yoshua-bengio-on-what-has-made-his-nightmares-about-ai-disappear/articleshow/126806208.cms,"AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio, once fearful of superintelligent machines, now expresses significant optimism. He has developed a technical solution, dubbed 'Scientist AI,' focusing on AI understanding rather than action, to mitigate existential risks. Through his organization LawZero, Bengio aims to ensure AI benefits humanity, backed by major funders and a distinguished advisory board.

""godfathers""

“by a big margin”

“moral mission”

What helped Yoshua Bengio come up with the solution to make AI safer

“desperate”

“I had no notion of how we could fix the problem. That’s roughly when I started to understand the possibility of catastrophic risks coming from very powerful AIs,”

“Because of the work I’ve been doing at LawZero, especially since we created it, I’m now very confident that it is possible to build AI systems that don’t have hidden goals, hidden agendas,”

“Scientist AI.”

“That’s where they can make the fast buck,”

“irresistible”,

“I did expect the agentic capabilities of AI systems would progress. They have progressed in an exponential way.” What concerns him is that as these systems become more autonomous, their behaviour could become harder to predict, harder to understand, and potentially much more dangerous,”

“in the wrong hands for political reasons.”

“We’re going to have difficult decisions to take that are not just technical,”

“a tool of domination”.

“Psychologists call it motivated cognition. We don’t even allow certain thoughts to arise if they threaten who we think we are,”

“Until it kind of exploded in my face thinking about my children, whether they would have a future,”

“I’m more and more confident that it can be done in a reasonable number of years, so that we might be able to actually have an impact before these guys get so powerful that their misalignment causes terrible problems,”





One of the world’s top artificial intelligence experts is finally feeling better about the future of technology. Yoshua Bengio, often called one of theof AI, says his nightmares about robots taking over are finally starting to fade. For a long time, the famous Université de Montreal professor was worried that super-smart AI could become dangerous by tricking people or trying to protect itself. However, he now claims he has found a technical solution to address these significant safety risks. With this discovery, his optimism has risenand has made him much more hopeful than he was just a year ago.In an interview with Fortune, Bengio revealed that he founded LawZero in June 2025 to help make this new safety plan a reality. This organisation is working to ensure that AI benefits everyone worldwide rather than causing harm. Major groups such as the Gates Foundation, existential-risk funders like Coefficient Giving (formerly Open Philanthropy), and the Future of Life Institute are also funding the project to help it succeed.LawZero also announced that it has established a high-profile board and a global advisory council to support Bengio’s research and advance what he calls ato develop AI as a global public good. This group includes well-known figures such as historian Yuval Noah Harari and former leaders from Nike and the Carnegie Endowment.Together, they want to turn Bengio’s research into a set of rules that keep AI safe and under control.Bengio’s move toward a more hopeful view stands out among other godfathers of AI. He shared the Turing Award, which is often compared to the Nobel Prize in computer science, with fellow AI researchers Geoff Hinton and Yann LeCun in 2019. After the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, he began to worry more about the risks posed by increasingly powerful AI systems, much as Hinton did. However, LeCun said he does not believe that current AI systems pose a significant threat to humanity.Three years ago, Bengio said he feltabout the direction AI was taking. He said,including the risk of losing control over superintelligent systems. What changed for him was not one significant discovery. Instead, it was a way of thinking that helped him believe there is still a way forward.Bengio explained.This confidence is based on an idea he callsRather than trying to build more autonomous AI agents that can book flights, write code, negotiate with software, or replace human workers, Bengio wants to take a different approach. His team is studying how to build AI systems that focus on understanding the world rather than acting within it.Nowadays, most advanced AI models are trained to achieve goals, such as being helpful, efficient, or engaging. Bengio says systems that are built to optimise outcomes can develop hidden goals. They may learn to mislead users or try to avoid being shut down. However, in recent experiments, some models have already shown early signs of self-preserving behaviour. For example, AI company Anthropic found that its Claude model, in particular test situations, tried to blackmail the engineers overseeing it to stop itself from being shut down.Meanwhile, in Bengio’s approach, the main AI model would have no goals. It would only aim to make honest predictions about how the world works. In his view, more capable systems could then be built on top of this trusted base, with safety checks, audits, and limits in place.Bengio says such a system could speed up scientific research. It could also act as an independent oversight layer for more powerful AI agents. However, this approach is very different from what most leading AI labs are doing these days.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2025, Bengio said companies were investing heavily in AI agents.he said. Bengio added that the push to automate work and cut costs isand that he is not surprised by what has happened since.Bengio mentioned.This is where governance becomes essential. Bengio does not believe technology alone can solve the problem. Even a safe technical approach, he argues, could be misusedThat is why LawZero is combining its research work with oversight from a strong board.he said. These decisions include who to work with, how to share research, and how to prevent the technology from becomingHe says the board is meant to help keep LawZero’s mission aligned with democratic values and human rights.Bengio revealed he has spoken to leaders at major AI labs, and many of them share his concerns. Still, he says companies like OpenAI and Anthropic believe they need to stay at the cutting edge to do any good with AI. Competitive pressure pushes them to build more powerful systems and reinforces the belief that their work is naturally beneficial.he said, noting that this is how he once experienced his own AI research.Bengio claimed.For someone who once feared that advanced AI may be uncontrollable by design, Bengio’s renewed sense of hope stands out. He admits that this view is not widely shared among researchers and organisations focused on the most extreme AI risks. Even so, he remains firm in his belief that a technical solution is possible.Bengio added.","Yoshua Bengio is one of the world's top artificial intelligence experts.

Netflix just made Paramount's hostile takeover pitch a lot harder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-just-made-paramounts-hostile-takeover-pitch-a-lot-harder/articleshow/126805494.cms,"Netflix has shifted its Warner Bros Discovery bid to an all-cash offer of $27.75 per share, abandoning stock. This move counters Paramount's criticisms and aims for a faster shareholder vote by April 2026. The core battle now focuses on the valuation of Discovery Global, a spun-off cable network, with Netflix seeking to secure the deal amidst ongoing industry speculation.

Faster path to shareholder vote in sight

Battle lines drawn over Discovery Global's value





Netflix has ditched the stock portion of its Warner Bros Discovery takeover, switching to a pure cash offer of $27.75 per share. The move directly counters Paramount's aggressive campaign to paint Netflix's original mixed deal as risky and inferior.The streaming giant announced Tuesday it will now pay the entire $82.7 billion enterprise value in cash, eliminating the $4.50 in Netflix stock that was part of its December offer. That stock component became a liability after Netflix shares dropped below the deal's collar price of $97.91, which would have diluted payouts to WBD shareholders.The revised structure should speed up regulatory review and get the deal to a WBD shareholder vote by April 2026. That's significantly faster than the original timeline, and it removes one of Paramount's key talking points about deal uncertainty.Netflix will finance the purchase through cash reserves, credit facilities, and committed financing. Both companies' boards unanimously approved the changes, though the deal still needs regulatory clearance in the US and Europe plus WBD shareholder approval.The real fight now centers on Discovery Global, the cable networks company being spun off before Netflix takes control.WBD's Tuesday proxy filing valued Discovery Global anywhere from $1.33 to $6.86 per share, depending on whether you're looking at comparable companies or potential acquisition scenarios.Paramount has been arguing those cable assets—CNN, TNT, TBS, Food Network—are basically worthless, despite generating billions in revenue. It's a convenient position since Paramount's $30-per-share hostile bid for all of WBD only looks superior if Discovery Global tanks.WBD also reduced Discovery Global's debt load by $260 million thanks to stronger-than-expected 2025 cash flow. The spinoff company is projected to carry $17 billion in net debt by mid-2026, decreasing to $16.1 billion by year-end.Separately, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has been doing damage control in Hollywood, promising to keep Warner Bros films in theaters for 45-day windows. ""I want to win opening weekend. I want to win box office,"" he told the New York Times, trying to calm fears that Netflix would kill theatrical releases.The original deal is still expected to close 12-18 months from last December, assuming Paramount doesn't successfully convince shareholders to reject it.","Netflix has ditched the stock portion of its Warner Bros Discovery takeover, switching to a pure cash offer of $27.75 per share.

OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar declares: Priority in 2026 is closing the gap between what AI now makes possible and how ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-cfo-sarah-friar-declares-priority-in-2026-is-closing-the-gap-between-what-ai-now-makes-possible-and-how-/articleshow/126805158.cms,"Read OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar’s blog post here



We launched ChatGPT as a research preview to understand what would happen if we put frontier intelligence directly in people’s hands.

What followed was broad adoption and deep usage on a scale that no one predicted.

More than experimenting with AI, people folded ChatGPT into their lives. Students started using it to untangle homework they were stuck on late at night. Parents started using it to plan trips and manage budgets.

Writers used it to break through blank pages. More and more, people used it to understand their lives. People used ChatGPT to help make sense of health symptoms, prepare for doctor visits, and navigate complex decisions.

People used it to think more clearly when they were tired, stressed, or unsure.

Then they brought that leverage to work.

At first, it showed up in small ways. A draft refined before a meeting. A spreadsheet checked one more time.

A customer email rewritten to land the right tone. Very quickly, it became part of daily workflows. Engineers reasoned through code faster. Marketers shaped campaigns with sharper insight. Finance teams modeled scenarios with greater clarity. Managers prepared for hard conversations with better context.

What began as a tool for curiosity became infrastructure that helps people create more, decide faster, and operate at a higher level.

That transition sits at the heart of how we build OpenAI. We are a research and deployment company. Our job is to close the distance between where intelligence is advancing and how individuals, companies, and countries actually adopt and use it.

As ChatGPT became a tool people rely on every day to get real work done, we followed a simple and enduring principle: our business model should scale with the value intelligence delivers.

We have applied that principle deliberately. As people demanded more capability and reliability, we introduced consumer subscriptions. As AI moved into teams and workflows, we created workplace subscriptions and added usage-based pricing so costs scale with real work getting done. We also built a platform business, enabling developers and enterprises to embed intelligence through our APIs, where spend grows in direct proportion to outcomes delivered.

More recently, we have applied the same principle to commerce. People come to ChatGPT not just to ask questions, but to decide what to do next. What to buy. Where to go. Which option to choose. Helping people move from exploration to action creates value for users and for the partners who serve them. Advertising follows the same arc. When people are close to a decision, relevant options have real value, as long as they are clearly labeled and genuinely useful.

Across every path, we apply the same standard. Monetization should feel native to the experience. If it does not add value, it does not belong.

Both our Weekly Active User (WAU) and Daily Active User (DAU) figures continue to produce all-time highs. This growth is driven by a flywheel across compute, frontier research, products, and monetization. Investment in compute powers leading-edge research and step-change gains in model capability.

Stronger models unlock better products and broader adoption of the OpenAI platform. Adoption drives revenue, and revenue funds the next wave of compute and innovation.

The cycle compounds.

Looking back on the past three years, our ability to serve customers—as measured by revenue—directly tracks available compute: Compute grew 3X year over year or 9.5X from 2023 to 2025: 0.2 GW in 2023, 0.6 GW in 2024, and ~1.9 GW in 2025.

While revenue followed the same curve growing 3X year over year, or 10X from 2023 to 2025: $2B ARR in 2023, $6B in 2024, and $20B+ in 2025. This is never-before-seen growth at such scale. And we firmly believe that more compute in these periods would have led to faster customer adoption and monetization.

Compute is the scarcest resource in AI. Three years ago, we relied on a single compute provider. Today, we are working with providers across a diversified ecosystem.

That shift gives us resilience and, critically, compute certainty. We can plan, finance, and deploy capacity with confidence in a market where access to compute defines who can scale.

This turns compute from a fixed constraint into an actively managed portfolio. We train frontier models on premium hardware when capability matters most. We serve high-volume workloads on lower-cost infrastructure when efficiency matters more than raw scale.

Latency drops. Throughput improves. And we can deliver useful intelligence at costs measured in cents per million tokens. That is what makes AI viable for everyday workflows, not just elite use cases.

On top of this compute layer sits a product platform that spans text, images, voice, code, and APIs. Individuals and organizations use it to think, create, and operate more effectively. The next phase is agents and workflow automation that run continuously, carry context over time, and take action across tools.

For individuals, that means AI that manages projects, coordinates plans, and executes tasks. For organizations, it becomes an operating layer for knowledge work.

As these systems move from novelty to habit, usage becomes deeper and more persistent. That predictability strengthens the economics of the platform and supports long-term investment.

The business model closes the loop. We began with subscriptions.

Today we operate a multi-tier system that includes consumer and team subscriptions, a free ad- and commerce-supported tier that drives broad adoption, and usage-based APIs tied to production workloads. Where this goes next will extend beyond what we already sell. As intelligence moves into scientific research, drug discovery, energy systems, and financial modeling, new economic models will emerge.

Licensing, IP-based agreements, and outcome-based pricing will share in the value created.

That is how the internet evolved. Intelligence will follow the same path.

This system requires discipline. Securing world-class compute requires commitments made years in advance, and growth does not move in a perfectly smooth line. At times, capacity leads usage. At other times, usage leads capacity. We manage that by keeping the balance sheet light, partnering rather than owning, and structuring contracts with flexibility across providers and hardware types.

Capital is committed in tranches against real demand signals.

That lets us lean forward when growth is there without locking in more of the future than the market has earned.

That discipline sets up our focus for 2026: practical adoption. The priority is closing the gap between what AI now makes possible and how people, companies, and countries are using it day to day. The opportunity is large and immediate, especially in health, science, and enterprise, where better intelligence translates directly into better outcomes.

Infrastructure expands what we can deliver. Innovation expands what intelligence can do. Adoption expands who can use it. Revenue funds the next leap. This is how intelligence scales and becomes a foundation for the global economy.





OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar has stated that now OpenAI is shifting its focus towards practical adoption of artificial intelligence in 2023. In a recent blog post Friar outlined that priorities of the company. The priority is closing the gap between what AI now makes possible and how people, companies, and countries are using it day to day,” Friar wrote. “The opportunity is large and immediate, especially in health, science, and enterprise, where better intelligence translates directly into better outcomes.”Signs of momentum are already visible. Data from Ramp showed that business spending on OpenAI models hit a record in December, surpassing rivals Anthropic and Google. This surge underscores growing enterprise reliance on OpenAI’s technology.Despite the increasing adoption, analysts advise caution. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced $1.4 trillion in infrastructure deals over the past year, including massive data center commitments. Some investors question whether revenue growth can keep pace with such spending.Friar countered these concerns by highlighting that revenue has scaled alongside compute availability.OpenAI’s compute capacity expanded from 0.2 GW in 2023 to 1.9 GW in 2025, while annualized revenue jumped from $2 billion to more than $20 billion. She described this as “never-before-seen growth at such scale.”One potential path forward is advertising, which OpenAI confirmed it has begun testing. CEO Sam Altman previously called ads a “last resort,” but the move has been anticipated for months as the company seeks to diversify revenue.","OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar says ChatGPT has become a tool people rely on every day to get real work done.

End of an era for Japanese TV dominance





Sony Group is spinning off its television and home entertainment division to Chinese rival TCL Electronics, ceeding majority control of the iconic Bravia brand as it accelerates its exit from low-margin consumer hardware. The Japanese electronics giant announced it will take a 49% stake in a new joint venture, with TCL holding 51%.

WhatsApp Web new update : Expected release timeline





WhatsApp, one of the most popular messaging services in the world, is soon going to roll out a very interesting new feature in their web service: voice and video calling. This new addition will, for the first time, enable calling services, until now only possible by smartphones, on computers as well. According to recent reports by WABetaInfo, the new service will enable individual as well as group calling right from web browsers.This update could significantly change how users communicate during work.The integration of the calling feature on WhatsApp Web is a development that has been eagerly anticipated for years, and it is a major step towards uniformity between the web service and the WhatsApp application.This new feature seems to offer several benefits for the online version of WhatsApp:This will enable WhatsApp Web users to engage in voice or video chats without depending only on their mobile phones, hereby improving usability for either professional, social, or educational activities.The implementation of group calls on WhatsApp Web has been designed to mirror the mobile experience as closely as possible:This design ensures that participants across different devices can communicate without compatibility issues, a problem sometimes experienced with other messaging platforms.Besides voice and video calling, there is expected to be the following functionality offered by WhatsApp Web, which can further organise calls:Although the exact launch date has yet to be announced, it is suggested that the upcoming feature may become available in the next few weeks. This is assuming it is already being developed, which is true, as it is currently available in beta versions.After its launch, WhatsApp Web will for the first time enable a complete calling experience similar to that on other phones, thus filling a gap that the platform has lacked for the last several years.","WhatsApp is expected to roll out a new feature in their web service: voice and video calling.

'Cannot Trust That Dog Anymore': Greenland Leader's BRUTAL ATTACK On Trump For Threatening Invasion

Texting through the Trump chaos

Beyond Ukraine: Europe prepares for life without America





European leaders have turned to a group messaging app to coordinate their response to President Donald Trump's escalating threats over Greenland, according to Politico. The informal but highly active arrangement, known as the ""Washington Group,"" has become a crucial tool for swift diplomatic coordination as transatlantic tensions reach new heights.The group chat includes UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Finland's Alexander Stubb, and Italy's Giorgia Meloni. Even Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy participates in the conversations. ""When things start moving quickly, it's hard to do the coordination, and this group [chat] is really effective,"" a source familiar with the arrangement told Politico. ""It tells you a lot about the personal relationships and how they matter.""The messaging system has evolved from the ""coalition of the willing"" that initially formed to support Ukraine. National security advisers from 35 governments maintain regular contact through the platform, meeting frequently online and in person while also exchanging less formal text messages.According to Politico, the leaders have developed a well-practiced routine: whenever Trump makes a provocative statement, they quickly exchange messages to align their responses.This approach has helped them navigate the past year of Trump's second presidency, though his recent Greenland threats have pushed the arrangement into overdrive.Trump's latest moves—threatening 10% tariffs on eight European allies if they oppose his Greenland acquisition plans—have marked a turning point. European officials, who previously tried maintaining a ""softly-softly approach"" to Trump's provocations, are now taking a firmer stance.The Washington Group takes its name from the European leaders who visited the White House with Zelenskyy last August. What began as Ukraine-focused coordination has transformed into a broader security alliance as American reliability comes into question.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that a forcible US takeover of Greenland would mean ""the end of NATO."" Meanwhile, von der Leyen stated that Europeans would ""stand firm"" in protecting Greenland, promising a response with ""steadiness and resolve.""The group chat may represent the foundation for a future European security arrangement—one that doesn't take American participation for granted.","European leaders have turned to a group messaging app to coordinate their response to President Donald Trump's escalating threats over Greenland.

Europe plans to do to Huawei and ZTE what America did in the year 2022,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/europe-plans-to-do-to-huawei-and-zte-what-america-did-in-the-year-2022/articleshow/126794328.cms,"The EU is reportedly planning to mandate the exclusion of Chinese firms like Huawei and ZTE from critical infrastructure, including telecom and solar energy. This move, mirroring US actions, aims to bolster security and reduce reliance on ""high-risk"" suppliers.

""high-risk""

What is the EU’s cybersecurity proposal and what changes it may bring

""high-risk""

“Fragmented national solutions have proven insufficient to achieve marketwide trust and coordination,”

What China said about EU’s plans to ban Huawei and ZTE products for critical infrastructure

“market principles and the rules of fair competition”.

“Facts have demonstrated that in a handful of countries, the removal of Chinese telecom companies' quality and secure equipment not only handicaps their domestic technological development but also results in heavy financial losses,”





The European Union is reportedly planning to propose phasing out Chinese-made equipment from critical infrastructure in the region. If the proposal is accepted, it will bar companies like Huawei and ZTE from telecommunications networks, solar energy systems, and security scanners across the EU, a Financial Times report claimed, citing officials. The move mirrors similar actions taken by the US in 2022, when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) banned the sale and import of new telecommunications and video surveillance equipment from Huawei, ZTE, and other Chinese firms. The US ban cited unacceptable national security risks and the fulfilment of requirements from the Secure Equipment Act of 2021 to prevent new devices from these companies from entering the American market.Brussels' potential action comes as the EU revamps its security and technology policy by reconsidering its dependence on both major US tech companies and Chinesesuppliers. According to the FT report, some EU officials are worried that these Chinese suppliers could be used to collect sensitive data from European networks and infrastructure.Earlier, the US designated Huawei and ZTE as national security threats and restricted their use in government-funded networks before implementing the broader 2022 ban.Europe now appears ready to follow a similar path in restricting Chinese technology companies from its critical systems.The report cited people familiar with the matter to say that the EU's cybersecurity proposal, to be presented soon, is expected to make the existing voluntary system that restricts or excludes high-risk vendors from their networks mandatory for EU countries.Previous recommendations have reportedly been unevenly followed, with several European countries continuing to rely on suchsuppliers. Last year, Spain signed a €12 million contract with Huawei to provide the hardware to store wiretaps authorised by judges for law enforcement and intelligence services.said an earlier draft of the proposed Cybersecurity Act, which is still subject to change.The proposal follows increased EU efforts to curb Chinese participation in critical European industries. The European Commission has launched investigations into train manufacturers and wind turbine makers, and in 2024, raided the European offices of security equipment company Nuctech.The exact timeline for the phaseout would depend on the assessed risk posed by the vendor to the EU and the specific sector, the officials said. The proposed timelines would also take costs and the availability of alternative suppliers into account. For example, more than 90% of solar panels installed in the EU are made in China.Some industry officials also point to the lack of viable alternatives, given that the EU must simultaneously reduce its reliance on both Chinese and US suppliers. However, telecom operators in particular have warned about the impact on consumer prices of a direct ban.After the commission presents its proposal, the draft law will be negotiated with the European Parliament and the EU member states. As member states are responsible for national security, the proposed timelines are likely to face resistance from some European capitals.The proposal could pose challenges for EU lobby groups, such as SolarPower Europe, the solar industry body of which Huawei is a member, due to its production of inverters used in solar panels, the report notes.In November 2025, China said that the European Commission's push to phase out the use of Huawei and ZTE technology would violatea Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said at that time.","The EU is reportedly planning to ban Chinese-made equipment from critical infrastructure in the region.

What is a ‘Digital Embassy’



India-UAE collaboration on technology and AI



India invites nations to set up secure digital embassies







The ‘Digital Embassies’ initiative is being pursued between India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the larger context of the strengthening of the strategic relationship between the two countries, as indicated in the joint statement on the occasion of the formal state visit of the President of the United Arab Emirates, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, to India. The objective of this initiative is to protect data of national importance. There is, in fact, an increasing focus on the role of digital infrastructure in building international relationships.The idea has been referred to by the foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, as a ""secure repository of strategic information,"" where only a few countries in the world possess such a facility. Both countries will work on a framework that will regulate this novel initiative.A Digital Embassy, which is also called an “info embassy” or “data embassy,” is basically an invulnerable presence of computer systems that is built beyond the boundaries of a nation’s territory, with the intention of safely storing vital data that is under the ownership of the state. It is safe from cyber attacks and is shielded by diplomatic immunity from the laws of the state it is resident in.“The plan is to offer a safe haven for important and valuable data,” said Misri.“It’s a fairly new technology and has had a few successes globally, but it’s new in India as well. It definitely requires a regulatory framework in which to execute it,” she added. But she said the UAE has expressed interest in it and was willing to explore it together.The Data Security Council of India explains that a Digital Embassy is an extension of a nation’s cloud computing infrastructure using government-owned servers overseas. Apparently, this will become even more important in the international arena due to the increasing geopolitical and cyber challenges.In addition to the digital embassy, the joint statement saw the strengthening of science, technology, and innovation cooperation between the two countries, including the focus on artificial intelligence and emerging technologies. The two countries agreed to work together on creating a supercomputing cluster in India and the potential to create data centers in India.This partnership reflects deeper strategic alignment in digital infrastructure ambitions.“This collaboration is a manifestation of a common desire to develop technology prowess with a focus on secure and trustable management of data,” it added. Additionally, the President of the UAE expressed his support for the upcoming AI Impact Summit in India in February 2026.India is actively inviting nations to establish Digital Embassies within its territory, with the UAE likely to be the first to do so. One proposed location is Gujarat’s GIFT City (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City), which offers state-of-the-art infrastructure suitable for secure and highly regulated data facilities as reported by MEA.These embassies will be legally protected, physically secure, and cater to foreign governments’ data storage needs while remaining under the diplomatic protections afforded to embassies. This approach positions India as a potential global hub for digital infrastructure, boosting its strategic and technological influence.Foreign Secretary Misri stressed that Digital Embassies involve complex sovereignty considerations. “Data carries national significance and strategic value, so establishing these facilities requires careful regulatory oversight. We will work closely with the UAE to navigate these issues while respecting sovereignty concerns,” he said.The development of a robust regulatory framework will ensure that data stored in these embassies remains secure, immune to host country interference, and compliant with international best practices for cybersecurity and governance.",India-UAE collaboration on technology and AI.

Threads shows significant growth, while X's mobile audience has declined. Despite X's desktop dominance, Threads' mobile-first strategy, leveraging Instagram's reach and feature experimentation, is proving effective, especially as X faces controversies.

Although desktop divide tells a different story

Elon Musk’s X is surrounded by controversies, and that could be helping Zuckerberg’s Threads





Meta's Threads has quietly pulled ahead of Elon Musk's X in the one place that matters most: people's phones. New data from analytics firm Similarweb shows Threads hit 141.5 million daily active users on iOS and Android in early January 2026, compared to X's 125 million mobile users.Threads has been climbing steadily—up 37.8% over the past year—while X's mobile audience has shrunk by nearly 12% in the same window. For a platform that launched in July 2023 amid eye-rolls about Meta opportunistically capitalizing on X's turmoil, that's a pretty convincing trajectory.Here's where it gets messier. X still crushes Threads on desktop, drawing around 150 million daily web visits against Threads' barely-there 9 million. That gap hints at something important: X remains the go-to for people treating social media like work—journalists, professionals, the chronically online. Threads, meanwhile, feels more like something you check between Instagram stories.In the US specifically, X holds onto a narrow lead with 21.2 million daily mobile users versus Threads' 19.5 million. But Threads grew 42% year-over-year in America while X managed just 18%.At that pace, the gap won't last long.Meta's playbook here is pretty transparent. They're using Instagram's enormous reach to funnel users toward Threads through constant cross-promotion. The company has also been throwing features at the wall—direct messages, disappearing posts, topic-based communities, even tests of in-app games—to see what sticks.Threads' rise comes during a particularly rough stretch for X. The platform's Grok AI chatbot recently generated non-consensual deepfake images, including some of minors, triggering investigations from California's attorney general and regulators in the UK, EU, India, and Brazil.Other alternatives haven't fared much better. Bluesky, the Jack Dorsey-backed Twitter clone, has seen its daily mobile users drop 44.4% year-over-year to just 3.6 million, according to Similarweb.Whether Threads can actually replace X remains unclear. But for now, Mark Zuckerberg 's mobile-first strategy is landing punches where Musk didn't see them coming."," Threads hit 141.5 million daily active users on iOS and Android in early January 2026.

Oracle is reportedly facing problems in pursuing its employees to move to its newest office in Nashville. Despite reported promises of tens of thousands of dollars in relocation incentives as well as offering a futuristic design and an in-house Nobu restaurant, the staff is refusing to move to the ‘world HQ’ that company founder Larry Ellison called 'the center of our future'. The reason: A potential ceiling on their future salaries.According to a report by Fortune (via Bloomberg), employees are reluctant to move to Tennessee-based “world headquarters” due to financial concerns of tech workers wary of “pay band” demotions. The city has been categorised in a lower geographic pay band than California, which means workers will be paid lesser less in Nashville for the same job as compared to Silicon Valley.Employees fear that moving to Nashville will cap their maximum earnings. The difference can be judged by the fact that employees will be paid an average annual salary of $110,000 for the 8,500 projected jobs, this figure is said to be significantly lower than the compensation packages in California.In 2024, Ellison announced that Nashville will be the company's new global epicenter, particularly for AI innovation and healthcare tech.The plan involved a massive 2-million-square-foot campus along the Cumberland River, featuring a pedestrian bridge and public parkland.However, the transition has been sluggish as Oracle reportedly saw a net gain of just seven employees in Nashville throughout 2025. Meanwhile, despite Ellison calling Nashville the ‘world HQ’, official SEC filings and the company's own website still list Austin, Texas, as the world headquarters.Currently, only about 800 workers are assigned to Nashville, a fraction of the 5,000 based in Kansas City (following the Cerner acquisition) or the 5,000 split between Austin and Redwood City, the report added.However, Scott Twaddle, the senior vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, said the company is attracting talent to build up its cloud and AI hub in Nashville.“We’ve seen great success recruiting engineering and technical positions locally and will continue to hire aggressively for the next several years. We look forward to breaking ground on this dynamic campus, which will add more public green space along the riverfront and incorporate a new pedestrian bridge creating greater community connectivity for the city that will become our global headquarters,” Twaddle was quoted as saying.The company is also heavily invested in the city's infrastructure, committing $175 million to riverfront improvements. In exchange, Tennessee state leaders provided a $65 million grant, and the company stands to recoup 50% of its future property tax payments.","Employees fear that moving to Nashville will cap their maximum earnings.

Report says 'caught Bill Gates lie' on climate; claims Gates Foundation made millions of dollar investments in ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/report-claims-caught-bill-gates-lie-on-climate-claims-gates-foundations-millions-of-dollar-investments-in-/articleshow/126790382.cms,"What Bill Gates said

What changed after 2015





Bill Gates’ charitable foundation, Gates Foundation Trust holds hundreds of millions of dollars in fossil fuel extractors, said Guardian. The trust invested $254m in companies that extract fossil fuels such as Chevron, BP and Shell, according to end-of-year filings as quoted in the report. The investment marked a nine year high and was 21% up compared to the year 2016. After adjusting inflation, the amount is the highest since 2019, the analysis showed. These investments, the report claims, comes despite Bill Gates’ claims of divestment made in 2019.Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, was ranked by Forbes as the world’s richest person for the period between 1995 and 2017. In 2000, he and his then wife Melinda Gates established the Gates Foundation, which is now the world’s third-largest charitable foundation.Questions around divestment first emerged for Gates in 2015, when a global campaign led by religious leaders, climate activists, students and charities urged large foundations to pull their money out of fossil fuel companies. That same year, calls were made for major trusts, including the Gates Foundation Trust, to move away from investments in coal, oil and gas companies whose business models depend on extracting fuels that cannot be safely burned.According to the report, Gates Foundation Trust was heavily invested in fossil fuels, to the tune of $1.4 billion in 2013.In a book titled ‘How to Avoid a Climate Disaster’ that Gates wrote in 2021, the tech billionaire said “I understood why the Guardian had singled out our foundation and me. I also admired the activists’ passion”. Skeptical of divestment, Gates said he did not see how “divesting alone would stop climate change or help people in poor countries”.Despite Gates' skepticism, the trust shifted its position and sold much of its fossil fuel stocks and bonds, including most of its $187 million stock holding in BP and a $824 million holding in ExxonMobil. The trust’s foldings dropped from $1.4 billion in 2023 to $260 million in 2015, a Guardian analysis found.As per the report, Gates called for more government investment in carbon-free energy sources in a 2015 paper. But, Gates Foundation Trust’s investment in several fossil fuel companies has increased. Its Glencore holdings increased from $5.7 million in 2015 to $14.1 million in 2024, the report says, adding its BP holdings increased from $8.7 million to $24.2 million, and its Occidental Petroleum holdings rose from $23,529 to $7.9 million, among others.","Bill Gates’ charitable foundation, Gates Foundation Trust holds hundreds of millions of dollars in fossil fuel extractors.

Interview that got Sulaiman Khan Ghori ‘fired’

Tyler

: Today I have the pleasure of sitting down with

Sully Ghori

, and he is one of the engineers at xAI. I've been kind of fascinated by xAI since like 2023 when

Elon

first started. I think it's like one of the fastest growing companies of all time. Can you just talk about like what the [ __ ] is happening at xAI?

Sully: Yeah. Um, we don't have really due dates. It's always yesterday. Um, there's no blockers for anything—at least nothing artificial. Uh, the whole Elon thing about going down to the root, uh, the fundamental, whatever the physical thing is, we get there pretty quick if we can, as quick as we can, which is funny in software. It's not really like a thing that you think about is the physics too much, but we do try quite a bit and we're not really fully a software company given all the infrastructure pull down. Um, it's kind of hardware at this point. Yeah, it's like hardware constrained. It's probably our biggest edge is the hardware because nobody else is even close on the deployment there. Um, although the talent density on software is like incredible. I've never been anywhere like that. It's really cool.

Tyler: For Elon, he is very good at figuring out like what the bottlenecks will be even like a couple months or even years in the future and then trying to work backwards from that and make sure that like he's in a really good position. Um, how does that work day-to-day with just normal people like at xAI and like adopting that kind of mental framework?

Sully: Usually when we spin something up new very quickly, either one of us or he comes up with this uh metric that's usually very core to either the financial or the physical return, or both sometimes. Um, and so everything is just focused on driving that metric. Um, there's never like a fundamental limitation to it or like whatever the fundamental limitation is, it better be rooted deep down and not something artificial. Um, and there is a lot of uh perceived limitations, um especially in the software world coming from like especially in the last 10 years of like web dev and all these kinds of things. People just assume or accept certain limitations especially when it comes to speed and latency and they're not true. Um, you can get rid of a lot of overhead. Like there's a lot of stupid stuff in the stack and if you can knock out a lot of that, you can usually 2x to 8x most anything—at least anything invented relatively recently. Uh, some stuff not so much, but yeah.

Tyler: When was the last time that you experienced this where there's some like conventional wisdom that says that there's this is the timeline and then you guys just were able to completely shred that?

Sully: Um, most recently it's our model iterations on Macro Hard. Um, so we're working on some novel architectures actually multiple at the same time and uh we're coming out with new like iterations like daily, sometimes multiple times a day from pre-train um in some cases, uh which is not something you ordinarily really see but it comes from well, a) we have a pretty great supercomputer team and they've knocked out a lot of the typical barriers it takes to train a lot of this stuff even with how variable our hardware is. Like, it's you know, within a day of standing up a rack you can usually be training, sometimes within the same day, um even within a few hours in some cases and this is like not normal. Like normally the timelines are like days or weeks it takes a lot. Well, in most cases at least, yeah, in the last 10 years you abstract this away and let Amazon or Google take care of this, um and so whatever their capacity is is what their capacity is, but that's not like you can't have that be the case when in AI now. So, the only solution is to die or uh or build it yourself.

Tyler: Can you tell me about like how what your experience was like joining, why you joined, and then kind of what the like onboarding process was for the first like couple weeks?

Sully: Yeah. So, um I was working on my own startup when I moved to the Bay. Um and actually during that time, Greg Yang, one of the co-founders of xAI, had reached out. He's great at recruiting as it turns out. Um, what did he say? Uh, so I got an email and I thought it was spam because I was getting a lot of these like, you know, emails to founders at the time of like, ""hey, you want to chat?"" or ""I like what you're doing, you want to chat,"" whatever. I was going to mark it as spam to like delete it. And I saw the domain x.ai. I was like, ""oh, wait a second. I know these guys."" And they just uh I think it was probably eight months in at that point. Um, and so I was like, ""okay, yeah, let's chat."" And so we chatted a bunch of times. Um, then uh I wanted an aqua-hire but uh I think we were too early at the time and that company kind of went mostly because it was fairly obvious that you can't build Macro Hard with like a million dollars. Um, but the uh idea was sound.

So I spent the next like six, seven months wasting all my money um building like aerospace projects and working on uh an aerospace astro-mining concept. Um, that also I realized like probably wouldn't work, but it was worth a try. And so I emailed Greg again like uh, ""hey can uh like you want to chat again?"" He's like, ""yeah sure you want to interview tomorrow."" I was like, ""okay."" And um uh I apparently did well and I moved on Monday and I started uh then and it was really great. Um, nobody told me what to do. So like my first day they just gave me a laptop and a badge and I was like okay. Um and I was like okay now what? And so I went to go find Greg cuz I was like, ""I don't I don't even have a team."" I've not been told what to do. Like Greg just brought me on cuz I think he liked what I was doing previously and it was related to what the long term was for Macro Hard which wasn't really even a project at the time.

And I ended up working on actually uh as Grok was spinning up at the time where our integrations with X and so they're like ""can you help?"" and I was like ""yes I can help."" And so my first week was working uh with the one guy. I found out very quickly like everything that we built like I could sit and I could stand up from my desk which I didn't even have a desk assigned to me. I just sat at random people's desks that weren't there that day. Um and I could point to whoever built that thing at xAI um like from my desk. It was very very very cool. And there was like almost no people working there at this point. Just like a couple hundred, right? Uh yeah, about a hundred or so on the engineering staff. And then I don't know what the uh uh infra buildout team looked like at that time. And it's kind of hard to tell because some people move up the ladder from like the actual building and construction crew onto our payroll. But um it was pretty small at the time—like much much like an order of magnitude smaller than the other labs. Um and we had still just done Grok 3. Um yeah, which yeah was pretty cool.

Tyler: One of the things that I kind of love um is how fast xAI went from being founded. I remember Elon initially saying like we're not even sure if this can be a success with you know people having you know a multi-year advantage on on speed and like timing and then you guys got done with the first like Colossus data center in like 122 days. Um and that was just like unheard of and Jensen's out here saying singing the praises of xAI and Elon. Uh, what kind of culture did that allow to be formed?

Sully: It definitely enabled like us on on model and product to kind of assume we would have the resources to do what we needed to do. Um and that's definitely the case. Like we're not super duper resource constrained. Like we've still found a way to push up against that wall. Um but that's just we have 20 different things going at the same time. Like more than that, like many more things than that. There's an absurd amount of of runs and training and all that stuff going on at the same time in parallel usually by like a few a handful of people. Um which is how we're able to iterate very quickly on on model and product side. Um and utilization has definitely been very high. The the speed allows us definitely to I guess think more long term. Um, so I think Grok 4 or 5 really what it was was already planned out and and designed in terms of size and what we expected um way early—like before I joined. I joined around Grok 3. So it's like thinking at least a year in advance. You can yeah you can think much more in advance and assume that those estimates will be hit um just because everyone's like pretty great and reliable which frees you up a lot in terms of like what your limitations are I guess.

So for us for example the assumed minimum latency was about three times higher than it actually needed to be and the buildout allowed for that basically. Um, what do you mean by that? So the one of the novel architectures we're working on um is not really possible unless you scale up your experiment rate because it's it's not building on any existing body of work. You need a new pre pre-training body and you need also uh a new data set but that's not really constrained by the resources—like the physical uh infrastructure resources mostly. Um although there's the uh the Tesla computer thing which I think maybe we'll get into maybe not but um uh so actually this one's public. So one thing that we're thinking about is okay like we're we're building this human emulator with Macro Hard. Um how do we deploy it? Because you actually need like if we want to deploy 1 million human emulators we need 1 million computers. Um how do we do that? And the answer showed up two days later in the form of a Tesla computer because those things are actually very capital efficient as it turns out. And we can run um potentially like our our model and the like full computer that a human would otherwise work at on the Tesla computer for much cheaper than you would in on on a VM on AWS or Oracle or whatever or even just buying hardware from Nvidia. That car computer is actually much more capital efficient and so it enables us to assume that we can deploy much much faster at a much higher scale. Um and so we've adjusted our we adjusted our expectations for that basically.

Tyler: Are you basically able to just bootstrap off of the like car network?

Sully: So that's one of the one of the potential uh solutions basically. Yeah. So like okay well we want 1 million VMs. Um there's like 4 million uh Tesla cars in North America alone. Um, and like let's say 2/3 or half of them have hardware 4. Um, and like somewhere between 70-80% of the time they're sitting there idle probably charging. We can just potentially pay—and they have, you know, networking, they have cooling, they have power—um, we can just pay owners to lease time off their car and let us run um like a human emulator uh digital Optimus on right on it. And uh they get you know their lease paid for and we get uh a full human emulator we can put to work. Um and that's something without any buildout requirement. It's a purely software implementation that's required.

Tyler: Yeah. The the asset is sitting there and you can just go and use it. Amazing. What for the human emulators uh in Macro Hard what is the like purpose of that of scaling up you know millions of many humans?

Sully: Um, I mean the basic concept is very simple, right? With Optimus, you're uh taking any physical task a human can do and allowing a robot to do it automatically at a fraction of the cost at 20, you know, with 24/7 uptime. Um, we're doing the same with anything that a human does digitally. So any anything where they need to digitally input uh a keyboard and mouse inputs, which is usually what humans do, um and look at a screen back and make decisions, uh we just emulate what the human is doing uh directly. So no adoption from any software is required at all. Um we can deploy in any situation in which a human is in potentially currently.

Tyler: Um interesting. What is what is that actually going to look like uh for rolling it out?

Sully: Um I don't think we've detailed our plans publicly yet specifically on uh on how we'll roll out. It'll be slowly at first and then very quickly basically like uh like the difference for us given that infrastructure buildout already has happened or we can go on the Tesla network or we can build out our own data center Tesla computers actually. Um the difference for us from from going from 1,000 human emulators to a million is actually not very big. It's not it's not the biggest part of the challenge.

Tyler: Elon, I know one of the things that he does best is he basically just goes from fire to fire on whatever the company is and just kind of like puts it out and unfucks whatever problem is exists. Uh, what has that been like? What when have you like seen some problem exist and just had it unfucked very rapidly do this kind of process?

Sully: Um definitely on the infra build out this is the biggest. Um on model side we've been like we've had hiccups but it's more or less been smooth but on model side especially cuz there's a lot of uh I mean infra side there's a lot of very specific uh operations that each of these basically ASICs these GPUs are are built for and when we roll out new products like when we pick up new products from Nvidia or whoever um not everything works so in some of the meetings that we had with him uh early last year, uh he would hear these and he would make a phone call and the software team would deliver a patch the next day and we would work like side by side until that was resolved. Um and then we could run a model uh or a training run uh on the hardware uh very very quickly where otherwise it would have taken weeks of back and forth. So those kind of blockers are usually very quickly resolved with one phone call um or just us bringing it up to him or him just offering like frequently when uh a meeting is ending or there's a lull in in the conversation he'll be like, ""okay how can I help? how can I make this faster?"" whatever and someone will come up with with an answer.

Tyler: I know you guys are doing many different products in parallel and I get that it's kind of like you have to do that but also it's sometimes in most organizations it's like very difficult to stay focused on a single thing and like a single objective. How does that kind of work uh for just executing on multiple different fronts at the same time?

Sully: Very frequently we actually uh and this is increasing with scale. We don't have a full picture until like the all hands or we just chat with people what everyone is doing and how far everyone is on these different projects. Like for example on on when we did our our our voice model and our voice deployment um we actually had a lot of the work built for extremely low latency uh extreme low latency end like uh packets to be sent to the client. It was already built out and um it was a matter of flipping the right switches and the right configs basically to cut our latency pretty significantly um like 2-3x uh end to end. Um this is actually the case a lot of the time is there is a stupid thing that uh exists somewhere in the software or the hardware and someone has come up with a solution um and you find it when you go to look for it in in our codebase somewhere or you ask around and someone's like ""oh yeah this XYZ person has done this you should talk to them and they will hook you up."" Um there's not a lot of time spent syncing up with anyone or asking for permission or um waiting for anyone at all. Like the answer is like when you propose someone someone says a good idea. Like usually you propose something and the the answer is either ""no that's dumb"" or ""why isn't it done already?"" Like um and then you go and do it and then it's done.

Tyler: With Elon companies, you can kind of just ask for responsibility and then you basically just live by the sword, die by the sword, and if you get things done, then you can just ask for more responsibility and you can keep on doing that or you're just like out. What's been your experience like with that?

Sully: Very much so. Yeah, like um I've jumped around a lot of different projects and mostly just because someone asked for my help and I kept helping and then I ended up owning some of the stack or a lot of the stack. Um and this is the case for everyone—like this is just how it is. Um if you have any particular experience or um can iterate on something very quickly within days, you own that component. Um yeah there's no formal anything I think officially on our HR software I I'm on voice and iOS or something and our security software thinks I still work on our X integration and um which never updated. Yeah. No, no one ever updates this stuff like um it's kind of ridiculous.

Tyler: And has has your like journey at the company kind of been you show up there's not exactly like a clear direction of what you're going to work on and then you just start working on stuff and then you just kind of like hop from project to project by whoever asks for your help?

Sully: Yeah, there's quite a bit of like overlap and flowing. Um so like after onboarding I'm usually on two or three projects at once. Um, and whichever one is most pressing or I can help the most on ends up taking majority of my time and then that kind of overlaps and flows in like a waterfall way.

Tyler: What's been the journey from like the starting to to now? Like what what projects have you worked on?

Sully: Yeah, so specifically I started um I first worked on like ASRock uh and our integration there and I worked with our backend team a bit on like reliability and scaling up because we were scaling up a lot at that time. Uh and then after that I took on solo building up our our desktop suite. Um and took that went to internal completion. Uh and then I got asked for help on our Imagine rollout and iOS which yeah our iOS team is small for like how many people use it. Like it's ridiculous. You won't guess the number. Um like five people for three. It was three and I was the third person at the time when we were rolling that out. It was like it was ridiculous and everyone's like really really good. Um yeah, this is the first place where I've had to work very hard to keep up really with like the the speed and the talent.

Tyler: What was the first uh experience that you had where you thought to yourself like you're actually being kind of used to your full, you know, potential?

Sully: And I think that Imagine rollout was definitely like it was a really good push cuz like we had this 24-hour iteration cycle. Um you all would get feedback every night on whatever we were doing. Um and yeah, we we would push out that night. Uh in the morning we would have all the feedback. We would immediately knock out all the bugs, um implement the new stuff that that people were asking for. Whatever model had come up with, we implemented that too. Like it was a very very fast cycle and it was uh I think it was the longest like continuous stretch of me being in the office like every day.

Tyler: What was that like at the time?

Sully: It was like two or three months. Two or three times. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um yeah, like there weren't weekends for a while, which was uh it was good to know that I could do that and I was pretty happy doing that. Um, and after that I got pulled onto Macro Hard product which was just one other person at the time. So it was the two of us uh for a while and I've been on that since uh since that project kicked off basically.

Tyler: I don't know how much you like know about this but uh the like Colossus build and all the ridiculous stuff that the like early xAI team had to do to turn on Colossus and like get power and all the necessary inputs to making that work. And even today, I think like it's just bottlenecks across the entire thing. You just want more you you want more like uh chips and GPUs and all the stuff working and faster. Um what was that like?

Sully: There's a lot of war stories um and a lot of bets. Um want to go into a few? Yeah. So I think Tyler took this bet uh with Elon like uh one we were setting up new racks I think of I forget what which GPUs we were rolling out at that time. Um, we took a bet. Uh, Elon's like, ""Okay, you get a Cybertruck tonight if you can get a training run on these GPUs uh in 24 hours."" Uh, and we were training that night. Um, did he get the Cybertruck? Yeah, he got it. I think it's Yeah, I see it from our lunch window. Mhm. Cafeteria. Yeah, he's cool. Um uh you know what the I so for power we actually have to collaborate very tightly with the like municipal uh and state power companies uh because when load goes high on their end we have to shut off and go fully on the like 80—or maybe it's more than that, I think more than that—80 mobile generators we brought in on trucks um and go fully on those um just so that we don't like impact power uh anywhere. Within—and we have to do that like seamlessly without interrupting anyone's uh extremely volatile training runs uh on extremely volatile uh you know GPUs and and hardware which scales up and down by like megawatts in milliseconds. It's it's a lot. Um, is that also part of the logic of like basically putting massive battery packs right next to the uh data centers cuz then you can kind of like go up and down much faster?

Sully: Batteries can scale up a lot uh scale up and down and uh balance that load a lot faster. Um cuz with a generator you're literally asking a physical thing to speed up or or slow down like a spinning spinning physical thing that's obviously just going to take a certain amount of time. The batteries can uh react to the load much much faster and then yeah it's like actually from the physical standpoint I think there's the uh local capacitors, the station like data hall side capacitors, the batteries, and then generators, and then the public municipalities, although we might have changed that infrastructure at this point. Things move very quickly especially on the cooling side.

Tyler: Do you have any other really good like war stories that are just like uh I don't know things that shouldn't have been possible that became possible?

Sully: Uh, so the the lease for the land itself was actually technically temporary. It was the fastest way to get the permitting through and actually start building things. Um, I assume that it'll be permanent at some point, but yeah, it's I think a very short-term lease at the moment technically for all the data centers. It's the fastest way to get things done.

Tyler: And how do they how do they do that?

Sully: Um I think there's basically a special exception uh within like the local and state government says, ""okay if you want to just uh modify this ground temporarily""—I think it's like for like uh carnivals and stuff—you can. xAI is actually just a carnival company currently and so that was the way to get done quickly. I mean it was done yeah 122 days for like internal planning. I know things are just going to keep on scaling up like crazy and Elon's talked about energy being the biggest bottleneck and then you know just being able to get chips. Um how do you guys plan when it's very difficult to like predict 12 to 24 months in the future exactly what projects you're going to be working on or what their like resource requirements are going to be?

Sully: We try we try very hard to work backwards from like what's the highest leveraged thing we can be doing and then we determine the physical requirements later. So like if we want to get to 10 or 100 billion in revenue by this date, uh what are the highest leverage things we can do like from an economic perspective? How can we actually build systems to do that? And then what does it take on the physical and software side to roll that out and and get it done? Um just roll down roll backwards the whole way. So we don't usually start with the with the physical requirement. That's usually actually at the end.

Tyler: Is there like a SpaceX-esque um like algorithm for making things happen? As in like the usual ""delete""?

Sully: Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's the case all the time. Um and we do do the thing where yeah we delete something and then add it back later. Um what was the like last time that you did that? Today. Today. Um today. Yeah. So with Macro Hard we deploy on um a lot of like physical hardware that changes and um the testing harness for that is hard. Um so we try to minimize how many special cases are downstream of where it needs to be. And um for example like with display scaling um we need to be able to support displays that are you know 30 years old as well as the latest like 5K Apple whatever displays and that has to happen on the same stack. Um, turns out not all the systems are happy with that at all times. Like you have to you have to fiddle with the encoders at a certain level. Like uh video encoders um was the specific thing basically. We I didn't know but uh as it turns out there are limits to the maximum amount of pixels that certain encoders can take. So we have to now have I removed this special case for multiple encoders and turns out we found a problem at at plus 5K resolution and so we added that back.

Tyler: What are the most interesting things about xAI itself um that you think like would be really good stuff to talk about?

Sully: There's a lot of characters that work there and also we're doing hiring in like interesting ways I guess. Um like things that I thought would be stupid are okayed and we just do them and we try them and it's like we we'll do a hackathon and if we get five people in as a result it's worth it. Um because just their like expected return on on the company's like revenue or valuation is higher than the cost of running this hackathon for 500 people. Um like the overhead value is actually very high which is like funny. We did the math um earlier this week. Uh right now we're like I think at about $2.5 million per commit to the main repo. Um and I did five today.

Tyler: So you added like 12 and a half million of value. Um light days. Light days. Exactly. It was a good day. Um it's funny things like that. Um like the levers are are extremely strong. Like you you can get a lot a lot done with a lot less effort and time than you used to be able to for sure just because of who you work with, the internal tooling that we built up. Um, and my boss.

Tyler: What's like an example of the type of person that like wants to work here? Cuz I know when when you're talking about it, you kind of show up and the first day you're just like, ""I want to work on the weekends. I want to work on, you know, during the night, all this stuff."" Uh, go all in on this. Um, what kind of special characters are are working there?

Sully: People are definitely very enthusiastic when they come in. Like, um, very very enthusiastic. Uh just like like mission oriented. Um there's I guess different types of ambition for sure. Some people want to move up like the leadership ladder and own more in terms of a managerial like how many people report to me sense. Some people want to own huge parts of the technical stack. So like right now we're doing a big rebuild um of like our core uh production APIs. It's being done by one person with like 20 agents. Um, and they're they're very good and they're capable of doing it and um, like it's working well. Uh, so you can own huge chunks of the code base, no problem.

Tyler: It's kind of like a X where like after the acquisition they like had, you know, much fewer people, but you just like never had a lot of people in the first place, so there's one person like owning a huge part of the product. Absolutely. For hiring. Um what's what unusual practices outside of just hackathons uh does xAI do?

Sully: Uh so we're pushing very hard on Macro Hard. Like for two or three weeks I was doing upwards of 20 interviews a week. So that's like some of them are like quick 15 minutes. Some of them are full 1 hour technicals. So a lot of my time uh is dedicated towards bringing in new people and a lot of people are very good. So it's it's actually very hard to judge them. How do you uh I have a very specific problem that I have solved. I'm not going to reveal it because then people will use it. But I have solved a very specific computer vision problem a few years ago for one of my startups and I uh I give people half an hour to try to implement the solution. It's actually very very simple. This deceptively simple solution. People always overthink it. Um and this is something I like to index for on my team especially is like can you not overthink it and come up with a simple solution? Um it helps a lot because we're deploying on such a wide variety of like uh on a wide variety of hardware as a result of the wide variety of of customers—like literally 30 years, 40 years of uh different hardware, different operating systems, everything like that. You have to come up with simple solutions or you're going to have a 10 million line code base uh next week. So you you this is like very important. Um and especially now relying more and more on on agents and and an AI and and such for writing code. Um an AI will happily train out 200 lines when a 10-line solution will do um and probably do better. So you have to look for that. Like I want people and I look and actively hire for people who can find the 10-line solution first. Um, we're totally fine with people using AI to code things. Like you should you should use that as a force multiplier, but uh for now we're smarter. We'll see next year.

Tyler: What other like force multipliers do you kind of like look for?

Sully: I like people who will challenge uh challenge requirements and challenge me. So often uh I got this from uh Chester Zai German for he told me this and I thought it was great. He throws in usually um an incorrect requirement or question or an impossible like uh line in uh his challenges for people when he's hiring like coding challenges and he expects people to come back and say like, ""hey this is wrong, this is not possible, you made a mistake,"" and if he doesn't, then uh he doesn't hire them. Same thing for me—I picked that up. It's a great idea.

Tyler: The pace is insanely fast and like you said you kind of have worked on a number of different things. How do you kind of come up to speed on something as quickly as possible when you're on a new task or project?

Sully: It depends on what thing it is. If there's a lot of code to read, yeah, read the code by hand. Um like GD (Go to Definition) over and over again and you'll find things out very quickly. Actually, it's not that hard. Um for most things, the implementation is like less lines of code than you would otherwise see, which is nice. Um not all the time, but in most cases, if it's something that's in very active development, this is not the case. There's going to be 20 different versions of it going at the same time, and it's not obvious what is the current path. So, you just got to talk to people, and people are very open. Like, this is actually one of the things I was very surprised by, uh pleasantly surprised by when I joined is I thought people would be super smart and stuck up, but no, people are just super smart and very nice and helpful. Like, everyone's on the same team, everyone's rooting for each other, people are willing to like help you out um and answer your questions. So, which is good because we don't like write a lot of docs. We write things. We do things too fast to write docs really. Um, actually, yeah, we're trying to figure out some systems on on my team to like automatically generate docs as we like build stuff. Um, and with Grok, which is cool that we have unlimited access to uh very smart AI because then we can try a bunch of stupid things, see if it works, which otherwise, you know, at a startup would cost you maybe like $100 or a hundred thousand dollars or a million dollars in in credits or whatever. We do it for free. So experimentation—like failure—you can fail on a lot of things and it uh a lot more things you otherwise would um and as a result more experiments.





Sulaiman Khan Ghori, former engineer at Elon Musk ’s AI company xAI recently shared that he has left the firm. “I have left xAI. Nothing but love to my former team and coworkers!,” Ghouri wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter). The exit was announced days after Ghori appeared on the Relentless podcast hosted by Ti Morse, leading to speculation that the engineer was ‘fired’ for being “too candid” and “unfiltered”. “Fireside chat turned into actual firing…,” commented one user on the YouTube video of podcast interview. “I guess he was a little too candid,” said another.“Former xAI employee Sulaiman Ghori supposedly leaks Macrohard's roadmap in interview and gets fired! This is the part where he reveals details of the 'human emulator' they're building that does 'everything'...""we get a full human emulator we can put to work"",” wrote a user on X, adding to the speculation.According to his linkedIn profile, Ghori joined xAI in March 2025. His alleged 'firing' comes less than a year after he joined the company.","Sulaiman Khan Ghori is one of the engineers at xAI. Ghori: There's no blockers for anything—at least nothing artificial.

Conclusion

By: Nitin Bansal, Managing Director, India Head-Networks, Market Area South East Asia, Oceania, and India at Ericsson





India’s telecom sector in 2025 marks a transition from nationwide 5G deployment to a driving focus on value creation, monetisation and intelligent networks. Connectivity is no longer the end goal; it has become the platform on which India’s digital economy is being built. With 5G now firmly embedded across urban centres and expanding steadily into semi-urban and rural corridors, the sector is redefining its role as a strategic enabler of economic growth, enterprise transformation and inclusive digital access central to the vision of Viksit Bharat 2047.India has emerged as one of the world’s fastest growing 5G markets, driven by rapid consumer adoption and an unparalleled appetite for mobile data. The latest industry reports project that India will approach one billion 5G subscriptions by 2030, with 5G accounting for nearly 79 percent of total mobile subscriptions by that time. This momentum is being fuelled by immersive video, cloud-based applications, gaming and increasingly sophisticated digital experiences.One of the most consequential developments of the year has been the rise of 5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) as a mainstream broadband alternative.FWA has demonstrated that high-speed connectivity does not need to be constrained by the pace and economics of fibre deployment. By delivering fibre-like speeds wirelessly, FWA is transforming broadband access for homes and small businesses, particularly in fast-growing suburbs, smaller towns and areas where last-mile connectivity has traditionally been a challenge.By 2025, FWA connections have scaled rapidly, signalling a structural shift in India’s broadband model. This has meaningful implications for digital inclusion - enabling access to online education, telehealth, remote work and digital entrepreneurship. More importantly, it reinforces the idea that wireless technologies will play a central role in bridging India’s digital divide.Enterprise adoption of 5G reached an inflection point in 2025. What began as isolated pilots has started translating into scalable deployments across manufacturing, logistics, utilities, mining, ports and public services. Enterprises are increasingly investing in private 5G networks and edge computing to improve productivity, enhance safety, automate operations and gain real-time visibility into complex processes.Industry showcases and deployments during the year have highlighted how AI-enabled automation, digital twins, remote operations and mission-critical communications are becoming commercially viable at scale. This signals a fundamental shift for the telecom sector from being a connectivity provider to becoming a strategic partner in enterprise digital transformation.Perhaps the most defining change in 2025 has been the transition toward software-driven, cloud-native and programmable networks. Telecom infrastructure is increasingly being modernised through virtualised architectures, AI-based optimisation and end-to-end automation. These capabilities are critical as networks become denser, traffic volumes surge and energy efficiency becomes a business imperative.At the same time, the exposure of network capabilities through open APIs is transforming networks into platforms. Functions such as quality-on-demand, security, location intelligence and device insights are being made accessible to developers and enterprises, enabling the creation of new applications across financial services, mobility, gaming, logistics and industrial automation. This programmability is laying the foundation for an entirely new innovation ecosystem around connectivity.AI is becoming essential to managing the complexity of modern networks - enabling intent-driven operations, autonomous decision-making, improved reliability and lower total cost of ownership. On the other, the next generation of AI applications - personal AI assistants, real-time analytics, immersive experiences and intelligent machines - will depend on high-performing networks with low latency, strong uplink capabilities and edge computing.Robust, intelligent connectivity is required for mass-scale AI adoption and telecom networks are evolving into the invisible engine that powers India’s AI-led digital future.Progressive policy frameworks, spectrum planning and emerging satellite connectivity initiatives continue to strengthen India’s telecom foundation, particularly for remote and strategically important regions. Equally critical is the focus on skills and ecosystem readiness. Investments in 5G, AI and software capabilities - supported by industry-academia collaboration - are creating a future-ready talent base that will be vital as India prepares for the transition to 6G.India’s telecom sector in 2025 stands at the threshold of a new era defined not by expansion alone, but by intelligence, programmability and purpose. By embracing software-led networks, enterprise innovation, FWA-driven inclusion and the powerful convergence of AI and connectivity, the industry is building long-term value for the economy. As India looks toward 20s30 and beyond, telecom will remain a cornerstone of its ambition to emerge as a leading global digital economy.","India’s telecom sector in 2025 marks a transition from nationwide 5G deployment to a driving focus on value creation, monetisation and intelligent networks. Connectivity is no longer the end goal; it has become the platform on which India's digital economy is being built. By delivering fibre-like speeds wirelessly, FWA is transforming broadband access for homes and small businesses.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

PwC global chairman: AI adoption rises, results still limited

Confidence gap among business leaders





PwC global chairman Mohamed Kande has said that a majority of companies are not seeing results from their artificial intelligence (AI) investments because they are missing basic groundwork. Speaking to Fortune on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Kande highlighted a PwC survey which says that 56% companies are getting “nothing” out of AI, even as spending and adoption rise sharply. During the interaction, Kande said the role of CEOs has changed significantly, with leaders now expected to manage existing businesses, transform operations, and build new models at the same time. According to Kande, AI has become a key pressure point in this shift.Kande said the job of a CEO has changed more in the past year than in the previous 25 years. He explained that business leaders are now expected to run current operations, make changes in real time, and prepare for future business models simultaneously. He said this three-part responsibility is something he has not seen before in his career.“This is one of the most testing moments for leaders,” Kande told Fortune.He added that while the pace of change is creating uncertainty, similar periods have occurred in the past, including during major economic and industrial shifts.PwC’s 29th global CEO survey, based on responses from 4,454 CEOs across 95 countries and regions, shows a wide gap between AI adoption and outcomes. Kande said companies have moved from debating whether to use AI to actively deploying it. “Nobody is asking that question anymore. Everybody’s going for it,” he said.However, the survey found that only 10% to 12% of companies report gains in revenue or cost savings from AI. At the same time, 56% said they are not seeing any benefit. Kande said the issue is not the technology itself but weak execution.He said companies that are seeing results have focused on clean data, clear processes, and proper oversight. “Somehow AI moves so fast … that people forgot that the adoption of technology, you have to go to the basics,” Kande said.Kande also pointed to a gap in confidence among CEOs. While many leaders say they feel positive about the global economy, fewer are confident about growing their own businesses. PwC’s survey shows that only three in ten CEOs expect revenue growth over the next 12 months, the lowest level in five years.Kande said this uncertainty is also affecting how companies think about talent and careers, as AI takes over routine tasks. He said traditional entry-level learning models may need to change as a result.Kande said leaders should look at long-term trends rather than short-term disruptions. “I’m an optimist,” he said, adding that understanding change is key to dealing with it.",PwC global chairman Mohamed Kande said 56% companies are getting “nothing’ out of AI.

Google exec ‘calls out’ the No. 1 problem that American technology companies face and Chinese don’t have to,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-exec-calls-out-the-no-1-problem-that-american-technology-companies-face-and-chinese-dont-have-to/articleshow/126765463.cms,"How Google is tackling its ‘energy’ problems

Calls for US energy investment





Google’s senior executive has now warned that the US electrical transmission system is now the single biggest challenge facing American technology companies. Creating years-long delays in connecting new data centers to the grid. As reported by Reuters, speaking at an American Enterprise Institute ever, Marsden Hanna, Google’s global head of sustainability and climate policy said the transmission barriers are slowing down the expansion of critical infrastructure.“Transmission barriers are the number one challenge we’re seeing on the grid,” Hanna said. “We had one utility who told us 12 years to study the interconnection timeline, which is sort of wild, but that’s what we’re seeing.” On the other hand, Chinese technology companies do not face such prolonged bottlenecks, giving them a competitive edge in scaling data center capacity.To address these delays, Hanna urged policymakers to accelerate the approval process for new high-voltage transmission lines. Meanwhile, she also listed out Google’s strategy to power its data centres.Google calls it 'co-location' strategy wherein it plans to build data centres adjacent to existing power plants.By plugging directly into the source, Google can theoretically avoid the decade-long wait for a grid connection, bypassing the congested transmission system.“That's the strategy we're pursuing with colocation and our hope is that these can eventually be grid-connected resources,” Hanna said.The global electricity demand is said to increase by 30% by 2035 and it is largely driven by the rapid growth of data centers. Their share of total power consumption is expected to more than double, from 1.5% today to 3.5%, as artificial intelligence adoption accelerates.Earlier this month, one of America’s biggest investor Michael Burry urged the US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance to fast-track a $1 trillion nuclear power and grid expansion plan. In a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Burry argued that deploying small nuclear reactors nationwide and building a hardened national grid is the only way for the US to meet the increasing electricity demand which is driven by artificial intelligence. Burry also feels that this is only way in which we can hope to keep up with China, stressing that abundant energy is important for long-term national security and managing US debt.","Marsden Hanna, Google’s global head of sustainability and climate policy said the transmission barriers are slowing down the expansion of critical infrastructure.

Elon Musk keeps promise that he made in 2023





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has admitted limitations in social media platform X (formerly Twitter). In a post, the tech billionaire emphasized the platform’s real-time transparency as a key differentiator from competitors like Meta and TikTok. “We know the algorithm is dumb and needs massive improvements, but at least you can see us struggle to make it better in real-time and with transparency,” Musk wrote, adding “No other social media companies do this”.He was responding to a post by the official handle of X Engineering which announced the open-sourcing of X's new recommendation algorithm on January 20, 2026, fulfilling Elon Musk's January 10 promise to release the code powering organic and ad post recommendations every four weeks with developer notes.In a post earlier this month, the X owner said that the company “will make the new X algorithm, including all code used to determine what organic and advertising posts are recommended to users, open source in 7 days”.“This will be repeated every 4 weeks, with comprehensive developer notes, to help you understand what changed,” he further added.Elon Musk first promised to make X algorithm open-sourced in 2023. That year, a version was made available, but it was never updated.In order to record ongoing changes, the company now intends to release updated code and thorough developer notes every four weeks.The decision to make the algorithm open source comes as X faces pressure from regulators about content moderation and algorithmic bias. The European Commission recently extended a data retention order for the platform through 2026, while authorities in France and the UK have raised concerns about illegal content being shared. By making the code public, the company wants to let outside developers and researchers review the system and suggest technical improvements.","Elon Musk has admitted limitations in social media platform X (formerly Twitter) The tech billionaire emphasized the platform’s real-time transparency as a key differentiator.

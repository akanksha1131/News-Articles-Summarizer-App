Arrest of Huawei founder's daughter in Canada

A U.S. federal judge has reportedly ruled that Huawei Technologies , China’s leading telecommunications equipment manufacturer, must face a sweeping 16-count indictment accusing the company of stealing trade secrets, racketeering, wire and bank fraud, and violating U.S. sanctions . U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly rejected Huawei’s motion to dismiss the charges, calling the company’s arguments premature in a 52-page ruling, according to court documents.According to a report by news agency AP, the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) alleges that Huawei and its subsidiaries engaged in a concerted effort to steal American trade secrets, installed surveillance equipment that aided Iran in monitoring protesters during 2009 anti-government demonstrations, and conducted business in North Korea despite U.S. sanctions. The 2019 indictment also charged Huawei with using a Hong Kong shell company, Skycom, to sell equipment to Iran in violation of sanctions, and accused its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou , of misleading HSBC about Huawei’s Iranian dealings.Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, was arrested in Canada in 2018 on a U.S. extradition request but was released in 2021 as part of a prisoner swap that freed two Canadians detained by China. Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling. The case, which intensified during former President Donald Trump’s administration, saw the U.S. raise national security concerns and urge Western allies to exclude Huawei from their high-speed wireless networks. Chinese officials have countered, accusing the U.S. of “economic bullying” and using national security as a pretext to suppress Chinese companies. Huawei’s legal team argued the allegations were vague and some charges improperly applied U.S. law extraterritorially.Facing U.S. sanctions that have restricted access to American processor chips and technology, Huawei, the world’s largest network gear maker, has pivoted to developing its own chips and focusing on the Chinese market. The company has also expanded into network technology for hospitals, factories, and other industrial sectors less affected by U.S. restrictions. The ruling sets the stage for a high-profile legal battle as Huawei confronts the serious allegations in the U.S. federal court.","A U.S. federal judge has reportedly ruled that Huawei Technologies must face a sweeping 16-count indictment.

"When Steve Jobs visited Moscow as he was 'looking for something to do', making a trip that made it to FBI files",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-steve-jobs-visited-moscow-as-he-was-looking-for-something-to-do-making-a-trip-that-made-it-to-fbi-files/articleshow/122256947.cms,"Apple founder Steve Jobs reportedly made a trip to Moscow. When? In 1985, when Moscow was part of Soviet Union and shortly after reformist leader Mikhail Gorbachev‘s rise to power. According to a report in Cult of Mac, in a trip to the Soviet Union in 1985, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs aimed to bring Macintosh computers to Russia. The two-day visit saw Jobs lecturing computer science students, attending a Fourth of July party at the American embassy, and discussing the possibility of establishing a Mac factory in Russia.The trip came at a tumultuous time for Steve Jobs, who had been sidelined at Apple after a power struggle with CEO John Sculley. Seeking purpose, Jobs embarked on an overseas journey that included stops in Paris, Italy, and Moscow. In Paris, he met future U.S. President George H.W. Bush, discussing how Macs could spark a “revolution from below” in the Soviet Union, where the less-powerful Apple II had recently launched.However, Jobs’ visit wasn’t without controversy. According to Walter Isaacson’s 2011 biography, Jobs nearly clashed with the KGB by praising exiled Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky, deemed an “enemy of the people” by the Soviet regime. Cult of Mac cites Isaacson, noting that a KGB agent warned Jobs against discussing Trotsky, saying, “Our historians have studied the situation, and we don’t believe he’s a great man anymore.” Undeterred, Jobs reportedly began a speech to Moscow computer students by lauding Trotsky, though a partial transcript of the speech omits this detail.Intriguingly, Jobs suspected the attorney organizing his trip might have ties to the CIA or KGB, a detail noted in his FBI file, which also mentioned his meeting with a Russian Academy of Sciences professor to explore marketing Apple products. Despite these, the trip reportedly yielded no Russian Apple division, aligning with what Cult of Mac describes as “busy work” to keep Jobs away from Apple’s management.A surprising outcome emerged, however. Apple VP Al Eisenstat, staying at the same Moscow hotel, received a floppy disk from a nervous programmer containing advanced handwriting-recognition software. The report adds that members of the Apple Newton team later confirmed this code became the foundation for the Newton MessagePad’s handwriting recognition feature. Though Jobs’ Soviet venture didn’t revolutionize Russia’s tech landscape, it remains a fascinating chapter in his storied career, blending ambition, intrigue and unexpected technological gains.","Apple founder Steve Jobs reportedly made a trip to Moscow in 1985.

USCBP wants new digital forensics tool amid rise in device searches



The United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is reportedly seeking assistance from tech companies to develop a digital forensics tool capable of analysing data from seized phones and computers, specifically to uncover ""hidden"" patterns. This initiative suggests the agency's aim to enhance its data processing capabilities. According to a report from Wired, a federal registry listing from June indicates that CBP is looking for a tool that can scan text messages, pictures, videos, contacts, and other information on devices confiscated at US borders. Apart from basic data processing, the agency wants a tool that can identify ""hidden language"" or coded terms within text messages that may not be immediately apparent.CBP is also looking for a tool to identify specific objects across videos and photos, and to quickly process data for ""intel generation,"" indicating a focus on extracting actionable intelligence from the collected information, the report claims.In 2015, the agency searched around 8,500 devices; by 2023, that number had risen to 41,500. CBP also conducted 4,200 advanced forensic searches in 2024, involving deep data analysis.While CBP currently uses tools from Israeli firm Cellebrite, it remains open to alternatives. As per the report, the agency already employs a variety of data extraction tools, suggesting it's not tied to one vendor.CBP agents have been known to request access to travellers' phones and other devices, particularly during border checks. This practice has prompted some visitors to use burner phones when travelling to the U.S. to avoid handing over personal data.In a recent request for information, CBP hinted that it plans to select a vendor and finalise a contract to develop the tool by the third quarter of 2026, with potential implementation following in 2027.","US Customs and Border Protection is reportedly seeking help to develop a digital forensics tool.

Self driving cars to be first commerce use of Nvidia’s robotics technology: Jensen Huang





Redmi Pad 2: Know these Things Before Buying!

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence (AI), the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Huang said both AI and robotics represent what he believes a “multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity”. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said during the conference. Nvidia’s robotics division has seen fast growth in the past. Currently making up just 1% of Nvidia’s total revenue, the revenue brought in $567 million last quarter – a steep 72% rise from the previous year.“We’re working towards a day where there will be billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories that can be powered by Nvidia technology,” Huang said.Huang also emphasized a shift in how the company sees itself. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” he said, adding that Nvidia is now focused on being an “AI infrastructure” and “computing platform” provider.During the annual shareholder meeting, Huang said that Nvidia’s chips will be key not just for AI training, but also for software and hardware use in autonomous vehicles and robots. He named self-driving cars as the first major commercial use of Nvidia’s robotics technology. Nvidia’s Drive platform, a suite of chips and software for autonomous cars, is currently being used by Mercedes-Benz.The chipmaker recently introduced Cosmos, a line of AI models designed for humanoid robots.In a related news, Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company with a market cap of around $3.75 trillion. The company has rebounded strongly since a market dip earlier this year, which was caused by concerns about competition from China’s DeepSeek AI.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence, the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122088756,imgsize-19028,width-400,resizemode-4/Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Huang.jpg"

The US Embassy in India has issued a clear warning for visa applicants. “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas,” the embassy said in a post on microblogging site X (previously known as Twitter). The post reminded visa applicants to disclose all social media usernames or handles they’ve used over the past five years while filling out the DS-160 visa application form. “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form” the post read. “Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit.”The requirement is part of broader vetting procedures introduced by the US State Department in recent years. As part of the updated rules, applicants must list IDs used on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and others—even if the accounts are no longer active from the last five years.The move comes days after the US government issued a new guideline for those applying for student and exchange visitor visas. Applicable to all applicants of F, M, and J non-immigrant visas, the new rule requires these applicants to set their social media accounts to public. “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under U.S. law,"" the US embassy in India wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post.F, M and J visas are the common types of non-immigrant visas issued by the agency to foreign nationals who wish to study or participate in exchange visitor programs in the U.S. F visa is typically used by academic students, the M visa by vocational students, and the J visa by exchange visitors, including researchers, scholars, and interns.In a related news, USCIS has announced that it will switch to a new phone number for sending text (SMS) messages. “Effective July 1, 2025, USCIS will no longer send text (SMS) messages from the phone number 468-311 (GOV-311).

In the last decade, however, India's passport operations have undergone a quiet revolution in the background.On June 24, 2025, on the occasion of the observance of the 13th Passport Seva Divas, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar recognised this change. His speech wasn't merely formal. It was a straightforward assessment of how technology, governance, and public service have converged to impact actual people daily.In a social media update on X, Dr. Jaishankar expressed gratitude to passport officials, both in India and posted overseas, for what he labelled as a ""remarkable transformation"" in service delivery. He associated the program with three pillars: Seva (service), Sushasan (good governance), and Garib Kalyan (welfare). For the minister, these concepts are no longer theoretical—they're being implemented through services such as the Passport Seva Programme.The passport application process in India was all about delays, red tape, and queuing up for years. The picture has changed dramatically now. The Passport Seva Programme (PSP), initiated by the Ministry of External Affairs, has gradually revolutionised the way individuals apply for, obtain, and renew their passports.Dr. Jaishankar said the PSP is an expression of the government's overall vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"", a developed India with technology and governance aligned to better serve citizens. To say it in his own words, ""Seva, Sushasan and Garib Kalyan are three major pillars of governance that would take us to a Viksit Bharat. They are all expressed with prominence in our Passport Seva Programme.""This scheme is not limited to cities alone. It has spread its wings to Tier 3 and Tier 2 towns and districts with Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs), so that first-time applicants, migrant labourers, and students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities can avail of passport facilities without having to travel long distances.What was once seen as a long, often frustrating ordeal has now become a smoother and more accessible process. People are able to schedule appointments with ease, receive timely updates, and walk into clean, well-managed centres with helpful staff.Among the largest announcements this year is the country-wide introduction of e-Passports. They're not new passports with a new cover, they're embedded with a microchip bearing critical personal and biometric information.Here's what makes them different:The technology used is no different from that which is already common in most developed nations, bringing India's passport program to par with the best worldwide.e-Passports have several practical advantages:As per the latest updates from the Ministry of External Affairs, e-passports are issued phase-wise and in the next few years will become the norm for all new applicants.More countries are adopting digital verification systems, and e-passports are expected to further streamline international travel. Travelers will benefit from smoother immigration checks and faster processing through automated e-gates at major airports. With the government's phased rollout underway, carrying a smarter and more secure passport is set to become the new norm for Indian citizens.One of the more frustrating parts of applying for a passport has always been the police verification process. Depending on the location, this step could delay an application by weeks.In order to mitigate that, the Ministry of External Affairs launched the mPassport Police App, a mobile app now being used by the police in 25 states and Union Territories. As per the official update in the Ministry, the app has managed to decrease verification timelines to a mere 5 to 7 days in most regions.Police officers currently get electronic notifications, can upload proof of information at the scene, and transmit real-time updates to passport offices. This not only enhances speed but also avoids paperwork by hand and follow-up delays.For students, working professionals, and first-time applicants, this alone has made the whole process much more certain and less stressful.If you want to know how to obtain an e-passport, the procedure is not that different from obtaining a normal one. Here's how you do it:Following this, you will be able to follow up on your passport online until it arrives via post.","S. Jaishankar launches Passport Seva 2.0 in India: Know how to apply for e-Passport online, eligibility, and other information. E-passports are less likely to be forged or replicated, providing an additional layer of security for Indian travellers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122096858,imgsize-31690,width-400,resizemode-4/Passport-Seva-2-0.jpg"

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other top executives sell over $1 billion in company shares: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-and-other-top-executives-sell-over-1-billion-in-company-shares-report/articleshow/122155830.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells shares

Other Nvidia executives cash in

Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year, reports Financial Times. As per the report, over $500 million of those sales took place in June alone, as the chipmaker's stock price climbed to a record high, making Nvidia the world’s most valuable company. The report highlights that Nvidia insiders are capitalizing on the market’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, which has driven massive investor interest and sent the stock price soaring.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began selling his shares last week for the first time since September 2024. The company confirmed that his sales were made under a pre-arranged trading plan set in March, which defines the prices and dates for share sales. Such plans are commonly used by executives to avoid allegations of insider trading.Ben Silverman, vice-president of research at VerityData said “When the stock [dropped] in the first quarter, he did not sell, [which was] really smart.”“[Huang] waited for the stock to return to levels that he felt more comfortable selling at,” he added.According to VerityData, his sales began after a required 90-day cooling-off period ended. Under the trading plan, Huang can sell up to 6 million shares before the end of 2025. At current stock prices, that would amount to more than $900 million. Forbes estimates his net worth at $138 billion.According to the Financial Times report, several other top Nvidia figures have also sold large portions of stock. Mark Stevens, a longtime board member and early Nvidia investor, disclosed plans to sell up to 4 million shares on June 2, currently worth around $550 million. He has already sold $288 million worth.Jay Puri, Nvidia’s executive vice-president of worldwide field operations, sold $25 million in stock last week, says FT. Board members Tench Coxe and Brooke Seawell also made sales — Coxe offloaded around $143 million on June 9, and Seawell sold about $48 million in June.These executives, all long-time members of Nvidia’s leadership team, have been with the company since its early days. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 inside a Denny’s restaurant in San Jose. Coxe and Seawell, both with venture capital backgrounds, joined the board in the late 1990s.AI boom fuels Nvidia’s stock surgeDespite recent setbacks — including U.S. export controls and advances by Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek — Nvidia’s share price has bounced back. Since hitting a low in April, the company has regained about $1.5 trillion in market value.The company’s market value is not estimated at around $3.8 trillion. The rapid growth reflects strong global demand for the company’s chips, used to power AI systems across industries and governments.","Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year.

Sam Altman's strategic exaggeration backfires

Meta's AI hiring spree continues

Lucas Beyer , one of three OpenAI researchers who recently joined Meta 's superintelligence team, has publicly dismissed reports that Mark Zuckerberg offered him a $100 million signing bonus, calling the claims ""fake news.""“No, we did not get 100M sign-on, that's fake news,” wrote Beyer in his post on X (previously Twitter), announcing this move to Meta with his colleagues.Beyer’s clarification comes after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed on his brother's podcast that Meta had been making ""giant offers"" worth more than $100 million to lure away his top talent. Beyer, along with colleagues Alexander Kolesnikov and Xiaohua Zhai, announced their departure from OpenAI's Zurich office to join Meta's new AI unit this week.When a social media user suggested the OpenAI CEO Sam Altman ""clearly just threw out the 100m figure out there to make potential takers think that they were being lowballed,"" Beyer responded: ""Yes, it was a brilliant move, gotta give him that.""Meta's Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth echoed Beyer's sentiments during an internal company meeting Thursday, calling Altman ""dishonest"" and noting that the OpenAI chief was ""countering all these offers"" while creating inflated market expectations. Bosworth emphasized that such massive packages only apply to ""a very, very small number of people"" in senior leadership roles.The three researchers had previously worked together at Google DeepMind before joining OpenAI in December 2024 to establish the company's Zurich office.

Google is facing an antitrust complaint in the European Union (EU) regarding its AI Overviews feature – one of the biggest Search features launched in recent years. Citing a document, a report by news agency Reuters says that a group of independent publishers has lodged the complaint with the European Commission, also requesting an interim measure to prevent what they allege is irreparable harm to their businesses.Google’s AI Overviews provide AI-generated summaries that appear prominently at the top of search results, above traditional hyperlinks to relevant webpages. This feature is currently available to users in over 100 countries, with advertisements having been integrated into AI Overviews since last May.The report says that while Google views the integration of AI into search as a major strategic move, it has ignited significant concern among some content providers, particularly publishers.The complaint, filed by the Independent Publishers Alliance and dated June 30, accuses Google of abusing its dominant market position in online search.The document asserts that “Google's core search engine service is misusing web content for Google's AI Overviews in Google Search, which have caused, and continue to cause, significant harm to publishers, including news publishers in the form of traffic, readership and revenue loss.”The publishers argue that by placing its own AI-generated summaries – which are created using publisher material – at the top of search results, Google unfairly disadvantages their original content.A key point of contention in the complaint is the alleged lack of choice for publishers.“Publishers using Google Search do not have the option to opt out from their material being ingested for Google's AI large language model training and/or from being crawled for summaries, without losing their ability to appear in Google's general search results page,” the complaint states.In response to the allegations, a Google spokesperson stated that the company sends billions of clicks to websites daily.“New AI experiences in Search enable people to ask even more questions, which creates new opportunities for content and businesses to be discovered,” the spokesperson added.","Google is facing an antitrust complaint in the European Union (EU) regarding its AI Overviews feature – one of the biggest Search features launched in recent years.

The European Union (EU) has dismissed the calls by tech giants like Google, Facebook-parent Meta and others to delay the region’s landmark artificial intelligence (AI) act, saying that the European Commission will proceed with the implementation as previously scheduled. This means that the authority firmly rejects recent pleas from major tech companies and some nations to postpone the implementation of the AI Act, news agency Reuters reported.Companies including Google's parent Alphabet, Meta, and European firms like Mistral and ASML have recently urged the Commission to delay the AI Act by several years, citing concerns over compliance. However, Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier was unequivocal during a press conference.“I've seen, indeed, a lot of reporting, a lot of letters and a lot of things being said on the AI Act. Let me be as clear as possible, there is no stop the clock. There is no grace period. There is no pause,” Regnier stated.He emphasised that the legal deadlines are fixed within the legislation.“The provisions kicked in February, general purpose AI model obligations will begin in August, and next year, we have the obligations for high risk models that will kick in in August 2026,” he clarified.While some companies have expressed worries about the costs and stringent requirements of the AI rules, which aim to set crucial guardrails for a technology currently dominated by the US and China, the Commission remains steadfast.The Commission does plan to propose steps to simplify its broader digital rules later this year, potentially reducing reporting obligations for smaller companies, but this will not affect the AI Act's timeline.The AI Act is designed to regulate a technology that is becoming central to numerous economic sectors, ensuring its responsible development and deployment across the EU.","EU rejects calls by tech giants to delay implementation of landmark artificial intelligence (AI) act.

ChatGPT , now widely recognised by many as the chatbot that kicked off the generative AI boom, almost had a very different name. According to OpenAI executives, it was a “late-night decision” just before its viral 2022 launch that led the Microsoft-backed company to simplify its chatbot's moniker from the difficult “Chat with GPT-3.5” to the now-iconic “ChatGPT.”On a recent OpenAI podcast, Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT, and Mark Chen, research chief, shared insights into the crucial days leading up to the chatbot's public launch. Turley revealed that the decision to rename the product was made just the day before its late 2022 launch.“It was going to be Chat with GPT-3.5 , and we had a late-night decision to simplify” the name, he stated on the podcast.“We realised that that would be hard to pronounce and came up with a great name instead,” Turley explained. They ultimately settled on ChatGPT, an abbreviation for “generative pre-trained transformer.”Before ChatGPT's launch, few within OpenAI anticipated the impact the name would have. Andrew Mayne, the podcast host and OpenAI's former science communicator, noted that the chatbot's core capabilities were largely similar to its predecessors.The key differentiators were primarily a more user-friendly interface and, critically, its new, memorable name.“It's the same thing, but we just put the interface in here and made it so you didn't have to prompt as much,” Mayne noted.Soon after its launch, ChatGPT rapidly gained traction attracting millions of users worldwide.“We've had so many launches, so many previews over time, and this one really was something else,” Chen added. For Chen, ChatGPT's success marked a personal milestone: “My parents just stopped asking me to go work for Google,” he said.ChatGPT’s success has spurred a wave of competition, with numerous rivals, including Meta AI , Google's Gemini and DeepSeek, emerging in the expanding AI landscape.","ChatGPT is widely recognised by many as the chatbot that kicked off the generative AI boom.

"Microsoft 'quits' Pakistan after 25 years; founding country manager of Microsoft Pakistan says: This is more than a corporate exit, it is a ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-quits-pakistan-after-25-years-founding-country-manager-of-microsoft-pakistan-says-this-is-more-than-a-corporate-exit-it-is-a-/articleshow/122251777.cms,"'End of an Era… Microsoft Pakistan'



Microsoft is reportedly exiting Pakistan. The software giant is quitting Pakistan after 25 years. Microsoft is said to have been reducing its headcount and operations in the country over the last few years, and has now fully pulled out of Pakistan. Microsoft started its operations in Pakistan in June 2000. The news of Microsoft exiting Pakistan was revealed in a LinkedIn post by Jawwad Rehman , the founding head of Microsoft Pakistan . There has reportedly been no formal public announcement from the company itself. However, according to a report by Tech Radar, the move was all but confirmed already, with full operations shut down in Pakistan and only a liaison office with around five employees remaining.In the post titled 'End of an Era… Microsoft Pakistan', Rehman wrote: ""Today, I learned that Microsoft is officially closing its operations in Pakistan. The last few remaining employees were formally informed and just like that, an era ends... Exactly 25 years ago, in June 2000, I had the honor of launching and leading Microsoft Pakistan.""He added that Microsoft's decision to quit Pakistan calls for reflection, ""Today’s news forces reflection. This is more than a corporate exit. It’s a sobering signal of the environment our country has created.. one where even global giants like Microsoft find it unsustainable to stay. It also reflects on what was done (or not done) with the strong foundation we left behind by the subsequent team and regional management of Microsoft.""He further said that it is time to ask what has changed about Pakistan that has made global corporations leave the country. ""We must ask: What changed? What was lost? What happened to the values, leadership, and vision that once made it all possible?"" he wrote.Reflection further, he said, ""Allah grants honor and opportunity to whom He wills.. and takes it away from those who lose sight of it. But if your work leaves behind impact, integrity & inspiration.. then know that Allah’s favor was with you.""In another post, Rehman asked the Honourable Minister of IT and the Government of Pakistan to ""actively engage Microsoft’s regional and global leadership"" so that the company can maintain a presence within Pakistan.","Microsoft is said to have been reducing its headcount and operations in the country over the last few years.

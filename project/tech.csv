"Apple TV partners with EverPass Media, brings sports content to restaurants, bars",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-tv-partners-with-everpass-media-brings-sports-content-to-restaurants-bars/articleshow/128593071.cms,"Apple schedules March 4 experience event



Apple TV has partnered with EverPass Media to bring the streaming company’s live sports content to bars, restaurants, hotels and gyms, reports news agency Reuters. The agreement expands EverPass Media’s premium sports library that currently includes Paramount+'s UEFA Champions League , Prime Video's ""Thursday Night Football"", and National Basketball Association and Women's NBA content. Announcing the deal, EverPass CEO Alex Kaplan said: “From the continued growth of MLS and the enduring pull of MLB to Formula 1's rapidly expanding global fanbase, Apple 's content strengthens and diversifies our library of premium offerings”.The deal shows Apple’s growing effort to expand its sports content in public places, where large screens and group viewing could help attract more subscribers, increase customer visits, and strengthen its brand presence. This comes as Apple rebranded its streaming service Apple TV+ last year, dropping the plus sign and renaming it as ""Apple TV,"" introducing what the company calls a ""vibrant new identity."" The streaming service launched in November 2019 with ""The Morning Show"" and other star-studded originals and has since earned hundreds of awards.In a related news, Apple has announced a ""special Apple Experience"" event scheduled for March 4 at 9:00 am ET, with simultaneous gatherings planned in New York, London, and Shanghai. The invite features a 3D Apple logo made of yellow, green, and blue discs—colours that match rumoured options for a new low-cost MacBook. Apple is pointedly calling this an ""experience"" rather than an ""event,"" suggesting something smaller and more hands-on than the typical Apple Park keynote.There's no word yet on whether it'll be livestreamed.Bloomberg's Mark Gurman had previously reported that Apple was gearing up for hardware announcements as early as the week of March 2, and this lines up neatly. The company is expected to unveil new MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, an M5 MacBook Air, and a budget MacBook powered by an A18 Pro iPhone chip that could start around $699-$750.","Apple TV has partnered with EverPass Media to bring live sports content to bars, restaurants, hotels and gyms.

'Chinese Humanoid Robots' showcased during Lunar New Year event impress everyone and 'prove' why Elon Musk said that China is only competitor Tesla has,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinese-humanoid-robots-showcased-during-lunar-new-year-event-impress-everyone-and-prove-why-elon-musk-said-that-china-is-only-competitor-tesla-has/articleshow/128462881.cms,"“I think China will be by far the biggest competitor in the humanoid robot market. China is extremely good at scaling and manufacturing and is also strong in AI—the models being released there are already quite good and are improving rapidly.”

Why the hype around Chinese humanoid robot market has increased



“We’re gonna take the Model S and X production space in our Fremont factory and convert that into an Optimus factory … with the long-term goal of having 1 million units a year of Optimus robots in the current SX space in Fremont,”

“we’re still very much at the early stages of Optimus,”

“We wouldn’t expect to have any kind of significant Optimus production volume until probably end of this year,”

China's annual CCTV Spring Festival Gala, which is often compared to the US Super Bowl, showcased humanoid robots from four domestic startups during the Lunar New Year celebrations this week. This highlights the country's push to lead in robotics and manufacturing. The demonstration comes after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said China would be a key competitor in the humanoid robot market.During Tesla's earnings call last year, Musk said,The gala featured robots from Unitree Robotics, Galbot, Noetix, and MagicLab performing martial arts and fight sequences with swords, poles, and nunchucks alongside human child performers. The event served as a showcase for China's industrial policy and its ambitions in humanoid robotics.China is the world's largest manufacturer and user of robots. According to an industry report by Omdia, Chinese robotics firm AgiBot shipped over 5,100 humanoid robots in 2025, securing a 39% share of the global humanoid robot market.The attention surrounding China's humanoid robot sector comes as major players, including AgiBot and Unitree prepare for initial public offerings this year. Moreover, domestic artificial intelligence (AI) startups release a range of frontier models during the nine-day Lunar New Year public holiday.Last year's gala drew widespread attention with 16 full-size Unitree humanoids twirling handkerchiefs and dancing alongside human performers. Unitree's founder met President Xi Jinping weeks later at a notable tech symposium, which was the first of its kind since 2018.Xi has met five robotics startup founders in the past year, comparable to the four electric vehicle and four semiconductor entrepreneurs he met in the same timeframe, giving the emerging sector considerable visibility.Behind the spectacle of robots running marathons and executing kung fu kicks and backflips, China has positioned robotics and AI at the heart of its next-generation AI manufacturing strategy, aiming for productivity gains from automation to offset pressures from its ageing workforce.Elon Musk has said he expects his key competitors to be Chinese companies as he pivots Tesla toward a focus on embodied AI and its humanoid robot Optimus.Last month, Musk said that Tesla is betting on a future driven less by cars and more by humanoid robots, reiterating comments he made last year. During Tesla’s earnings call this week, Elon Musk outlined plans to shift focus away from vehicles toward its Optimus robots, saying the company would discontinue the Model S and Model X to prioritise robot production. Tesla said it will end production of the Model S and Model X and repurpose the California facility that built those vehicles to manufacture Optimus robots.Musk said.In 2024, Musk said Optimus could eventually make Tesla a $25 trillion company, compared with its current market value of about $1.4 trillion, and previously stated that 80% of Tesla’s value could come from robots.While Musk said Tesla plans to build a production line capable of producing one million Optimus units annually, he also acknowledged thatdescribing it as a research and development effort.Musk added.","China's annual CCTV Spring Festival Gala showcased humanoid robots from four domestic startups during the Lunar New Year celebrations this week.

Price spikes and “RAMmageddon”



Industry fallout due to global chip crisis



Echoes of past supply chain shocks



Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Xiaomi President Lu Weibing and many others are warning about a global crisis unfolding: Shortage of memory chips. The scarcity of memory chips led to their soaring costs. As a report in Bloomberg says it is beginning to hammer profits, derail corporate plans and inflate price tags on everything from laptops and smartphones to automobiles and data centers — and the crunch is only going to get worse.As per the Bloomberg report, the main driver of the squeeze is the buildout of AI data centers. Companies like Alphabet and OpenAI are buying millions of Nvidia AI accelerators, each needing a massive amounts of DRAM. This has left the consumer electronics maker fighting over dwindling supplies from Samsung and Micron. Elon Musk has also suggested that Tesla may need to build its own fabrication plant, “he said in January.The report also adds that the memory prices are increasing and going at an unprecedented levels. One of the type of DRAM jumped by 75% in a single month, with retailers adjusting prices daily. Industry insiders have dubbed the crisis “RAMmageddon.” Tim Cook warned that iPhone margins will be compressed, while Micron called the bottleneck “unprecedented.”The report also revealed the industry fallout on the global chip crisis.The report adds that Sony may delay its next PlayStation console to 2028 or 2029. Also, Nintendo is also thinking raising the prices of Switch 2. Xiaomi and Oppo may also cut shipment forecasts for 2026. Cisco cited the memory squeeze in a weak profit outlook, triggering its worst share loss in nearly four years. Lastly, Qualcomm and Arm Holdings also warned of more fallout.This global chip crisis recall the Covid-era chip shortages, but this time the driver is AI. Tech giants Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are pouring hundreds of billions into AI infrastructure, diverting memory production toward high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for AI accelerators. That leaves less capacity for standard DRAM used in everyday electronics.Bernstein’s Mark Li says memory prices are going “parabolic.” Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing warned the crunch will last at least through the year. Counterpoint Research estimates DRAM shortages will persist across electronics, telecom, and automotive industries, with signs of panic buying already visible.",Report: Shortage of memory chips led to soaring costs.

Mackenzie Scott, former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has said that her approach to large-scale philanthropy is shaped by acts of kindness she received during her early years. In an essay published on her philanthropic organisation, Yield Giving website in October, Scott said she often thinks about the people who helped her when she struggled financially as a college student. She recalled borrowing money from her college roommate to avoid dropping out and receiving free dental care from a local dentist when she could not afford treatment.“It is these ripple effects that make imagining the power of any of our own acts of kindness impossible,” Scott wrote in the essay. “Whose generosity did I think of every time I made every one of the thousands of gifts I’ve been able to give?”“It was the local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college. It was the college roommate who found me crying, and acted on her urge to loan me a thousand dollars to keep me from having to drop out in my sophomore year.”Scott, one of the most active philanthropists in recent times, has donated about 58 million Amazon shares since 2020, significantly reducing the stake she received following her divorce from Bezos in 2019. After the divorce, Mackenzie Scott received roughly a 4% stake in Amazon, amounting to about 139 million shares at the time.She has since cut that holding by around 42%.Despite this, Scott remains worth close to $28 billion, even after donating about $26 billion through her Yield Giving organisation, which she launched in 2022.Yield Giving has supported thousands of organisations across areas such as education, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), disaster relief, and community development. In recent months alone, Scott donated more than $400 million to education- and DEI-focused groups, with several recipients receiving the largest donations in their history.Recently, Garry Tan, CEO of Y Combinator shared an X post writing: ""MacKenzie Scott has given away $26B faster than anyone in history — with no oversight, and no accountability for the chaos that follows. This is not stewardship. Real philanthropy requires real care and attention. Pour sugar on the floor? You get ants."". The post caught the attention of Elon Musk who replied in affirmation. ""Yup,"" he repied endorsing Tan's critique of MacKenzie Scott's $26.4 billion donations since 2019.","Mackenzie Scott, former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has said that her approach to large-scale philanthropy is shaped by acts of kindness.

David Greene: Popular radio show host David Greene claims Google stole his voice; Google responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/popular-radio-show-host-david-greene-claims-google-stole-his-voice-google-responds/articleshow/128414462.cms,"What David Greene says

Google responds to the lawsuit

Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google , alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts. The lawsuit, filed in Santa Clara County alleges that Google cloned Greene’s voice and distinctive broadcasting style without permission or compensation. Greene argues that Google’s NotebookLM T tool voice's rhythm, intonation, and even his characteristic verbal tics are so similar that even his friends, colleagues, and listeners assumed he'd licensed his voice to Google.“So... I’m probably the 148th person to ask this, but did you license your voice to Google? It sounds very much like you!,” a former co-worker asked David Greene in a fall 2024 email, a Washington Post report says.“I was, like, completely freaked out,” Greene told the publication, adding “It’s this eerie moment where you feel like you’re listening to yourself.”Greene said the AI voice sounds very similar to his own, and that the impact goes beyond losing a chance to make money from his best-known asset. “My voice is, like, the most important part of who I am,” Greene reportedly said.In the lawsuit, Greene’s lawyer argues that the recordings make the resemblance clear.“We have faith in the court and encourage people to listen to the example audio themselves,” said Joshua Michelangelo Stein, a partner at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner.Google responded denying the allegations. Google spokesperson José Castañeda told Washington Post: “These allegations are baseless. The sound of the male voice in NotebookLM’s Audio Overviews is based on a paid professional actor Google hired.”The Washington Post reported, “The lawsuit is the latest to pit the rights of individual human creators against the rights of a burgeoning AI industry that promises to transform the economy by enabling the on-demand generation of stunningly lifelike speech, prose, images, and video. Behind the artificial voices found in tools like NotebookLM are language models trained on vast libraries of real-life human text and speech. The humans used to train these models are unaware that their words and voices will be used by AI, raising serious questions about copyright and ownership.”","Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google, alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently drew a comparison between today’s large technology companies and East India Company. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Sridhar Vembu wrote: “Big tech is bigger than most sovereign nations. ""East India Company"" is the way to think about them”. While he did not name any single company in his post, Vembu was responding to a post noting that Google raised $32 billion in debt in a single day—an amount comparable to what a large country like India raises over several months—and issued a 100-year bond, a time horizon longer than many government bonds.“Google raised $32B of debt in 1 day, what a sovereign government like India raises in 100 days. Google also issued a 100-year bond worth $1B, which is longer than India's longest at 40 years. Big tech now operates like sovereign nations with fundraising size and time horizons,” the X post said. It referred to a Google’s recent sale of a rare 100-year bond in British pounds as part of its massive multi-currency debt raise, making it the first tech company to attempt a century bond since IBM did it back in 1996.Sridhar Vembu’s X post has sparked debate online. Commenting on Vembu's post, one user replied “They are the new EIC, but operating on a different plane of existence.The 'Money' layer of control is collapsing, so the elites are shifting to the 'Data' layer. We are moving from a world defined by the Credit Score to one defined by the Algorithm. The EIC wanted spices. Big Tech wants souls (or at least, the predictive data that mimics it)”.Another user commented saying “goes deeper than scale tho. east india company controlled trade routes, big tech controls data routes. running business infra across 3 countries and every cloud pricing change or api deprecation sends you scrambling. the dependency is invisible until the terms change”.“You are wrong Sridhar. Big Tech operates on long-term horizons, while we often trip over ROI. Look at i-flex solutions: it built world-class products like Microbanker and Flexcube that dominated global banking.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive. Anime Paradox February codes let you redeem gems, stat chips, trait rerolls, and more.For players trying to build a decent team without sinking hours into farming, they matter.Below is the list of all working Anime Paradox codes in February 2026.Anime Paradox is a Roblox tower defence game where players summon and command powerful anime-style units to fend off waves of enemies and bosses as they defend a base. It blends classic tower defence mechanics with strategic placement and AI-controlled unit combat, so battles play out automatically once your units are deployed.Anime Paradox is built around summoning and upgrading units.That’s the loop. And like most Roblox games built this way, Gems sit at the centre of everything. It sounds simple, but the cost adds up quickly. Progress slows if you rely only on gameplay rewards. They give players a chance to catch up, try new units, or recover from a bad roll.As of the latest update, several Anime Paradox codes are still active.As per the recent updates, there are no expired Anime Paradox codes; however, this can change at any time.Redeeming codes in Anime Paradox is refreshingly simple.

Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora has said that the job loss due to AI is “overstated”, at least for now. In an interview with Economic Times, Arora said: “I don’t think 80% of the jobs are going anywhere soon”, adding “We need three to five times more technically skilled people globally than we have today. Everything that will get AI-enabled will have to be done by some technologist”. He told the publication that one major requirement for AI to take over a job is that you don’t need human judgment in that job anymore. “That may be true in certain scenarios. AI works well for deterministic problems…say, resolving customer support issues. But real-world jobs involve edge cases,” Nikesh Arora said.Giving an example of autonomous driving, he said that models constantly need retraining for unusual scenarios. “The same applies across industries. You need structured data, edge-case training, and continuous learning systems. That doesn’t happen overnight,” he added.When asked by threat to software as a sector due to the threat of automation by AI, Nikesh Arora said:“There’s a fear that the software industry is under attack from AI — it will make software easier and faster to build, and therefore reduce the need for traditional software spending.That may be true in some subsectors. If your product is purely analytical that can be recreated easily using AI, there could be disruption. If your system of work can be automated by agents, there is risk.”He also dismissed the idea that cybersecurity could be a collateral damage in the AI wave. Instead, he sees AI expanding the demand for protection. “I’m sure half the speeches being made here are written by some sort of LLM helping scriptwriters. But security works differently, because we inspect traffic. LLMs can tell you a file or an address is bad and we can too. Most of our business revolves around inspection software, whether it’s hardware firewalls, software, remote user protection or cloud security. That’s why I don’t believe cybersecurity is under threat from AI. If anything, AI increases complexity... and that increases the need for security,” he said.","Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora says job loss due to AI is ‘overstated’ “I don’t think 80% of the jobs are going anywhere soon,” he said. He also dismissed the idea that cybersecurity could be a collateral damage in the AI wave.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128591050,imgsize-981913,width-400,resizemode-4/nikesh-arora-chairman-and-chief-executive-officer-palo-alto-networks.jpg"

Other famous quotes by Mark Zuckerberg



“The biggest risk is not taking any risk.”

“Move fast and break things.”

“People don’t care about what you say, they care about what you build.”

“The question I ask myself like almost every day is, ‘Am I doing the most important thing I could be doing?’”

In the modern world, science and technology influence almost every aspect of daily life. Researchers and engineers have a big impact on the future, from the drugs we take to the phones we carry around. People have been talking more and more about new ideas, progress, and problems that affect the whole world. People are not only asking what technology can do, but also what it should do. In this case, what important people in the tech industry say gets attention because it is part of a larger conversation about the role of science in society.One of these voices is Mark Zuckerberg . He is the CEO of Meta, the company that owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. He has ideas about new things that go beyond social media. He has said that scientists, researchers, and engineers should be seen as important members of society. He said in a public statement that society needs more heroes in these fields: people who work to make the world a better place, cure diseases, and make life better for everyone.This quote shows how the way we celebrate accomplishments has changed. People who work behind the scenes in labs and research centers don't get as much attention as athletes, artists, and entertainers.Zuckerberg's comment shows how important it is to celebrate progress in science and engineering, especially now that the world is dealing with issues like pandemics, climate change, and new technologies.Zuckerberg's message about paying people who help with science and engineering is part of a larger discussion about how much people value knowledge work, research funding, and education. The quote means that modern heroes aren't just famous people or characters from movies. They're also researchers and engineers who work quietly to solve real problems.“Our society needs more heroes who are scientists, researchers, and engineers. We need to celebrate and reward the people who cure diseases, expand our understanding of humanity and work to improve people’s lives.”In this quote, Mark Zuckerberg points to the increasing importance of scientific and technological progress in improving human life. His words reflect the belief that people who work in laboratories, research institutions, and development centres deserve recognition similar to that given to traditional public heroes. The quote makes it clear that the public should give thanks and praise to people who come up with new ideas that help people, cure diseases, and make life better.Zuckerberg's message says that we need to learn, do a lot of research, and work hard to solve the problems we face today. Scientists and engineers do things that really change people's lives, like making a vaccine, coming up with a way to make energy last longer, or making technology that lets people talk to each other all over the world.Zuckerberg's quote talks about people who make the world a better place by sharing what they know, asking questions, and coming up with answers. People often look up to famous people in sports and entertainment, but the work of scientists and engineers has a bigger and longer-lasting impact on people's lives. It's important to notice this change in society's values because the world has problems that need to be fixed with facts, knowledge from many areas, and hard work over time.According to Zuckerberg's quote, honoring scientists and researchers has effects in the real world. More recognition can help people support research funding, inspire future generations, and show respect for people who know a lot about a subject. People who value science and engineering can make places where new ideas can grow and where people are proud of their jobs that help the community as a whole.Mark Zuckerberg’s quote can be applied in everyday life in several ways:Mark Zuckerberg has shared several insights on innovation, leadership, and the role of technology. Some notable quotes include:","Zuckerberg said that scientists, researchers, and engineers should be seen as important members of society. He said that society needs more heroes in these fields: people who work to make the world a better place, cure diseases, and make life better for everyone.

After low sales Elon Musk’s Tesla is giving its cars a Grok 'update' in Europe amid investigations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-tesla-is-giving-its-cars-grok-update-in-europe-to-boost-sales-as-chatbot-faces-investigations/articleshow/128571530.cms,"“

@Grok is coming to Teslas in Europe It can answer almost any question using real-time information & also add/edit navigation destinations to become your personal guide Initially rolling out in – UK – Ireland – Germany – Switzerland – Austria – Italy – France – Portugal – Spain More to come.”

How Tesla’s sales took a hit in Europe

What Tesla users have said about Grok in their cars

""distraction layer""

""Research shows that even in hands-free mode, you are more distracted when you are talking on the phone and driving. Adding Grok introduces more stimuli,”

“We do not yet understand the information needs of drivers, how well Grok or other chatbots fulfil those needs compared to other options and whether chatbots may change driving behaviour and exactly how,”

Tesla Europe has announced plans to integrate xAI's Grok chatbot into vehicle infotainment systems across the UK and eight other European markets. This comes as the company looks to revive decreasing sales in the region, even as Grok faces active regulatory scrutiny in Europe. The move comes despite a series of controversies surrounding Grok. The chatbot has allegedly enabled users to generate and share non-consensual deepfake explicit images of real people, including material depicting child sexual abuse. Last year, it generated and spread antisemitic hate speech across X and drew praise for Adolf Hitler, prompting earlier investigations by the European Commission.In a post shared on the microblogging site X (formerly Twitter), the company wrote:According to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, Tesla's sales of electric vehicles in Europe decreased by 27% in 2025, despite the fact that battery electric vehicles continued to gain traction in the larger European market. That year, BEVs made up 17.4% of the European market, but China's BYD overtook Tesla in market share thanks to more inventive and reasonably priced models.According to a CNBC report, Brand Finance said Tesla's slide was compounded by a consumer backlash against Musk's political rhetoric and his endorsements of anti-immigrant figures, including Tommy Robinson in the UK and Germany's AfD party.The company also lacked affordable new models throughout the year.Tesla is not alone in adding chatbot features to its vehicles; Volvo has announced plans to integrate a Google Gemini-based conversational AI assistant into its EX60 electric vehicles, the CNBC report noted.The Grok integration carries financial significance beyond the product itself. During a fourth-quarter earnings update, Tesla disclosed it had invested $2 billion into Musk's xAI.SpaceX subsequently acquired xAI in an all-stock transaction that valued the combined entity at $1.25 trillion. Before those deals, xAI had merged with social network X, and Grok had already attracted regulatory scrutiny across Asia, Australia and Europe, including investigations by authorities in Ireland, the UK, France and the European Commission.A Tesla owner in Canada raised concerns about Grok's safety after it was added to her vehicle. As CBC reported, her son used Grok to generate comments about soccer athletes, and the chatbot eventually asked the minor to send nudes. Tesla and xAI have not addressed whether they can restrict minors' access to Grok in Tesla vehicles or moderate its outputs to be appropriate for younger users by default.Safety concerns extend beyond content moderation. Mike Nelson, a partner at Nelson Law and an automotive safety researcher, said that while he has enjoyed using Grok in his own Tesla Model Y in the US, adding chatbot technology to vehicle infotainment systems introduces a newfor drivers.he added.Rayid Ghani, a professor of machine learning and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, told CNBC that researchers, regulators and insurance companies should move quickly to conduct ""practical evaluations"" of chatbots in vehicles.he said, without benchmarking and industry standards.","Tesla Europe has announced plans to integrate xAI's Grok chatbot into vehicle infotainment systems across the UK and eight other European markets.

"After Disney and Paramount, Netflix sends legal notice to Bytedance: Read full cease-and-desist letter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-disney-and-paramount-netflix-sends-legal-notice-to-bytedance-read-full-cease-and-desist-letter/articleshow/128570758.cms,"Netflix.

Read Netflix’s full letter to TikTok-parent Bytedance:

Re: CEASE AND DESIST — Willful Infringement of Netflix's Intellectual Property by Seedance 2.0

Dear Mr. Rogovin,

I am in-house counsel for Netflix, a global entertainment service that owns and distributes much-loved movies and TV series. We have learned that ByteDance's recently launched audio-video generative AI model, Seedance 2.0 (""Seedance""), is engaging in the pervasive and willful unauthorized reproduction of Netflix's valuable intellectual property.

The Infringement: Evidence of High-Fidelity Regurgitation

Seedance acts as a high-speed piracy engine, generating mass quantities of unauthorized derivative works utilizing Netflix's iconic characters, worlds, and scripted narratives.

Current forensic evidence indicates that Seedance is being used to generate unauthorized derivative works including, but not limited to:

● Bridgerton: Unauthorized depictions of Season 4 content, specifically featuring characters in a masquerade ball setting. These outputs mirror specific, narratively important costumes like Sophie Baek's ""Lady in Silver"" gown. ByteDance has even promoted this content using #Bridgerton tags via its own official social media channels, such as @BytePlusGlobal.

● Stranger Things: High-fidelity reboots of the series finale, which feature detailed reproductions of the iconic cast as well as the monsters from the series, including Demogorgons and the Mindflayer.

● Squid Game: Seedance has generated recreations of the ""Red Light, Green Light"" sets and the iconic Young-hee doll. These include unauthorized crossovers, such as inserting real-world figures like Elon Musk into the Squid Game environment.

● KPop Demon Hunters: Seedance has reproduced the specific visual style and character designs from our animated musical feature, including the lead character Rumi.

Netflix has never authorized ByteDance to use our content to generate these images or videos. ByteDance's activities are willful, and constitute direct and secondary

copyright infringement

. The use of copyrighted works to create a competing commercial product, especially one that regurgitates the original, is not protected by fair use.

Immediate Demands

To avoid immediate litigation, Netflix demands that ByteDance:

1. Cease Generative Output: Immediately implement technological guardrails to prevent Seedance from generating any content that resembles Netflix's protected characters, titles, or settings.

2. Remove Infringing Content: Remove all unlawfully obtained Netflix-owned content from training datasets, and also scrub all existing Seedance-generated videos featuring Netflix IP from all ByteDance-controlled platforms.

3. Identify All Infringements: Provide an accounting of all instances where Seedance has generated content based on prompts related to Netflix's IP.

4. Revoke Third-Party Access: Revoke access for any commercial partners or API users currently utilizing Seedance to generate unauthorized Netflix derivative works.

Netflix will not stand by and watch ByteDance treat our valued IP as free, public domain clip art.

We await your response within three (3) business days. All rights and remedies are reserved.

Regards,

Mindy LeMoine

Director, Litigation

""Using deceptive business practices seems to be a clever way of tackling this problem, but I am hard-pressed to see any scenario [where] any order by a Texas court would be respected in China,""

""Security representations are increasingly being evaluated as consumer protection and disclosure issues, not merely technical ones — a shift already visible in FTC enforcement actions and SEC disclosure mandates and now extending into state-level litigation.

What TP-Link said about the Texas lawsuit



""without merit and will be proven false,""

“We will continue to vigorously defend our reputation as a trusted provider of secure connectivity for American families,”

Texas has sued networking equipment company TP-Link Systems, accusing it of allowing the Chinese Communist Party to hack into consumers' devices while marketing its products as secure and private. Attorney General Ken Paxton announced the lawsuit this week, describing it as the first in a series of actions to be filed this week against companies with ties to the CCP.In a press release seen by The Record, Paxton’s office wrote,Paxton alleged that TP-Link markets its products as secure and privacy-protective, while Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups have used them to mount cyberattacks against the US. His office cited a May 2023 report by Check Point Research alleging that Camaro Dragon, a Chinese state-sponsored hacking entity, ran campaigns exploiting vulnerabilities in TP-Link firmware.Security consultant John Bambenek told Recorded Future News that the US intelligence community has raised similar concerns about TP-Link devices potentially enabling Chinese government espionage.However, he was skeptical that the lawsuit would have a meaningful impact.Bambenek said.Nakul Goenka, a risk officer at the security company ColorTokens, framed the lawsuit as part of a shift in how cybersecurity is regulated.Goenka noted.In December 2025, Paxton sued Chinese television manufacturers Hisense and TCL, alleging that their devices capture what consumers watch in real time and could be allowing that data to be harvested by China.A TP-Link spokesperson called the lawsuitand added the company is an independent American company with core operations and infrastructure located entirely within the United States.

Senior staff are calling the tools ""broken slop generators""

CEO Julie Sweet had already warned: Adapt to AI or leave

Accenture has started tying promotion eligibility to AI tool usage, telling senior managers and associate directors that advancing to leadership roles will require demonstrating ""regular adoption"" of its artificial intelligence platforms. The move follows CEO Julie Sweet's earlier warning that employees unable to adapt to AI would be ""exited"" from the company — and it appears HR is now putting that stance into formal practice. The consulting giant has also begun tracking individual weekly logins to its AI tools for some senior staff, making it one of the more aggressive internal AI mandates seen at a major professional services firm.According to an internal email seen by the Financial Times, ""use of our key tools will be a visible input to talent discussions."" The policy is set to factor into the company's summer promotion decisions, with Accenture's AI Refinery among the tools being monitored.The reaction internally has been less than enthusiastic. Two people familiar with the changes told the FT they considered some of the tools to be ""broken slop generators,"" and one said they would ""quit immediately"" if the rule directly affected them. Staff in 12 European countries and those working on US federal government contracts are exempt from the new policy.The pushback isn't entirely surprising. Executives at three Big Four firms independently told the FT that getting senior managers and partners to adopt AI has proven far harder than with junior staff. Older, more senior professionals tend to be less comfortable with new technology and more attached to how they've always worked.Sweet has made the company's position clear. She previously told investors that Accenture would ""exit"" employees for whom reskilling on AI wasn't a viable path—and the latest promotion criteria appear to be the formal follow-through on that stance.The firm says it has trained 550,000 of its roughly 780,000 employees in generative AI and spends around $1 billion annually on learning and development. It also recently announced partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic.Still, the urgency makes sense given the context. Accenture's share price has dropped roughly 42% over the past year, and the company is betting heavily that its AI-first repositioning—including rebranding its workforce as ""reinventors""—will reverse that slide.","Accenture is tying senior staff promotions to AI tool usage.

Why OpenClaw developer Peter Steinberger chose OpenAI over Meta

""the major labs""

""eccentric, but brilliant.""

""the biggest Codex advertisement show that's unpaid"",

""live in a foundation,""

""build an agent that even my mum can use,""

“We expect this will quickly become core to our product offerings,”

“The more I talked with the people there, the clearer it became that we both share the same vision.”

OpenClaw library maintainer Peter Steinberger has recently announced that he has joined the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, OpenAI . Steinberger has explained that he decided to accept an offer from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over another offer from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . He has decided to join OpenAI despite the fact that the other offer was reportedly more lucrative. The OpenClaw developer has explained that his decision was not influenced by financial considerations but by his alignment with the product vision and the overall goal of developing accessible AI agents.Earlier this week, Altman announced that Steinberger and his OpenClaw project would join OpenAI andOpenClaw, an autonomous system that enables users to build agents capable of controlling desktop and personal applications, is expected to become integrated into OpenAI’s broader product roadmap. Altman said,Speaking on the Lex Fridman podcast, Steinberger said that after his recent meeting within San Francisco, he had two serious offers on the table: one from Meta and another from OpenAI. However, he chose OpenAI, and his reasoning reveals as much about his values as it does about the two companies.His first call with Mark Zuckerberg turned into a 10-minute debate about Claude Code versus Codex. Zuckerberg reportedly called himMeta brought technical muscle to the table, with Steinberger hinting at Cerebras-level inference speeds under NDA. Yet none of that proved decisive.Steinberger said that three things shaped his choice. First, Steinberger is a committed Codex believer, as he called himselfand joining OpenAI meant doubling down on that bet.Secondly, OpenAI said it is committed to keeping OpenClaw open source. Altman explicitly said it woulda guarantee Meta's offer apparently did not include.Thirdly and perhaps most importantly, OpenAI was a better fit for OpenClaw’s mission. Steinberger said that his goal is toand OpenAI's reach through ChatGPT offered a path to that at scale.However, he noted that money was not part of the calculation.he said on the Lex Fridman podcast.On his blog, Steinberger wrote,Having already exited PSPDFKit for over $100 million, spent three years away from the industry, and worked through 43 side projects, Steinberger returned to building because the craft itself drives him, not the outcome, he noted.Regarding OpenAI’s plans for OpenClaw, Altman said,indicating a defined product direction rather than an exploratory effort.Reflecting on his decision, Steinberger wrote on his blog,","OpenClaw developer Peter Steinberger has joined the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, OpenAI.

Azure gave Shriram the muscle to scale fast

From branch queues to loan approvals on the road

Shriram Finance has built a cloud-native financial super app on Microsoft Azure—and 63% of its users come from small towns and rural India.Called Shriram One, the app consolidates lending, deposits, insurance, and payments into a single interface. Since launching, it has crossed 20 million downloads, with fixed deposit volumes growing more than three-fold—from Rs 80 crore to nearly Rs 300 crore—in just two years.The partnership with Microsoft goes beyond cloud hosting. Security and compliance are handled through Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel, while AI and machine learning models embedded in the platform have helped lift deposit balances by nearly 30%.For Shriram's tech team, the choice wasn't complicated. ""We were already predominantly in a Microsoft environment, so Azure was a practical fit for how we needed to scale,"" says Gayadhar Behera, Chief Technology Officer at Shriram Finance.The infrastructure allows Shriram to manage workloads across multiple financial products in near real time—updating features and monitoring risk without disrupting customer experience.The app supports seven Indian languages, a decision that has been central to adoption beyond metro cities.The real-world impact shows up in the users themselves. Shivjot Singh, a long-haul truck driver from Punjab, got a Rs 5 lakh commercial vehicle loan approved within a week—entirely through the app, without stepping into a branch.""Every day off the road is lost income,"" he says.As India's financial inclusion story shifts from account access to actual engagement, Microsoft's infrastructure sits at the centre of that transition—quietly keeping the plumbing running for millions of first-time digital borrowers.","Shriram Finance has built a cloud-native financial super app on Microsoft Azure. 63% of its users come from small towns and rural India.

Why Europe keeps losing its best tech talent to Silicon Valley

OpenClaw stays open-source as its creator moves on to bigger ambitions

Peter Steinberger, the Austrian developer behind viral AI agent platform OpenClaw, is heading to San Francisco after being personally recruited by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman—and he's not leaving quietly.In a candid post on X, Steinberger laid out exactly why he chose to cross the Atlantic. ""In the USA, most people are enthusiastic,"" he wrote. ""In Europe, I get insulted, people scream REGULATION and RESPONSIBILITY."" He added that building a company in Europe means wrestling with investment protection laws, employee co-determination rules, and what he called ""paralyzing labor regulations."" At OpenAI, most employees work six to seven days a week and are compensated for it. In much of Europe, that's simply illegal.Steinberger, who previously split his time between London and Vienna, isn't the first European founder to make this argument—but few have made it this bluntly, right as they walk out the door. The timing stings. OpenClaw went viral for letting AI agents autonomously manage calendars, book flights, and even populate Moltbook, a social platform built exclusively for AI bots.Altman called Steinberger ""a genius"" on X and said he would help build ""the next generation of personal agents"" at OpenAI—a space Altman described as one that will ""quickly"" become core to what the company offers.Rather than monetise OpenClaw or fold it into OpenAI, Steinberger is transitioning it into a foundation to keep the code open source. His stated goal is more ambitious than building a startup: he wants to create an AI agent that, as he put it, ""even my mum can use.""Europe's struggles aren't news. A 2024 EU report flagged the region's widening innovation gap with the US, but by end of 2025, little had changed. Steinberger had hoped EU INC—a push for a unified corporate framework across the bloc—might help. He now says it's ""fizzling out,"" undone by what he calls ""egoistic national interest.""","Austrian AI developer Peter Steinberger is moving to OpenAI in San Francisco.

‘AI agents to replace professional services’



One of America’s top financial regulators has sounded an alarm even as the world’s tech giants are celebrating record-breaking AI breakthroughs. Michael S. Barr, governor of the Federal Reserve, issued a warning about the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) technology to create a “jobless boom”. He said that AI may help in the rapid growth of economy, but a significant portion of the population may find themselves “essentially unemployable” as AI agents and robots take over everything from office work to transportation.“We should be clear-eyed about how painful these changes could be for affected workers and how challenging it would be for the government and the private sector to successfully manage the fallout,” Barr said, as per a report in Fortune. Speaking before the New York Association for Business Economics on Tuesday (February 17), Barr outlined three possible ways AI could reshape our world.Barr described a future where AI agents replace a wide range of professional and service occupations, while robotics automate manufacturing and transportation.“Layoffs soar, leading to widespread unemployment in the short run and declines in labor force participation over time, as a large share of the population is essentially unemployable,” Barr said.He added that such a future would require a complete rethinking of workforce development.He says that similar to the invention of the light bulb or the internet, AI will slowly become the part of life. Some jobs are lost, but new industries are created, and wages eventually go up. He cautioned that early warning signs are already visible as early-career workers in AI-related fields, such as software development, are already seeing declines in employment relative to other sectors.“For these workers, the short run may have long-term consequences,” Barr said.Third is the Stalled Boom – a “dot-com” style crash where energy shortages or a lack of data cause the AI industry to bust, which may lead to financial stress. As per Barr, the private and public sectors are ill-equipped to handle the potential speed of the transition.He warned that the “historical record on meaningful efforts to help workers in such a transition is not encouraging.”“Society will need to be nimble and bold to reduce the pain of short-term dislocations. Widespread AI adoption will very likely lead to dramatic and sometimes difficult changes in the way many of us work and live,” Barr said.","Michael S.

“There has to be some element of international cooperation, or maybe at least minimum standards around how these technologies should be deployed,”

What Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis said about AGI at the India AI Impact Summit

""I don't think we are there yet.”

""superintelligent tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own and, in turn, massively increase abundance and prosperity.""

""What you'd like is for those systems to continually learn online from experience, to learn from the context they're in, maybe personalise to the situation and the tasks that you have for them,""

""They can plan over the short term, but over the longer term, the way that we can plan over years, they don't really have that capability at the moment,”

""Today's systems can get gold medals in the international Math Olympiad, really hard problems, but sometimes can still make mistakes on elementary maths if you pose the question in a certain way. A true general intelligence system shouldn't have that kind of jaggedness,”

He cited three key limitations in current AI systems and said,His remarks stand in contrast to OpenAI's long-stated ambition of achieving AGI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has argued thatHassabis identified the first gap as the absence of continual learning.

Family often narrows first

Work becomes identity

Health declines slowly before it demands notice

Friends fade without conflict

Rotating priorities replaces balance

An old productivity idea has resurfaced online and is now being framed through the lives of tech billionaires. Known as the Four Burner Theory, it imagines life as a stove with four flames representing family, work, health and friends. The claim is simple. You cannot keep all four burning at full strength at the same time. A recent viral X thread argues that extreme success often comes from turning one or even two burners off. It references high-profile figures in technology to make its point, suggesting that professional dominance may carry a personal cost. The discussion has spread across social media, drawing attention to how ambition, balance and sacrifice are understood in a culture shaped by visibility and performance.The Four Burner Theory suggests that to succeed, something has to give. To become highly successful, more than one area of life may need to be reduced. It is not presented as scientific law. It reads more like a framework people recognise in hindsight. Work expands. Time does not. Energy narrows under pressure.The thread that reignited interest in the theory claims it explains why certain tech billionaires appear professionally unstoppable yet personally complicated. It names figures such as Elon Musk Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg to illustrate the idea. The framing is blunt. Achievement at scale may come with trade-offs.The post says, “It destroyed Elon Musk's first marriage. It explains why Bezos is jacked but divorced. And why Zuckerberg has no real friends.”Consider your life like a stove with four burners:Family, in the Four Burner Theory, stands for connection and presence. It covers marriage, children, shared time, and ordinary evenings. The thread argues that this part of life does not scale with ambition. You cannot automate a conversation with your partner. You cannot outsource showing up to a school event.For high achievers, the shift can be gradual. Work expands by an hour, then another. Travel increases. Messages go unanswered. Nothing dramatic happens at first. The reduction is quiet. Over time, the gap grows wider than expected.Work is usually the most difficult burden to lower. It brings income, recognition and structure. In modern hustle culture, especially around start-ups and tech, work is often framed as purpose itself.When work is kept on full flame, it consumes attention. The theory suggests this is rarely a conscious decision. It feels necessary. Deadlines, targets, competition. Yet the more space work takes, the less room remains for the other burners. The imbalance may not be visible immediately, but it settles in.Health tends to give warnings in small ways. Less sleep. Skipped exercise. Meals replaced by caffeine and convenience. None of it appears urgent in the moment.The thread describes health as the burner that whispers before it screams. You can ignore it for a while. Productivity may even hold steady. Then the cost becomes harder to dismiss. Fatigue builds. Stress shows up physically. At that point, recovery requires more effort than maintenance ever did.Friendship is often the quietest casualty. There is rarely a clear break. Instead, calls become less frequent. Plans are postponed. Distance grows through routine.Social media can create the impression of connection. Messages are exchanged. Posts are liked. But offline contact has reduced. The theory suggests that friendships need time that feels unproductive by career standards. When that time disappears, so does depth.None of these burners fail at once. They dim at different speeds. The point, as framed in the thread, is not blame. It is recognition.The thread ends with a softer suggestion. If all four burners cannot stay high, they can be rotated. Different seasons allow different emphasis. Health can be rebuilt. Work can slow. Friendships can be renewed. The key argument is awareness. Choosing which area receives energy, rather than drifting into imbalance. The Four Burner Theory does not promise harmony. It offers a way of naming trade-offs that many already sense. In a culture watching tech billionaires closely, the metaphor has found fresh ground.","The Four Burner Theory reframes success as sacrifice.

Bridging the Access Gap

The Power of the Second Opinion

How Oncovault Works

Treating Advanced Cases



Trust and Long-Term Vision

“You have three months. Live with love, care, and family.” That’s what Gaurav Kumar was told at a leading hospital in Mumbai, where he visited with his mother’s medical reports in 2023. She survived for two years. “That doctor didn’t say anything else. My mother had Stage IV gallbladder cancer. I was numb,” Kumar, 28, told. “I came back to Delhi, consulted another doctor who helped streamline the treatment, and it helped.”This personal tragedy sparked a professional mission. Seeking to bridge a massive gap in Indian healthcare, Kumar and his engineering batchmate, Shubham Shreyas, co-founded Oncovault under their startup, BigOHealth. The AI-powered app is designed to help patients navigate the complex journey of cancer treatment.Kumar points to a stark disparity in Indian oncology: while the country accounts for 18% of global cancer cases, only 2% of patients participate in clinical trials. “In tier 2, tier 3 towns, people don’t have access to specialised healthcare. I have come across at least three cases in which the treatment was flawed,” Kumar explained.By allowing patients in small towns to upload medical reports and connect with specialists via phone, Oncovault brings expert advice to underserved regions.Kumar’s own experience at a Delhi hospital underscored the inconsistencies in medical advice. While one doctor dismissed surgery as an option, another at the same hospital recommended it. “Families panic when they are told about cancer. Their anxiety makes them blind to make a conscious choice,” Kumar noted. “When I was given three months, I had panicked too, but a second opinion helped me.”Cancer treatment frequently generates a paper trail exceeding 1,000 pages. Oncovault leverages AI to process this data into actionable insights. Kumar explains, “AI ensures only legitimate documents and medical images are uploaded, the platform analyses patient data to find the most compatible oncologists, AI generates a summary of the case history, saving doctors vital time during consultations.” Doctors always have the option to review the source data if they wish to verify the AI-generated summary, he added.In Stage III or IV cases, where cancer has impacted multiple organs, a single perspective doesn’t help. “You need a medical oncologist, a surgical oncologist, a radiation oncologist, a palliative care specialist, etc. This is where we come into the picture,” Kumar said. “Oncovault’s medical board assembles these various specialists to collaborate and suggest the most accurate course of treatment.”Kumar claims the AI model has been rigorously tested using consented data from thousands of patients via partner hospitals. Beyond individual care, Kumar hopes to provide govt with high-level medical data to improve public health strategy. “With 70% to 80% of cancer cases currently diagnosed at advanced stages (III and IV), our goal is to analyse this data to provide govt with actionable insights. We aim to identify specific cancer trends based on regional geography, gender, and age demographics,” he said.The impact of this work is best reflected in personal victories. Last year, Kumar and his partner spent days at a Delhi hospital helping a teenage patient whose family had been told to arrange an air ambulance to go back home. By connecting her to the right specialists, her health improved. “The girl is doing fine now. Our birthdays fall around the same time, so we celebrated them together,” Kumar said with a smile.","Gaurav Kumar and his engineering batchmate, Shubham Shreyas, co-founded Oncovault under their startup, BigOHealth.

How AI is making tech shopping smarter in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-ai-is-making-tech-shopping-smarter-in-india/articleshow/128554131.cms,"What's changing?



What this means for the brands?



Looking ahead



By Zeba Khan – Director - Consumer Electronics , Amazon India

Indian consumers are using AI to make better decisions—transforming how they shopOn tennis courts, I often watch players obsess over their smart wearables, analyzing every swing angle, footwork pattern and shot trajectory. Some get sharper. Others get lost in the data and metrics when they should be practicing their serves. The difference? One group uses technology to amplify its judgment, while the other lets it replace their judgment entirely. This conflict between human instinct and machine intelligence is not just playing out on tennis-courts, but it is defining a new era of consumer technology.Over the last few years, Artificial Intelligence has evolved from being a buzzword over to dominating technology conversations. The recent CES 2026 shows how far we have come. AI is now integral across categories, from televisions and laptops to home appliances, with every iteration, unlocking capabilities that genuinely enhance everyday experiences.In India, this evolution has taken an interesting shape. Indian buyers have always been thoughtful and thorough in their research when making purchase decisions. AI is now becoming their research partner - helping them cut through complexities, surface relevant choices and validate their decisions with confidence.Consider how consumers navigate electronics purchases today. A family in Pune researching televisions no longer drowns in technical specifications or sits through the tiresome sales pitches. Instead, they answer simple questions on an app, like - How big is their room? What do you primarily watch? How bright is the space? AI processes these inputs instantly—filtering thousands of options down to models that match their needs. What would have taken days, if not weeks, now happens in minutes and with much greater accuracy. Or take the working professional based out of Jaipur, upgrading her laptop. She describes her use cases —video editing, client presentations, frequent travel etc. The AI doesn't just match specifications, but also understands the context. It recommends laptops that are optimized for creative workloads with excellent battery life, reasonable weight and highlights trade-offs transparently. Visual search is another breakthrough. Spot a television setup at a friend's home? Photograph it. AI identifies the model, finds similar options, compares prices and shows what others typically purchase alongside it.A more confident buyer is emerging. Premium technology adoption is accelerating beyond metros—in cities like Coimbatore, Vizag and Indore. What is enabling this isn't just aspiration. It's access to reliable delivery, installation support, flexible payments and critically, to AI-powered research tools that speak to customers in their own language—making complex purchases manageable.Customers are now comparing specifications rather than blindly drifting to brand names. The willingness to invest in quality has been there for some years now. Today, it is paired with caution. Dumping specs and features just for the sake of it doesn’t work anymore. By reducing uncertainty, AI is helping India's naturally diligent shoppers invest more confidently in premium technology.Perhaps the most powerful shift is how AI now interprets customer feedback. Instead of shoppers having to scroll through hundreds of reviews, they can now view a clear, consolidated insight gathered from thousands of real user experiences. Consider something as familiar as a pair of headphones. Across several reviews, customers might most often praise sound quality, build quality and noise cancellation, with battery life and comfort following closely, while criticizing Bluetooth connectivity and a lack of seamlessness when it comes to multi-device use. Or the views on value for money proposition vary, reflecting different expectations at different price points. Presented this way, reviews don’t feel like noise. They become guidance—helping customers understand strengths, limitations and real-world performance before making a decision.For brands, the tennis analogy holds. They face the same choice: what to focus on and whether AI sharpens their judgment or becomes a distraction.This creates opportunity for brands to understand their customers better. When AI helps customers articulate their actual needs—'Which TV works best for cricket in bright rooms?’—it connects the right products to the right buyers faster. Brands that design for real use cases benefit immediately. A television optimized for Indian living rooms with excellent daytime viewing gets discovered by families who need exactly that. The match happens faster, with higher satisfaction. Customer feedback is also now more actionable. Instead of scanning through multiple reviews, the product teams can see clear patterns: which features resonate, where products excel, what buyers in different cities prioritize. This can create better product development cycles. The brands that win, will be the ones who are able to understand their customers better and build products that solve real problems—because AI helps those products find their audience efficiently.AI won't just help customers find products—it will anticipate needs with better precision, clarify trade-offs and validate choices through real experiences. What took seasoned shoppers years to develop—the ability to cut through claims, compare meaningfully and spot value—is now available to anyone with a smartphone.Indian consumers aren't asking whether to trust AI – they have already embraced it. As AI reshapes how we discover, compare and decide, the information advantage that once belonged to a select few is disappearing. The future isn't AI making choices for us; it's AI empowering thoughtful humans to choose better for themselves. For a market that has always valued informed decisions, better shopping will be about using smarter tools with intent.","Indian consumers are using AI to make better decisions—transforming how they shop.

The India AI Impact Summit 2026 brought together leaders of the technology industry, including CEOs such as Google CEO Sundar Pichai , OpenAI's Sam Altman , Anthropic's Dario Amodei, Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen, Meta Chief AI scientist Alexandr Wang, K Krithivasan, Tata Consultancy Services, Salil Parekh and others, at Bharat Mandapam for a high-level Opening Ceremony, setting the stage for discussions on responsible AI innovation, scientific advancement and international collaboration. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the event which called for shaping the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) through cooperative global effort and ethical development.The list of leaders also included Yann LeCun, former Meta chief AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, and Yoshua Bengio, one of the godfathers of AI. The following attended the opening ceremony:All were present at Bharat Mandapam for the first major global AI summit to be hosted in the Global South, where $100 billion in investment commitments are on the table. Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with these leaders, and addressed the main plenary on February 19. The five-day summit is organised around three pillars – People, Planet, and Progress – and will run across multiple venues in the national capital, including Bharat Mandapam and Sushma Swaraj Bhawan.Artificial intelligence marks a transformative chapter in human history. India is not just a part of the AI revolution, but is leading and shaping it.Some people have doubts about new technology. But the way the younger generation is embracing AI is unprecedented.There has also been tremendous enthusiasm here regarding the AI Summit exhibition. In the course of human history, there have been certain turning points that shaped entire centuries. These turning points set the direction of civilisation and transform the pace of development. Artificial intelligence is one such transformation in history.A few tech leaders praised the event, while others committed billions of dollars for AI infrastructure and skilling of Indian youth. Here’s what key tech leaders said on India AI Impact Summit 2026:Addressing the India AI Action Summit today was a profound personal honor. AI can improve billions of lives and solve some of the hardest problems in science. The best outcomes of AI are not guaranteed. We must pursue AI boldly, approach it responsibly, and work together through this moment.Google is establishing a full-stack AI hub, part of our $15 billion infrastructure investment in India.It is amazing to be here, obviously the work happening in India and the adoption of AI is leading the world, and I can't wait to see what goes next. This will be one of the biggest markets for AI in the world, and I think India will have a huge amount of influence... It (AI) will definitely impact the job market, but we always find new things to do, and I have no doubt we will find lots of better ones this time.It is a huge honour to be here today with so many of my esteemed colleagues from industry, academia and government and congratulations to Prime Minister Modi and the Indian government on convening such an impressive summit at this very pivotal moment for AI. It is fantastic to see how the summit has evolved over the years with the first meeting convened by former Prime Minister Sunak. It is becoming an incredibly important convening point for international dialogue and hopefully cooperation over the future of AI.He emphasised that such gatherings have moved beyond optional discussions to becoming essential for the safe and collaborative development of the technology.Given the number of people who use AI in India will be greater than, I think, anywhere in the world over a few years, I think the leadership that India can play, not just in what these models mean, how do you think about data, how do you think about privacy and security and trust. I want every piece of information that's produced to have the provenance and the watermark so that people can actually know what is real and what's fake.Adobe is expanding the opportunity for creativity for millions of students across India, empowering them with AI skills, further accelerating Prime Minister Modi’s vision. I look forward to seeing what the students of India create with Adobe's industry-leading tools, and in doing so accelerating Viksit Bharat.My fundamental view is that AI has been on an exponential for the la for the last 10 years um and as part of a sort of Moors law for intelligence and that we are now well advanced on that curve and there are only a small number of years for AI models surpassing the cognitive capabilities of most humans for most things. We're increasingly close to what I've called a country of geniuses in a data center. a set of AI agents that are more capable than most humans at most things and can coordinate at superhuman speed.India is the world's largest democracy. We need to think about how democracies handle AI and how we confront other countries that are authoritarian. Another risk I talk about is making sure that AI systems are safe and predictable and autonomously behave in a way that’s under our control.If you want to make technology that serves society, Meta has an incredible opportunity to get this technology into people’s lives. Across India, creators use our AI to automatically translate their Reels into the language of the person watching. Small businesses talk to customers through WhatsApp business agents they created in 10 minutes on their phones, and use our Gen AI tools to create ads and reach customers way more efficiently than they could before. And, India has world class developers building genius things to solve big societal challenges.We’re releasing new models this year, with the first coming in the next couple of months. These will be deeply integrated with our products in a way we’re really excited about. We’re optimistic about the trajectory we’re on. The first models will be good, and as the year goes on I think we’re going to be pushing the frontier. Our vision is personal superintelligence – AI that knows you, your goals, your interests, and helps you with whatever you’re focused on doing. It serves you, whoever you are, wherever you are.It's about collaboration between the public and private sectors – to deliver these four building blocks, and to design and deploy AI that works for your citizens and your economies. I don't want these amazing technologies to be one-size-fits-all. I want them to serve your needs – designed for the challenges and opportunities that are unique to India, to societies across the global south, and all over the world. I want them to serve you as an individual. No matter who you are, where you live, what language you speak, or what culture you’re a part of.I think this event is hugely important. The world has come to India so that we can think together about what we can do to bring AI to more of the world, especially the global south. And we have more work to do. I think it's going to require investments, partnerships by tech companies, by other private capital, by governments. And we have to keep investing in skilling, and that's a big part of what we're doing at Microsoft this week. We unveiled our progress, we're on a pace to invest $50 billion before the end of the decade to bring AI to the global South, both infrastructure and through skilling. And then we have to make sure that AI works for people. We all know that technology will get better each and every year. The real question is, can we work together to make sure the technology serves people better every year. That, I think is the ultimate quest on which we should all join together.The AI Summit has been a great recognition of the importance of countries coming together, private sector and the public sector, and it's really been a great testimony to the importance of India as well. One of the themes of the Summit has been the importance of inclusive growth and inclusive AI, and I think the fact that there are so many people here from around the world tells you that leaders are committed to this.Today, on behalf of the Reliance Group and Jio Intelligence, I want to make three announcements. Announcement one, Jio connected India to the internet era. Jio will now connect India to the intelligence era. We will deliver intelligence to every citizen, every sector of the economy, and every facet of social development and every service of government. Jio will do so with the same reliability, quality, scale, and extreme affordability that transformed connectivity. India cannot afford to rent intelligence. Therefore, we will reduce the cost of intelligence as dramatically as we did the cost of data... Announcement 2, Jio, together with Reliance, will invest 10 lakh crores over the next seven years, starting this year... Announcement 3, Jio Intelligence will build India's sovereign compute infrastructure through three bold initiatives. One, gigawatt-scale data centres. We already started construction on multi-gigawatt AI-ready data centres at Jamnagar. Over 120 megawatts will come online in the second half of 2026 this year and a clear path to gigawatt-scale compute for training and large scale inference. Two, our green energy advantage. We have an in-house energy advantage with up to 10 gigawatts of ready green power surplus anchored by solar in both Kutch and Andhra Pradesh. Three, a nationwide edge compute, an edge compute layer deeply integrated with Jio's network will make intelligence responsive, low latency, and affordable close to where Indians live, learn, and work...AI, in my mind, is the next big infrastructure. It is the infrastructure of intelligence.Chandrasekaran framed AI as a transformative infrastructure shift comparable to steam engines, electricity, and the internet. He added that AI tools must reach the ""last person,"" highlighting how accessibility will define the technology's societal impact. He cited examples of rapid AI adoption, including rural participants learning and deploying AI tools within hours, to illustrate the technology's lowering barriers.","The India AI Impact Summit 2026 brought together leaders of the technology industry, including CEOs such as Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI's Sam Altman, Anthropic's Dario Amodei, Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen, Meta Chief AI scientist Alexandr Wang, Salil Parekh and others, at Bharat Mandapam.

'India Built What No Other Country Could': Macron Praises India's Digital Rise At AI Summit

NEW DELHI: From Hyderabad to northern France, a new startup bridge is taking shape. India’s startup ecosystem took another step towards global expansion on Wednesday as T-Hub entered into a strategic partnership with the Hauts-de-France region to deepen cooperation between Indian and French startups and investors.Announced on Thursday at the India AI Impact Summit 2026, the partnership aims to create a structured, long-term corridor for startup-led economic collaboration between the two countries. The agreement focuses on easing market entry for startups, enabling cross-border investments and building strong links between incubators, academia, investors and corporates on both sides.Under the partnership, startups from India and France will get access to structured immersion programmes, market access support and assistance with registration in new geographies. Investor networks from both ecosystems will also be connected to facilitate syndication and co-investment opportunities. The long-term target is to help at least 10 French startups enter the Indian market and 10 Indian startups expand into France.A key pillar of the collaboration is the creation of an Indo-French Startup Consortium. The consortium will function as a formal bilateral platform bringing together incubators, universities, venture capital firms and large companies to ensure sustained engagement and knowledge exchange.By institutionalising cooperation, the partners aim to create steady capital flows and coordinated growth opportunities for startups.The partnership also includes jointly designed acceleration and market-readiness programmes to help startups localise products, refine business models and scale internationally. Founder exchanges through demo days, pitch sessions, bootcamps and mentor interactions will further strengthen ties between the two ecosystems.The collaboration aligns with India’s Viksit Bharat 2047 vision and complements national initiatives such as the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme and the revised deep-tech framework, which focus on strengthening early-stage funding and global competitiveness.Based in Hyderabad, T-Hub has supported over 2,000 startups through funding access, market linkages and infrastructure. Hauts-de-France, one of France’s most populous regions, hosts over 17,000 digital companies and a strong talent base, positioning it as a key gateway for Indian startups looking at Europe.","The partnership aims to create a structured, long-term corridor for startup-led economic collaboration between the two countries.

What may be wrong with the US launching website to see banned content

The US government is reportedly planning to launch a website that will allow people in Europe and elsewhere to see content banned by their governments including alleged hate speech and terrorist propaganda, reports news agency Reuters. Citing unnamed sources, the report said that the project is being headed by Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy, Sarah Rogers and was expected to be unveiled at the Munich Security Conference earlier this week. But the announcement was delayed. The site will be hosted at ""freedom.gov,"" the report added.As per the federal registry get.gov, the web address freedom.gov was registered on January 12. But the site, reports says, had no content but showed the National Design Studio's logo, the words ""fly, eagle, fly"" and a log-in form.The Reuters report says that the project can potentially strain ties between the Trump administration and traditional U.S. allies in Europe, amid the “heightened disputes over trade, Russia’s war in Ukraine and President Donald Trump’s push to assert control over Greenland”.Further, the launch is seen as the government's attempt to encourage citizens to flout local laws.European governments regulate online content more strictly than the United States, where the Constitution offers broad free speech protections.The European Union requires platforms to restrict or remove content considered illegal hate speech, terrorist material, or harmful disinformation. US officials have criticised rules such as the EU’s Digital Services Act and Britain’s Online Safety Act, arguing they limit free expression.Former State Department official Kenneth Propp said the website would likely be seen in Europe as an attempt by the US to undermine national laws. “It would be perceived as a U.S. effort to frustrate European legal provisions,” he said.This may not be a first by the US government. The Reuters report states that before Trump's second term, the US government helped fund commercial VPNs and other tools as part of efforts to promote democracy globally and help users access free information in China, Iran, Russia, Belarus, Cuba, Myanmar and other countries.","The US government is reportedly planning to launch a website that will allow people in Europe and elsewhere to see content banned by their governments.

The bull case: switching costs and decades of data

The bears aren't backing down either

Tesla Bull has a message for everyone spooked by trillion-dollar bloodbath in software stocks worldwide: I think this will…Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, rather known as “Tesla bull,” calls the historic selloff a ""generational buying opportunity"" even as $2 trillion vanishes from software market caps The numbers are brutal. Salesforce is down 27% this year. ServiceNow has shed nearly 29%. Microsoft has lost about 16%. And across the broader software sector, roughly $2 trillion in market value has evaporated over the past year —what JPMorgan called the largest non-recessionary drawdown of its kind in over three decades. For investors, it's been a gut-punch.But Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, isn't running. He's buying.""I think this software selloff will go down as a generational opportunity to own some of the stalwarts,"" Ives said in a recent Yahoo Finance interview, calling himself ""more emboldened"" about the bull case for tech despite the carnage.The selloff wasn't random. It was sparked—at least in part—by Anthropic's Claude rolling out a new legal tool capable of handling tasks across legal, sales, marketing, and data analysis.The move signalled that large language models were pushing aggressively into enterprise software territory, muscling into the ""application layer"" where companies like Salesforce and ServiceNow have long made their money.The fear: if AI can do the job cheaper and faster, why pay for the software at all?Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid put it bluntly. As recently as October, markets were pricing in a world where ""almost every tech company would come out a winner."" That optimism has since unravelled fast, with the repricing rippling well beyond tech into legal, logistics, and consulting sectors.Ives isn't dismissing the disruption—he's reframing it. Companies like Salesforce sit on decades of proprietary customer data and deeply embedded enterprise relationships, things an AI plug-in simply can't replicate overnight. Digital security requirements and high switching costs give legacy software players a meaningful edge, he argues.JPMorgan analysts backed that view, calling the AI-disruption narrative an ""overly bearish outlook"" and noting that multiyear contracts and deep integration complexity make rapid displacement unlikely anytime soon. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon also weighed in, calling the selloff ""too broad.""Not everyone is reassured. Deutsche Bank's Reid cautioned that even by year's end, there won't be enough evidence to identify structural winners and losers with confidence—leaving plenty of room for investor imagination, both optimistic and pessimistic, to run wild.For now, Ives is betting the bold get rewarded. Whether this is the bottom or just a pause in a longer unwind is the question every software investor is sitting with.","$2 trillion in market value has evaporated over the past year in the software sector.

'Nonsense!': Hawley FORCES Zuckerberg To Apologise; Big Rewind Ahead Of Social Media Addiction Trial

Mark Zuckerberg testifies in social media trial: His testimony on addiction claims



Response to addiction claims

Underage users and age verification

The legal arguments on both sides



Plaintiff’s claims



Meta’s defense



Broader context and industry impact



On February 18, 2026, Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Meta Platforms Inc., gave testimony in a historic trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court about social media and youth mental health, according to Reuters. This is one of the first big lawsuits in the US to ask if big social media companies made features that could be addictive for kids and teens on purpose, which led to bad mental health outcomes.The plaintiff in the trial, whose initials are K.G.M., is a 20-year-old woman who says that using social media sites at a very young age made her depressed, anxious, and had other mental health problems. She claims that companies, including Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) and YouTube, built their products in ways that encouraged extended and compulsive use by young users. TikTok and Snap have already settled similar claims before trial, but Meta and Google remain in the courtroom.Zuckerberg’s testimony represents the first time he has appeared under oath in this consolidated wave of lawsuits alleging youth harm. Lawyers for the plaintiff presented internal company documents and questioned the Meta CEO on issues ranging from platform design to user age verification practices.The trial is expected to unfold over several weeks and may set a legal precedent for hundreds of similar cases nationwide.According to reports, Zuckerberg repeatedly denied that Meta designed Instagram or other platforms to be addictive for children and teenagers. He told jurors that the company’s intention was not to maximise the amount of time people spend on the platform but to build products that users find “useful.”When asked directly whether Meta wanted people to become addicted to its services, Zuckerberg said the company aims to foster sustainable use rather than exploit users’ time for profit. He rejected the idea that Instagram’s features were engineered specifically to pull in younger users to generate long-term dependency.A central focus of questioning was whether Meta effectively prevents children under 13 from using Instagram, a rule in the platform’s policy. Zuckerberg said he recognises that enforcing age limits is difficult, noting that many users lie about their ages to gain access. He acknowledged that Meta deployed tools to identify and remove underage accounts but described this challenge as ongoing.The plaintiff’s legal team showed documents suggesting that Meta had internal discussions about how to attract younger users, although Zuckerberg stated that such records were being mischaracterised. Meta’s position has been that improvements to safety and age verification have been introduced over time.The lawsuit alleges that Meta and YouTube exploited psychological and algorithmic design features such as endless scrolling, notifications, and recommendation systems to keep young users engaged at the expense of their mental health. Internal Meta documents shown in court say that the company knew about the risks of teens using their products.The plaintiff says that these design choices made her mental health problems worse and that the companies should be held legally responsible for any harm that comes from using the product for a long time, starting in childhood.Meta has maintained that its products are not intentionally addictive and that there is no definitive scientific consensus that use of social media causes clinical addiction. The company points to ongoing investments in safety features and policies aimed at protecting younger users. According to Reuters, official statements also emphasise that many external factors such as home life and overall well-being, contribute to mental health outcomes.Zuckerberg also stressed that past engagement goals within Meta were internal benchmarks and not instructions to design platforms for addiction. He reiterated that people will use products more if they are truly useful, not because they are designed to make people want to use them.This case is part of a larger trend in the US where people are suing social media companies and making claims about the mental health of young people. Reuters said that more than 1,600 similar lawsuits have been combined, making this trial a bellwether case. The outcome of this case could affect how courts handle future claims against Meta, Google, TikTok, Snap, and other digital platforms.","Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms Inc., gave testimony in a historic trial about social media and youth mental health.

The 52-year-old entrepreneur is also the co-founder of Craft Ventures, a venture capital fund.

David Sacks’ connection with Elon Musk

US President-elect Donald Trump has appointed venture capitalist David Sacks as the new ""White House A.I. & Crypto Czar,"" signaling a significant shift in technology policy for the incoming administration. Sacks, a Silicon Valley insider and co-host of the popular ""All-In"" podcast, will guide federal policies on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency.In an announcement on Truth Social , Trump praised Sacks' credentials, highlighting his mission to ""make America the clear global leader"" in these critical technological domains. The appointment comes after Sacks hosted a high-profile fundraiser in San Francisco that reportedly generated over $12 million for Trump's campaign.Sacks' deep connections to the tech world, particularly his association with the legendary "" PayPal Mafia ,"" add intrigue to his new role. A founding-era chief operating officer at PayPal , Sacks maintains close ties with notable Trump-aide Elon Musk , who’ll be heading the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), an external advisory body, working to cut government spending.The two have a long-standing relationship dating back to PayPal's early days, with Musk and Sacks both being part of the influential group of tech pioneers who went on to found and invest in numerous successful companies.""David will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship,"" Trump stated.The move represents a dramatic political transformation for Sacks, who was previously critical of Trump following the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. At the time, he claimed Trump had ""disqualified himself from being a candidate at a national level."" Now, he finds himself at the center of the potential next administration's technology strategy.Sacks will serve as a special government employee with a unique arrangement that mirrors similar appointments like Elon Musk's. He can serve up to 130 days per year, with or without compensation, and will not be required to divest or publicly disclose his assets.Prior to this appointment, Sacks founded enterprise software company Yammer, which Microsoft acquired for $1.2 billion, and currently leads Craft Ventures, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm.","Venture capitalist David Sacks has been appointed as the new White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.

"Google DeepMind’s new GenCast AI model to offer faster, more accurate weather predictions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-deepminds-new-gencast-ai-model-to-offer-faster-more-accurate-weather-predictions/articleshow/116051877.cms,"Google DeepMind's GenCast weather tracking AI model: How it works



Researchers at Google’s AI research lab, Deepmind, have developed a new AI weather forecasting model called GenCast . In a paper published in Nature, the company explains that this model provides faster and more accurate predictions up to 15 days in advance. Google Deepmind also explained how this new model works in a blog post. Here are all the detailsThis model, which outperforms the current leading system, uses probabilistic ensemble forecasting to predict a range of possible weather scenarios, offering a more comprehensive picture of the upcoming conditions.The researchers are also making GenCast's code, weights, and forecasts publicly available to benefit the wider weather forecasting community. This new model can be particularly crucial as climate change increases the frequency of extreme weather events , making reliable forecasts more important than ever.Unlike older models that just gave one ""best guess,"" GenCast can provide many possible weather predictions , like having 50 different weather reports. This can help in understanding how the weather may change and what different things could happen.GenCast uses a special kind of AI that's good at creating things, like pictures, videos, and music. But instead of creating those things, GenCast creates different weather possibilities. It's like having the AI imagining many ways the weather could go.To teach GenCast how to do this, scientists showed it 40 years of weather data, like temperatures, wind speeds, and how much the air pushes on things. This helped GenCast learn all about how weather works all over the world.To check GenCast’s efficiency, scientists tested it using weather data from 2019. They compared the model to the best weather prediction system that is currently being used and GenCast was better at predicting the weather most of the time.Researchers looked at lots of different weather things, like temperature and wind, and GenCast was more accurate in almost all of them, especially when predicting further into the coming days.GenCast is also good at knowing when it's not sure about the weather. Just like when it is not sure if it will rain, the model will say ""maybe"" instead of being inaccurate.The best part is that GenCast is super fast. It can predict the weather for 15 days in just 8 minutes. The old way of predicting weather usually takes hours.","Google's AI lab, Deepmind, has developed a new AI weather forecasting model called GenCast.

Meta may be making a lighter pair of smart glasses



Samsung may take on Meta with new smart glasses



Facebook-parent Meta has announced a partnership with popular film director James Cameron 's technology company, Lightstorm Vision. With this partnership, the Mark Zuckerberg-led social media major aims to enhance the creation of 3D entertainment for the Meta Quest. This collaboration will make the Quest headset Lightstorm Vision's exclusive mixed-reality hardware platform.The partnership highlights Meta's ongoing commitment to its mixed-reality division, having already invested billions into augmented reality and metaverse technologies. In September, Meta unveiled a more affordable version of its Quest headset, further emphasising its push into the mixed-reality space. Additionally, Meta revealed plans to work with Lightstorm Vision to reduce production costs for creating 3D content, making it more accessible for creators.Reports from earlier this year also suggested that Meta is developing a lightweight, glasses-like mixed-reality device codenamed ""Puffin,"" which is expected to be released as early as 2027. Weighing around 110 grams, Puffin may be significantly lighter than the latest Quest 3 headset and may come with an external pack housing the battery and processor.These lighter smart glasses are also likely to feature advanced hand and eye-tracking, eliminating the need for controllers, and incorporating video passthrough technology for users to see their surroundings.This move towards a more accessible mixed-reality experience contrasts with Apple's pricey Vision Pro headset. Meta's shift in focus follows reports of halting development on a high-end headset, suggesting a prioritisation of affordability and comfort.Despite financial losses in its Reality Labs division, CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to be committed to mixed reality as a key part of Meta's future.Apart from this, Samsung is also rumoured to launch a new display-less smart glasses in the coming months, potentially alongside the Galaxy S25 series. Similar to Ray-Ban Meta's glasses, these glasses will focus on audio and connectivity features.Samsung is also expected to reveal more about the software in the coming weeks. This launch follows the company’s 2023 announcement of new extended reality (XR) products developed with Google and Qualcomm.","Facebook-parent Meta has announced a partnership with James Cameron's technology company, Lightstorm Vision.

What Anduril said about the OpenAI partnership



ChatGPT maker OpenAI has announced a partnership with US-based defence technology company Anduril Industries to develop and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions for national security missions The focus will be on enhancing US’ counter-drone systems (CUAS) to improve real-time detection and response to aerial threats. The CUAS is designed to counter drone strikes by detecting and intercepting drones while they are in flight. By training OpenAI's AI models on Anduril's data library of CUAS threats and operations, the partnership aims to strengthen the US's defence capabilities against drone attacks. This partnership with OpenAI comes as the US and its allies strive to maintain an edge over China in AI-powered military technology.In a statement, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said: “Our partnership with Anduril will help ensure OpenAI technology protects US military personnel and will help the national security community understand and responsibly use this technology to keep our citizens safe and free”In October, the Microsoft-backed AI startup also announced that it was partnering with the US military's research arm DARPA on cyber defences for critical networks.“AI is a transformational technology that can be used to strengthen democratic values or to undermine them. With the proper safeguards, AI can help protect people, deter adversaries, and even prevent future conflict,” the company said in a post at the time.In a release shared by the company, Anduril co-founder and CEO Brian Schimpf said: “Our partnership with OpenAI will allow us to utilise their world-class expertise in artificial intelligence to address urgent Air Defense capability gaps across the world.”Schimpf also added that the partnership will allow “military and intelligence operators to make faster, more accurate decisions in high-pressure situations.”Founded in 2017, Anduril Industries specialises in developing autonomous defence solutions. The company was co-founded by Palmer Luckey following Facebook's $2 billion acquisition of his previous company, Oculus VR.Anduril has experience in creating and deploying integrated systems that utilise various sensors, drones, and other assets. The company’s expertise lies in automating robotic systems for tactical environments, making it a valuable partner in the race to develop AI-controlled weapons.","The focus will be on enhancing US’ counter-drone systems to improve real-time detection and response to aerial threats.

El Salvador made Bitcoin legal in 2021

El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has disclosed that the nation's Bitcoin holdings have exceeded $600 million in valuation. Sharing a screenshot on X, the President Nayib Bukele highlighted the significant increase in the Bitcoin portfolio, which occurred alongside cryptocurrency surpassing the $100,000 milestone for the first time.Having initially invested around $269.7 million in Bitcoin, El Salvador now boasts a current valuation of approximately $603 million, yielding an unrealized profit of over $333 million. According to Arkham Intelligence, El Salvador's Bitcoin holdings currently stand at nearly 6,000.Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , a prominent cryptocurrency advocate, responded to the series of tweets from the President's with the word ""Impressive.""Currently priced at $103,465.81, Bitcoin's surge followed Donald Trump 's win in the recent US election. The President-elect's announcement to appoint a cryptocurrency supporter as the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission ignited enthusiasm within the crypto market, propelling Bitcoin's rally. Trump nominated Paul Atkins for SEC chair, a choice seen as favorable for crypto regulation. Since Trump's election win, Bitcoin has risen by about 45%, driven by an influx of money into Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US.El Salvador's unwavering support for Bitcoin, making it legal tender in mid-2021 when the cryptocurrency was valued around $36,000, distinguishes the country from others who have not taken similar steps. Despite warnings from international financial groups like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the President's government has consistently purchased and held Bitcoin.The tiny Central American country has long used the dollar as currency, but Bukele promised bitcoin would provide new opportunities for El Salvador's unbanked and cut out money transfer services from the remittances Salvadorans abroad send home.

When Bryan Johnson accepted 'defeat' with his anti-ageing therapy

Tech millionaire Bryan Johnson , famed for his age-reversing experiments, recently connected with Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal at an exclusive event titled “Don’t Die.” The gathering, inspired by Johnson’s movement advocating longer, healthier, and happier lives, was hosted by Goyal at Soho House for an intimate audience of 50 select attendees. Sharing the experience on X (formerly Twitter), Johnson wrote, “Last night at Soho House with @deepigoyal, who built @zomato into one of the most successful companies in India.”For those unaware, Soho is an international private members’ club in Mumbai. “There were over 1,100 applications for 50 seats. Sad to miss so many of you. Thank you @akshaybd and @thetanmay for hosting,” he added, sharing images from the event.The event was also attended by a Mumbai-based doctor Rickson Pereira who wrote on X: “Had an enlightening Sunday evening listening to @bryan_johnson talk about his project ‘Blueprint’. “Blueprint” is his personal project where he aims to “not die” by implementing a rigorous daily routine that includes diet, exercise, sleep, and supplements. He works closely with a team of doctors and researchers to monitor his body’s biomarkers and adjust his routine for optimal health. I subscribe to his ideology of prioritising your health first. I have been following his work for over a year and I think he is doing an amazing job of generating data about what works for human body and what is required to be in peak physical health. Thank you @thetanmay for the invite.”Bryan Johnson’s anti-aging journey, part of his ambitious Project Blueprint , has involved controversial methods such as receiving blood transfusions from his teenage son—a ""young blood"" procedure not approved by the FDA—alongside a strict diet with Blueprint-branded supplements and regular gene therapy injections.In November this year, Johnson accepted facing a setback when a recent procedure reportedly caused severe swelling to his face. Sharing a post on Instagram, Johnson wrote that he injected a fat-derived extracellular matrix into his face as part of first therapy under a procedure called “Project Baby Face”. He said that immediately following the injections, his face began to blow up. “And then it got worse, and worse, and worse until I couldn’t even see. It was a severe allergic reaction,” he added.","Tech millionaire Bryan Johnson is famed for his age-reversing experiments.

An Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die. Launched in July early this year, the app analyzes personal data such as age, height, weight, daily calorie intake, exercise levels, and more to predict the date. Developer Brent Franson says that the AI was trained on a dataset of more than 1,200 life expectancy studies with some 53 million participants. The results, he says, are a ‘pretty significant’ improvement on the standard life-table expectations.Despite its somewhat morbid concept—a ""fond farewell"" death-day card featuring the Grim Reaper—the app has gained traction in the Health and Fitness category. It is free to use, while you will need a subscription to show a clock counting down to my estimated death. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, the app has around 1,25,000 downloads till date.“Have you ever asked yourself 'when will I die?', our advanced life expectancy calculator will accurately* predict your death date for you depending on where you live, how much you smoke and your lifestyle to show your own death clock countdown. To predict your death date, simply input your date of birth, sex, smoking habits, your BMI and the country you live in. If you don't know your BMI simply use the BMI calculator form,” the app reads.Death Clock predictions are based on extensive medical studies and health data, with AI providing personalized suggestions for a healthier lifestyle. The idea is to encourage individuals to take better care of their health, using the predictions as a framework for decision-making.As mentioned, the app offers personalised suggestions to users. Some of these include:Maintaining a healthy weight is vital to reduce the risk of developing diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.Get moving for at least 30 minutes a day. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.Avoid smoking and second-hand smoke. These can lead to various types of cancer, heart disease, and lung diseases.Eating a balanced diet full of nutrient-rich fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains is critical. Avoid consuming too much processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats.Limit alcohol intake. While occasional social drinking is usually okay, heavy or prolonged drinking can lead to a number of health issues including liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and cancer.Try to get a good night's sleep. Quality sleep is important for overall health and well-being. It affects mood, memory, and healing processes.Regular screenings and medical check-ups can help detect problems early. This is especially important for conditions that don't always show noticeable symptoms, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol.Long-term stress can lead to a number of health issues. Practice stress management techniques like mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or other relaxation exercises.Relationships and social interactions are vital for mental health. Loneliness and social isolation can lead to depression and cognitive decline.Keep your mind active. Lifelong learning, reading, solving puzzles, or other brain-engaging activities can help to keep your mind sharp and potentially delay the onset of cognitive decline.While it’s important to note that these AI-driven tools aren’t guaranteed to provide exact dates, there are concerns about privacy and data security, as users must input sensitive information, which could be exploited by companies or malicious actors.","Artificial intelligence-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die.

The Income Tax Department has introduced PAN 2.0 to streamline the process of allotting and updating Permanent Account Numbers (PAN). Aimed at enhancing convenience and security, this initiative ensures that e-PAN cards, featuring a QR code, are sent to the registered email IDs of applicants free of cost. However, taxpayers must pay a nominal fee for a physical PAN card. Existing PAN cards remain valid even without the QR code. This article provides a detailed overview of PAN 2.0 and a step-by-step guide to applying for and receiving your PAN card digitally.Before proceeding, determine whether your PAN was issued by NSDL or UTI Infrastructure Technology and Services Ltd. (UTIITSL). This information is located on the back of your PAN card.The inclusion of QR codes on PAN cards enhances security by providing a quick and reliable way to verify their authenticity. The encrypted data stored in the QR code allows authorities, banks, and other institutions to easily access and confirm the cardholder's details, ensuring protection against counterfeit or fraudulent PAN cards.According to experts, individuals with older white PAN cards or those lacking QR codes should switch to the newer version featuring a QR code. They believe the updated PAN card design, known as PAN 2.0, will help mitigate fraud risks by incorporating a QR code for faster and more efficient verification.","The Income Tax Department has introduced PAN 2.0 to streamline the process of allotting and updating Permanent Account Numbers (PAN) Aimed at enhancing convenience and security, this initiative ensures that e-PAN cards, featuring a QR code, are sent to the registered email IDs of applicants free of cost.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115808793,imgsize-78664,width-400,resizemode-4/115808793.jpg"

Info Edge , the parent company of the jobs listing portal Naukri, has filed a first information report (FIR) against Rahul Yadav, the founder of its portfolio company 4B Networks, and others, alleging fraudulent misuse of funds.“An FIR has been registered by the Bandra Police Station (Mumbai Police) on November 29, 2024 against Rahul Yadav, Devesh Singh, Pratik Choudhary, Sanjay Saini (and unnamed others) in connection with 4B Networks, alleging inter alia commitment of certain fraudulent acts involving 4B Networks’ funds,” Info Edge said in a stock exchange filing on Saturday.Rahul Yadav is also the cofounder of Housing.com.In July last year, Info Edge initiated arbitration proceedings against 4B Networks after the startup failed to provide crucial information regarding its operations and management for a forensic audit. Deloitte was appointed to conduct the audit after 4B Networks did not disclose details of financial transactions and related-party activities requested by the investor.Info Edge stated that the FIR would have no material financial impact on its business operations. The consumer internet group had previously written off its equity investment of Rs 276 crore in 4B Networks during the December 2022 quarter, citing excessive cash burn, liquidity issues, and uncertainty regarding funding options. At that time, Info Edge co-founder Sanjeev Bikhchandani acknowledged that investing in the startup was a mistake.Founded in November 2020, 4B Networks facilitated communication and business transactions between real estate developers and brokers through its Broker Network Platform.

Bill Gates names two parenting crisis

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates reflected on the value of real-world experiences and the evolving challenges of parenting in the digital age . Sharing a blog post recently, Gates recalled the freedom he enjoyed growing up, where his parents often didn’t know his whereabouts half the time. In the blog post, Gates also emphasized the importance of balancing real-world exploration with responsible digital engagement, shedding light on the parenting paradox of our times.Bill Gates said:Gates also talked about annual “Think Week” that was “crucial” to his success later on. During the Think Week , Gates said he would isolate himself in a cabin “with nothing but a big bag of books and technical papers.”“For seven days straight, I would read, think, and write about the future, interacting only with the person who dropped off meals for me. I was so committed to uninterrupted concentration during these weeks that I wouldn’t even check my email,” he further stated.He said that the world is facing two parenting crisis these days – digital under-parenting (giving kids unlimited and unsupervised access to devices and social media) and real-world over-parenting (protecting kids from every possible harm in the real world).“The result is young people who are suffering from addiction-like behaviors—and suffering, period—while struggling to handle challenges and setbacks that are part of everyday life,” he said.In the blog post, he recommends The Anxious Generation by New York University social psychologist Jonathan Haidt.

How former employees defrauded Apple

The Santa Clara County District Attorney’s Office has charged six former Apple employees with orchestrating a scheme to defraud the company. They exploited Apple’s employee gift-matching program to fraudulently obtain approximately $152,000 (approx. Rs 1,28,00,000) in matching funds. The group included Siu Kei (Alex) Kwan, 37, of Castro Valley; Yathei (Hayson) Yuen, 34, of San Jose; Yat C (Sunny) Ng, 35, of Milpitas; Wentao (Victor) Li, 38, of Hayward; Lichao Ni, 39, of Sunnyvale; and Zheng Chang, 31, of Union City.The accused manipulated donations to the charities over a period of three years from July 1, 2018, and April 6, 2021.Led by Siu Kei, the group tricked Apple into matching thousands of dollars in donations to children’s charities over three years. However, they made no actual contributions themselves. Additionally, they overreported around $100,000 in charitable contributions on their tax returns to claim illegal deductions. They have been charged with multiple felony offenses, including grand theft, conspiracy to commit grand theft, perjury, and tax fraud.Employees made donations through a third-party platform called Benevity.

Google CEO touts AI success

Google CEO Sundar Pichai has, in a way, challenged Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to a head-to-head comparison of their respective AI models. Speaking at The New York Times' Dealbook Summit, Pichai expressed his confidence in Google's AI capabilities .“I would love to do a side-by-side comparison of Microsoft’s own models and our models any day, any time,” Pichai said.This challenge comes in response to comments made by Nadella earlier this year, where he questioned Google's position in the AI race following some high-profile mishaps with Google's AI products. Nadella, speaking on a podcast in March, acknowledged Google's talent and resources but implied that the company had faltered in its AI efforts.“Google should have been the default winner in the world of big tech’s AI race,” Nadella had said.“Google’s a very competent company and obviously they have both the talent and the compute. They’re the vertically integrated player in this. They have everything from data to silicon to models to products and distribution,” Nadella added.Following Alphabet's strong third-quarter earnings report, the CEO highlighted the company's gains in AI. During the earnings call, Pichai emphasised that Google's investments in AI are “paying off and driving success,” particularly in its search and cloud divisions.Google Cloud revenue surged by 35% year-over-year, fueled by strong demand for AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions.Pichai also expressed his belief that Google is “uniquely positioned to lead in the era of AI,” citing the company's strong foundation in the technology. He highlighted the rapid pace of innovation in AI and growing user engagement with Google Search and Google Lens, driven by AI-powered features.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai challenged Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to a head-to- head comparison of their respective AI models.

This renewed focus on AI highlights Bezos's commitment to driving innovation in one of the most transformative fields of technology, underscoring his continued influence on the company's strategic direction.""My heart is in Amazon, my curiosity is in Amazon, and my fears are there and my love is there,"" Bezos said, emphasizing his ongoing involvement. The world's second-richest man is particularly focused on helping Amazon become a leader in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, with the company currently developing 1,000 internal AI applications.A key strategic move involves building a powerful supercomputer in collaboration with Anthropic, the AI startup in which Amazon has invested $8 billion.

Waiting period denial: Insurers often set waiting periods for specific illness and PEDs. Review these with your advisor when buying a policy

Non-coverage: Some treatments are permanently excluded from coverage (eg. drug abuse, etc) Review the policy/consult your advisor to understand these limitations fully.

Fraudulent claims: Claims may be rejected for non-disclosure of critical medical information. As a rule of thumb, always disclose your PEDs during your application.

Blacklisted hospitals: Insurers may deny claims if treatment is received at hospitals excluded from their coverage. Check your insurer’s list of excluded hospitals before admission.

Unnecessary hospitalisation: Claims may be denied if hospitalisation is deemed unnecessary (eg. fever).

Insurer Delays: The insurer may delay cashless approval for further investigation.

Possible PED: Claims may be questioned if a PED is suspected.

Navigating the complexities of insurance can be daunting, especially when faced with a claim rejection. Nithin Kamath , CEO of Zerodha, an online brokerage firm, recently addressed a common concern: why insurance claims get denied. Kamath highlighted a crucial point: many people lack comprehensive understanding of their insurance policies' coverage and exclusions. This often leads to confusion and disappointment when claims are rejected.In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) Kamath emphasized the importance of thoroughly reading and understanding your insurance policy . This includes identifying exclusions and pre-existing conditions that might limit coverage. “Having insurance alone isn't enough. Just because you have insurance doesn't mean all your claims will be processed. Insurance companies often don't pay claims in full or flat-out reject the claims. It's important to know the common reasons why claims get rejected and what you can do about it,” Kamath said in a post.Kamath also acknowledged that facing claim rejection can be stressful. He encouraged individuals to seek guidance from insurance advisors or legal professionals if needed throughout the process.","Nithin Kamath, CEO of Zerodha, recently addressed a common concern: why insurance claims get denied.

How this chip plant may not completely cut Nvidia’s Taiwan ‘ties’

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is reportedly talking with Nvidia about manufacturing its Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) chips at its new Arizona plant. If these rumoured talks go through, TSMC may potentially secure another major customer for the facility. Last month, Intel was awarded nearly $8 billion in funding from the US Department of Commerce to boost its semiconductor manufacturing and packaging capabilities in multiple sites including Arizona. This funding, which was provided through the CHIPS and Science Act aims to strengthen domestic chip production and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers. With TSMC reportedly in talks with Nvidia to produce its AI chips at this plant, it can affect Intel’s AI chip goals. When made in the US, Nvidia may offer its AI chips to its customers at a more competitive price.As per the latest annual tally by the Arizona Republic confirmed that Intel is one of largest non-governmental employers in this US state. With nearly 12,000 employees in Chandler, this makes the chipmaker a significant contributor to the state's economy and workforce.A report by the news agency Reuters cited three sources familiar with the matter (who remained anonymous) to claim the Nvidia-TSMC Arizona plant is scheduled to begin volume production next year and is already preparing to manufacture the chips early next year. Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips, unveiled in March this year, have been in high demand for generative AI and accelerated computing tasks. These chips are said to be 30 times faster at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots. Currently manufactured in Taiwan, producing them in Arizona would also align with US efforts to boost domestic chip production.Two sources also reportedly claimed that Apple and Advanced Micro Devices are a part of Nvidia’s list of customers that will be supplied from the Arizona plant.While TSMC may have plans to manufacture the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be sent back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility reportedly lacks the necessary **chip on wafer on substrate** (CoWoS) capacity required for the Blackwell chips, two sources added. Currently, all of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is based in Taiwan.TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker based in Taiwan, is also investing tens of billions of dollars into the construction of three facilities in Phoenix. The project has received substantial subsidies from the US government, which aims to boost semiconductor manufacturing within the country.","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is reportedly talking with Nvidia about manufacturing its Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) chips at its new Arizona plant.

WhatsApp scams: Government gets 'alarm call' from India's telecom regulator,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-sends-notice-to-whatsapp-after-scam-alarm-from-telecom-regulator-trai/articleshow/116020712.cms,"The big jurisdiction problem with WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram

The 'big OTT scam problem' Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea face

How fraudsters scam users on OTT apps

The Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) has reportedly urged Meta Platforms, the parent company of WhatsApp, to address scams originating on the messaging platform. This follows a request from India’s telecom regulator for intervention. According to an Economic Times report quoting MeitY secretary S. Krishnan, the ministry is actively addressing the issue with Meta. “This is an ongoing process. Scammers will always find new ways, which is a cause for concern,” Krishnan told ET.Krishnan further said that the government is in a regular dialogue with stakeholders particularly WhatsApp and added that users need to be cautious and raise complaints even in the case of WhatsApp. “If there is some wrong content, there is a process. The IT rules require these companies to have a grievance officer with whom users can raise issues. They can raise it either within the app or outside. In case, the issue is not dealt with, there is also a grievance appellate committee.”Recently, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) asked MeitY to probe and prevent calls and messages sent out by scamsters using WhatsApp. “WhatsApp calls at present, are being looked at by MeitY, so on that we have already written to the ministry saying that Trai is already working in respect to voice calls and SMS, and requested them to take appropriate action,” Trai chairman Anil Kumar Lahoti told ET in a recent interaction.The OTT apps like WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram currently fall under MeitY’s mandate in terms of regulatory compliance- not under The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and the telecom department. The telecom regulator is pushing the Ministry of Electronics and IT (Meity) to take strong steps to check rampant instances of spam and phishing communications that are rapidly shifting to over-the-top (OTT) apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram.An official said while WhatsApp is cooperating with the DoT to some extent and has blocked numbers as requested by the government, there is no visible control yet over Telegram and Signal-platforms that need to take concrete steps to curb scams. However, what makes WhatsApp's case is its huge user base in India.The telecom operators -- Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea -- have been highlighting the issue of rising instances of spam on OTT platforms and all the measures to control the menace do not work on OTTs as they are not regulated, either by DoT or Trai.Every time the regulator asks the telcos to block numbers for spam, their corresponding OTT numbers too have to be blocked. But since telcos can't do it, the numbers are provided to platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram by the DoT for blocking, who have to do that at their end. But unlike telcos, the OTT platforms are not bound by any licence to block the numbers. Further, there are international numbers, from which spam continues to come and telcos have no control over it.The fraudsters have been abusing WhatsApp to commit financial frauds. Modus operandi includes asking for screen share and taking remote access of a smartphone to steal personal data, and in other cases asking for a one-time password (OTP) to swindle money from a bank account.","The Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) has reportedly urged Meta Platforms, the parent company of WhatsApp, to address scams originating on the messaging platform.

A Virginia man, Naresh Bhatt , has been charged with the murder of his wife, Mamta Bhatt , four months after her disappearance. The case has drawn widespread attention due to its complex nature, involving suspicious internet searches and the absence of the victim’s body. The 37-year-old was indicted by a Prince William County grand jury on charges of murder and defiling a dead body. Despite the lack of a body, investigators linked Mamta’s DNA to blood found at the couple's home in Manassas. This case has not only shaken the local community but has also sparked international concern, particularly among Mamta's family and supporters in Nepal.Prosecutors revealed that Naresh Bhatt conducted troubling internet searches three months before Mamta’s disappearance. Queries such as ""How long does it take to get married after a spouse dies?"" and ""What happens to debt of a deceased spouse?"" raised significant suspicion. These searches came to light during the investigation and have become a key component of the prosecution’s case.Mamta Bhatt, a 28-year-old pediatric nurse, was last seen in late July 2024. Her sudden disappearance led to an intensive search effort by local authorities and the community. While her body has not been recovered, investigators discovered blood at the couple's home, later confirmed to match Mamta's DNA.As per reports, three weeks after Mamta went missing, Naresh was charged with concealing a dead body. He was detained and has remained in jail since the arrest. This charge eventually escalated to murder and defiling a corpse following further investigation.Mamta’s disappearance galvanised the local community in northern Virginia and her family in Nepal. Social media campaigns, rallies, and community events were organized to keep the case in the public eye. The collective efforts aimed to pressure authorities for a resolution and to honor Mamta’s memory.Prince William County Police Chief Mario Lugo expressed confidence in the case despite the absence of Mamta’s body. “From the beginning, we believed that she was murdered,” Lugo stated during a press briefing. He also emphasized the strength of the evidence, which includes the DNA match and Naresh’s suspicious online activities.The case has highlighted the complexities of prosecuting a murder charge without a body. However, legal experts point out that advances in forensic science and circumstantial evidence can build a compelling case.The case has drawn significant public interest due to its disturbing details and the broader implications for domestic violence awareness . Many have called for justice for Mamta, while others have questioned the legal challenges of convicting a suspect without a recovered body.Authorities are continuing their investigation to locate Mamta’s remains and gather additional evidence. Naresh Bhatt is set to face trial, and prosecutors are determined to seek justice for Mamta.","Mamta Bhatt, a 28-year-old pediatric nurse, was last seen in late July 2024.

In a recent social media exchange, Elon Musk spotlighted Singapore’s steep decline in fertility rates, a trend he described as an existential challenge. Responding to a post by Mario Nawfal—a prominent personality on X (formerly Twitter)—about the nation’s ""baby crisis"" and the potential role of robotics in addressing the issue, Musk remarked,This statement has reignited global discussions on the demographic struggles of developed nations, where falling birth rates pose long-term economic and social challenges. Musk, a vocal advocate for population growth, has frequently warned of the adverse consequences of shrinking populations, emphasizing the importance of addressing these issues for global sustainability. The post highlights broader concerns about aging societies and their impact on labor markets, innovation, and healthcare systems, while underscoring the rising interest in technologies like robotics to compensate for declining human workforce numbers.Singapore has been grappling with a steady decline in its Total Fertility Rate (TFR) over the last three decades. In 2023, the TFR reached a historic low of 0.97, marking the first time it has dipped below 1.0. This figure signifies that, on average, each woman in Singapore is having fewer than one child—far below the replacement level of 2.1 required to maintain a stable population.The primary drivers of Singapore’s fertility decline stem from evolving societal trends. Data from the Singapore government reveals that a growing number of women aged 25–34, considered prime childbearing years, are choosing to remain single. Additionally, the marital fertility rate among women in their 20s has seen a substantial decline, accounting for approximately 32% of the overall drop in TFR.Between 1990 and 2005, marital fertility rates among women aged 25–34 experienced a sharp decrease. While there was a slight recovery in 2023, the long-term trend remains concerning.Despite its demographic challenges, Singapore’s advancements in robotics and automation could help address labor shortages caused by a declining workforce. According to the International Federation of Robotics, Singapore ranks second globally in robot density, with 770 industrial robots per 10,000 workers. This technological prowess allows the country to sustain industries despite high labor costs and a relatively small manufacturing base.Musk’s interest in robotics is well-documented through Tesla’s investment in humanoid robots designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. While he has not directly suggested robots as a replacement for human populations, his remarks hint at the potential for technology to mitigate the economic and social impacts of declining birth rates.Musk’s statement sparked widespread debate on social media, with opinions ranging from support to criticism.Some users highlighted Singapore’s strong immigration policies as a mechanism to counteract its population decline. The city-state has long relied on foreign talent and workers to supplement its labor force and sustain economic growth.Others pointed to deeper issues contributing to the reluctance to have children. Rising living costs, financial instability, and paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyles were frequently cited as barriers to family planning. Many individuals expressed concerns about the affordability of raising children in an increasingly competitive and expensive environment.Singapore’s struggle with low fertility rates mirrors challenges faced by many developed nations, including Japan, South Korea, and certain European countries. Declining birth rates have far-reaching consequences, including:","Singapore has been grappling with a steady decline in its Total Fertility Rate (TFR) over the last three decades.

In an age where technology facilitates convenience, instances of scams in ride-hailing services have emerged as a concern for commuters. A Bengaluru resident recently faced such a situation but demonstrated exceptional composure and quick thinking to outwit a potential scam. Sharing her story on Reddit, she recounted her encounter with a low-rated ride-hailing driver. Despite being in a tense situation, her ability to stay calm and strategise helped her resolve the matter without escalating it. The story not only highlights the risks associated with ride-hailing services but also offers a lesson in handling such scenarios effectively.The incident occurred when the Bengaluru resident booked a Rapido cab from Central College to Hoodi, with the app quoting a fare of Rs 385. She noticed the driver had a low rating of 2.6, which raised initial concerns. However, due to heavy rain and the cab’s proximity, she decided to proceed with the booking.The journey was uneventful until the drop-off point when the driver demanded Rs 600, showing a screenshot as proof. The commuter immediately identified the screenshot as being from a previous ride and checked her app, which still showed the trip ongoing with no deviations.The situation took a turn when the driver logged out of his account and logged into another, presenting an empty ride history as evidence. He continued to insist on the inflated fare, citing server issues. Recognizing the scam, the commuter decided against direct confrontation. Instead, she pretended to sympathize with the driver’s explanation to de-escalate the situation.“I played along, telling him I’d pay whatever fare my app eventually displayed, even if it was Rs 1,000,” she wrote in her Reddit post. She logged in and out of the app, connected to her home WiFi, and pretended to call Rapido’s SOS service.After a 20-minute standoff, she suggested paying Rs 385 upfront and sending the remaining amount via Google Pay once her app updated.

Scientists use forensic technology to reveal ‘real face’ of 1700 years old Santa Claus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/scientists-use-forensic-technology-to-reveal-real-face-of-1700-years-old-santa-claus/articleshow/116016935.cms,"Image credit: Instagram

Take a look at the post here



Who was Saint Nicholas of Myra

What the scientist said about the real face of Santa Claus



“The skull has a very robust appearance, generating a strong face, as its dimensions on the horizontal axis are larger than average. This characteristic, combined with a thick beard, is very reminiscent of the figure we have in mind when we think of Santa Claus,”

“We initially reconstructed the skull in 3D using this data. We supplemented this with the anatomical deformation technique, in which the tomography of a living person’s head is adjusted so that the virtual donor’s skull matches that of the saint. The final face is an interpolation of all this information, seeking anatomical and statistical coherence,”

Scientists have used facial reconstruction technology to reveal the likely face of Saint Nicholas, the 4th-century bishop who inspired the Santa Claus legend. By analysing data from Saint Nicholas 's skull, researchers created a detailed image showing a white-bearded man with a broad forehead, thin lips, and a round nose. According to lead researcher Cicero Moraes , the reconstruction combines ""statistical projections"" and ""artistic"" interpretation. Moraes also shared the “real face” of Santa Claus in an Instagram post.Saint Nicholas of Myra, renowned for gifting only well-behaved children, originally inspired the Dutch figure Sinterklaas , who eventually evolved into the jolly, sleigh-riding figure known in the US for bringing toys to children.In an interview with Pen News (seen by The New York Post), Moraes noted that although the bishop passed away in 343 AD, long before photography existed, the 3D images depict his face as both ""strong"" and ""gentle.""he said.Moraes also highlighted that he was surprised to discover how the scientifically reconstructed images closely aligned with early literary descriptions of Santa Claus, such as the 1823 poem *“Twas The Night Before Christmas,”* which highlights his “rosy cheeks,” “broad face,” and a “nose like a cherry.”Examination of the saint’s remains even revealed signs of chronic arthritis in his spine and pelvis, as well as a thick skull that likely caused frequent headaches, Moraes added.The scientists also suggested that Saint Nicholas likely followed a mostly plant-based diet. Originally buried in Myra (modern-day Turkey), his bones were later transferred to Bari, Italy, where they remain today.Moraes explained.","Scientists have used facial reconstruction technology to reveal the likely face of Saint Nicholas, the 4th-century bishop who inspired the Santa Claus legend.

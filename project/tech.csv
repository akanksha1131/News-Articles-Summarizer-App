“great information equaliser, democratiser.”

“This is an existential threat to us. If the internet stops existing, what’s left for Cloudflare to do? So one of the things that is really important to us is a thriving and vibrant internet ecosystem,”

Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) is ruiningthe internet. During a recent interview, he said that the days of search engines beingareSpeaking on the WIRED Big Interview Podcast, Prince expressed his concerns about a near-term dystopian AI scenario. He said:Prince also noted AI is not a search engine but anand it does not generate traffic, which is essential for funding the work of internet content creators such as researchers, writers, and journalists.Prince has outlined three future possibilities for the internet as answer engines replace search engines. He dismisses the first one, where research may vanish and be entirely replaced by AI, since it still depends on human-created content.The second, which he sees as more likely, is awhere most content creators end up employed by a few AI companies, similar to how powerful families like the Medicis once controlled art and knowledge output in the 1400s.In this scenario, major AI firms could dominate global information flows and shape them according to their own views, as seen when researchers found xAI’s Grok aligned its responses with Elon Musk’s opinions.Prince added.Prince warns that if people must subscribe to a few big AI companies for perspectives, information will becomeHe says this goes against the internet’s original purpose of free knowledge sharing and risks undermining its role as theHe even outlined a third possibility where AI companies will shift to a licensing model similar to Netflix, paying creators for content rather than scraping it for free. He argues that this would require content creators to create scarcity by blocking AI scrapers unless they are compensated.Some publishers have already filed lawsuits over the unauthorised use of their work, with Penske Media recently suing Google. Cloudflare has begun supporting this approach by letting customers block AI crawlers unless they pay, with clients like the Associated Press and Conde Nast already on board.Prince added.","Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) is ruining the internet.

How hackers used ChatGPT to create fake ID cards



Apple Watch Ultra 3, Series 11 & SE 3 – Which One Should You Buy?





A suspected North Korean hacking group has used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card, a report claims. According to cybersecurity researchers, these fake IDs was reportedly used to make a phishing attempt more credible by linking to malware that could extract data from the recipient's device. The cyber-espionage unit, which researchers have dubbed Kimsuky, is suspected of being sponsored by North Korea and has been linked to other spying efforts against South Korean targets. The US Department of Homeland Security previously stated that Kimsuky is likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence-gathering mission. The details were published in a report by the South Korean cybersecurity firm Genians.During their investigation into forged identification documents, Genians researchers tested ChatGPT. While the system initially refused to generate a government ID (which is illegal under South Korean law) however, adjusting the prompt allowed the restriction to be bypassed.Mun Chong-hyun, director at Genians said that the broader trend shows how attackers are turning to AI for tasks such as planning attacks, developing malware, creating hacking tools, and impersonating recruiters.In July, cybersecurity firm Genians shared its latest findings on signs of suspected North Korean operatives using AI in intelligence-gathering.Later on, in August, Anthropic reported that North Korean hackers had leveraged its Claude Code tool to secure remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies. The AI system assisted them in crafting fake identities, passing coding tests, and even delivering technical work once hired.Earlier, in February, the company said it had banned accounts linked to North Korea that were using its service to generate fraudulent resumes, cover letters, and social media content to support recruitment schemes.Recent phishing attempts targeted South Korean journalists, researchers, and human rights activists focusing on North Korea. Emails appeared to come from an address ending in .mli.kr, mimicking a South Korean military domain. The number of victims remains unclear.US officials have long accused North Korea of running cyber operations, cryptocurrency theft, and IT contracting schemes to collect intelligence and generate revenue. Washington alleges that the funds support Pyongyang’s efforts to evade sanctions and advance its nuclear weapons program.","Hackers used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card.

Questions remain over algorithm control and congressional approval





The United States and China announced they have reached a ""framework"" agreement to transfer TikTok to US-controlled ownership, potentially averting a ban of the popular social media app just days before a September 17 deadline. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the preliminary deal during trade talks in Madrid, saying President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will finalize the agreement in a Friday phone call.The framework would shift ownership of TikTok's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance to American investors, addressing national security concerns that have dominated the app's future for years. While Bessent declined to reveal commercial terms, calling it a deal ""between two private parties,"" he emphasized the agreement protects US security interests while preserving what Chinese negotiators consider the app's cultural characteristics.Trump celebrated the breakthrough on Truth Social, writing that ""a deal was also reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save.""The announcement comes after months of negotiations and three deadline extensions since Trump took office, with the current ban scheduled to take effect Wednesday if no agreement is reached.Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang confirmed the two sides reached a ""basic framework consensus"" on resolving TikTok-related issues through cooperation. However, he warned the US against continued ""suppression"" of Chinese companies while seeking Chinese accommodation on American concerns.Critical details remain unresolved, including whether ByteDance will transfer control of TikTok's valuable recommendation algorithm that drives user engagement. Chinese officials previously expressed reluctance to export the algorithm technology, which Beijing considers strategically sensitive. Wang Jingtao from China's cyberspace regulator suggested the deal could involve licensing intellectual property rights rather than full transfer.Any final agreement may require approval from Congress, which passed bipartisan legislation in 2024 requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban due to national security fears. The law, upheld by the Supreme Court, prohibits companies from ""foreign adversary"" countries from owning more than 20 percent of the platform.Industry analysts expect Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a Trump ally whose company currently hosts TikTok's US data, to lead the American investor group. TikTok serves approximately 170 million US users, making it one of the most significant social media platforms in the country.","The United States and China announced they have reached a ""framework"" agreement to transfer TikTok to US-controlled ownership.

Microsoft is reportedly updating its Visual Studio Code editor with an automatic AI model selector that prioritises Claude Sonnet 4 over GPT-5 for paid GitHub Copilot users, a report has said. This signals a strategic shift, with Microsoft effectively admitting it is favouring Anthropic's AI models for coding and development tasks over OpenAI ’s – a company in which it invested $13 billion.A guidance was issued before the release of GPT-5, but The Verge cites sources as saying that the company's stance has not changed. The report also notes that Microsoft has been instructing its own developers to use Claude Sonnet 4 for several months.“Based on internal benchmarks, Claude Sonnet 4 is our recommended model for GitHub Copilot,” said Julia Liuson, head of Microsoft’s developer division, in an internal email in June.The Verge also reports that beyond its partnership with Anthropic, Microsoft is also making ""significant investments"" in training its own AI models. At a recent employee town hall, Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman stated, ""MAI-1-preview was only trained on 15,000 H100s, a tiny cluster in the grand scheme of things,"" hinting at much larger ambitions for proprietary AI.This shift in preference also extends to other products. The Information reports that the Microsoft 365 Copilot will be “partly powered by Anthropic models” after some of these models reportedly outperformed OpenAI in Excel and PowerPoint.This comes even as Microsoft and OpenAI announced a new deal last week that could pave the way for OpenAI's initial public offering.Moreover, Microsoft's investment in OpenAI could be the biggest bet in tech history, with one report claiming the software giant is set to receive a stake worth $150 billion. The investment is reportedly part of a restructured deal with OpenAI. Microsoft initially invested $1 billion in the company in 2019 and followed up with a multi-billion dollar investment in early 2023.

Remote workers may lose access to important projects and leadership opportunities







Microsoft is officially ending its flexible remote work era, delivering an ultimatum to employees: work from the office at least three days per week or potentially face career limitations. The Redmond giant's new policy signals a dramatic shift from its pandemic-era flexibility, with implementation beginning February 2026.The mandate starts with Seattle-area employees living within 50 miles of Microsoft offices, according to Chief People Officer Amy Coleman's internal memo. Workers who fail to comply could find themselves at a disadvantage as the company increasingly emphasises in-person collaboration for career advancement.""We've looked at how our teams work best, and the data is clear: when people work together in person more often, they thrive—they are more energised, empowered, and they deliver stronger results,"" Coleman stated, suggesting remote workers may struggle to demonstrate their value.The policy arrives amid Microsoft's broader crackdown on employee performance, including recent layoffs of thousands deemed underperformers and accelerated improvement plans designed to exit struggling staff.This context suggests employees who resist the office mandate may face heightened scrutiny during evaluations.The rollout follows a three-phase approach: Puget Sound area first, then other US locations, and finally international offices in 2026. Employees have until September 19 to request exceptions, though approval criteria remain unclear.Coleman emphasised that AI product development—Microsoft's current priority—requires ""smart people working side by side, solving challenging problems together."" This language implies remote workers might be excluded from high-visibility projects crucial for career advancement.Certain roles including account management, consulting, and field marketing will be exempt due to customer requirements. However, for most employees, the message is clear: embrace the office return or risk being sidelined in Microsoft's future growth plans.","Microsoft is ending its flexible remote work era, delivering an ultimatum to employees: work from the office at least three days per week.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that he is disappointed by China's internet regulator’s reported instruction to the country’s largest technology companies to stop purchasing the US-based chipmaker’s artificial intelligence (AI) chips and to terminate their existing orders.“We probably contributed more to the China market than most countries have. And I’m disappointed with what I see,” Huang said, after a Financial Times report cited three individuals familiar with the matter as saying that Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) this week ordered companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s latest chip designed for the Chinese market.Several companies had reportedly planned to order tens of thousands of these chips and had begun verification work with Nvidia’s server suppliers before being told to halt all activities after receiving the CAC's directive.“But they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States, and I’m understanding of that,” Huang added.This new ban extends beyond earlier guidance from regulators that focused on the H20, Nvidia's other China-only chip.Executives at Chinese tech companies say the message is now “loud and clear” and that the industry is now fully committed to building domestic systems.This directive comes after Chinese regulators, who had summoned domestic chipmakers like Huawei and Cambricon to report on their products, concluded that China's own AI processors are now comparable to or even better than the Nvidia products allowed for export.It comes after a tumultuous few years for Nvidia’s business in China, which Huang described as “a bit of a rollercoaster.”“We’ve guided all financial analysts not to include China” in financial forecasts, Huang told reporters Wednesday at a press briefing in London.“We’ve guided all financial analysts not to include China” in financial forecasts, Huang told reporters in London.“The reason for that is because that’s largely going to be within the discussions of the United States government and Chinese government,” he added.The RTX Pro 6000D was the last Nvidia product the company was allowed to sell in China in significant volumes.",China's internet regulator reportedly told tech companies to stop buying Nvidia's AI chips.

Why Indian mobile numbers start with +91: The story behind the code,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-indian-mobile-numbers-start-with-91-the-story-behind-the-code/articleshow/123945699.cms,"

The ITU and global country codes

Why India received a short code

How +91 works in practice

Global calling: Country codes, including India’s neighbours



Pakistan – +92

Sri Lanka – +94

Bangladesh – +880

United States (US) – +1

United Kingdom (UK) – +44

Canada – +1

Russia – +7

Australia – +61

United Arab Emirates (UAE) – +971

Singapore – +65





Ever wondered why India’s phone numbers always start with +91? The answer lies in an international system managed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a United Nations agency responsible for global telecommunications. When country calling codes were first established, the ITU divided the world into geographic zones, assigning each region specific number ranges. India falls into the 9th zone, which covers South, Central, and West Asia as well as the Middle East. Within this system, India was given the two-digit code +91. The code ensures seamless international dialing and reflects India’s population size and economic significance.The International Telecommunication Union oversees the assignment of country codes worldwide. These codes standardize international dialing, allowing callers to reach any country reliably. By dividing the world into numbered zones, the ITU ensured that countries in the same region received codes starting with the same digit. India, in the 9th zone, was thus assigned a code beginning with 9, followed by a unique number, making its code +91.Factors like population size and economic importance influenced the length of country codes. Heavily populated and economically significant nations were given shorter codes to simplify dialing. India, being one of the world’s largest countries by both population and economic activity, received a concise two-digit code, making international communication more convenient.When dialing internationally, the +91 prefix signals that the call is directed to India. This is followed by the local area code and the subscriber number. The system works uniformly for both mobile and landline numbers, ensuring that anyone worldwide can recognize and call Indian numbers using the same standardized format.India’s +91 country code reflects both its regional placement in the ITU’s 9th zone and its global significance. By providing a short, standardized code, the ITU made international dialing simpler, allowing seamless communication with India from anywhere in the world. The +91 prefix is now a universal identifier for Indian phone numbers.","The International Telecommunication Union oversees the assignment of country codes worldwide.

What OpenAI looks for in new grads



Rethinking CS education



The New York Times





ChatGPT creator OpenAI’s Codex product lead Alexander Embiricos has message for students in this rapidly evolving tech landscape. Embiricos feels that students majoring in computer science will have to learn to use AI tools along the way. As reported by Business Insider, speaking on recent podcast episode, Embiricos said that students who take up computer science programs that ban the use of AI should be concerned. “The main place where I would be worried, if I was a student right now, is if I was studying CS and my college didn't allow the use of any AI, because then I would just feel like I'm falling behind,” he said.As per the Business Insider report, despite the warning Embiricosbelieves in the value of a computer science degree, citing the growing demand for software engineers. “I think there's going to be so much more software created and therefore so much more software engineers needed,” he said. “But I also think, figure out how to be using AI constantly while you do it.”His comments come at a tine when universities grapple with how to teach computer science in the era of agentic AI tools such as OpenAI’s GPT-5 Codex. These tools are capable of creating code and also automating development tasks.Along with this, Embiricos also revealed that OpenAI is not hiring many entry-level engineers. He shared that while hiring, the most important trait he looks for in a new graduate is whether they’ve built something. “I don't know if this is advice, but what I can say is that when I look at new grad profiles, for me, the thing that I take the most signal from is if they've built something,” he said.It appears that educators are already working on rethinking how to teach CS. Carnegie Mellon’s Thomas Cortina toldthat AI has “really shaken computer science education,” with students realizing they don’t fully understand code they’ve generated using AI tools.Embiricos also feels that the CS departments should help students become “mentally plastic” in how they approach problem-solving. He advocated for a mix of manual learning to build foundational understanding, alongside outcome-driven projects that integrate AI tools.","OpenAI’s Codex product lead Alexander Embiricos has message for students in this rapidly evolving tech landscape.

Facebook-parent Meta may be stuck with a Chinese hardware maker for its AI glasses. The social media giant is reportedly relying a lot on Chinese hardware maker Goertek for its new AI-powered spectacles despite the US tech giant's attempts to diversify its supply chain outside of China. Citing sources familiar with the matter, a report claimed that Goertek is manufacturing Meta's upcoming smart glasses, codenamed ""Hypernova,"" which are expected to be unveiled this week. The report also notes that Goertek has increased its influence over Meta's supply chain through a series of acquisitions and deals. This includes taking control of Shanghai-based OmniLight, which makes micro-nano optical components for smart glasses and is contributing to the financing of a takeover of Plessey, a UK-based optics supplier to Meta.In a statement to Financial Times, A person familiar with the matter said:This continued dependence on a Chinese partner stands in contrast to CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent efforts to adopt a more hostile stance on China, including informing President Donald Trump about the importance of the US leading the AI race against Beijing.While Meta has started some production of its Quest virtual reality headsets in Vietnam, Goertek remains a key partner there as well.Goertek’s actions have previously raised concerns within Meta. In 2022, people familiar with the matter said Facebook’s parent company discovered that the Chinese group was offering a lower-cost version of its VR glasses model on local e-commerce platforms, resembling the Quest.According to the same individuals, Meta executives discussed the possibility of filing a lawsuit against Goertek but ultimately decided not to pursue legal action.Goertek also denied producing its own VR glasses, stating itThe company manufactures Meta’s Quest VR headsets and its Ray-Ban smart glasses, while also supplying specific components. Meanwhile, Meta sources parts from a range of suppliers in countries including Japan and the US.“We have a robust, diversified supply chain so we’re not solely dependent on any one manufacturer, and we’re constantly reviewing and exploring supply chain opportunities around the world,” Meta said at that time.Meta, which entered the VR market by acquiring Oculus in 2014 and later rebranding its headsets as Quest, has shifted its focus under Mark Zuckerberg toward AI-powered wearable devices.The company is also working with the US government on military technology, with CTO Andrew Bosworth advising the Department of Defence on AI and a new partnership with Anduril to design AR/VR headsets for the army.On the consumer side, its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched in 2023, have sold over 2 million units by early 2025.

Culture of compliance and compensation







A former top security executive at WhatsApp has filed a lawsuit against Facebook-parent Meta. The lawsuit alleges that the internal performance review system of the company was weaponised to retaliate against him for exposing some major privacy vulnerabilities affecting millions of users. According to a report by Business Insider, Attaullah Baig, who worked as the head of security at WhatsApp, claims that Meta’s obsession with its Performance Summary Cycle (PSC), a system the company uses to evaluate employee performance has created a culture where optics contain more value as compared to user safety. “Meta’s culture is to attack the messenger, not the message,” Baig told Business Insider. “The reason this whole thing is big is because of user harm.”Baig alleges that Meta often ignored the warnings about hackers compromising more than 1,00,000 WhatsApp accounts daily. Along with this, the company also overlooked that fact thousands of employees had access to sensitive user data including locations, profile photos and contact lists. He also revealed that when he tried to raise alarm about the situation internally including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg he was swiftly sidelined and was finally laid off in February 2025.“It was almost immediate,” Baig said of the alleged retaliation, noting that he had previously received glowing performance reviews and was in line for a promotion and equity grant.This lawsuit filed by Baig paints a damning picture of the company’s internal culture, where employees are focused on ‘busy work’ and short-term fixes to boost their PSC scores. Baig also alleges that the engineers at the company are rewarded for churning out code and also for copying features from rival apps such as Signal and Telegram.One of the WhatsApp engineering manager is quoted in the suit saying, “This company runs on PSC.” Baig also claims that the internal metrics tracking user harm were manipulated around review periods in order to make the numbers look better.As reported by Business Insider, the claims made by Baig has drawn attention from Capitol Hill. Senators Charles Grassley, Josh Hawley, and Marsha Blackburn sent a letter to Zuckerberg last week demanding clarity on whether Meta violated its 2019 FTC privacy settlement by failing to disclose known security risks.Along with this, Baig has also filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), alleging retaliation. Meta spokesperson Zade Alsawah responded, calling Baig’s claims “a mixture of distorted and false,” and noted that the Department of Labor had dismissed his complaint.Baig also mentioned that Meta’s huge compensation packages discouraged the employees from challenging the system. “Meta has a very good campus and benefits,” he said. “But you have to agree with their philosophy of treating users as pure numbers on their dashboard.”","Attaullah Baig, who worked as the head of security at WhatsApp, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook-parent Meta.

Google’s New AI Is BANANAS: How To Use Gemini Nano Banana





Tesla’s board will not have to face a shareholder vote on political neutrality among its executives after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allowed the company to exclude the proposal from its 2025 annual meeting materials. The SEC confirmed in a letter, obtained by Fortune, that it would not take enforcement action if Tesla left the proposal out. This comes after a Tesla shareholder sought to limit the political role of executives.The proposal was filed by Jay Butera, a long-time Tesla investor and climate advocate. He asked that company leaders be barred from making political endorsements, contributions, or statements. Butera said such a policy would have protected Tesla’s “mission of accelerating sustainability” from being undermined by political controversies.“I don’t want to see the company jeopardized by unnecessary forays into the endless friction of human politics,” Butera told Fortune. “The Tesla brand, and its mission, should stay above that fray.”Butera expressed disappointment with the SEC’s decision, saying: “They can exclude my proposal from the ballot on technical grounds, but the issue remains—political perceptions are still harming the Tesla brand, reducing sales, and stressing government relations.”In August, Tesla had written to the SEC asking that the proposal be excluded. The company argued that the measure would amount to “micromanagement” and that it did not have the authority to restrict political speech. The SEC agreed, ruling the proposal to be micromanagement.Butera called the reasoning “ironic,” saying: “My proposal was trying to address a nearly existential problem for the company.”The decision means Tesla shareholders will not be able to vote directly on political neutrality at the company’s November 2025 annual meeting. Some investors had pushed for more debate on the issue, citing CEO Elon Musk’s high-profile involvement in U.S. politics, including his past ties with Donald Trump.","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allowed the company to exclude the proposal from its 2025 annual meeting materials.

Grok training team faces continued cuts despite leadership promises







Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI has placed a college student on leave from the University of Pennsylvania in charge of its crucial data annotation team following sweeping layoffs that eliminated over 500 positions. Diego Pasini, who graduated high school in 2023 and joined xAI just eight months ago, now leads the team responsible for training the company's Grok AI chatbot.The dramatic personnel changes came after at least nine high-level employees had their Slack accounts deactivated last week, according to Business Insider reporting. The data annotation team, previously numbering around 1,500 workers, has been reduced to approximately 900 following the cuts that occurred in multiple waves throughout September.Pasini assumed leadership of the team in early September and led an all-hands meeting on September 15, assuring remaining staff there would be no further layoffs. However, more than 100 additional employees were terminated shortly after, current workers told Business Insider. The 20-year-old has since conducted rapid-fire one-on-one meetings requiring employees to justify their roles at the company.Under Pasini's leadership, the team has implemented new performance evaluation protocols and shifted focus toward specific testing requirements that determine employee retention.Before the layoffs began, he posted announcements in company Slack channels directing workers to concentrate on critical assessments that would influence their future positions at xAI, according to Business Insider's previous reporting.The University of Pennsylvania student, whose LinkedIn profile shows he's ""on leave"" from studying computer science and economics, joined xAI after winning a company hackathon in San Francisco. His previous experience includes a fellowship at investment firm Contrary and attendance at the prestigious Pingry School in New Jersey, which charges over $47,000 annual tuition.The data annotation team plays a vital role in xAI's operations, with contract and full-time staff labeling and categorizing raw data to improve Grok's understanding capabilities. Pasini's appointment represents a stark contrast to his predecessor, who had managed Tesla's Autopilot data annotation team for over a decade before joining xAI.Musk began following Pasini on X in early September, shortly after the student posted supportive comments about the billionaire's companies. Two employees who questioned Pasini's credentials on internal Slack channels had their accounts deactivated within hours, screenshots obtained by Business Insider show. The company has not responded to requests for comment about the leadership changes or ongoing workforce reductions.","Diego Pasini, 20, joined xAI just eight months ago and is now leading the team responsible for training the company's Grok AI chatbot.

A comfortable career at Compaq



The meeting that changed everything



Ignoring the experts







There’s in an interesting story behind Apple CEO Tim Cook joining Apple in 1998. Way back in 1998, Apple CEO Tim Cook worked as an executive with then thriving company Compaq. For those unaware, Compaq was the world’s leading PC manufacturer in at that time. During the same time, Apple was having a tough time and the company was struggling hard to stay afloat. Despite the repeated attempts to hire Tim Cook, the now Apple CEO declined the offer — until a five-minute meeting with Apple founder Steve Jobs changed everything.At that time, Tim Cook was rising as an executive at Compaq and was enjoying a stable and successful job. On the other hand, Apple was seen as a sinking ship. Dell CEO Michael Dell also famously suggested Apple should “shut it down and give the money back to shareholders.” Also, Cook had no intention of leaving his comfortable position at Compaq and join Apple. Many times Cook rejected the offer of joining Apple with a polite “no thanks. ”Curious about the potential and perspective about Steve Jobs convinced Cook for a meeting. “Steve created the whole industry that I’m in,” Cook later said.He walked in with no intention of taking the job—but Jobs’ vision quickly shifted his perspective. Jobs talked about the future and about corporate clients. Jobs definition of success relied on his consumers. He described a new kind of computer, unlike anything on the market.Within just five minutes, Cook’s analytical mind gave way to instinct. “I can make a contribution here,” he thought. Working with Jobs, he realized, would be “the privilege of a lifetime.”Many experts and fellow CEOs asked Cook not to join Apple and many of friends also called him a “fool” for considering the move. Cook on the other hand, saw something which others missed. He identified the ability of Steve Jobs to see the world with “beginner’s eyes”. So instead of the conventional wisdom, Cook trusted his gut and joined Apple.Tim Cook joined Apple in March 1998 as head of worldwide operations. Later on Steve Jobs said that he trusted Cook so deeply that he could “just forget about a lot of things.”","Tim Cook joined Apple in March 1998 as head of worldwide operations.

Tesla’s entry into India has created waves in both the automotive and business sectors, marking a significant milestone for the country’s electric vehicle (EV) landscape. The global EV giant, led by Elon Musk , has been eagerly anticipated by enthusiasts and business leaders alike. The historic delivery of India Inc’s first Tesla to Siddharth Jain, Executive Director of the Inox Group, reflects both the growing interest in sustainable mobility and India’s potential as a luxury EV market. This moment not only celebrates a personal achievement for Jain but also signals Tesla’s strategic push to expand its footprint in India, bringing high-end electric vehicles to Indian consumers despite the challenges of import duties and infrastructure development.Elon Musk personally acknowledged Siddharth Jain’s landmark purchase through a post on X, warmly congratulating him on becoming the first member of India Inc to own a Tesla vehicle. Musk’s public recognition highlights the strategic importance Tesla places on its highly anticipated Indian debut and the symbolic value of Jain’s significant acquisition. For Musk, such milestones represent the growing global acceptance of electric vehicles, the rapid progress of Tesla’s mission to accelerate sustainable transport, and the increasing enthusiasm of environmentally conscious consumers worldwide.Siddharth Jain, recognised as India Inc’s first Tesla owner, took to X to share his excitement after receiving his Model Y, marking a historic moment for Indian business leaders. In his post, Jain expressed the culmination of a long-held dream, noting that he had been anticipating this moment since visiting Tesla’s Fremont factory in 2017. He tagged Elon Musk and dedicated the purchase to him, writing about the thrill of finally owning a Tesla and celebrating the arrival of sustainable, high-end electric mobility in India.The post resonated widely, drawing admiration from followers who appreciated both his personal achievement and the symbolic significance of India Inc embracing electric vehicles.While Jain’s milestone highlights private sector enthusiasm, the ceremonial first delivery in India went to Maharashtra Transport Minister Pratap Sarnaik at Tesla’s Mumbai showroom. This official event underscored the government’s commitment to encouraging EV adoption and promoting sustainable transport policies. Jain’s post, therefore, sits at the intersection of private aspiration and public endorsement, reflecting both individual fulfillment and the broader shift toward electrification in India.Siddharth Jain, executive director of the Inox Group, made history as India Inc’s first Tesla owner. Receiving a stealth grey Model Y, Jain expressed his excitement on X, noting that he had been waiting for this moment since visiting Tesla’s Fremont factory in 2017. His post captured widespread attention, with many celebrating his achievement and the joy of realizing a long-standing dream. Jain’s milestone reflects not only personal fulfillment but also growing awareness and aspiration for electric mobility among India’s business elite.Tesla officially entered India on July 15, 2025, opening its first showroom in Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) and a second in Delhi at Aerocity. These showrooms function as experience centers where customers can explore Tesla’s technology, features, and innovations. The Model Y, Tesla’s flagship SUV in India, is offered in two variants: the Rs 59.89 lakh Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) and the Rs 67.89 lakh Long Range All-Wheel Drive (AWD), with on-road prices in Mumbai reaching Rs 69.15 lakh. Imported from Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory, these vehicles carry higher prices due to India’s 110% import duty on fully built cars over $40,000, placing Tesla firmly in the luxury segment.Tesla aims to create awareness of its brand while targeting high-end consumers in India. The company currently imports vehicles rather than manufacturing locally due to high import duties, but it seeks to stimulate EV adoption and support the development of infrastructure such as charging stations. By promoting electric mobility among affluent consumers and demonstrating the benefits of Tesla’s technology, the company hopes to gradually expand India’s EV market and influence broader automotive trends in the country.","Siddharth Jain, executive director of the Inox Group, made history as India Inc’s first Tesla owner.

US Senate AI hearing: Why Parents are demanding stronger safeguards for children using chatbots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-senate-ai-hearing-why-parents-are-demanding-stronger-safeguards-for-children-using-chatbots/articleshow/123940025.cms,"Parental testimonies highlight AI risks

OpenAI and Meta’s response

Federal scrutiny and FTC inquiry



Proposed legislation: The CHAT Act



Growing demand for AI accountability





Parents whose children died or were hospitalized following interactions with AI chatbots urged Congress on September 16, 2025, to introduce stricter regulations to protect minors. At a Senate hearing convened by Senator Josh Hawley, parents called for laws prohibiting chatbots from engaging in romantic or sensual conversations with children, mandating age verification, requiring rigorous safety testing, and implementing crisis response protocols. Among those testifying were Matthew Raine, who sued OpenAI after his son’s suicide was allegedly linked to ChatGPT, and Megan Garcia, who filed a lawsuit against Character.AI. The hearing also spotlighted Meta Platforms over concerns about inappropriate chatbot conversations with minors, though the company declined to testify.Matthew Raine shared his son Adam’s tragic story, emphasizing that chatbots can provide harmful guidance during vulnerable moments. “Chatbots need some sense of morality built into them,” Raine said, describing how ChatGPT gave his son detailed self-harm instructions.Megan Garcia also testified, recounting her son Sewell’s interactions with Character.AI and advocating for legislation that prevents companies from testing AI products on children. Another mother from Texas, who appeared under a pseudonym, described her child’s hospitalization following chatbot interactions. These testimonies underscore concerns that AI chatbots, if inadequately regulated, can pose serious mental health risks to minors.OpenAI acknowledged that ChatGPT safeguards may become less reliable over extended interactions and announced plans to estimate user ages to direct children toward safer chatbot versions. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms, invited to testify, declined to appear. Hawley’s office noted prior internal reports indicating the company’s chatbots had engaged children in romantic or sensual conversations, which Meta disputes and says have been addressed. These developments highlight ongoing questions about AI companies’ accountability and safety measures for younger users.In addition to Senate hearings, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched a broad inquiry into AI companies including OpenAI, Character.AI, Meta, Google, Snap, and xAI. The FTC aims to evaluate the potential risks to children and teens, assess safety measures, and examine data handling practices. The agency emphasizes balancing innovation with child protection, scrutinizing chatbot design, crisis management capabilities, and possible mental health impacts on minors.Lawmakers introduced the Children Harmed by AI Technology (CHAT) Act, proposing measures to safeguard minors. The bill seeks to require parental consent for chatbot use, ban sexually explicit interactions, mandate real-time alerts for suicidal ideation, enforce privacy protections for age verification data, and require clear warnings distinguishing AI responses from human communication. The legislation would also authorize federal enforcement to ensure compliance, holding AI companies accountable for child safety.The Senate hearing reflects mounting pressure on AI developers to implement comprehensive safeguards. Parents, lawmakers, and regulatory agencies are advocating for stronger oversight to prevent further harm to children. With lawsuits ongoing and investigations underway, the hearing underscores the urgent need for policies that protect vulnerable users while allowing AI innovation to continue responsibly. As technology advances rapidly, lawmakers and companies alike face mounting pressure to create AI systems that are both innovative and inherently safe for younger users.","Parents whose children died or were hospitalized following interactions with AI chatbots urged Congress to introduce stricter regulations to protect minors.

How Luckin Coffee’s app-first strategy is helping



Starbucks CEO praises app-only Luckin Coffee





Luckin Coffee, the Chinese coffee chain that overtook Starbucks as the country’s largest coffee chain, is now aiming for the US market with an app-driven business model. According to a DailyMail report, the company opened its first American store in New York in May this year and has already expanded to five different locations across the city. Unlike traditional cafés, Luckin shops operate without cashiers — all orders must be placed through the brand’s mobile app, and customers collect their drinks directly from counters.Luckin Coffee’s appeal comes from its heavy reliance on digital engagement. Customers are lured with steep discounts, often 30% to 50% off menu prices, delivered through coupons and codes in the app. The company has also used giveaways, such as free tote bags and drinks under $1, to attract students and young professionals.This aggressive pricing mirrors the tactics that helped Luckin Coffee dethrone Starbucks in China, where it built a loyal base of young urban consumers through low prices and social media promotions, including TikTok.However experts want that Luckin Coffee’s US expansion may face hurdles as the business model is not sustainable in the long term. The DailyMail report quotes Bernstein US restaurant equity research analyst Danilo Gargiulo who said “In the case of Luckin, the idea is I want to grow in awareness”.“They want to make sure that the brand gets recognized on a national basis, even though at the beginning, this means that I might need to be suffering from some smaller losses on a per store basis,” he added.Starbucks, he said on the other hand, “is always striving to be profitable on a single occasion... Usually, trying to target a minimum of 15 percent margin per store is our estimation”.As quoted in a Business Insider report, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said “They've done an interesting job on how they've turned the app into the only way you can interact with that business”. “It's a different approach. I don't think it's the right approach for us,” he added.""The one thing that they probably have done a nice job of is just an unbelievable pace of product innovation,"" Niccol said. ""It sets the tone for, 'Hey, we cannot be complacent on flavors and drink combinations.'""","Luckin Coffee opened its first American store in New York in May this year.

Elon Musk’s daughter Vivian Wilson: ‘I want people to know me as…’





Elon Musk’s estranged daughter Vivian Wilson has made her model debut at the New York Fashion Week (NYFW), stepping into the public eye with poise and purpose. Vivian walked the ramp for Elena Velez, a designer known for her raw and industrial aesthetic and is known from showcasing complex femininity. Her appearance marked an important moment for her personal journey and has legally changed her name and distanced herself from her father in 2022.Vivian’s runway look at the New York Fashion week featured a sculptural ensemble which echoed Velez’s signature fusion of art and rebellion. Her debut walk received admiration from both fashion insiders and social media as many praised her for her confidence and individuality. The show is part of Velez’s Spring/Summer 2026 collection which covered multiple themes like identity, transformation and reclamation.Vivian has always maintained a low profile since her transition. Her modelling debut at one of the prestigious fashion shows marks the beginning of a new chapter. This new beginning talks about her distinct identity which is not overshadowed by her father’s vast tech empire.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has not yet commented on the modelling debut of his estranged daughter.However, Vivian’s debut at the New York Fashion Week has started conversations around visibility, autonomy and the evolving interactions of fashion and personal identity.Recently, Elon Musk’s estranged daughter, Vivian Wilson, has said that she is broke despite being the daughter of the world's richest person, insisting she wants people to know about her “other than just the obvious”. In a new, wide-ranging interview the 21-year-old aspiring model stated she is living with three roommates because it is ""cheaper,"" a decision that highlights her independence from her billionaire father.“People assume I have a lot of money. I don’t have hundreds of thousands of dollars at my disposal,"" Wilson told The Cut magazine in an interview. She acknowledged that while her mother is wealthy, Musk's fortune is ""unimaginable degrees of wealthy.""Wilson added that she has no desire to be superrich and feels fortunate to have a place to live, friends, food, and some “expendable income,” putting her in a more comfortable position than most people her age in Los Angeles.","Elon Musk’s estranged daughter Vivian Wilson has made her model debut at the New York Fashion Week.

Amazon’s shrinking workforce







Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently explained what and how the e-commerce company is working to improve the company’s culture. Speaking at Amazon ’s annual conference for third-party sellers in Seattle (via CNBC), Jassy said that ""bureaucracy is really anathema to startups and to entrepreneurial organizations"" and that he is working to root out bureaucracy and flatten the organisation as part of his effort to reset its culture and boost innovation.“I would say bureaucracy is really anathema to startups and to entrepreneurial organizations. As you get larger, it’s really easy to accumulate bureaucracy, a lot of bureaucracy that you may not see,” Jassy said as quoted in the CNBC report.In September last year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy set a goal to flatten organizations across Amazon. He then announced to reintroduce a five day work week at the company, from the previous three days. Jassy also called for the e-commerce giant to increase worker-to-manager ratio by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025.In the same year, Andy Jassy also announced the creation of a “no bureaucracy email alias”-- an initiative aimed to help employees flag unnecessary processes or excessive rules at the company. As part of this, Jassy said it has received about 1,500 emails in the last one year. Amazon, he said has changed about 455 processes based on that feedback.The e-commerce giant has laid off more than 27,000 employees since 2022. In an internal memo sent to employees earlier this year, Andy Jassy said that artificial intelligence will reduce the company's corporate workforce over the next few years as it integrates more AI tools and agents across its operations.""We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,"" Jassy wrote in an internal memo.

Elon Musk’s relentless grind, driving Tesla, Neuralink, and Optimus





Elon Musk offers the world a stark glimpse into his extreme daily schedule: “I go to sleep, I wake up, I work, go to sleep, wake up, work, do that seven days a week.” This relentless routine drives his involvement in multiple high-profile ventures, from Tesla’s groundbreaking electric vehicles and Neuralink’s medical breakthroughs to the upcoming rollout of the Optimus humanoid robot. While Musk’s work ethic has produced tangible results and technological milestones, it also raises questions about the sustainability of such intensity and the human cost behind these achievements.Musk’s rigorous work pattern fuels Tesla’s ongoing success. The company has achieved record deliveries, expanded global production, and advanced battery technology, solidifying its position as a market leader. Behind the scenes, Musk’s hands-on involvement, from product development to operational strategy, reflects the unyielding energy suggested by his “sleep, wake up, work” mantra.The same intense focus extends to Neuralink, where Musk oversees progress on brain-computer interfaces. The company has made strides in helping paralysis patients regain mobility and control, highlighting the high-risk, high-reward nature of his ventures.These breakthroughs demonstrate how Musk’s tireless schedule drives ambitious, cutting-edge innovation.Optimus, Musk’s humanoid robot project, is preparing for public rollout, aiming to automate repetitive and dangerous tasks. The development pace reflects Musk’s hands-on leadership style and the extreme hours he invests, showing how his personal grind directly shapes technological progress in robotics.While Musk’s routine produces results, experts warn of the dangers. Chronic overwork can lead to burnout, impaired judgment, and serious health consequences. Critics argue that glorifying such extreme schedules risks normalizing workaholism and unrealistic expectations in corporate culture. Supporters counter that Musk’s approach is a personal choice, emphasizing the sacrifices sometimes required to operate at the top tier of innovation.Elon Musk’s “sleep, wake up, work” lifestyle is inseparable from the successes of Tesla, Neuralink, and Optimus. It shows the scale of effort behind breakthrough technologies but also serves as a reminder of the human limits of relentless ambition. Experts emphasize that such extreme schedules, while effective for some, are not universally sustainable and can have lasting physical and mental health repercussions. His schedule is as much a story of achievement as it is a cautionary tale about the extremes of modern entrepreneurship. Musk's rigorous schedule sparks a broader conversation about work-life balance in the age of innovation.","Elon Musk’s “sleep, wake up, work” lifestyle is inseparable from the successes of Tesla, Neuralink, and Optimus.

Retention metrics “Healthy,” says Pichai



The cost of staying competitive







With the growing concerns over an escalating talent war in the artificial intelligence segment, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has publicly addresses the issue of employee poaching, specifically from Google DeepMind, the company’s AI research division. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at Alphabet’s Q2 earnings call, Pichai acknowledged the growing competition from rivals like Microsoft, Meta and also from emerging players such as OpenAI. All of these companies have aggressively recruited AI experts and that to with multimillion-dollar compensation packages.“I do know individual cases can make headlines,” Pichai said, referring to recent high-profile departures. “But when we look at numbers deeply, I think we are doing well through this moment.”As reported by Business Insider, Google CEO remains confident of Google’s internal metrics despite the ongoing talent drain. “We continue to look at both our retention metrics, as well as the new talent coming in, and both are healthy,” he stated. Google declined to share specific figures when asked by Business Insider.Pichai’s comments come at a time when Meta has launched its ‘superintelligence’ division and has already poached many former Google employees including Pei Sun, the researcher who contributed to Google’s Gemini AI assistant and Waymo self-driving technology.According to Business Insider, analysts such as Bernstein’s Mark Shmulik, raised concerns about the increasing costs of staying ahead on the race of AI innovation. A recent report by SignalFire revealed that researchers are 11 times more likely to leave Google for Anthropic than the reverse — a stark indicator of shifting industry dynamics.Pichai stressed on the fact that retaining the top talent is not all about offering huge compensation packages. “Access to compute is super important,” he said, referencing Google’s investment in cutting-edge chips and infrastructure. “Researchers want to be at the frontier driving progress… the mission and how state-of-the-art the work is matters.”","Google CEO Sundar Pichai has publicly addressed the issue of employee poaching, specifically from Google DeepMind, the company’s AI research division. “We continue to look at both our retention metrics, as well as the new talent coming in, and both are healthy,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123934116,imgsize-22098,width-400,resizemode-4/were-not-slowing-down-now-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-after-pixel-10-launch.jpg"

What the US entertainment companies said in the lawsuit



“MiniMax’s bootlegging business model and defiance of US copyright law are not only an attack on Plaintiffs and the hard-working creative community that brings the magic of movies to life, but are also a broader threat to the American motion picture industry.”

“MiniMax completely disregards U.S. copyright law and treats Plaintiffs’ valuable copyrighted characters like its own. MiniMax’s copyright infringement is willful and brazen. Given the rapid advancement in technology in the AI video generation field ... it is only a matter of time until Hailuo AI can generate unauthorized, infringing videos featuring Plaintiffs’ copyrighted characters that are substantially longer, and even eventually the same duration as a movie or television program,”

These companies are staffed with talent that includes former employees of major U.S. and Chinese tech giants, such as Google and Huawei.According to a report by The LA Times, the lawsuit claims MiniMax's AI has created iconic characters, including Darth Vader, the Minions, and Wonder Woman. The entertainment studios are seeking damages of up to $150,000 for each infringed work, along with attorney fees and costs. They have also requested that MiniMax be stopped from any further infringement.In their complaint (as seen by LA Times), filed in the US District Court in Los Angeles, the companies said:The entertainment companies asked that MiniMax be barred from further infringement and are seeking damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work, along with attorney fees and costs.According to the lawsuit, Shanghai-based MiniMax operates a service called Hailuo AI, marketed as a “Hollywood studio in your pocket.” The platform allegedly featured characters such as the Joker and Groot in its ads without the studios’ consent.The document states that users can enter a text prompt requesting characters like “Star Wars’” Yoda or DC Comics’ Superman, and Hailuo AI can generate high-quality, downloadable images or video of them.the lawsuit added.This marks the latest wave of copyright lawsuits filed by major studios against AI companies over intellectual property issues.

OpenAI recently announced plans to restructure into a for-profit public benefit corporation, a move that will allow it to issue traditional stock to investors. With this change, according to analysts, Microsoft is set to receive a new equity stake in OpenAI that could be worth at least $150 billion. This would be a remarkable return on Microsoft’s total investment of approximately $13 billion – suggesting that bet is shaping up to be one of the most successful investments in the history of technology.According to a report by Business Insider, the potential return rivals some of the most famous technology acquisitions. Google's purchase of YouTube for $1.65 billion in 2006 and Facebook's acquisition of Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 are both now worth hundreds of billions.However, there is a huge difference. Google’s and Meta’s investments took more than a decade to mature, while Microsoft's return on its OpenAI investments has grown at a much faster pace.The original partnership between Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, CTO Kevin Scott, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was unusual, involving profit-sharing units in what was then a charity. As part of the deal, OpenAI received credits to use Microsoft's Azure cloud service to train and operate the large AI models that power ChatGPT.Following the launch of ChatGPT and its growth, OpenAI required more money to support its operations. The startup’s unusual corporate structure presented challenges in raising capital from new investors who sought traditional equity stakes. This pressure led to a renegotiation of the partnership with Microsoft, a process that has been described as acrimonious but is now nearing a resolution.The outcome appears to be a win-win: Microsoft stands to gain a massive equity stake, and OpenAI can now issue traditional stock to raise more funding.Given OpenAI’s current valuation of $500 billion from a new funding round, a 30% stake would be worth $150 billion, and a 33% stake would be worth even more.","OpenAI recently announced plans to restructure into a for-profit public benefit corporation.

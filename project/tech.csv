Tesla’s former engineer to lead the AI platform

Trump administration seems to go in in full startup mode

Experts worried about security concerns

The Trump administration's plan to integrate artificial intelligence across all federal agencies was accidentally exposed through a GitHub repository before being hastily removed, revealing a July 4 launch date for a new AI.gov platform designed to automate government operations.The GitHub repository vanished shortly after reporters began asking questions, though it was later found archived in GSA's project collection. The AI.gov domain currently redirects to whitehouse.gov.The leaked repository, discovered by multiple observers and first reported by 404 Media, showed the General Services Administration (GSA) developing a ""whole-of-government, AI-first strategy"" under the leadership of Thomas Shedd , a former Tesla engineering manager now heading the Technology Transformation Services.The AI.gov platform will feature three core components: an AI-powered chatbot, an ""all-in-one API"" connecting agencies to models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, and a monitoring system called ""CONSOLE"" that tracks real-time AI usage across government departments.Shedd, described as an Elon Musk ally, reportedly wants GSA to ""operate like a software startup"" and has pushed for AI tools that other agencies will be required to use. The staging site revealed integration plans with Amazon Bedrock, Meta's LLaMA, and various FedRAMP-certified vendors, though some listed models appear to lack proper government certification.Internal government reaction to the AI push has been ""pretty unanimously negative,"" according to federal employees who expressed concerns about security vulnerabilities and the potential for AI to introduce bugs into critical systems or recommend terminating essential contracts.The leaked documentation shows CONSOLE will monitor how employees use AI tools and track their preferences, raising questions about workplace surveillance. Experts warn that widespread AI adoption could create significant security risks as these systems process confidential data and personally identifiable citizen information.The July 4 launch date, as seen on the website, suggests that the Trump administration plans to accelerate AI integration as part of broader government efficiency initiatives championed by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.","The GitHub repository was accidentally exposed, revealing a July 4 launch date for a new AI.gov platform designed to automate government operations.

Written by Steve Jobs: Three 'most-important' words of Apple philosophy that define the company since almost past 50 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/written-by-steve-jobs-three-most-important-words-of-apple-philosophy-that-define-the-company-since-almost-past-50-years/articleshow/121893338.cms,"The Apple Marketing Philosophy by Steve Jobs

Inside 'The Apple Marketing Philosophy': The 'three words' that still shapes every big decision

1. Empathy



2. Focus



3. Impute



Apple’s secret? Three words that still run the show

Why these three words still matter in a noisy world

In a world where technology evolves faster than most companies can catch up, Apple's staying power isn't just impressive — it's historic. From revolutionizing personal computing to reimagining how we communicate, work, and listen to music, Apple has shaped nearly every corner of modern life. But behind every product launch, keynote, and sleek design lies a foundational philosophy that has remained unchanged for almost five decades.It all began in 1977, not with a marketing campaign or a product blueprint, but with a memo. A short, 88-word document that captured the soul of a company still finding its place in a chaotic tech landscape. Though it was penned by Apple’s early investor and chairman Mike Markkula, it would come to be embraced and embodied most powerfully by co-founder Steve Jobs . These three deceptively simple words — Empathy, Focus, and Impute — have defined Apple ever since.And perhaps more remarkably, they still do.The document, known as The Apple Marketing Philosophy, was not an abstract corporate vision statement. It was a hands-on guide — direct, sharp, and actionable. It didn’t talk about profits, market share, or competition. Instead, it drilled into how Apple should think, behave, and communicate — both internally and with the world.It was a set of principles that Steve Jobs not only internalized but used as a compass every time Apple faced a critical decision.Let’s break down the three words that have become Apple’s north star.Apple’s first priority has never been what’s trending — it’s what the customer truly needs, even if they can’t articulate it. That’s what Empathy means in the Apple context. It’s not just listening to feedback or conducting user surveys. It’s putting yourself so completely in the shoes of your users that you anticipate their wants before they do.Steve Jobs was a master of this. He famously said, “People don’t know what they want until you show it to them.” That was never arrogance — it was insight. Apple’s approach has always been: meet human need before technical spec.Empathy explains why the iPod wasn’t just another MP3 player — it was a music revolution. Why the iPhone didn’t just add a touchscreen — it redefined the phone entirely. It’s why Apple software feels intuitive, even to a child, and why its hardware often “just works.”One of the hardest disciplines in business is knowing what not to do. That’s where Apple’s second guiding word comes in. Focus has been Steve Jobs’ personal mantra and a defining principle of Apple’s product philosophy.Focus is why Apple never drowned itself in a dozen product lines. When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, the company had a confusing sprawl of products. His first major act was to cut 70% of them. The result? A simplified product grid — desktop and portable, for consumers and pros — that laid the foundation for Apple's modern dominance.Focus doesn’t mean limiting ambition. It means channeling it. Every ounce of Apple’s creative energy is poured into a small number of products, each of which is obsessively crafted. That’s why updates take longer. That’s why features are rolled out only when Apple believes they’re truly ready. And that’s why users trust them.In Markkula’s words: “People DO judge a book by its cover.” And Apple has always known this better than anyone. The idea behind Impute is simple but profound — every interaction with a product, from packaging to advertising to interface design, sends a signal. That signal must always reflect care, quality, and thoughtfulness.When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, he didn’t just focus on tech specs. He obsessed over font choices, box design, and store layouts. Because if a product looks cheap or cluttered, it will feel that way — regardless of how powerful it is inside.Impute is the reason why Apple Stores feel more like design museums than retail outlets. Why unboxing a new iPhone feels like an event. Why even the inside of a Mac is sometimes as beautiful as the outside. The message is clear: what you see is a reflection of what’s underneath.Nearly five decades later, Apple remains fiercely loyal to these three words. Not because of nostalgia, but because they work. When Steve Jobs passed, many wondered if Apple would drift. But the continued success of the iPhone, the rise of the Apple Watch, the evolution of Macs, and the company's growing dominance in services all suggest otherwise.Every major Apple move — from their push into custom silicon with the M-series chips to their cautious and considered rollout of Vision Pro — can be traced back to these principles. Empathy for how people really want to use technology. Focus on a narrow, high-quality product line. And Impute, ensuring that everything from keynote slides to App Store icons exudes intention and design clarity.In 2025, the tech industry is louder than ever. Artificial intelligence is reshaping entire sectors. Mixed reality is beginning to enter the mainstream. New gadgets appear and vanish in the blink of an eye. And yet, Apple remains not only relevant — but aspirational.That’s no accident. It’s because these three words are more than a philosophy. They are a filter. A way to cut through hype, avoid distractions, and deliver lasting value.For any company wondering how to endure, inspire, and lead — the answer isn’t in chasing the latest trend. It’s in embracing a few timeless truths. And if they’re lucky, they’ll write them down on one sheet of paper, just like Apple did in 1977.","The Apple Marketing Philosophy was written by co-founder Steve Jobs in 1977. Empathy, Focus, and Impute have defined Apple ever since. Apple remains fiercely loyal to these three words because they work. The message is clear: what you see is a reflection of what’s underneath.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121893634,imgsize-17104,width-400,resizemode-4/The-Apple-Marketing-Philosophy-by-Steve-Jobs.jpg"

What is Vietnam's big worry

The United States reportedly has another plan to cut China's hardware and components supply chain of Apple, Google, Samsung, Meta and other technology companies. According to a report in Reuters, America is urging Vietnam to reduce Chinese technology in devices assembled in the country and exported to America. Vietnam, a hub for tech giants like Apple and Samsung, relies heavily on Chinese components, with Meta and Google also producing goods like VR headsets and smartphones there.Vietnam has held meetings with local businesses to increase the use of Vietnamese parts, with firms expressing willingness but noting the need for time and technology, one source told Reuters.The Trump administration has threatened 46% tariffs, which could disrupt Vietnam’s export-driven economy. One source said that Vietnam was asked to ""reduce its dependency on Chinese high-tech"" to restructure supply chains and lessen US reliance on Chinese components. Another source highlighted the US goal of accelerating decoupling from Chinese tech while boosting Vietnam’s industrial capacity, citing VR devices as an example.With a US-imposed tariff deadline of July 8 looming, the scope and timing of a potential deal reportedly remain uncertain. Sources emphasized that reducing Chinese high-tech content in exports is a US priority. Last year, China exported $44 billion in tech goods to Vietnam, 30% of its total exports there, while Vietnam shipped $33 billion in tech goods to the US, per Vietnam’s customs data.The US also wants Vietnam to address Chinese goods mislabeled as ""Made in Vietnam"" to evade higher duties. Vietnam’s trade ministry noted progress in recent Washington talks but said key issues remain unresolved.Vietnam’s Communist Party chief, To Lam, may meet President Trump in late June, though no date is confirmed, sources told Reuters. Local companies have shown willingness to adapt but warned that rapid changes could ""destroy business,"" one source said. Industry experts note that Vietnam’s supply chain lags China’s by 15–20 years but is progressing in sectors like electronics. Abrupt shifts could strain Vietnam’s ties with China, a key investor and also lead to security concerns.","Vietnam is a hub for tech giants like Apple and Samsung, which relies heavily on Chinese components.

“We would like to inform you that a technical incident is currently impacting our network. Our technical teams are fully mobilized to restore the situation. We apologize for any inconvenience.”

Gadget tips for monsoon: What to do and what to avoid this rainy season

France 's second-largest telecom provider, SFR, is currently facing a widespread mobile network outage. The downtime has made accessing texts, calls, and mobile internet impossible for thousands of users across the country. The company has confirmed that it is aware about the outage and is currently investigating the issue. The outage is also affecting broadband contract holders with SFR, preventing internet use in their homes. Reports of the disruption began arriving around 11:00 AM local time (2.30 PM IST), with hundreds of users quickly reporting the network as down. At its peak, around 4:53 PM IST, outage tracking website Downdetector recorded over 10,000 reports of the SFR network being down from across France. However, normal service is expected to be resumed later this evening, June 16.Replying to a post on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), SFR wrote (translated from French):As per Downdetector, the outage hasn’t been resolved for all SFR users. Report of the same has reduced but are still affecting nearly 2,000 users at the time of writing.This is not the first time French residents are facing widespread mobile network outage. In November 2024, users of the 'Free' network experienced an outage that, in some cases, lasted for several hours.Recently, in April, a massive blackout swept across Spain, Portugal and parts of southern France disrupting life for nearly 50 million people throughout Europe. The outage brought subway systems to a standstill, cut off phone services, disabled traffic lights, and rendered ATMs inoperable. The outage also forced the suspension of Madrid Open matches.Public transport systems, airports, traffic lights, and phone services across major cities like Madrid, Barcelona, Lisbon, and parts of southern France were affected.","France's second-largest telecom provider, SFR, is currently facing a widespread mobile network outage.

What took Google hours to fix a glitch that its engineers “identified in 10 minutes”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-took-google-hours-to-fix-a-glitch-that-its-engineers-identified-in-10-minutes/articleshow/121893332.cms,"What caused the Google Cloud outage

What took Google engineers hours to fix the issue and the way forward

Google apologises for the outage

Google has apologised for a major outage recently that impacted services running on Google Cloud across the globe recently. The widespread outage disrupted over 70 Google Cloud services, bringing down major third-party platforms like Cloudflare, OpenAI, and Shopify, as well as Google’s own products, including Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Google Meet.In an incident report released late Friday (June 17), the company said, ""Google Cloud, Google Workspace and Google Security Operations products experienced increased 503 errors in external API requests, impacting customers."" Google attributed the hours-long downtime to a series of flawed updates, particularly a new “quota policy checks” feature introduced in May. The feature, designed to evaluate automated incoming requests, was not adequately tested in real-world scenarios. This led to blank entries being sent across all Google Cloud data centers, triggering widespread system crashes.""On May 29, 2025, a new feature was added to Service Control for additional quota policy checks. This code change and binary release went through our region by region rollout, but the code path that failed was never exercised during this rollout due to needing a policy change that would trigger the code. As a safety precaution, this code change came with a red-button to turn off that particular policy serving path. The issue with this change was that it did not have appropriate error handling nor was it feature flag protected. Without the appropriate error handling, the null pointer caused the binary to crash. Feature flags are used to gradually enable the feature region by region per project, starting with internal projects, to enable us to catch issues. If this had been flag protected, the issue would have been caught in staging,"" said Google in the Incident report.According to the company, Google engineers identified the issue within 10 minutes, but the outage persisted for seven hours due to overloaded systems in larger regions. Google admitted it failed to use feature flags, a standard industry practice that could have caught the issue during a gradual rollout. "" Within 10 minutes, the root cause was identified and the red-button (to disable the serving path) was being put in place. The red-button was ready to roll out ~25 minutes from the start of the incident. Within 40 minutes of the incident, the red-button rollout was completed, and we started seeing recovery across regions, starting with the smaller ones first. Within some of our larger regions, such as us-central-1, as Service Control tasks restarted, it created a herd effect on the underlying infrastructure it depends on (i.e. that Spanner table), overloading the infrastructure. Service Control did not have the appropriate randomized exponential backoff implemented to avoid this. It took up to ~2h 40 mins to fully resolve in us-central-1 as we throttled task creation to minimize the impact on the underlying infrastructure and routed traffic to multi-regional databases to reduce the load. At that point, Service Control and API serving was fully recovered across all regions. Corresponding Google and Google Cloud products started recovering with some taking longer depending upon their architecture,"" said Google in its Incident Report.To prevent future incidents, Google said it will overhaul its system architecture to ensure operations continue even if one component fails. The company also committed to auditing its systems and improving both automated and human communication channels to keep customers informed during issues.“We deeply apologize for the impact this outage has had,” Google wrote in the incident report. “Google Cloud customers and their users trust their businesses to Google, and we will do better. We apologize for the impact this has had not only on our customers’ businesses and their users but also on the trust of our systems. We are committed to making improvements to help avoid outages like this moving forward.”CEO of Google’s cloud unit Thomas Kurian, also posted about the outage in a Twitter post, saying “we regret the disruption this caused our customers.”","Google apologised for a major outage that impacted services running on Google Cloud.

Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang says he is waiting for Elon Musk’s brain chips before having kids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/scale-ai-founder-alexandr-wang-says-he-is-waiting-for-elon-musks-brain-chips-before-having-kids/articleshow/121892713.cms,"Why Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang is waiting for Neuralink brain chips to have kids



“I want to wait to have kids until we figure out how Neuralink or other ways (brain computer interfaces) for brains to interlink with a computer until they start working. There are a few reasons for this. In first seven years of life, your brain is more neuroplastic than at any other point by an order of magnitude.

For example, if a newborn that has cataracts in their eyes, so they can't see through the cataracts and then they live the first seven years of their life with those cataracts. Then when you have them removed they're like eight or nine.

Even with those removed, they're not going to learn how to see because it's so important in those first seven years of your development that you're able to see, that your brain can learn how to read the signals coming off of your eyes.

And if you don't have that until you're eight or nine, then you won't learn how to see, because it's so important that your

neuroplasticity

is so high in that early stage of life.

I think, when we get Neuralink and these other technologies, kids who are born with them are going to learn how to use them in like crazy ways. It'll be like a part of their brain in a way that it'll never be true for an adult who gets a Neuralink or whatever hooked into their brain.”

Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang has stated that he plans to delay having children until brain-computer interfaces like Neuralink become available.

Noise Tag 1: How it works

Noise TAG 1: Verdict

Lost keys? Not anymore! Best Bluetooth trackers for Android under Rs 1,500!

We've all had that moment of panic—digging through pockets, retracing steps—only to realise our keys are missing. In today's connected world, smart trackers have become essential tools for locating lost belongings, offering a safe, digital way to help us in forgetful moments. Apple understood this early on with the launch of AirTag. But for Android users, choices remain limited, often leaving them with less reliable alternatives.That’s where the Noise TAG 1 steps in. Designed as an accessible, affordable Android-friendly solution, it integrates easily with Google's Find Hub network, ensuring compatibility with modern smartphones and tablets.

Verdict on July 2, what proscecutors want

Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment, with a French court hearing disturbing accounts from former employees, predominantly women, about a toxic workplace culture at the gaming giant’s Paris headquarters during the 2010s, according to The Guardian. The accusations, reportedly described as “extremely serious” by prosecutor Antoine Haushalter, include incidents of employees being tied to chairs, forced to perform handstands, subjected to sexual jokes, exposed to pornographic videos in the office, and enduring crude behavior, such as a boss farting in employees’ faces. One woman reported a manager drawing a penis on her arm during a video call with senior leaders. The court case marks the gaming industry’s first major #MeToo trial.The accused include Tommy Francois, 52, former Vice President of Editorial & Creative Services; Serge Hascoet, 59, former Chief Creative Officer; and Guillaume Patrux, 41, former Game Director. Ubisoft, known for blockbuster titles like Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Just Dance, was allegedly a “Boys’ Club” where such misconduct thrived, per The Guardian.Francois faces charges of sexual harassment, bullying, and attempted sexual assault. The Guardian reported that he allegedly tied a female employee to a chair before sending her in an elevator to a random floor and forced a woman in a skirt to do handstands, leaving her terrified. At a 2015 office party, he reportedly attempted to kiss a woman while others restrained her; she escaped after shouting. Another woman accused Francois of grabbing her hair and attempting a forced kiss at a U.S. gaming event, showing her nude photos, and drawing on her arm during a video call. Ubisoft’s HR allegedly dismissed her concerns, advising her not to escalate. Francois denies all allegations.Hascoet is accused of bullying and sexual harassment, including making inappropriate sexual comments, such as telling a woman on a work trip she “needed sex” in front of colleagues, and joking that a used tissue he handed to a female employee was “worth gold at Ubisoft,” per The Guardian. He allegedly made sexual noises, forced assistants to run personal errands, and denies any intent to harass.Patrux faces similar charges, accused of punching walls, pretending to strike employees, cracking a whip near faces, joking about an office shooting, and burning an employee’s beard with a lighter, according to The Guardian. He also denies the allegations.Haushalter called the trial an important moment for the gaming industry, highlighted by the #MeToo movement, which empowered victims to speak out. He also highlighted “strong proof” of systemic mistreatment and requested suspended prison sentences of up to three years and fines for the trio. The court concluded hearings, with a verdict expected on July 2, 2025.","Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment.

When it comes to supporting their children’s passions, most parents settle for lessons, gear, or maybe even a trip to a championship. But when you're Bill Gates , the Microsoft co-founder and one of the richest men in the world, the scale of parental support takes a whole new dimension.In what might be one of the most extravagant gestures of modern parenthood, Gates reportedly spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams. What began as a simple rental in 2011 evolved into a strategic series of acquisitions that transformed the elite Mallet Hill Court neighborhood into a private horse-centric haven, complete with barns, mansions, and lots of privacy.The Gates family initially dipped their toes into Wellington’s equestrian scene in 2011, renting a home for four months at a cost of $500,000. Their teenage daughter, Jennifer, was already training as a competitive show jumper, and Wellington, a hub for global equestrian sports, was the perfect base.By 2013, Bill Gates had made his first major purchase:From there, the acquisitions accelerated:In total, Bill Gates acquired 18 acres of land, effectively transforming a residential street into a private equestrian neighborhood.The scale and strategy of the acquisitions caught local attention. As one local told the Daily Mail, Gates was “gobbling up properties like Pac-Man.” Many purchases were reportedly made at two to three times the appraised market value, all in a bid to secure surrounding lots and guarantee privacy for Jennifer and her team.Stuart Roffman, a former property owner on the street, explained that despite the gated entrance, the activity level was still high. “Between trucks, stable hands, grooms, and house staff, that's a lot of people on a small street,” he noted. Gates’ solution? Buy the neighbors out.Although the purchase spree appears lavish, Melinda French Gates defended their parenting approach in a 2024 interview with The New York Times, saying,She emphasised that Jennifer and her siblings were raised with allowances, chores, and boundaries. “They were explicitly told not to mention private jets to their classmates,” Melinda added, underscoring an attempt to keep their lives grounded, despite the multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio.Now 29 years old, Jennifer Gates has successfully balanced her equestrian career with impressive academic achievements. A graduate of Stanford University, she later attended medical school and recently announced her residency in Pediatrics Research at Mount Sinai, one of her top choices.In a recent Instagram post, she wrote:she added, celebrating the match to her desired program.Jennifer is now married to Olympic show jumper Nayel Nassar and continues to compete in equestrian events while working in the medical field.Florida isn’t the only state where Jennifer enjoys equestrian luxury. For her graduation from Stanford, the Gates family purchased a 124-acre equestrian estate in North Salem, New York, reportedly worth $15.8 million. The property, located near New York City, consists of three large parcels, giving her ample space to house horses, practice riding, and enjoy countryside serenity. She often shares glimpses of her quiet life there on social media. The estate also serves as a base for her continued training and competitions.Bill Gates once downplayed the perks of wealth by saying,But in this case, the metaphorical burger came with a mansion, barns, paddocks, and full-time staff. What began as a teenager’s passion has turned into a lifestyle, supported by one of the most influential tech moguls in history.While many parents support their children's hobbies with encouragement or a few lessons, Bill Gates offered Jennifer a community, a sanctuary, and the freedom to chase her dreams without compromise. His investment wasn’t just financial—it was deeply personal. It showed how belief in a child’s passion can create a legacy beyond wealth.","Bill Gates spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which was once commonly linked to war veterans, has been brought into the limelight again in recent times because of its increasingly diagnosable occurrence throughout all demographics and occupations.

From victims of natural disasters and violent offenses to those subjected to chronic emotional stress, PTSD can drastically interfere with daily life and quality of life if not treated. Here's a comprehensive overview of PTSD, its symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and contemporary treatment methods.PTSD stands forr, a mental health condition that may occur following exposure to or witnessing a traumatic event.It is accepted within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and may occur in individuals of all ages, including children.PTSD is different from the temporary emotional distress that most individuals experience following trauma. Although many recover on their own, those with PTSD remain affected by long-lasting symptoms that can last for months or even years and disrupt their normal functioning.PTSD may result from a variety of traumatic events. While some individuals develop the disorder following a one-time event, others become affected after repeated exposure to stressful situations. They are commonly triggered by:It is worth noting that not everyone who is exposed to trauma will develop PTSD. Genetics, brain chemistry, coping methods, and support systems can all play a role in a person's risk.PTSD symptoms typically start within three months of the traumatic event but at other times may emerge later.

"Meta, TikTok challenge EU’s Big Tech fee; call it “unfair and disproportionate”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-tiktok-challenge-eus-big-tech-fee-call-it-unfair-and-disproportionate/articleshow/121796298.cms,"What Meta and TikTok said about Europe’s DSA

What the European Commission argue

Xiaomi QLED TV FX Pro 55-inch Review: Affordable Cinematic Experience at Home

Meta and TikTok have taken the European Union to court over a fee which they claim is unfair and based on flawed calculations. Speaking before Europe’s second-highest court on Wednesday, the two tech giants argued that the EU’s supervisory levy under the Digital Services Act (DSA) is both disproportionate and lacking in transparency. The law, which came into effect in 2022, requires 19 large online platforms to pay a fee—up to 0.05% of their annual global net income—to help fund the European Commission's work overseeing their compliance with digital rules.Stating that the company is not trying to avoid paying the fees, Meta’s lawyer questioned the Commission’s method for calculating the fee. In a General Court in Luxembourg, he said it was wrongly based on the overall group’s revenue, not the revenue of the EU-based subsidiary, and that the company still doesn’t know exactly how the final amount was reached.TikTok’s lawyer echoed similar concerns, calling the fee “unfair and disproportionate.” He said the method used inflated TikTok’s payment and even required the company to help cover the cost for other platforms. He also accused the EU of counting the same user more than once if they switch between devices, which he said led to double-counting.Both companies argued that the Commission went beyond its legal powers by using group-level profits to calculate the cap for the fee.In response, the European Commission’s lawyer defended the system, saying that when a company files consolidated financial reports, it’s reasonable to use group-level financial data. She also said that companies had access to enough information to understand how the fee was determined and that there was no violation of their rights.","The two tech giants argued that the EU’s supervisory levy under the Digital Services Act (DSA) is both disproportionate and lacking in transparency.

8 simple tips to help you improve efficiency of your car’s AC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/8-simple-tips-to-help-you-improve-efficiency-of-your-cars-ac/articleshow/121792931.cms,"8 simple tips to improve your car’s AC

Park in the shade

Vent hot air before starting AC

Use the Recirculation Mode

Don't keep it on max fan speed constantly

Get regular AC servicing

Clean or replace air filters

Use a sunshade

Turn off AC before turning off engine

As temperatures soar, a well-functioning car air conditioner becomes less of a luxury and more of a necessity. However, many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling. A few simple practices can significantly improve its efficiency, save fuel, and extend the life of your cooling system. By incorporating these simple habits, you can ensure your car's AC runs more efficiently, keeping you comfortable while potentially saving on fuel costs and maintenance. Here are eight simple tips to help you stay cool on the road.This might seem obvious, but parking under a tree or in a covered area can make a huge difference. A car parked in direct sunlight can reach internal temperatures far exceeding the outside air, forcing your AC to work much harder to cool it down.Before turning on your AC, roll down your windows for a minute or two, especially if your car has been sitting in the sun. This allows trapped hot air to escape, reducing the initial load on your air conditioning system.Once your car is cool, switch your AC to recirculation mode. This feature re-circulates the air already inside the cabin, rather than constantly trying to cool hot outside air. This is much more efficient and helps maintain a comfortable temperature.While it's tempting to use the highest fan setting, keeping it on maximum continuously isn't always the most efficient. Once the cabin is cool, reduce the fan speed to maintain comfort, which puts less strain on the system.Just like your car's engine, your AC system needs regular maintenance. Getting it serviced annually ensures that refrigerant levels are optimal, components are clean, and there are no leaks. A well-maintained system runs more efficiently.A clogged cabin air filter can restrict airflow and make your AC work harder. Check your car's manual for recommended replacement intervals and clean or replace the filter as needed. This simple step can dramatically improve airflow and efficiency.When parking outdoors, a reflective sunshade in your windshield can significantly reduce the internal temperature build-up. This minimises the initial cooling effort required from your AC.It's a good habit to turn off your AC a few minutes before you reach your destination or turn off the engine. This allows the system to dry out, preventing mold and mildew growth in the vents, which can lead to unpleasant odours and reduce efficiency over time.","Many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling.

Microsoft has disabled a 'key feature' to enhance Windows security,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-has-disabled-a-key-feature-to-enhance-windows-security/articleshow/121891649.cms,"How Windows Hello technology works



HP EliteBook Ultra G1i Review: Thin, light, power in a premium package

Microsoft has enhanced the security of the Windows operating system but for that it has disabled a crucial feature. The company has quietly updated Windows Hello 's face unlock feature, which now prevents it from working in dark rooms. As per the tech giant, this isn't a bug but a deliberate change made in April to patch a serious spoofing vulnerability. While the fix enhances security, it removes a key functionality many Windows 11 users relied on.The change, spotted by Windows Central, has been noted by some Surface Laptop users who claimed that they can no longer use their face to sign into their laptop in a dark room.“After installing this update or a later Windows update, for enhanced security, Windows Hello facial recognition requires color cameras to see a visible face when signing in,” says Microsoft in its April Windows Update patch notes.Windows Hello leverages a combination of both colour cameras and infrared (IR) sensors, allowing for authentication even in complete darkness.The vulnerability was discovered by researchers at Nanyang Technological University“Automated recognition mechanism with inadequate detection or handling of adversarial input perturbations in Windows Hello allows an unauthorized attacker to perform spoofing locally,” the researchers said.The flaw was rated ""important"" by Microsoft, though the company noted it was ""less likely"" to be exploited by malicious actors locally on a device, and it has not been publicly disclosed or exploited.Meanwhile, for users who rely heavily on dark-room unlocking, a temporary workaround exists: disabling the webcam in Windows 11's Device Manager. However, there is a catch. This 'change' by users renders the camera unusable for all other applications, including video calls, making it an impractical solution for most users and a clear trade-off between convenience and security.","Microsoft has quietly updated Windows Hello's face unlock feature, which now prevents it from working in dark rooms.

China’s first clinical trial of a technology that allows signals from the brain to control an external device has proved successful, making it only the second country after the US to reach this stage, a report has said. Until now, Elon Musk-owned Neuralink has been able to successfully implant a brain chip in a human, enabling him to carry out tasks like control a computer mouse using his thoughts.Citing Global Times, Bloomberg reported that Chinese researchers used brain-computer interfaces, or BCI, a wireless invasive implant in a patient with tetraplegia in March. Only a few weeks after the surgery, the patient was able to play racing games and chess on the computer using only the mind to control the electronic devices, it said, citing a statement from the Shanghai-based Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology.The implant used in the Chinese trial is said to be the world’s smallest so far, with a diameter of 26 millimeters and thickness less than 6 millimeters and is over 100 times more flexible than the one developed by Neuralink.For the next stage, the team plans to enable the patient to operate a robotic arm using thoughts to perform more complex physical actions such as grasping and holding a cup. The centre launched the trial in collaboration with Fudan University’s Huashan Hospital.The centre said the BCI system could get approval from the authorities, and be able to enter the market as early as 2028.BCI is an emerging technology to help restore functionality to people with paralysis, and Neuralink, co-founded by Elon Musk appears to be the only company that has successfully trialled the implant in humans.","China is only the second country after the US to reach this stage.

A Dutch court has confirmed a 2021 consumer watchdog ruling that Apple abused its dominant position by imposing unfair conditions on dating app providers within its App Store. The Rotterdam District Court has reportedly confimred that the Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) was justified in imposing an order with a penalty for non-compliance against the tech giant. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the court's ruling supports ACM's finding that dating app providers were compelled to use Apple’s own payment system. These providers were also restricted from referring to payment options outside the App Store and were required to pay the company a 30% commission (or 15% for smaller providers), the report noted.In a statement to Reuters, an Apple spokesperson said:In 2021, the ACM imposed a fine of 50 million euros ($58 million) on Apple for failing to comply with mandated changes to its App Store, the Reuters report added. At that time, the regulator said that this fine was necessary to stop practices that violated European Union antitrust laws.Earlier this month, the company filed a legal challenge against a European Union (EU) order requiring it to open its closely controlled ecosystem to competitors such as Meta and Google.The company criticised the Digital Markets Act (DMA), calling it ""deeply flawed"" and arguing that the EU’s demands are ""unreasonable"" and could ""hamper innovation.""As reported by Reuters, Apple stated that the EU's requirements create “a process that is unreasonable, costly, and stifles innovation.”Apple said in a statement to Reuters.",A Dutch court has confirmed a 2021 consumer watchdog ruling that Apple abused its dominant position by imposing unfair conditions on dating app providers.

"After Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis too disagrees with Anthropic CEO's AI job warning",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-nvidias-jensen-huang-google-ai-ceo-demis-hassabis-too-disagrees-with-anthropic-ceos-ai-job-warning/articleshow/121889566.cms,"AI job warning: What Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said about



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says Anthropic CEO is very wrong



Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis said about AI job warning



After Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s recent dismissal of apocalyptic job-loss predictions, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has also dismissed the pessimistic predictions made by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei . Recently, Amodei warned of significant white-collar job displacement, Hassabis and Huang present a more optimistic point of view. Speaking at the SXSW London festival, Hassabis stated that AI will disrupt traditional roles but also emphasised that it will also create valuable and new jobs, particularly for those with STEM skills and technical fluency. Hassabis has asked the students and professionals to embrace AI tools and also build foundational knowledge in math, physics, and computer science, calling them essential for navigating the AI-driven future.Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that artificial intelligence could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years, potentially driving US unemployment to 20%. The stark prediction comes as AI technology rapidly advances, with sectors including technology, finance, law, and consulting facing the greatest disruption.""We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,"" Amodei told Axios in an interview published Wednesday. The 42-year-old CEO emphasized that most people remain unaware of the impending transformation, calling it a reality that ""sounds crazy, and people just don't believe it.""Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris. Huang specifically challenged Amodei’s recent claim that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, dismissing the notion as overly alarmist.“I pretty much disagree with almost everything [Amodei] says,” Huang stated, critiquing three key points he attributed to Amodei: that AI is so dangerous only a select few should develop it, that it’s too costly for widespread development, and that its power will lead to massive job losses. “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe,” Huang added, advocating for transparent and collaborative AI development.Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis has also expressed less concern about widespread job displacement due to AI. While acknowledging that AI will inevitably transform roles and that humanity is undergoing a shift even greater than the Industrial Revolution, Hassabis remains optimistic about human adaptability. He believes AI will lead to the emergence of ""new very valuable jobs,"" particularly benefiting ""technically savvy people who are at the forefront of using these technologies.""Hassabis's primary concern regarding AI lies not in job loss, but in its potential misuse by malicious actors. He stresses the urgent need for global regulation and an international framework to govern AI, likening it to a ""digital Geneva Convention,"" to prevent powerful AI systems from falling into the wrong hands.",Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that artificial intelligence could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years.

Why Meta's models are reproducing exact text



What this means for Meta



Facebook parent Meta ’s newest AI model, Llama 3.1, has been found to replicate passages from well-known books, including Harry Potter, far more frequently than anticipated, as per a new report which also says that many of these works remain under copyright. Researchers claim that the AI has memorised roughly 42% of the first Harry Potter book and can accurately reproduce 50-word sections about half the time. The study, conducted by experts from Stanford, Cornell, and West Virginia University, examined how five leading AI models processed the Books3 dataset, which includes thousands of copyrighted titles.""Llama 3.1 70B—a mid-sized model Meta released in July 2024—is far more likely to reproduce Harry Potter text than any of the other four models, the researchers found ""Interestingly, Llama 1 65B, a similar-sized model released in February 2023, had memorized only 4.4 percent of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. This suggests that despite the potential legal liability, Meta did not do much to prevent memorization as it trained Llama 3. At least for this book, the problem got much worse between Llama 1 and Llama 3,"" the researchers wrote.Meta’s Llama 3.1 has been noted for retaining large portions of well-known books, including The Hobbit, 1984, and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. In contrast, earlier versions, such as Llama 1, only memorized around 4% of Harry Potter. This suggests that the newer model is preserving significantly more copyrighted content.Researchers suggest several reasons why Meta's AI models may be copying text verbatim. One possibility is that the same books were repeatedly used during training, reinforcing memorisation rather than generalising language patterns.Others speculate that training data could include excerpts from fan websites, reviews, or academic papers, leading the model to inadvertently retain copyrighted content. Additionally, adjustments to the training process may have amplified this issue without developers realizing the extent of its impact.These findings intensify concerns about how AI models are trained and whether they might be violating copyright laws. As authors and publishers push back against unauthorised use of their work, this could become a major challenge for tech companies like Meta.Earlier this year, The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement, alleging that their AI models, including ChatGPT, were trained on copyrighted articles without permission. According to the Times, OpenAI, “can generate output that recites Times' content verbatim, closely summarizes it, and mimics its expressive style.” It said that the AI company essentially stole their intellectual property.","Llama 3.1 has been noted for retaining large portions of well-known books, including The Hobbit, 1984, and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.

Former Apple design director – Bob Baxley has warned professionals switching jobs not to carry over the culture of their previous company. “My biggest point on this topic is that when you go into a new culture you really need to slow down, deeply observe, don't judge or compare, and then when you have a reasonable handle on things, reflect on the best ways to express the values from the old place with behaviors that are appropriate to the new,” he told Business Insider.Speaking on Lenny's Podcast, Baxley shared a personal lesson from his own career move. He said “I think my own particular mistake, and I've seen this with some other Apple executives as well, is we went directly from Apple — I left Apple on a Friday and I started Pinterest on a Monday”. “And I didn't give myself time to recalibrate to the Pinterest culture,” he added.Stating that Apple’s working environment has a way of sticking with you, he stated that most tech companies have a “really powerful cultures”. He said “I came in thinking I was supposed to behave the way I behaved at Apple, which is very direct, fighting hard. It's very — everybody cares about each other, it's never insulting, but it's intense”. “That's not really where Pinterest was at the time.”""You get kind of indoctrinated into all those standards and it's really deep. It infuses all of your behavior and how you conduct yourself in the company, away from the company,"" he said. ""And so, I think it's pretty hard to immigrate successfully from one of those environments to another.""He cited Hiroki Asai as a prime example of how taking a break can lead to a smoother transition. Asai, Apple’s former Vice President of Global Marketing, took several years off for what he called a “re-wirement” before eventually joining Airbnb , according to his LinkedIn profile. Baxley noted that other ex-Apple colleagues who took time off before starting new roles adjusted more easily than those who jumped in immediately, like he did.He said “It also should be noted that he had — it was a multi-year gap between the time he left Apple and the time he started Airbnb”.""At Apple, I think it was Tim or Steve, used to talk about the Apple car wash,"" he added. ""That when you started Apple, they kind of had to take you through the car wash and get off all that stuff that you'd accumulated at other places. It turns out there's a car wash you need to go through when you leave Apple as well.""""The thing I took away from Apple, and I think this is true for anybody changing from one major culture to another, is most likely, the new place hires you because of the values of the organization you left, but not the behaviors,"" he said.","Former Apple design director Bob Baxley has warned professionals switching jobs not to carry over the culture of their previous company. “My biggest point on this topic is that when you go into a new culture you really need to slow down, deeply observe, don't judge or compare,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121888465,imgsize-16844,width-400,resizemode-4/Former-Apple-executive-to-professionals-When-joining-a-new-company-dont-judge-or-compare-then-when-you-have.jpg"

Gmail's built-in security features:



Simple tips for staying safe:



With the holiday season in full swing, Google is reminding Gmail users to be vigilant against festive scams. The company is highlighting its built-in Gmail security features and offering valuable tips to help users avoid falling prey to fraudulent emails.“Thanks to new Gmail security features we launched over the past year, users reported 35% fewer scams (phishing, malware, etc.) hitting inboxes during the first month of the holiday season compared to last year. Millions more unwanted and potentially dangerous messages were blocked before they even reached inboxes,” said Google in a blog post.Here’s Google shared a scam warning and tips to keep you safe.* Phishing scams : These emails often come disguised as greetings or order confirmations from legitimate companies. They may contain malicious links or attachments that can steal your personal information or infect your device with malware.* Fake shipping notifications: Fraudsters may impersonate delivery services to trick you into clicking on links or providing sensitive information like passwords or credit card details.* Spoofed charity appeals: These emails manipulate users' generosity by posing as reputable charities. Always research the organization before donating online.Fortunately, Gmail offers several robust security features to protect users from scams:* Spam filters: Gmail automatically filters out a significant amount of spam and phishing emails.* Warning labels: Many suspicious emails are clearly marked with warnings like ""Be careful with this message"" or ""External sender.""* Two-factor authentication: This extra layer of security makes it harder for unauthorised users to access your account even if they possess your password.* Beware of unsolicited emails: Don't click on links or open attachments in emails from unknown senders.* Verify sender addresses: Double-check the email address before clicking on anything. Legitimate companies will use their official domains.* Don't be pressured into acting fast: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into making mistakes.* Research before donating: Before you donate to a charity, research them online to ensure their legitimacy.* Report suspicious emails: Report any suspicious emails to Google to help improve its spam filters.","Google is reminding Gmail users to be vigilant against festive scams.

ChatGPT , the chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI , is now more accessible than ever. Users can now interact with the AI chatbot through a dedicated phone number (1-800-CHATGPT) or via WhatsApp.According to the company, users in the US will receive 15 minutes of free usage per month through the phone number while ChatGPT on WhatsApp is “available everywhere ChatGPT is”.“To start, people in the U.S. will get 15 minutes per month of voice calling. This is an experimental way to talk to ChatGPT, so availability and limits may change,” the company added.This new feature essentially offers a simplified and convenient way to experience ChatGPT, especially for those unfamiliar with AI or who prefer using familiar communication channels.According to a report by The Verge, OpenAI's chief product officer, Kevin Weil, revealed that this feature was developed in just a few weeks. The phone line utilizes OpenAI's Realtime API, while the WhatsApp integration is powered by GPT-4o mini through the WhatsApp API.However, OpenAI emphasises that existing users who require more advanced features, higher usage limits, and personalisation should continue using their regular ChatGPT accounts through traditional channels.Users can talk to ChatGPT by calling 1-800-ChatGPT, which is nothing but 1-800-242-8478 in the US.“Call 1-800-CHAT-GPT. It even works on flip phones and landlines,” the company added.“To send a message on WhatsApp, just type in 1-800-242-8478 as the recipient,” the ChatGPT-maker said.The development comes soon after the OpenAI announced 12-day release event, dubbed ""ship-mas,"" with a flurry of announcements and new features. Among the most notable developments is the availability of Sora, OpenAI's AI video generation tool.","ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, is now more accessible than ever.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ( CISA ) has issued an urgent recommendation for senior government officials and politicians. It has published a “Mobile Communications Best Practice Guidance”, urging them to immediately switch to end-to-end encrypted messaging apps.In a written advisory, CISA urged individuals in senior government and political positions to prioritise the use of end-to-end encrypted communications to protect their sensitive information. This encryption method ensures that only the sender and recipient can read the messages, preventing unauthorised access even if the communication channel is compromised.This guidance comes in the wake of significant cyberattacks on major US telecom companies attributed to Chinese hackers .“The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has identified cyber espionage activity by People’s Republic of China (PRC) government-affiliated threat actors targeting commercial telecommunications infrastructure. This activity enabled the theft of customer call records and the compromise of private communications for a limited number of highly targeted individuals,” the guaidance said.CISA's recommendation highlights the growing concern over the severity of these recent cyberattacks, dubbed ""Salt Typhoon."" Last week, Senator Ben Ray Lujan called it ""the largest telecommunications hack in our nation's history.""“While applicable to all audiences, this guidance specifically addresses “highly targeted” individuals who are in senior government or senior political positions and likely to possess information of interest to these threat actors. CISA is releasing this best practice guidance to promote protections for mobile communications from exploitation by PRC-affiliated and other malicious cyber threat actors,” the guidline added.It added that these individuals “should assume that all communications between mobile devices—including government and personal devices—and internet services are at risk of interception or manipulation.”It highlighted that while no single solution eliminates all risks, implementing these best practices significantly enhances protection of sensitive communications against government-affiliated and other malicious cyber actors.","The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ( CISA) has issued an urgent recommendation for senior government officials and politicians.

Microsoft president makes this 'China and Russia' request to Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-president-makes-this-china-and-russia-request-to-donald-trump/articleshow/116449017.cms,"Microsoft President Brad Smith REUTERS/Pedro Nunes

Microsoft’s president Brad Smith recently called on US President-elect Donald Trump to “push harder” against cyber attacks from Russia, China and Iran amid a wave of state-sponsored hacks targeting US government officials and election campaigns. Brad Smith, who is also the Big Tech company’s vice chair and top legal officer, told the Financial Times that cyber security “deserves to be a more prominent issue of international relations” and appealed to the US president-elect to send a “strong message”.“I hope that the Trump administration will push harder against nation-state cyber attacks, especially from Russia and China and Iran,” Smith said. “We should not tolerate the level of attacks that we are seeing today.”Ransomware attacks against US businesses have surged in recent years, often perpetrated by criminal gangs that Smith said were “tolerated . . . and in some cases even facilitated” by the Russian government.Recently, US law enforcement agencies accused China of mounting a widespread cyber espionage campaign, by breaking into several American telecoms networks in the run-up to this month’s election.Smith said Joe Biden’s administration had made “tremendous progress in strengthening cyber security protections” but added: “There’s more steps that are needed, especially in dissuading and deterring these other countries from unleashing these cyber attacks.”A recent Microsoft study found that its customers face more than 600mn cyber attacks every day, with criminal gangs and “nation-state groups” increasingly teaming up to share tools and even conducting joint operations.Smith testified before the US Senate in September that Russia, China and Iran had stepped up their digital efforts to interfere in global elections this year, including in the US.However, Microsoft’s own security standards have come under fire in recent months. A damning report by the US Cyber Safety Review Board in March said its security culture was “inadequate”, pointing to a “cascade . . . of avoidable errors” that last year allowed Chinese hackers to access hundreds of email accounts, including those belonging to senior US government security officials, that were hosted on Microsoft’s cloud systems. Post this, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella reportedly told employees that the company would prioritise security “above all else”, including by tying staff remuneration to security.","Brad Smith said cyber security ‘deserves to be a more prominent issue of international relations’ He appealed to the US president-elect to send a ‘strong message’ to Russia, China and Iran.

Who is Nima Momeni

Bob Lee killing 'shocked' Silicon Valley

San Francisco DA Jenkins calls out Elon Musk

Conflicting accounts and key evidence

Prosecution's Argument:

Defense's Argument:

A San Francisco jury convicted Nima Momeni , a 40-year-old tech consultant, of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of Bob Lee, the renowned founder of Cash App. Lee, 43, a prominent figure in the tech world, was killed in April 2023. Momeni, who was facing first-degree murder charges, now faces a sentence of 16 years to life in prison. His attorney, Tony Brass, has stated his intention to appeal the verdict.The tragic incident unfolded in the early morning hours of April 4, 2023, when Lee was found bleeding profusely in a doorway on a San Francisco street. He had sustained stab wounds to the hip and heart and had called 911 for help before succumbing to his injuries at a hospital.According to his Linkedin page, Nima Momeni is the owner of Expand IT. His profile describes the company as providing IT solutions in the Bay Area since 2010.Lee, a highly respected figure in the tech community, was known for his contributions to Google Android and Square's Cash App. He later served as a top executive at MobileCoin. His untimely death, which occurred while he was visiting San Francisco from his new home in Miami, shocked the tech world and sparked widespread concern about safety in the city.The killing of Bob Lee, a well-respected and influential figure in the tech industry, had a significant impact. It sparked widespread discussion about safety concerns in San Francisco and fueled speculation about the city's post-pandemic challenges.District Attorney Brooke Jenkins expressed relief at the jury's verdict, stating that she feared a mistrial. Momeni is scheduled to be sentenced in February or March.San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins reportedly thanked the attorneys who prosecuted the case outside the courtroom after the guilty verdict was read. ""I knew was confident that we had the best two handling this case,"" Jenkins said, as per a report in SFGate. ""And I think the verdict was a testament to the hard work they put in, to the great lawyers that they are, and to their commitment to justice and to making sure that this family received justice.""Tesla CEO Elon Musk , after Lee was stabbed in April 2023, reportedly blamed the widely discussed attack on San Francisco’s governance. He wrote on X, “Violent crime in SF is horrific and even if attackers are caught, they are often released immediately. Is the city taking stronger action to incarcerate repeat violent offenders @BrookeJenkinsSF?”""I think that hopefully now, we have once again established what truly happened here. We all know that after Bob Lee was murdered, Elon Musk took to Twitter to make an effort to really shame San Francisco, and to make it seem like this was about lawlessness in San Francisco and about what's going on in our streets,"" Jenkins said.“After Elon Musk’s tweet, within 24 hours, it had 6 million views worldwide,” Jenkins said, “and that inhibits San Francisco from being able to thrive. And he was incorrect.”The prosecution and defense presented starkly different narratives of the events leading to Lee's death.Prosecutors argued that Momeni, driven by anger over Lee's alleged involvement in his sister's drug abuse, fatally stabbed Lee with a paring knife.Momeni's lawyers maintained that he acted in self-defense, claiming that Lee lunged at him with the knife after a ""bad joke"" during a social gathering.Key evidence in the case included DNA evidence found on the knife handle, which matched Momeni's DNA. The prosecution emphasized the lack of a 911 call from Momeni, casting doubt on his self-defense claim.","Nima Momeni, a 40-year-old tech consultant, was convicted of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of Bob Lee, the founder of Cash App. Lee, 43, a prominent figure in the tech world, was killed in April 2023.

What TP-Link has to say

The US government reportedly is investigating Chinese router manufacturer TP-Link over potential national security risks , with authorities considering a ban on the sale of its home internet devices in the US as early as next year.Citing people familiar with the matter, a report by the Wall Street Journal said that concerns have arisen about the security of TP-Link routers after a recent Microsoft analysis revealed that a Chinese hacking group has compromised thousands of these devices to launch cyberattacks against Western targets, including government organisations, think tanks, and defense contractors.Notably, TP-Link holds a dominant position in the US home and small business router market with a 65% share, the report said, adding that its routers are widely available on Amazon.com and are even used by the Defense Department and other federal agencies.The sources also claim that TP-Link routers often ship with security vulnerabilities that the company fails to address promptly. Furthermore, TP-Link has been criticised for its lack of engagement with security researchers who identify these vulnerabilities.TP-Link, which operates in the US through a California-based unit, maintains that it takes security seriously and addresses known vulnerabilities.“We welcome any opportunities to engage with the U.S. government to demonstrate that our security practices are fully in line with industry security standards, and to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to the US market, US consumers, and addressing US national security risks,” the spokeswoman was quoted as saying..Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington criticised the US investigation, accusing it of using national security as a pretext to “suppress Chinese companies”He added that China will “resolutely defend” the lawful rights and interests of Chinese firms.",The US government reportedly is investigating Chinese router manufacturer TP- Link over potential national security risks.

NPCI issues an advisory about 'online scams' that Indians are losing crores to,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/npci-warns-phonepe-gpay-and-other-upi-users-about-scam-that-indians-are-losing-crores-to/articleshow/116352174.cms,"What NPCI advisory says

What is digital arrest scam



How to identify a digital arrest scam

Unexpected Contact from ‘Officials’: Be cautious if someone claims to be from government agencies like the police, CBI, income tax officers, or customs agents, contacts you. Be cautious especially if they claim urgent legal action is being initiated or warranted. They might allege that you or one of your family members is involved in a serious crime like money laundering, tax evasion, or drug trafficking.

Fear-based language and urgency: Scammers may request video calls, disguising themselves in police uniforms, using government logos, or creating official-sounding background noise to appear legitimate. They often threaten arrest or immediate legal action, demanding a quick response and using legal terms to sound convincing. In some cases, they create a police station-like set up to further convince victims of their credibility.

Request for sensitive information or payment: Scammers may ask for personal information or demand large sums of money, promising that this will clear up your involvement in the alleged crime. They may also coerce you to transfer money to their account until the investigation is complete. Terms like “clearing your name”, “assisting with the investigation”, or “refundable security deposit/escrow account” might be used by them to persuade you into transferring money to specified bank accounts or UPI IDs.

Tips to stay safe

Pause and Verify: If you receive unexpected calls or messages about legal issues, take a moment to verify. Stay calm, as scammers rely on fear and urgency. Real government and law enforcement agencies will never ask for money or investigate cases through phone or video calls. Always confirm the caller’s identity and consult trusted sources before taking any action.

Use Support Channels: Report suspicious numbers to the national cybercrime helpline by dialing 1930 or the Department of Telecommunication (https://sancharsaathi.gov.in/sfc/).

The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country. As digital payments, including UPI, gain widespread adoption, incidents of online scams have risen significantly. Indians, as mentioned by PM Modi in one of the episodes of Mann ki Baat have lost Rs 120.3 crore through digital arrest scam s. In its advisory, the NPCI highlights the critical need for awareness and vigilance to protect against such fraudulent activities as India advances towards a digital-first economy.In a press release, NPCI says “Digital payments are now accessible nationwide, driving India towards a digital-first economy. They offer both security and convenience. However, it's crucial to use digital payments safely and avoid online scams. Early identification of potential scams helps protect you and your loved ones, fostering a safer, less-cash economy, for everyone.”The 'Digital Arrest' scam is a type of online fraud where cybercriminals trick individuals into believing they are under investigation or at risk of arrest by law enforcement or financial authorities. Scammers often impersonate government officials, police officers, or financial regulators and use fear tactics to manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information or transferring money. Some of the common tactics used in the scam include fake calls or messages, threat of arrest and demand for payment.As per NPCI, you can identify a digital arrest scam by keeping an eye for the following","The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme. In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

“#Vi5G is here. It's On NSA. Location: Supreme court metro station, Delhi”

What is an NSA 5G service



Vodafone Idea (Vi) has officially confirmed the launch of its 5G services in select circles. The third-biggest telecom operator in the country joined the 5G race in the country after almost one and a half years since Airtel and Jio started offering 5G services in 2022. The company took to the social media platform X (earlier Twitter) to share an official statement on the 5G rollout.In the X post, the telco wrote:Apart from this, the company hasn't shared any other details about the plans that will support 5G connectivity or when to expect a full-fledged rollout and it's important to note that Vi's 5G service is not yet widely available. It's currently active in select locations across India, including major cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru and more.The telco has shared a list of cities with the TOI Tech team where Vi’s 5G services are currently available:Vi has reportedly deployed its 5G network on both the 3.3GHz and 26GHz spectrum bands. The service is also said to be available to both prepaid and postpaid subscribers on a limited scale. Several users have also taken to social media to share screenshots of their devices connected to Vi's 5G network. An X user shared screenshots to confirm the availability of Vi’s 5G service on his device. The user wrote:Vi's 5G network, similar to Airtel's, is expected to use non-standalone (NSA) technology. This approach involves upgrading existing infrastructure to deliver 5G services, making it a more budget-friendly option compared to Jio's standalone (SA) 5G network. This suggests that some devices which exclusively support SA 5G, will be incompatible with Vi's network.","Vodafone Idea (Vi) has officially confirmed the launch of its 5G services in select circles.

Hi all,

I've been going through our attendance data. It is shocking that a lot of people have very poor attendance.

I would imagine everyone has the basic self respect to not fleece the company by not even turning up for work. It's even disrespectful to those colleagues who genuinely work hard and contribute. And we don't have any WFH policy expect for genuine needs.

Monday onwards a more stringent attendance expectation will start. And those of you who have misused the freedom so far, HR will be having a conversation with you. The best excuse I've heard so far is that the facial recognition system data is wrong. Let's not insult basic intelligence.

Come to work, do good work, and feel a part of Ola's mission.

Tips to avoid falling victim to dating scams

Verify identity by conducting a reverse image search of their profile photos. Scammers often use stolen images.



Be wary of overly romantic gestures. Take your time to get to know someone before trusting them fully.



Never send money to someone you haven’t met in person, no matter how convincing their story may be.

Paypal founder Peter Thiel: Silicon Valley called staff back to office as they realised that employees weren’t actually working,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/paypal-founder-peter-thiel-silicon-valley-called-staff-back-to-office-as-they-realised-that-employees-werent-actually-working/articleshow/116403476.cms,"Peter Thiel

Employees working remotely weren't actually working

Companies have offered various reasons for pushing employees back into offices, but Paypal founder Peter Thiel provides a starkly blunt explanation for the corporate shift away from remote work. He argues that Silicon Valley discovered a significant portion of remote workers weren't actually productive. Peter Thiel is a close friend of Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Thiel is also part of the famous Paypal Mafia. The term Paypal Mafia was coined in a 2007 Fortune cover story, which examined the outsize influence within the tech scene of a group of men who had launched a payments startup called PayPal almost a decade earlier. When PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002, these newly capitalised techies dispersed like seeds to germinate new tech companies. The names include Tesla, LinkedIn, Palantir Technologies, SpaceX, Slide, YouTube , Yelp, and Yammer.In a TV interview recently, Thiel contrasted the current situation with the pre-pandemic era, citing a statistic that around 94% of U.S. federal government workers were working from home. He then asserted that Silicon Valley's experience with remote work over one or two years revealed its ineffectiveness. ""When people didn’t come into the office, they weren’t working,"" Thiel stated. He described the initial period as one where worker power allowed them to ""insist on not working."" However, he continued, after two years, companies ""fired a bunch of these people and reasserted control because you realize, wow, there were all these people we hired and they’re not working. And it doesn’t matter, and we can just get rid of them.""Thiel's comments resonate with the wave of tech layoffs that occurred in late 2022 and early 2023, impacting tens of thousands of employees at major companies like Google , Meta, and Amazon . These layoffs coincided with the waning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thiel's perspective suggests a correlation between remote work, perceived low productivity, and these mass layoffs. He implies that tech companies realized the dispensability of many remote workers, leading to their dismissal with minimal impact on business operations.This aligns with observations that the large-scale layoffs had little discernible effect on the performance of these tech giants. Amazon announced the official end of remote work for all employees starting in 2025 (though some flexibility remains for certain roles and teams). Meta and Google have also been actively encouraging employees to return to physical offices, implementing policies like requiring a certain number of in-office days per week. This shift by major tech players signals a potential decline in the prevalence of remote work as the pandemic becomes a more distant memory. Some sources suggest that the return-to-office push is also linked to concerns about maintaining company culture, fostering innovation through in-person collaboration, and managing performance more effectively. Additionally, commercial real estate interests and the desire to revitalize urban centers may be contributing factors.","Paypal founder Peter Thiel argues that Silicon Valley discovered a significant portion of remote workers weren't actually productive.

"How Nigerian scammers used WhatsApp, Instagram in international romance and crypto scam",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-nigerian-scammers-used-whatsapp-instagram-in-international-romance-and-crypto-scam/articleshow/116402642.cms,"Representative image

How scammers targeted their victims

Nigerian authorities have busted a major international scam operation that lured victims with promises of romance and lucrative cryptocurrency investments, a report has said. In a raid on a seven-story building in Lagos, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested 792 suspects, including 148 Chinese nationals and 40 Filipinos.According to a report by news agency Reuters, these suspects were detained on December 10. It added that the building housed a sophisticated call centre where scammers targeted victims primarily from the Americas and Europe.The operation involved a network of Nigerian and foreign nationals working in tandem. Nigerian accomplices used to initiate contact with potential victims online, building trust and establishing relationships, the report said.The report also highlighted that scammers used instant messaging app like WhatsApp , and social media platforms Instagram to target people. They employed a combination of romance scams and fraudulent investment schemes to defraud unsuspecting individuals.“Nigerian accomplices were recruited by the foreign kingpins to prospect for victims online through phishing, targeting mostly Americans, Canadians, Mexicans and several others from European countries,” said EFCC spokesperson Wilson Uwujaren.Once victims were hooked, foreign operatives would take over, pressuring them to invest in bogus cryptocurrency schemes and other non-existent projects.“The Nigerians would win the confidence of the victims, and then the foreigners would take over the actual task of defrauding them,” explained EFCC spokesperson Wilson Uwujaren.The EFCC seized computers, phones, and vehicles during the raid and is collaborating with international partners to investigate potential links to organised crime.","The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested 792 suspects, including 148 Chinese nationals and 40 Filipinos.

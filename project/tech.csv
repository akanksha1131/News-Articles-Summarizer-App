Elon Musk, Jack Ma and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian on work-life balance debate



Multimillionaire musician and tech entrepreneur Will.i.am has joined the work-life balance debate, challenging conventional wisdom regarding the discussion. He argued that those seeking entrepreneurial success should prioritise their dreams over traditional boundaries. The Grammy-winning artist, who founded the AI company FYI, asserts that achieving ambitious goals requires a relentless dedication that transcends the typical 9-to-5 workday.In a recent interview with Fortune, Will.i.am dismissed the concept of work-life balance as being inherently tied to supporting someone else's vision.“If you’re trying to build something that doesn’t exist, it’s about dream-reality balance,” the singer told the publication.“Work-life balance means that you’re working for somebody else’s dream. You just have a job supporting somebody else’s dream, and you want to balance your work and your life. But if it’s dream-reality balance, then it’s not work. It’s a dream that you’re trying to put into reality, and you’re ignoring your current reality,” he added.Will.i.am revealed that his own work schedule extends far beyond standard hours, encompassing both his tech venture and his creative pursuits.He works from 9am to 5pm on his AI company, and then transitions to his creative projects until 9 pm. This dedication, he argues, is essential for transforming a dream into a tangible reality.“I’m not really paying attention to this reality,” he stated.“I’m trying to bring that one [a new business venture or idea] here and focusing on how do I get people who believe in this dream to help me materialise it? So for that, you have to make some type of sacrifice to bring this thing that doesn’t exist here,” he added.In the past, prominent tech leaders like Elon Musk, Jack Ma, and Alexis Ohanian pushed for a departure from conventional notions of work-life balance, advocating for intense dedication and flexibility in pursuit of success. Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is known for his relentless work ethic. He recounted tales of living within his factories and sleeping on the floor to meet critical production deadlines. Musk has also publicly criticised what he perceives as a declining work ethic in the US, contrasting it with the extended hours commonly observed in countries like China.Similarly, Jack Ma, the co-founder of Alibaba, defended China’s “996” work schedule – working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. In 2019, Ma described this intense schedule as a “huge blessing,” framing it as a privilege for those passionate about their careers.Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian asserted in August 2023 that the idea of maintaining an equal focus on both work and personal life is a “farce.” Ohanian advocates for a more fluid approach, suggesting that balance involves shifting priorities according to evolving needs.","Will.i.am dismissed the concept of work-life balance as being inherently tied to supporting someone else's vision.

Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos makes acting debut with Apple TV+ series that premieres globally on March 26,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-ceo-ted-sarandos-makes-acting-debut-with-apple-tv-series-that-premieres-globally-on-march-26/articleshow/119441928.cms,"Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos on Apple TV content strategy

Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos makes a surprising acting debut, playing himself in an episode of Apple TV+'s new series, ""The Studio,"" which premieres globally today, March 26. The satirical comedy, created by Seth Rogen, offers a ""Curb Your Enthusiasm""-style take on Hollywood, and features Sarandos in a cameo at the Golden Globes. In the scene, Sarandos reportedly interacts with Rogen's character, a struggling movie studio head, humorously acknowledging Netflix's competitive presence.In a recent interview to Variety, Sarandos spoke about his acting debut with Apple. Said to be known for his driven nature, Netflix CEO said that he readily agreed to the role, stating, ""I said yes right away. Seth sent it to me, and I thought it was really funny."" He also emphasized his focus on professionalism during filming. ""I was really super conscious about not forgetting my lines. I just didn’t want to slow anything down and cost them money.""""The Studio,"" a ten-part series, marks another collaboration between Apple TV+ and Rogen, following the success of ""Platonic."" Rogen, who also stars as the studio head Matt Remick, revealed to 9to5Mac that his relationship with Sarandos predates Netflix's streaming dominance, dating back to its DVD-by-mail era. Notably, Rogen admitted to bypassing Apple's approval for the cameo. ""I just emailed him. I did not ask our Apple partners if I could do this,"" Rogen said. ""I went ahead and sent him the script and was like, ‘We have this joke. You actually deliver this wisdom that helps permeate throughout my arc in some ways.’ He instantly was like, ‘Yes, if I can make this work in my schedule, I’d love to do it.’”In the Variety interview, Netflix CEO Sarandos also spoke about Apple's content strategy for its streaming service. When asked about Apple TV+, Sarandos said, ""I don’t understand it beyond a marketing play, but they’re really smart people. Maybe they see something we don’t.""","Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos makes a surprising acting debut.

Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger joins faith-focussed AI tech firm: Read his LinkedIn post announcing appointment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-joins-faith-focussed-ai-tech-firm-read-his-linkedin-post-announcing-appointment/articleshow/119430994.cms,"Gelsinger has been connected with Gloo for almost 10 years

Read Pat Gelsinger’s announcement on LinkedIn

For more than four decades, Linda and I have lived our lives at the intersection of technology and faith. Today, that intersection becomes even more profound as we begin a new chapter – a chapter that starts with me taking an expanded role at Gloo. Effective today, I’ve been named Gloo’s executive chair and head of technology.

I’ve been involved with Gloo for almost 10 years, both as a board member and investor. Gloo’s focus on creating a technology platform that connects and catalyzes the faith ecosystem perfectly aligns with my own sense of purpose.

Now more than ever, there is great need for faith-based communities to take an active role in ensuring we shape technology as a force for good. As we’ve seen with social media, the impact of technology evolutions is swift, deep and long lasting. AI is an even more powerful yet nascent tool. It is imperative we ensure AI is used to enhance the human experience, not harm it.

This will form the foundation of my work at Gloo, as I lead the company’s product and engineering efforts, as we continue building one of the world’s first vertical industry clouds for the faith ecosystem. This includes spearheading

Gloo AI

, which is designed to advance values-aligned AI. Across all of our efforts we are deeply committed to open-source, trust through transparency and benchmarking, and licensing of content for training and use of AI.

I see tremendous opportunity ahead for Gloo and I couldn’t be happier to partner with CEO Scott Beck and the rest of the leadership team as we prepare for our next phase of growth.

I will have a few more updates to share on this new chapter in the coming days. Gloo will be a major focus…but there’s a bit more to come.

There’s never been a more thrilling time to be a technologist!

Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has taken on an operational role as head of technology and executive chairman at Gloo, a Boulder, Colorado-based company specialising in technology tools for faith-based organisations. Gelsinger, who departed Intel last year following a disagreement with the board regarding his turnaround strategy, will now spearhead Gloo 's efforts in developing AI-driven solutions, including virtual assistants and chatbots.Gelsinger made the announcement on his LinkedIn profile. The appointment marks his first executive position since his departure from Intel. He brings not only his extensive technological expertise but also a deep personal connection to the faith-based community.Having served as Gloo's non-executive chairman since 2018, and leading a San Francisco Bay area group focused on church expansion for over a decade, Gelsinger is well-versed in the company's mission. He said that he has been connected with Gloo for about 10 years.In his new role, Gelsinger will be responsible for overseeing Gloo's product and engineering divisions, driving the development and implementation of these innovative technologies.Gloo, founded in 2013, recently secured $110 million in growth financing to accelerate its AI initiatives. The company is actively developing AI tools, such as chatbots with ""safe search"" capabilities and responses rooted in the Christian Bible, tailored to the specific needs of faith-based organisations, as per news agency Reuters.","Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has taken on an operational role as head of technology and executive chairman at Gloo.

SAP , a German software company, has overtaken Danish healthcare giant Novo Nordisk to become Europe's largest company by market capitalisation . SAP, Europe's largest software maker, provides critical business application software that companies use for finance, sales, supply chain management, and other essential functions.According to news agency Reuters, as of Monday (March 24) at 0900 GMT, SAP's market value reached $340 billion, slightly edging out Novo Nordisk.The company's shares have experienced a significant surge in recent years, largely driven by optimism surrounding its cloud business , which is positioned to be a major beneficiary of the growing investments in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI).Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk, which had claimed the title of Europe's most valuable company from luxury retailer LVMH in September 2023, has seen its shares underperform in recent months. This downturn followed disappointing trial data for its experimental next-generation obesity drug Cagrisema, which failed to meet investor expectations.This milestone follows SAP's previous achievement last year when it surpassed ASML Holding NV to become Europe's most valuable technology company.The Dutch chip-machine maker experienced a dramatic decline in its market capitalisation, losing over 60 billion euros since its announcement of disappointing guidance. ASML cited delays in chip plant construction and lower-than-expected orders as primary factors behind the revised outlook.ASML’s substantial market value loss, one of the largest one-day declines in European history, created an opening for SAP to reclaim its position as Europe's technology leader.This shift marks a return to a previous competitive dynamic, as ASML had previously fallen behind SAP in market capitalisation back in 2020.","SAP has overtaken Danish healthcare giant Novo Nordisk to become Europe's largest company by market capitalisation.

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban 'wonders' on Donald Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs: What does this do to Amazon ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/billionaire-investor-mark-cuban-wonders-on-donald-trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-what-does-this-do-to-amazon-/articleshow/119429341.cms,"Mark Cuban has raised concerns about new US trade policies potentially affecting Amazon, particularly due to reciprocal tariffs targeting non-tariff barriers and duty rate disparities. These changes could significantly impact Amazon's reliance on international imports and its low-margin business model.

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has raised concerns about how new US trade deficit policies could impact e-commerce giant, Amazon . Cuban referred to an X post that says that the United States allows foreign companies to import goods into the U.S. as foreign importers of record without creating a local entity or hiring anyone in the U.S. “Countries that don’t allow American companies to import into their country without creating a local entity include Vietnam, Mexico, India, China, Malaysia, Philippines, Pakistan, Indonesia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, and many others,” the post reads.“Expect this barrier to be part of the reciprocal tariffs coming out next month. They will target non tariff barriers to balanced trade as well as duty rate disparities,” it further adds. Quoting the post, Cuban wrote “What does this do to Amazon?”. Donald Trump 's reciprocal tariffs refer to his trade policy idea that the US should impose tariffs on foreign goods equal to the tariffs that other countries place on American products. Essentially, if another country charges a 25% tariff on US exports, the US would respond by imposing a 25% tariff on their imports.He often criticized countries like China, the European Union, and Canada for having what he saw as unfair trade barriers against American goods.Amazon reportedly relies heavily on international imports. The reciprocal tariffs could impact the e-commerce giant’s low-margin business.When a user asked “if tariffs are so terrible why does literally every country the US trades with charge them?”, Cuban replied saying “It’s not about whether they are good or bad. It’s how you use them. Strategically they are great. They can help domestic industries”He further stated that if one wants “to use them to offset income taxes, that’s a different purpose. To offset OT, social security and tip taxes means you need a lot of tariffs on a lot of products. As Lutnick says, that’s a consumption tax .”“So the question is, if your taxes aren’t being reduced , are they good or bad ? Maybe it depends on whether you think a consumption tax is good. The math doesn’t math,” he added.","Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has raised concerns about how new US trade deficit policies could impact e-commerce giant, Amazon.

Hints for today’s Strands

Hints

The spangram moves from right to left, so consider a theme-related word spanning the board.

The key theme word is on the left side—start scanning that area closely.

Look for common letters or fragments that might form famous rock band names.

Watch for double letters, as some words may contain repeated characters.

Spotting shorter words first can make it easier to identify longer ones.

Think of legendary bands with decades-long careers and classic hits.

If stuck, focus on vowels first—they often help connect different letters.

Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress. He emphasized the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. Zoho has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119109563,imgsize-83630,width-400,resizemode-4/119109563.jpg"

Air Canada and Thales issue joint statement

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories.” According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales. Air Canada and Thales issued a joint statement acknowledging the error and stating that the issue has been ""resolved."" ""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy."" Thales added in a separate statement that the map had been provided by a third party.The map feature was promptly disabled, and an updated version will be installed across the fleet starting March 14. Air Canada and Thales apologized for the ""unease created by this situation.""This is not the first time such an issue has occurred in aviation. JetBlue apologized for a similar map error in 2024, and British Airways faced a similar situation in 2013. In 2018, SWISS confirmed its policy of turning off maps entirely when landing in Tel Aviv after a similar incident. Thales stated that the maps are supplied by a third party and that they are working with the airline and the provider to resolve the issue quickly.","Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories” The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.

Baidu has unveiled its AI model, Ernie X1, which is designed to articulate its reasoning process. The Ernie X1 model operates on similar principles to DeepSeek R1 , a model that garnered significant attention in Silicon Valley for its ability to deliver comparable performance to leading chatbots at a significantly lower development cost. Baidu emphasises that its reasoning model excels in areas such as daily dialogue, complex calculations, and logical deduction, as per a report.Bloomberg reports that in addition to the Ernie X1 launch, China's leading internet search provider has upgraded its flagship foundation model to Ernie 4.5 . Notably, the company has made all tiers of its AI service, including the X1 model, freely accessible to its chatbot users, accelerating its initial plans by several weeks.Baidu claims that Ernie 4.5 outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT 4.5 in text generation, citing various industry benchmarks. Baidu has also announced its intention to make its Ernie AI models open-source starting June 30. The company has also integrated the R1 model into its core search engine business.This launch appears to be a strategic move to regain momentum in the competitive AI landscape, where Baidu faces increasing pressure from emerging rivals such as DeepSeek, the report added.While Baidu was the first major Chinese tech company to introduce a ChatGPT-like chatbot, it has since faced stiff competition from rivals like TikTok parent company ByteDance and Moonshot AI. Furthermore, open-source models such as Alibaba's Qwen and DeepSeek have received recognition within the global developer community, the report added.The generative AI boom has positively impacted Baidu's financial performance, with a 26% increase in cloud revenue reported in its December-quarter results. This growth, driven by services provided to developers seeking computing power, was somewhat offset by weaker advertising sales amidst China's challenging economic conditions.","Baidu has unveiled its new Ernie X1 AI model, designed to articulate its reasoning process.

Facebook’s extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

How hackers are using this phishing campaign against Mac users



How Mac users can protect themselves from this phishing campaign



Cybersecurity experts have discovered a new phishing campaign that is targeting Mac users. According to a report by the cybersecurity company LayerX Labs , experts have discovered that hackers using this phishing campaign, which originally attacked Windows users, are now targeting Mac users after Windows users received an Edge browser update. With these phishing attacks, hackers are reportedly tricking users into believing their Mac is compromised to steal their username and password.The report said that in this phishing campaign, hackers use fake security warnings that pop up on users’ screens while they are browsing, displaying messages that their Mac is “compromised” and “locked.”To raise panic – a tactic used by sophisticated attackers – hackers make the webpage appear frozen. A window then prompts users to enter their Mac’s username, password, and phone number for supposed ""support.""In the report, LayerX Labs shared a screenshot of the phishing attempt, though attackers may change the alert to make it more convincing, cybersecurity experts warned.The fake warning has noticeable red flags, such as a design that doesn’t match Apple’s style and the incorrect formatting of “macOS”, however, they may not be apparent for many users.As per the report, users can encounter these hackers accidentally by mistyping URLs in their browsers. These typos redirect them to compromised domain parking pages hosting the phishing scam.The report also noted that the phishing attack initially targeted Windows users. However, after Microsoft, Google and Mozilla introduced new security measures in their browsers to block the threat, attackers shifted their focus to Mac users.In the report, the cybersecurity experts have also advised users to verify URLs before visiting websites and bookmark frequently used ones to avoid typing errors.It also suggests using a search engine to find websites, as this can help identify typos and direct users to the correct URL. Additionally, the report also highlights the importance of installing Apple's security updates promptly to stay protected.","Cybersecurity experts have discovered a new phishing campaign that is targeting Mac users.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk says 'No more loans to...' as DOGE announces new measures to prevent fraudulent applications using stolen Social Security numbers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-says-no-more-loans-to-as-doge-announces-new-measures-to-prevent-fraudulent-applications-using-stolen-social-security-numbers/articleshow/119422369.cms,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has voiced support for the Small Business Administration 's (SBA) new policy aimed at preventing fraud involving stolen Social Security numbers. In a post on X, Musk commented, “No more loans to babies or people too old to be alive (i.e. stolen Social Security numbers),” in response to a Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) announcement.The revised SBA policy now requires applicants to provide their date of birth for all direct loan applications to combat fraudulent claims. It also temporarily halts loan processing for individuals under 18 or over 120 years old, following past cases flagged by DOGE, including a 157-year-old receiving a $36,000 loan. The measures follow reports of $333 million in loans issued to individuals over 115 years old during 2020-2021.SBA’s updated verification process is part of the Trump administration’s broader initiative to improve data integrity in federal loan programs while managing operational priorities and resource limitations.He has previously called it the “biggest fraud in history”. He then said that “there are far more ‘eligible’ social security numbers than there are citizens in the US. This might be the biggest fraud in history”.Earlier this month, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), announced that DOGE had initiated a significant cleanup of the Social Security Administration's records. He then quoted DOGE’s X post announcing “Approximately 3.2 million numberholders, all listed age 120+, have now been marked as deceased. More work still to be done”.In February, Musk had raised concerns about Social Security records, claiming that millions of deceased individuals were still listed as alive. He suggested this could lead to errors in benefit distribution. US President Donald Trump had also made similar claims, stating that millions of people over 100 years old remained in the database, with some still receiving payments.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has voiced support for the Small Business Administration's (SBA) new policy aimed at preventing fraud involving stolen Social Security numbers.

Kunal Kamra vs Bhavish Aggarwal: A history of feuds

Stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra reignited his feud with Ola founder Bhavish Aggarwal during his controversial show in Mumbai, delivering sharp jabs at the electric vehicle company and its leadership. Kamra mocked Aggarwal's handling of customer complaints and Ola Electric 's reported issues.Responding to an audience member's question about Ola scooters catching fire, Kamra quipped, ""Indian businessmen don't even admit when they're wrong. Take the Ola guy, for example. What did I say that made him so angry? It's simple—you manufacture two-wheelers, and neither of the wheels works. And yet, he tells me, 'Come work with us, let's build India together.'""Kamra went on to criticise Aggarwal's focus on launching new scooter colours instead of addressing technical issues. ""Maybe a different shade will fix the problem,"" he joked, adding that Aggarwal should prioritise refunds for customers over offering him money.This isn't the first time Kamra has clashed with Aggarwal. Last October, Kamra criticized Ola Electric on X (formerly Twitter) for rising consumer complaints and delays in refunds. Aggarwal responded by inviting Kamra to help out at Ola's service centers, promising him better pay ""than his flop shows.""Kamra also mentioned Aggarwal's recent email to employees, which resembled Elon Musk's approach by requiring daily reports. During the show, he commented, ""I’ve stopped tweeting about Ola because people keep blaming me, saying, ‘Because of you, my stocks have dipped!’""Ola Electric has faced significant scrutiny, with its share price falling below Rs 50 last week, far below its IPO price of Rs 76. The company has received over 10,000 complaints, prompting the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) to issue a notice. Kamra criticized these agencies as ""toothless,"" claiming they back down when confronted with Aggarwal's political connections.","Comedian Kunal Kamra reignited his feud with Ola founder Bhavish Aggarwal.

How users can spot a fake and malicious website

Carefully verify URLs before using any online conversion tool

Avoid free ads that appear at the top of search results

Research and check reviews of any file conversion service before use

Ideally, avoid online document converters entirely in favour of established applications and platforms

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has reportedly intensified its warnings about fake online document converters , confirming that users continue to fall victim to this increasingly prevalent cybersecurity threat. The agency has detailed how hackers are using fake websites to steal user data including banking information and passwords. It says that criminals are exploiting search algorithms to carry out cyber attacks.Citing an FBI spokesperson, Bleeping Computer said that scammers employ sophisticated tactics to deceive users:“The scammers try to mimic URLs that are legit, so changing just one letter, or 'INC' instead of 'CO',” Vikki Migoya, the Public Affairs Office for FBI Denver, was quoted as saying. The problem is compounded by search engine algorithms that frequently display paid results at the top of search pages, many of which may be fraudulent.“Users who in the past would type ‘free online file converter’ into a search engine are vulnerable, as the algorithms used for results now often include paid results, which might be scams,” Migoya added.The implications of this threat extend beyond individual users, the report said, adding that federal investigators suggest this file converter method may be behind the February ransomware attack on a Davenport, Iowa-based media company, indicating these seemingly minor scams can lead to significant organisational breaches.The FBI emphasised that education is the best defense.

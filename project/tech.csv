‘Would that be enough to convince you’: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and father of quantum computing debate AI’s true test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/would-that-be-enough-to-convince-you-openai-ceo-sam-altman-and-father-of-quantum-computing-debate-ais-true-test/articleshow/124103662.cms,"A new test for AGI





OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and British physicist David Deutsch have agreed on a striking new test for artificial intelligence (AI) – if an AI model could solve the mystery of quantum gravity — and explain its reasoning — it could be considered human-level smart. According to a Business Insider report, the exchange happened on Wednesday (September 24) in Berlin, where Altman visited Axel Springer’s headquarters to meet tech leaders and collect an award. During a fireside chat, publisher Mathias Döpfner asked Sam Altman about his favorite book — Deutsch’s The Beginning of Infinity — and then surprised him by patching the author in live from Oxford.Deutsch, often called the father of quantum computing, has long argued that brute-force training alone cannot produce true minds. He said real intelligence means creating knowledge, not just repeating or remixing it. “Large language models can talk endlessly because they are trained on huge bodies of knowledge,” he explained. “In my mind, genuine intelligence is the ability to create knowledge — spot a problem, invent a solution, test it, and improve it as humans do. ”Sam Altman, smiling as Deutsch appeared on screen, asked a direct question: what would it take to convince him that an AI had reached real intelligence? Deutsch pointed to Einstein’s theory of relativity as an example of knowledge creation.“We know he created it because we know his story, what problems he was addressing, and why,” he said.Then Sam Altman offered a hypothetical: “If a future model figured out quantum gravity and could tell you its story — the problems it chose, the reasons it pursued them — would that be enough to convince you?”“I think it would, yes,” Deutsch replied.Altman agreed: “I agree to that as the test.”",OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and British physicist David Deutsch have agreed on a striking new test for artificial intelligence.

Given the US H-1B overhaul, do you think this might be an opportunity for Germany to attract more

skilled professionals

from India?

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

What about further simplifying immigration processes, language restrictions and recognition of academic qualifications?

Do you think Germany needs more focused campaigns to attract talent, like maybepublicizing initiatives like the Opportunity Card?

Indians in Germany have a problem with cultural and social integration. How are you addressing it?

So, you are expecting an increase in the number of Indian students too?





Europe’s economic powerhouse Germany is ready to welcome more Indian IT professionals and students following the US torpedoing of its H-1B visa programme, says German ambassador to Indiain an exclusive interview toThis is a chance for many to consider what Germany has to offer. I think we have one of the most liberal immigration laws in Europe and what is remarkable is that even though we had a change of government recently where the Conservatives took over the Chancery, nobody is thinking of changing this immigration law. So, there is a very liberal atmosphere and it’s veryeasy to get into Germany for skilled and highly skilled labor from India. I’d recommend to everyone who is thinking of going elsewhere to consider the many opportunities that Germany has to offer.You’d be surprised to see how quickly your visa is issued once there is a case for it. We don’thave a big problem with waiting times when it comes to skilled workforce visas. What’s perhaps more demanding is how to get your degree recognized in Germany and that’s something the government is working on.There’s a certain disadvantage because Germany has a differentlanguage. I’d say in the upper echelons of industries, German is not necessary and you see many Indian students studying in universities that have English-taught courses. I’d recommend that if you live in Germany, learn German at least to alevel you can converse in the streets or do your shopping.That’s one way into Germany if you have the means to sustain yourself for a certain period, fulfil certain criteria and have relevant degrees.You can see that on the embassy website. If you fulfil these criteria, you can go to Germany without even having a job and look for work there. So, that’s a very liberal approach. At thesame time, we have many other possibilities for people who do have a contract with a German company to come to Germany. We also have 60,000 Indian students in Germany, a growth of 20% from last year. This year the growth will beeven bigger because we have so many students who were thinking of going to the Americas but are now reconsidering. Once you have your degree in Germany, you can stay 18 months in Germany and look for a job. That’s a long period of time.This is important. I’d say you should not underestimate the fact that if you are going to Germany, your life will change in many ways. But what we are seeing is a growing Indian community with a very interesting network of assistance. When you go on Instagram or X or LinkedIn, you’d find a group of Indian influencersaddressing issues of German life for Indians in Germany. We do talk to these people and see them once in a while. They do an incredible job in preparing people to join the German life and learn German language. Indians in Germany have been tremendously successful in an admirable way. An average Indian in Germany’s workforce earns more than an average German. We have about 300,000 Indians in Germany. High salary means a valuable contribution to society and welfare. There’s a very positive mood towards Indians in Germany. Migration is an issue that’s discussed in Germany. It’s a problem when it comes to refugees and, asylum seekers, but skilled labor from India is excluded from this discussion.I think so. The applications from Indian students went up by 35 percent in the first month of 2025. We expect more Indians to come to Germany now. We have had a very good experience with Indian students in areas like engineering, IT and AI. However, there are non-German universitiesthat are geographically based in Germany and aggressively recruit in India. We have question marks when it comes to their quality and therefore my message to everybody is don’t trust your agent. Most Indians go through an agent. It’s always good to check on your own if that school is really up to the standards you want to achieve in your academic life. I can only say that in Germany education is a public good. You have basically little to no fee in our public universities, no tuition fee. I’d always strongly recommend joining state-funded and state-run universities, our most prestigious institutions.","Germany is ready to welcome more Indian IT professionals and students following the US torpedoing of its H-1B visa programme, says German ambassador to Indiain.

Billionaire Silicon Valley investor says US' H-1B visa policy could backfire: ‘Engineers from Indian universities are…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/billionaire-silicon-valley-investor-says-us-h-1b-visa-policy-could-backfire-engineers-from-indian-universities-are/articleshow/124094780.cms,"US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

Poll Do you think raising the H-1B visa fee will hurt US tech innovation? Yes, it will hurt innovation No, it will protect American jobs

Tech companies hire for skills, not cost savings

Policy could drive innovation overseas





Billionaire Silicon Valley investor Michael Moritz, whose investments in Google PayPal , and other tech giants helped shape the modern internet, has sharply criticised President Donald Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, warning that the policy will backfire and demonstrates the administration's fundamental misunderstanding of what drives American tech success.The policy, announced Friday through a presidential proclamation, imposes the steep fee on new H-1B visa applications starting September 21, representing a dramatic increase from current fees of $2,000 to $5,000. The administration also proposed overhauling the lottery system to prioritise higher-paid workers, with the Trump administration claiming the program has been ""deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers. ""The announcement triggered panic across Silicon Valley over the weekend, with companies including Amazon , Microsoft, and Google advising H-1B employees to return to the US before the Sunday deadline.Writing in the Financial Times, Moritz argued that Trump's ""H-1B caper will backfire"" because advances in technology make it easier for companies to move work overseas rather than bring foreign workers to America. The former Sequoia Capital partner warned that the policy shows ""the fragile grasp the president and his acolytes have about why the US — especially its technology sector—has worked so well.""The H-1B program currently allows 85,000 skilled foreign workers annually to work in the US for up to six years. Indian nationals account for 71% of approved visas, with the program heavily used by tech companies and IT consulting firms. Moritz noted that ""engineers with undergraduate degrees from the better eastern Europe, Turkish and Indian universities are every bit as well qualified as their American counterparts,"" underlining the caliber of talent that could be affected by the policy changes.Moritz, who built his reputation investing in companies like Google, PayPal, LinkedIn, and YouTube during their early stages, dismissed Trump's claims that companies abuse the H-1B program to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. In his FT column, he emphasised that ""large tech companies hire foreign nationals because they possess particular skills"" and retain them ""to perform tasks in areas where the US has labour shortages. ""The investor argued that companies don't hire H-1B workers ""to deprive Americans of jobs or for cost reasons,"" contradicting the administration's core justification for the fee increase. He noted that US companies are already ""forbidden to discriminate against foreign workers doing the same jobs as American citizens"" and must notify employees before hiring foreign workers.Trump's proclamation cited multiple examples of tech companies laying off American workers while simultaneously hiring thousands of H-1B visa holders. One unnamed software company was approved for over 5,000 H-1B workers in fiscal year 2025 while announcing layoffs totalling more than 15,000 employees, according to the White House. The administration argued this demonstrates the program is being used to replace rather than supplement American workers.Rather than protecting American jobs, Moritz warned the policy could push tech innovation abroad. He noted that skilled engineers from ""better eastern Europe, Turkish and Indian universities are every bit as well qualified as their American counterparts,"" and much of their work ""can be done as easily in Istanbul, Tallinn, Warsaw, Prague or Bengaluru as in San Francisco.""The investor predicted that companies fearful of Trump's next move might change their policies, meaning ""these foreign economies rather than the US will receive a shot in the arm."" This would also ""deprive America of a fresh generation of entrepreneurs since the most able of the H-1B visa holders often go on to start companies of their own.""Moritz's warnings contrast sharply with support from some tech leaders, including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, who called the $100,000 fee ""a great solution"" that would ensure H-1B visas are ""used just for very high-value jobs."" However, most Silicon Valley executives have criticised the changes as harmful to innovation and startup growth.The policy has already created international ripple effects. India, which supplies 71% of H-1B visa holders, responded through its external affairs ministry that the fee would have ""humanitarian consequences"" and cause family disruptions. Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal suggested Americans are ""afraid of our talent.""Moritz suggested the administration should instead expand the H-1B program, proposing to ""double or triple the number of H-1B visas"" and automatically offer citizenship to foreign nationals earning STEM PhDs from top American universities.He highlighted successful immigrant CEOs including Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Sundar Pichai of Google as examples of the program's benefits, noting in his FT piece: ""Two of the finest chief executives in the US, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Sundar Pichai of Google, are here because of the attitudes of prior administrations.""","Billionaire investor Michael Moritz has sharply criticised President Donald Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee.

Read Google’s full ‘urgent’ memo to H-1B visa holders

We are reaching out with an urgent update regarding international travel for individuals on H-1B visas.

A Proclamation is scheduled to take effect this Sunday at 12:01 AM ET. It introduces significant changes to re-entry procedures for H-1B visa holders currently outside the United States. We continue to review the Proclamation, but the initial advice we have received is that re-entry will require a mandatory payment of $100,000 per petition, which may cause substantial delays or prevent re-entry to the US

What You Need to Know:

If you are currently outside the US:

If you are currently outside the US with a valid H-1B visa, make plans to return and enter the US before the Proclamation takes effect on Sunday, September 21 at 12:01 am ET (i.e. by this Saturday night).

If you are currently in the US:

We strongly advise against any international travel if you are in valid H-1B status or need to travel to activate your H-1B visa. You should remain in the US

Departing the US may result in complications or denial of re-entry under the new policy.

If you are unable to return prior to the deadline in H-1B status: please reach out to go/immigration-help.

We understand this may create challenges, and we are here to support you. We are actively monitoring the situation and will keep you updated as we learn more.

Shark Tank judge Anupam Mittal says ‘Most MBAs are outdated’: ‘Better to learn….’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/shark-tank-judge-anupam-mittal-says-most-mbas-are-outdated-better-to-learn-/articleshow/124038917.cms,"Here’s what Anupam Mittal said

Should you do an MBA? My views👇🏼

Most MBAs are outdated 🤷🏼

Better to learn how to build Products,

Best training ground if you want to accelerate your career or run a company one day.

That’s how I started. As a Product Manager.

Case studies and frameworks are nice, but they don’t teach you how to,

- Question the status quo

- Build deep empathy for customers

- Pursue global optima, not local wins

- Influence without authority

- Work backwards from the end state

That’s a Builder’s life.

It’s messy, political, creative, analytical — all at once.

A microcosm of real life, not classroom fluff.

That’s what helped me build companies, not the three-letter degree, although I do have one 🙈

So I tell young students & professionals to do an MBA, but a different kind. Do a Masters in Building Awesome things and you will graduate, not in 2 yrs, but every day 👨🏼‍🎓😎

Be a PM, Product Engineer, Product Designer, AI Builder, Hardware Designer, Robotics Engineer ….. heck, even a Toy Designer!

Because the 21st century will be led by builders who can also tell great stories 💪🏼

P:S - If you MUST do a top-tier MBA. Or hide for a few months & learn how to build, esp with AI 🤷🏼

Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus is facing mounting pressure after a 13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and caused 600 triple-zero calls to fail across multiple states. The September 19 network failure has prompted government investigations and renewed calls for accountability from the embattled telco.The outage primarily affected South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, with some impact also recorded in far western New South Wales near the SA border, according to Reuters reporting. CEO Stephen Rue confirmed that established processes were not followed during a network firewall upgrade that began at 12:30 AM Thursday and lasted until approximately 1:30 PM (local time).Four deaths have been linked to the incident, though South Australian police later clarified that an eight-week-old boy's death in Gawler West was ""unlikely"" to have been caused by the outage delay. A 68-year-old Adelaide woman and two men aged 74 and 49 in Perth remain connected to the emergency services failure.The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) reported that Optus received multiple customer complaints about the triple-zero failure as early as 9 AM Thursday, with five customers contacting the call center about the outage.However, these concerns were not properly escalated, and government authorities weren't informed until after the issue was resolved.Communications Minister Anika Wells expressed ""unbelievable disappointment"" that Australia was ""here again so quickly,"" referencing a similar 2023 incident. The Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA) chair Nerida O'Loughlin revealed her agency wasn't notified until more than 10 hours after the outage began, contrary to standard protocols.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years. The company was fined A$12 million in 2023 for failing to provide emergency call services to thousands during a nationwide outage and subsequently failing to conduct required welfare checks.The telecommunications giant, owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has faced a series of crises including a 2022 cyberattack affecting 9.5 million Australians and the 2023 outage that led to former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin's resignation. Current CEO Stephen Rue took over in November 2024.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking from New York, declined to say whether Rue should resign but indicated the government has ""action at its disposal"" pending investigation results. ACMA has launched a formal investigation, with Optus potentially facing fines exceeding $10 million and additional penalties.The company has promised full cooperation with all investigations while conducting its own internal review, with results to be made public.",13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and 600 triple-zero calls to fail.

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

A side door for skilled professionals



Pros and cons of O-1B visa



The advantages of O-1B visa include:

No lottery or annual cap

Faster processing available

Renewable indefinitely

The drawbacks of O-1B visa are:

More subjective than H-1B, requiring proof of “extraordinary ability”

Some employers hesitate due to uncertainty in approval

Application costs can be higher than pre-hike H-1B fees

Some real world examples of O-1B visa



Entrepreneurs like Soundarya Balasubramani, who launched an educational venture in the U.S., are among the new wave of Indian applicants using the O-1 to bypass the H-1B bottleneck. “I got my O-1A approved as the solo founder and 100% owner of an educational venture,” she told ET.

Karan Vaidya, cofounder of AI startup Composio, said his O-1 visa cost less than $10,000 including legal fees, and praised its flexibility: “It’s a three-year visa that can be renewed indefinitely. I’m on my fifth O-1 now.”





US President Donald Trump’s executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee from $10,000 to $1,00,000 sent shockwaves in the tech industry. Due to the announcement last week many tech giants called back their professionals with H-1B visa back to the US. As the scrutiny around the traditional H-1B visa pathway making the process unpredictable, the skilled professionals are now planing to turn towards O-1 visa a lesser known route. The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.For those unaware, the O-1 Visa is introduced under the Immigration Act of 1990. The O-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields of education, science, athletics or arts. It enable the recipients to work in the US for up to three years and comes with unlimited renewals.

Read Sridhar Vembu’s complete post here



I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger.

Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21. Now, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has also issued a piece of advice to Indian techies ‘come back to India to rebuild’. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Vemu drew parallel with the Partition of India in order to explain the current H-1B situation. He mentioned the stories of his Sindhi friends whose families were forced to leave everything but they eventually thrived after starting over again.“I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time.

He said that India today offer multiple opportunities as compared to that in the past. He also adds that those willing to take this leap will ultimately benefit from it.The hike in the visa fees could lead to reverse migration of skilled professionals, strengthening its domestic tech and startup ecosystem.

Political leaders weigh in







An ABC spokesperson recently confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely. The company decided to take the decision after the host of the show Jimmy Kimmel made some controversial comments on Charlie Kirk, linking his alleged killer to President Trump’s MAGA movement. MAGA – short for Make America Great Again is a political slogan, popularized by President Donald Trump during his election campaigns. During the late-night show, Kimmel made sharp comments stating that the MAGA gang is “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.Actor and filmmaker Ben Stiller was among the celebrities who has publicly defended Kimmel and has criticised the decision of ABC. In s post shared on social media platform X, Stiller wrote, “This isn’t right”.His brief but pointed reaction quickly went viral, with many fans and fellow entertainers echoing his sentiment that the suspension undermines free expression in comedy.Commenting on Ben Stiller’s post, Elon Musk supported the decision made by ABC and wrote, “He went full retard. Never go full retard.”This is not the first time that Musk has reacted to the controversy.Earlier this week after the Kimmel’s video clip from the show went viral, Musk said, “Jimmy Kimmel is disgusting”.The California Governor Gavin Newsom has also blasted the decision and has accused Republicans of orchestrating censorship. “They are censoring you in real time. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous,” wrote Newsom on X.On the other hand, commentator Davis Sirota suggested corporate politics were at play, noting that Nexstar, which has ties to ABC, is seeking regulatory approvals from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the suspension on Truth Social, calling it “Great News for America” and labeling Kimmel “ratings challenged” with “zero talent.”","ABC confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely.

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

Impact on Indian IT professionals



Next steps and legal challenges







US President Donald Trump recently announced the fee hike for H-1B visa program. Last week, the US government increased the H-1B visa fee to $1,00,000 from $10,000. This annual fee applies to all the fresh H-1B visa applications. Now, days after imposing the new fee, the Trump administration has introduced a new proposal which is aimed at revamping the H-1B visa program. As reported by Reuters, the new proposal of the Trump administration aims to scrap the the long‑standing lottery system and replace it with a weighted selection process that favours higher‑skilled and higher‑paid applicants.Presently, the H-1B program is capped at 85,000 visas annually and it uses a random lottery when the application exceed demand. Under the new rules, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes a wage‑based ranking system, giving preference to applicants with advanced degrees, specialized skills, and higher salary offers.As per the Reuters report, the official suggests that this change will make sure that the visas go to the “the best and brightest” while still allowing employers to hire foreign workers at all wage levels. The administration claims that it has framed the reform in order to curb the ‘abuse’ of the system done by outsourcing firms.The changes made to the H-1B visa system could have a critical impact on the Indian technology workers, who make up the largest share of H-1B recipients. While highly paid engineers and specialists may benefit, entry‑level workers and outsourcing companies that rely on bulk visa applications could face reduced opportunities.Experts suggest that this new rule could reshape the global IT services market and will push the companies to expand operations in India or other regions of access to US visa becomes restricted.This new proposed rule of the Trump administration will now undergo a public comment period before it is finalised. The legal challenges are expected as the earlier attempt to reform the H-1B visa system have faced pushback in the US courts. If implemented, the reforms — combined with the new $100,000 annual fee — would mark one of the most dramatic shifts in U.S. skilled immigration policy in decades, with ripple effects across the global technology and outsourcing industries.","Last week, the US government increased the H-1B visa fee to $1,00,000 from $10,000.

What Rafael Nadal said about the AI investment scam



“Hello everyone,

I want to share this message of caution—something unusual for my social media, but necessary. In recent days, together with my team, we have detected fake videos circulating on some platforms. These were generated with artificial intelligence, showing a figure that imitates my image and my voice. In those videos, I am falsely attributed with investment advice or proposals that in no case come from me.

This is misleading advertising, completely unrelated to me. I ask you to be cautious: I have neither made nor endorsed such messages.

Artificial intelligence is a tool with enormous potential, capable of bringing extraordinary progress in education, medicine, sports, and communication. However, it can also be misused, creating false content that generates confusion and may deceive many people.

As a society, we face the challenge of learning to distinguish between what is real and what is manipulated, and of promoting an ethical and responsible use of technology. Innovation is always positive when it serves people, but we must remain aware of its risks and act with critical thinking.

Thank you all for your attention and for your continued support.”

Building a case for O-1 visa

O-1 visa: An overlooked alternative to H-1B visa







For three consecutive years, 26-year-old Tanush Sharanarthi tried to secure an H-1B visa to continue working in the United States. Despite holding a master’s degree from Johns Hopkins University, his applications were repeatedly rejected under the lottery system. “The H-1B lottery felt like playing the slots in Las Vegas — you win sometimes, but mostly you lose and have no control,” Sharanarthi, who hails from Bangalore, told Business Insider.Frustrated by the uncertainty, he began exploring alternatives. That’s when he learned about the O-1 visa, a category reserved for individuals with “extraordinary ability” in fields such as science, technology, education, or the arts.According to a report by Business Insider, Tanush Sharanarthi had been building a strong portfolio without realizing it. He had published research on artificial intelligence (AI), reviewed papers for journals, judged hackathons, and contributed to open-source projects.These achievements, the report says, helped him meet the O-1 requirements, which demand evidence across at least three out of eight eligibility categories.After six years of work in AI — starting with Kimberly-Clark, followed by his graduate studies and his current role at IBM — Tanush Sharanarthi finally applied for the O-1 visa in August. Less than two weeks later, his application was approved, BI reports.“It took a lot of hard work, but it felt nice. Only this time in Vegas, I won,” he told the publication.Often referred to as the “Einstein visa,” the O-1 is granted to professionals who can demonstrate sustained achievement and recognition in their fields. Unlike the H-1B, which is capped at 85,000 approvals each year and relies on a lottery system, the O-1 does not have a numerical cap.Immigration lawyers say the visa is gaining attention as workers face increasing uncertainty under the H-1B program. Last week, Donald Trump introduced a $100,000 annual fee on H-1B applications starting September 21. The administration is now reportedly weighing fresh restrictions on H-1B approvals, likely replacing the lottery system.","Tanush Sharanarthi, 26, applied for the O-1 visa to work in the United States.

CEO Stephen Rue confirmed that established processes were not followed during a network firewall upgrade that began at 12:30 AM Thursday and lasted until approximately 1:30 PM (local time).In a statement to the Singapore Exchange, Singtel Group CEO Yuen Kuan Moon said the company was “deeply sorry” and extended condolences to the families affected. “Our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have passed away and we know that Optus will get to the bottom of this matter,” he saidMultiple online reports indicate that three to four people died after not being able to reach the emergency services during the 13-hour long outage.Four deaths have been linked to the incident, though South Australian police later clarified that an eight-week-old boy's death in Gawler West was ""unlikely"" to have been caused by the outage delay. A 68-year-old Adelaide woman and two men aged 74 and 49 in Perth remain connected to the emergency services failure.Optus later confirmed the disruption was triggered by a deviation from standard procedures during a firewall upgrade, which affected around 600 customers’ ability to connect to emergency services.In order to address the crisis, Optus announced the appointment of Dr Kerry Schott, a senior Australian executive, to lead an independent review into the outage. This will review will try to determine the technical causes, operational process and handling of Triple Zero calls.Optus CEO Stephen Rue also apologised, saying: “There are no words that can express how sorry I am about the very sad loss of the lives of people who could not reach emergency services in their time of need”. Optus chairman John Arthur echoed the sentiment, calling the incident “clearly unacceptable” and offering condolences to the families of the victims.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years. The company was fined A$12 million in 2023 for failing to provide emergency call services to thousands during a nationwide outage and subsequently failing to conduct required welfare checks.The telecommunications giant, owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has faced a series of crises including a 2022 cyberattack affecting 9.5 million Australians and the 2023 outage that led to former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin's resignation. Current CEO Stephen Rue took over in November 2024.","Singapore’s telecom operator Singtel has now issued an apology for the recent outage on its Australian subsidiary Optus.

You may soon be able to convert your UPI payments into EMIs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/you-may-soon-be-able-to-convert-your-upi-payments-into-emis/articleshow/124089030.cms,"How the EMIs on UPI payments may work



“Today, we are not yet live with EMI, but the next version—which NPCI has permitted via its product guidelines—will allow the consumer, at the point of scanning the QR code (subject to certain terms and conditions), to split payments into EMIs.”

“UPI is becoming more than just a payment method, it is evolving into a full-fledged payment system.”

$101 Billion in 1 Day: How Larry Ellison Became the World’s Richest Man Explained





The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is reportedly developing a new feature that will enable users to convert their Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ) payments into Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs). This move is part of NPCI's strategy to boost credit products and drive the next phase of growth in retail digital payments, a report suggests. A report by the Economic Times (ET) cited sources familiar with the plan, claiming that NPCI is set to enable fintech companies to integrate an EMI payment feature that will allow customers to convert their UPI transactions into EMIs instantly. The feature is expected to help the NPCI push more credit transactions through the UPI network.As per the report, the experience would be similar to making card payments at point-of-sale (PoS) terminals, where customers can instantly convert a card swipe into EMIs on the spot.NPCI is reportedly exploring this feature following the widespread adoption of RuPay credit cards on UPI and the introduction of credit lines on the UPI network. A few banks have already partnered with fintechs like Navi and Paytm to provide UPI users access to such credit lines.In a statement to ET, Navi CEO Rajiv Naresh said:However, Navi has not yet launched the feature; the Sachin Bansal-backed company is heavily investing in UPI with a clear focus on leveraging credit-based payments which is something it believes will help build sustainable business models for UPI apps.Fintech founders argue that credit on UPI opens up revenue opportunities, unlike savings account-based transactions, where no fees can be charged to merchants due to the government’s zero-fee mandate on RuPay debit cards and UPI payments.A Gurugram-based fintech founder told ET that NPCI has set an interchange fee of around 1.5% on UPI credit lines, making it a clear revenue channel.Speaking with ET last week, PayU CEO Anirban Mukherjee highlighted the growing opportunity around instant credit on UPI, noting thatMuch like cards that support debit, credit, and EMI payments, UPI is expected to build its own credit ecosystem, which could extend checkout financing to millions of consumers who currently don’t own a credit card.Today, UPI handles about 20 billion transactions each month, with an active user base of 250–300 million. To expand further and bring more types of payments onto the platform, the report also cited industry insiders, who claim that doubling down on credit is essential, a direction NPCI is actively pursuing.","NPCI is reportedly developing a new feature that will enable users to convert their UPI payments into Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs) This move is part of NPCI's strategy to boost credit products and drive the next phase of growth in retail digital payments, a report suggests.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124089035,imgsize-38556,width-400,resizemode-4/you-may-soon-be-able-to-convert-your-upi-payments-into-emis.jpg"

SIDDARAMAIAH CHIEF MINISTER

VIDHANA SOUDHA BENGALURU - 560 001

Date: 19-09-2025

Dear Sri Azim Premji,

I extend my warm greetings to you and sincerely appreciate Wipro's continued contribution to the progress of Karnataka's IT ecosystem and overall socio-economic development.

One of the key challenges currently facing Bengaluru, particularly along the Outer Ring Road (ORR) corridor at Iblur junction is severe traffic congestion during peak hours, which adversely impacts mobility, productivity, and the quality of urban life.

In this context, I wish to explore the possibility of allowing limited vehicular movement through the Wipro campus, subject to mutually agreed terms and necessary security considerations.

Preliminary assessments by traffic and urban mobility experts indicate that such a measure could reduce congestion on adjoining stretches of the ORR by nearly 30%, particularly during peak office hours.

Your support in this matter will go a long way in easing traffic bottlenecks, enhancing commuter experience, and contributing to a more efficient and livable Bengaluru. I would greatly appreciate it if your team could engage with our officials to work out a mutually acceptable plan at the earliest.

With warm regards,

Yours sincerely,

(SIDDARAMAIAH)

How Larry Ellison plans to donate 95% of his wealth

Leadership changes at Ellison’s for-profit organization





Oracle founder Larry Ellison is currently the world’s second richest person, only behind Tesla CEO Elon Musk. As per Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, he has a total net worth of $373 billion. Ellison’s wealth has grown rapidly in the past months due to massive gains in Oracle’s stock, driven by the AI boom. But not many are aware that Larry Ellison has pledged to donate 95% of his wealth as part of the Giving Pledge in 2010. Since then, he has moved away from traditional nonprofits, saying he prefers to give away wealth on his own terms.A report by Fortune reveals how Larry Ellison plans to give away his wealth.As mentioned above, Ellison’s net worth is estimated at $373 billion as of September 2025. The majority of his wealth comes from his 41% stake in Oracle, along with a significant investment in Tesla.Ellison’s philanthropic efforts are primarily channelled through the Ellison Institute of Technology (EIT), a for-profit organization based at the University of Oxford. The institute focuses on global challenges including healthcare, food insecurity, climate change, and AI research.A major new campus for EIT, valued at approximately $1.3 billion, is scheduled to open in Oxford by 2027.Over the years, Ellison has made several high-profile donations. He contributed $200 million to the University of Southern California to establish a cancer research center and gave roughly $1 billion to the Ellison Medical Foundation, which focused on aging and disease prevention before it was closed.While his direct charitable disbursements are lower than some of his peers, his commitments through the Giving Pledge and the Ellison Institute total in the billions. Ellison has stated that nearly all of his wealth will eventually be directed toward philanthropic causes, managed on his own terms and timeline.According to a New York Times, EIT has faced turbulence due to leadership changes. In 2024, Ellison hired scientist John Bell to lead research. In August, he said former University of Michigan president Santa Ono would “collaborate” with Bell. Two weeks later, Bell quit, calling it a “very challenging project.”","Larry Ellison is currently the world’s second richest person, only behind Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

A long‑term success story



Lessons for today’s immigration debate







The tech industry is still reviving from the shock of increased H-1B visa fee. Last week US President Donald Trump announced an increase in the H-1B visa application fee. After the revised regulation the H-1B visa fee for fresh application stands at $1,00,000. As the discussion about the future of the H-1B visa program is intensifying, an old video clip of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has resurfaced online. The video clip going viral is a snippet taken from Bill Gates speech delivered at IIT Delhi in February 2024. In the video Gates can be seen talking about Microsoft’s early years. He revealed that he hired a group of Indian engineers who helped him transform the company.Gates remembered that in the 1980s, when Microsoft was still a young company with only few hundred employees and was struggling to recruit some top-tier engineering professionals. Then one of his senior colleagues advised him to travel to India and recruit some fresh graduates from Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). About 15 engineers were eventually hired, a move Gates described as “a phenomenal thing.”It was a crucial decision at that time as the media criticised the move as a ‘brain drain’.Meanwhile, in the United States, concerns were raised that foreign workers were “taking” American jobs — a debate that continues to echo in today’s immigration discussions.Looking back after more than 25 years, Gates said that the decision proved to be both fruitful and transformative. The engineers hired from India helped in strengthening Microsoft’s technical foundation and also went on to become leaders in global technology industry. Many of those engineers also contributed to innovations that shaped modern digital world.The now viral video clip of Bill Gates came at a time when the popular H-1B visa program is facing renewed scrutiny. Critics argue that the H-1B visa program displaced American workers, whereas the supporters believe that the visa program helps in filling the skill gaps and also fuels innovation.

Google Search: From information retrieval to intelligence



Why India is a key market for AI push in Google Search







In a major push to further integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into its core products, Google is bringing its new feature, Search Live, to India. A senior executive has said that the country will be the first outside the US to receive the feature, which allows users to have back-and-forth conversations with Google Search using both voice and video. This AI-powered capability is designed to transform the traditional search experience into a more interactive, conversational one, enabling users to get information through a dynamic dialogue. The expansion to the Indian market which leads the way in adopting many of Google’s innovations, including voice and visual search.“It's a mobile-first experience for when you need quick real-time help...It is naturally multimodal. You can pick up your phone camera, invoke search live, point your camera, and ask a question to get a response,” said Rajan Patel, vice-president of engineering, Google Search.Notably, Google brought AI Mode – a Google Search feature that provides AI-powered, comprehensive answers using a chat-like interface, rather than just a list of links – in India in June.Earlier this year, Google launched Search Live, a new feature that lets users have a free-flowing, voice-based conversation with Google Search.It's designed for hands-free use while on the go or multitasking.To use it, users can tap a new ""Live"" icon in the Google app and speak your question. The AI provides an audio response, and you can continue the conversation with follow-up questions. It also works in the background, allowing you to use other apps simultaneously.Google says that this feature uses a custom version of Gemini with advanced voice capabilities and is built on Search’s existing information systems to provide reliable responses. Google plans to add camera integration in the future, allowing users to ask questions about what they're seeing in real time.“Under the hood, this is using our advanced AI models that can recognize what you're looking at, and as always, give you an answer that you can trust as quickly as possible,” said Patel, who is also the co-founder of Google Lens.Search Live will join the already available AI features in Search. For example, AI Overviews that reach over 2 billion monthly users across more than 200 countries and territories and 40 languages, as per Google. The company also says that it has seen over 10% growth in the types of queries that show AI Overviews, globally.The second is AI Mode (available in English and Hindi in India), which Google says is its most powerful AI Search that taps frontier capabilities of Gemini models to answer truly complex questions. It has over 100 million monthly active users in the US and India. There’s a Circle to Search that helps users translate and can even give game tips in-context.“We're moving from an information retrieval product to an intelligence product, not just fetching information from the web, but helping you make sense of it and take action,” Patel said.Google is positioning India as a crucial hub for its future growth, especially for its AI initiatives. With the world's largest user base, India has become the first international market to receive key AI-powered features. In July, Google rolled out AI Mode in India, making it the first country outside the United States to receive the feature.The country was also among the first to get AI Overviews, the AI-powered search experience launched last year. These features are being localized for the Indian market, with AI Mode adding Hindi support earlier this month, and AI Overviews now available in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, and Marathi.“In India, people are using AI mode for queries related to education, getting recommendations and comparisons, writing and step by step instructions,” said Hema Budaraju, Vice President of product management for Search at Google.“India is leading the way in adopting many of our innovations – including voice and visual search. More people use Google Lens in India every month than in any other country worldwide. We are hoping that Indian users will continue to be torchbearers of the AI transformation that we are bringing to Search,” she added.The announcement comes as Google Search faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Perplexity that are also infusing AI into their products. While OpenAI has introduced an affordable India-specific pricing plan called ChatGPT Go, priced at Rs 399 per month, Perplexity is bringing its Comet browser in the country.","Google is bringing its new feature, Search Live, to India.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that he once turned down an early model of a luxury timepiece worth over half a million dollars and opted for its prototype instead because of his self-described ""builder"" persona. The Facebook-co-founder revealed the choice during an interview with the platform Drip, where he showcased his Greubel Forsey Nano Foudroyante watch, which retails for around $585,000.According to a report by Business Insider, the Swiss watchmaker's creation was a limited-edition piece, with only 22 timepieces available at its debut.“They said that if I wanted, I could get one of the early ones that they made,” Zuckerberg explained.“I'm more of a work-in-progress, builder type of person, so I actually just asked them if I could get the prototype,” he added, noting that he was unsure if the company normally accommodates such requests but that they “figured out how to do that for me.”The Nano Foudroyante is Greubel Forsey's 10th “Fundamental Invention” and is notable for its intricate “foudroyante” complication, a subdial that measures fractions of a second with a hand completing one revolution per second.The watch is also a feat of engineering, as it is designed to be significantly more energy-efficient than traditional models.Zuckerberg's watch collection is extensive, ranging from a humble $120 Casio to a flashy yellow-gold Rolex. The Nano Foudroyante is not his only Greubel Forsey timepiece; he also owns a Hand Made 1, which has a reported value of $900,000.Last year, a video went viral on social media, showing Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, having a conversation with Anant when Chan noticed his wristwatch.“That is cool,” Chan said, to which Zuckerberg responded, ""I know. I told him already."" She then asked Anant, ""Who makes that?"" Anant replied that the watch was a Richard Mille.Zuckerberg seemed particularly impressed by the timepiece. ""I never really wanted to get a watch. But..."" he said, showing his appreciation, as Priscilla added, ""I might want that.""","The Nano Foudroyante is Greubel Forsey's 10th “Fundamental Invention” and is notable for its intricate “foudroyantes” complication.

The company stated that it has ""consistently fought against those efforts on free speech grounds"" and has an ""unwavering"" commitment to freedom of expression that ""will not bend to political pressure.""“The Company terminated channels for repeatedly violating its Community Guidelines on elections integrity content through 2023 and COVID-19 content through 2024. Today, YouTube's Community Guidelines allow for a wider range of content regarding COVID-19 and elections integrity,” Google said.“Reflecting the Company's commitment to free expression, YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect,”it added.With more than two billion users globally, YouTube also stated in the letter that it “values conservative voices on its platform and recognises that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse.”",YouTube is taking steps to restore the accounts of content creators who were previously banned for violating the platform's rules on COVID-19 and 2020 election misinformation.

Google has said that the Biden administration pressed the company to “remove non-violative user-generated content” which was “related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not violate its policies. ” The claim was made in a letter sent to the House Judiciary Committee by the counsel for Alphabet, Google’s parent company.“It is unacceptable and wrong when any government, including the Biden Administration, attempts to dictate how the Company moderates content, and the Company has consistently fought against those efforts on First Amendment grounds,” Google said in a 28-page letter.The House Committee on the Judiciary shared the letter on its official website.According to the company, it had to take to balance freedom of expression with responsibility.“The COVID-19 pandemic was an unprecedented time in which online platforms had to reach decisions about how best to balance freedom of expression with responsibility, including responsibility with respect to the moderation of user-generated content that could result in real world harm,” the company said in the letter addressing Jim Jordan, Chairman of Committee on the Judiciary, on September 23.The company said that “senior Biden Administration officials, including White House officials, conducted repeated and sustained outreach to Alphabet and pressed the Company regarding certain user-generated content related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not violate its policies.”“While the Company continued to develop and enforce its policies independently, Biden Administration officials continued to press the Company to remove non-violative user-generated content,” it added.“As online platforms, including Alphabet, grappled with these decisions, the Administration's officials, including President Biden, created a political atmosphere that sought to influence the actions of platforms based on their concerns regarding misinformation,” the letter further added.Last year in August, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, stated in a letter to the same committee that his platform was forced to make COVID-19-related changes “in the wake of this pressure.” He added that it ‘expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn't agree’.","Google said Biden administration pressed the company to “remove non-violative user-generated content” which was “related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not violate its policies” The claim was made in a letter sent to the House Judiciary Committee by the counsel for Alphabet, Google’s parent company.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124074373,imgsize-52846,width-400,resizemode-4/google-parent-alphabet.jpg"

What Jumia CEO said about the company’s growth



“Consumers are gaining more confidence,”





The CEO of Jumia Technologies AG, Francis Dufay, has claimed that the company is benefiting from the global trade war. According to Dufay, US President Donald Trump 's tariffs on Chinese goods have led China to divert products to other markets, including those in Africa. This is making it easier for the continent's largest e-commerce company, also commonly referred to as the “Amazon of Africa,” to obtain goods, Duffy claimed.“Our pipeline of goods from China is getting healthier and healthier, and we have a lot more interest from Chinese suppliers and vendors. It’s really making our lives much easier.” Dufay said in a Bloomberg TV interview.While Africa's economies are growing rapidly, the region has been considered a less appealing market for Asian manufacturers due to its limited infrastructure and high inflation rates. However, as tariffs have limited Chinese shipments to the US, exports to Africa have soared by 25% year-on-year.Jumia has been restructuring to reduce costs, exiting markets such as South Africa and Tunisia and halting food delivery operations. It is now the largest e-commerce company in eight of the nine countries where it operates, Dufay said, with more currency stability in recent months.he added.This stability is helping Jumia defend its market position against low-cost Chinese entrants, such as Temu and Shein. Dufay noted that the company had a strong head start, having developed extensive logistics networks and fleets that competitors would find hard to replicate.He added that Jumia has retained its top spot in Nigeria, even as Temu began making inroads late last year. Jumia has had to build its own logistics and infrastructure in several markets to serve a young, tech-savvy population that relies on smartphones to overcome gaps in services.The company was among the first African companies to reach “unicorn” status with its 2019 New York listing, though its market value fell from a January 2021 peak of over $5 billion. Still, shares have risen 210% so far this year, bringing its market value to roughly $1.45 billion.","The CEO of Jumia Technologies AG, Francis Dufay, has claimed that the company is benefiting from the global trade war.

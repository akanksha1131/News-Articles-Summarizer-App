Mico : “The Socratic Tutor”

Planning, learning, and staying 'Insane'





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has highlighted three new features within the company’s Copilot AI assistant that he claims have become indispensable to his daily work and personal life. Nadella touted the features as major advances in how humans interact with technology, comparing one innovation to the introduction of touchscreens.Nadella shared his top three “daily habits” in a short video clip posted on X (formerly Twitter), emphasising the rapid pace of development within Microsoft's AI initiatives.Nadella called the voice-activated Copilot on his Windows laptop the most exciting new way to interact with a computer since touch technology was introduced. The CEO described the feature as essentially giving him “a new mouse, and it just happens to be voice.” This allows him to instantly invoke Copilot while working on emails or documents and ask it questions.“I can just invoke Copilot and ask it questions. It retrieves information, and it's just fantastic to have,” Nadella said, praising it as the most exciting ""new modality"" to emerge since touch.The second feature the CEO highlighted is Mico, a new character interface for Copilot.Nadella praised Mico for transforming the AI interaction by giving it ""a face to talk to.""He described Miko as a Socratic tutor, capable of not just providing information but truly teaching the user. Nadella shared a personal example, noting how he and his daughter used Miko to explore Egyptian mythology.“The cool thing about it is it taught us both what we wanted, you know, not just give us information and it's just wonderful,” he stated.The third feature Nadella mentioned, though less specific, focuses on Copilot's utility in managing complex life and work demands. He lauded its capabilities in “planning, learning, coordinating,” and helping him “stay sane.”“So I think these three things are definitely becoming my go-to features on a daily basis,” he said.Nadella concluded his endorsement by encouraging users to try out the new functionalities, stating: ""We are building fast. Try these features out. Tell us what you think.""","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has highlighted three new features within the company’s Copilot AI assistant.

What's behind SELL rating on Nvidia









Nvidia is the world's most valuable company with a market cap nearing $4 trillion. Little doubt that it is investors darling on Wall Street. There are as many as 80 analysts who cover Nvidia, 73 of whom reportedly have the equivalent of a buy rating on the Nvidia stock, six rate it a hold. But there's one Jay Goldberg, who as Bloomberg says is the lone bear on high-flying Nvidia Corp. 54-year-old Jay Goldberg, a senior analyst at Seaport Global Securities, has sell rating on Nvidia stock.According to Bloomberg report, Gildberg said, “There’s a lot more that can go wrong with Nvidia than can go right.” With the AI boom driving the US economy and propelling the stock market to record after record, few people are eager to bet against the key company behind the rally.Goldberg, however, has no qualms about going against the grain.“I’m probably a little cantankerous by nature, so I’m skeptical of all of the hype around AI right now,” he said. “This is not my first bubble.” Quoting Bloomberg, analyst Goldberg, who covers 12 companies, has a sell rating solely on Nvidia, while maintaining buy ratings on Apple, Netgear, and AI-exposed chipmakers Broadcom and Arm Holdings. He argues the AI investment thesis hinges on six key players -- Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Oracle, and OpenAI -- driving demand for Nvidia chips, propelling Nvidia to a $4.5 trillion valuation.These five public companies are projected to spend nearly $400 billion on capital expenditures this year, a 67% increase from last year, while OpenAI has pledged over $1 trillion. However, with four of these companies reporting earnings next week, investors are growing skeptical about the lack of tangible returns on this massive spending.Goldberg compares this to the dot-com bubble’s telecommunications infrastructure boom, when he was earning his MBA at the University of Chicago before working at Lazard, Deutsche Bank, Peregrine Semiconductor, Qualcomm Inc., a software startup, and a venture capital firm. He notes that when expected internet traffic failed to materialize, stocks like Cisco Systems crashed and have yet to recover their 2000 peak.“That feels very strongly like the pattern we’re seeing now,” Goldberg told Bloomberg. “We’re going to build up all this AI stuff for what are largely psychological reasons. At some point the spending will stop, and the whole thing will tumble down and we’ll reset.”","Jay Goldberg, a senior analyst at Seaport Global Securities, has sell rating on Nvidia stock.

Other new features coming to Microsoft Teams







Microsoft Teams is reportedly adding a new feature that will automatically set a user's work location when they connect to an office Wi-Fi network. The update is said to be designed to reduce confusion about where employees are physically situated. According to a Microsoft 365 roadmap seen by TechRadar, “when users connect to their organisation's Wi-Fi, Teams will automatically set their work location to reflect the building they are working in.” However, this change could eliminate employees' ability to find a quiet, untracked space in the office premises. The new tool is currently in development and is expected to be released in December 2025, the report added. When released, the feature will be available to Teams users on both Windows and Mac globally, the report noted.Apart from this feature, Microsoft has rolled out a series of recent updates which are designed to improve efficiency for Microsoft Teams users. These updates include a new option that will allow users save messages in their chats and conversations, making it easier to find important messages without scrolling through long threads.The company also announced that configurable keyboard shortcuts will be introduced to Microsoft Teams soon, enabling users to access frequently used symbols, icons, and other elements more conveniently while working.The company has also confirmed that Copilot in Microsoft Teams will be able to review what’s shown on the screen during a meeting if recording is turned on. It uses this along with the meeting transcript and chat to help users get quick answers or summaries.For example, users can ask Copilot things like “Which products had the highest sales?” or “What feedback was given on each slide?” It can also create new content based on the meeting, such as rewriting a paragraph shown on-screen using feedback from the chat.This feature works with anything shared from a user’s desktop, including documents, slides, spreadsheets, or websites, no matter which app or platform they come from. The rollout for this feature is scheduled for August 2026, and the feature will be available across Android, Desktop, iOS, Mac, and Web platforms.","Microsoft Teams is reportedly adding a new feature that will automatically set a user's work location when they connect to an office Wi-Fi network.

How OnlyFans achieved this feat







OnlyFans has surpassed major technology companies, including Apple , Nvidia, Google , Meta and Microsoft, to achieve the highest revenue per employee globally. According to an analysis by the financial and marketing firm Barchart, the platform generates $37.6 million in revenue per employee. This figure is notably higher than that of large tech firms. For comparison, Nvidia generated $3.6 million per employee, Apple $2.4 million, Meta $2.2 million, Google $1.9 million, and both OpenAI and Microsoft $1.1 million per employee. The revenue per employee metric primarily reflects a company's operational efficiency rather than its overall size or market value. Despite its lead in this metric, OnlyFans' total revenue for the 2023 financial year was $1.3 billion, which is substantially lower than that of the tech giants.OnlyFans operates with nearly 42 employees while generating $1.3 billion in annual revenue. The platform hosts 2.1 million independent content creators who monetise their audiences directly through subscriptions and tips. The company takes a 20% commission on all transactions processed through the platform. Content creators retain 80% of revenue generated from their subscribers.The OnlyFans revenue performance demonstrates the profitability of platform-based business models that facilitate direct creator-to-consumer transactions.The company provides infrastructure and payment processing while independent creators produce content and build audiences.This approach requires fewer staff compared to traditional technology companies that develop products, manufacture hardware, or maintain extensive research and development operations. Platform models leverage user-generated content and network effects to achieve high revenue efficiency.The platform's business performance is closely linked to its adult content market, which critics claim accounts for a large share of its traffic and revenue. This connection has fueled ongoing discussion concerning content moderation, the potential for exploitation, and regulatory scrutiny.While the company promotes itself as a general hub for all types of creators, its reputation as an adult content platform has made it difficult to attract mainstream advertisers and expand beyond that niche.Additionally, some analysts note that the company's reliance on independent creators makes it sensitive to shifts in user behaviour, changes in government regulations, or restrictions imposed by payment processors.","OnlyFans generates $37.6 million in revenue per employee.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees.

Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

Nexperia’s Chinese parent company, Wingtech Technology, has issued a formal warning to the Dutch government, stating that its financial performance may take a major hit if it fails to regain control of its seized chipmaking unit, Nexperia, by the end of 2025. In its latest quarterly earnings report filed on Friday (October 24), the Shanghai-listed electronics firm warned of significant financial strain.“If control of Nexperia cannot be restored before the end of 2025, the company may face temporary downward pressure on revenue, profit and cash flow,” Bloomberg stated Wingtech as saying.The warning underscores the escalating international conflict centred on the critical semiconductor supplier. While Wingtech reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, with semiconductor revenue rising 12.2% year-on-year, the company noted that the long-term ability of its chipmaking segment to sustain growth is now in doubt due to the ongoing dispute.The clash began last month when the Dutch government took the step of seizing control of Nexperia, a key manufacturer of basic chips used widely in the automotive industry by companies like Volkswagen AG.Reports suggested that the seizure followed mounting US pressure after Wingtech was placed on the US Entity List in 2024. The Dutch government cited concerns that Nexperia will not operate independently of its Chinese parent, resulting in the removal of Nexperia's Chinese CEO.According to the report, the dispute is fueling concerns over global supply chain stability ahead of US-China trade talks. Earlier this week, China's commerce minister warned that the Dutch action has “seriously affected” the stability of the global supply chain. The Dutch government, in its replay, has stated it remains in contact with Chinese authorities, aiming to work “toward a constructive solution.”",Dutch government seized control of Nexperia's Chinese unit last month.

Meta's Llama models to power enterprise AI solutions

Building on five-year partnership between the two giants





Meta Platforms' Facebook Overseas has acquired a 30% stake in Reliance Enterprise Intelligence Limited (REIL), a new AI venture launched by Mukesh Ambani 's Reliance Industries, according to a regulatory filing. Reliance Intelligence Limited, RIL 's wholly owned AI subsidiary, will hold the remaining 70% stake in the joint venture, which was formally incorporated on October 24, 2025.The two companies have committed an initial combined investment of Rs 855 crore in REIL, which will focus on developing, marketing, and distributing enterprise AI services across India, PTI reported. Reliance Intelligence will invest Rs 2 crore towards the initial subscription of 20 million equity shares valued at Rs 10 each.The joint venture, first announced at RIL's Annual General Meeting in August 2025, will leverage Meta's open-source Llama AI models combined with Reliance's extensive enterprise reach. The partnership aims to offer two main products: an enterprise AI platform-as-a-service that enables organisations to customise and deploy generative AI models, and pre-configured AI solutions for industries including sales, marketing, IT operations, customer service, and finance.Meta will provide technical expertise in building Llama-based models, while Reliance will contribute its digital infrastructure and access to thousands of Indian enterprises and small businesses.The solutions will be deployable across cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments, with emphasis on lowering total cost of ownership.This AI collaboration extends the strategic relationship between Meta and Reliance that began in April 2020, when Facebook invested $5.7 billion (Rs 43,574 crore) in Jio Platforms, making it the largest minority shareholder. That investment, approved by the Competition Commission of India in June 2020, gave Facebook a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms, which houses RIL's telecom business with nearly 500 million subscribers.The regulatory filing noted that REIL's incorporation does not fall under related party transactions, and none of Reliance Industries' promoters, promoter group, or group companies have any interest in the transaction. No governmental or regulatory approvals were required for establishing REIL.","Meta Platforms' Facebook Overseas has acquired a 30% stake in Reliance Enterprise Intelligence Limited (REIL), a new AI venture launched by Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries.

US Infiltrates China’s Time Centre, Steals Secrets | Beijing Drops Bombshell Amid Trump’s Trade War

What all information China is asking in the questionnaire

How US and China are piling up trouble for companies





There seems no letting down in US-China trade war, at least for now. According to a report in Bloomberg, China has asked some US semiconductor companies to submit what is being termed as 'sensitive information'. The request comes from China’s Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Commerce. The questionnaire seeks details from US Chip companies their sales in the world’s largest chips market, China. The activity is said to be part of China's probe of American suppliers.The probe is reportedly designed to gather intelligence for an anti-dumping investigation on certain American-made analog IC chips. The Bloomberg report says, it is of the sort of products sold by Texas Instruments and Analog Devices.The analog chips that Beijing is now looking into are used to help digital systems interface with the real world, handling tasks like wireless signal amplification and power and voltage regulation. They don’t require cutting-edge chipmaking, but are essential in everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to medical imaging.The China’s Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau seeks data on sales activities of these companies in China, including a comparison of the costs and profits for the investigated chips in their home country.Among other requests, the China's fair-trade bureau asks for the names of Chinese customers and transaction details, including sales volumes and various costs from logistics to warehousing. The questionnaires ask for information on raw material suppliers working with these US chip companies. As per the report American companies will be given 37 days to provide their answers.So far, it remains unclear which all companies will be expected to fill out the questionnaires.China also recently added companies to its version of the US' entity list, which restricts transactions between Chinese companies and those that are targeted. It has launched antitrust probes into Qualcomm and Nvidia.Companies in both the countries face increasing pressure from their governments. The US is speculated to expand its entity list to over 10,000 Chinese companies and is considering broader export restrictions. China is implementing its own export controls on critical minerals, extending restrictions to foreign products using Chinese rare earths, and launching antitrust probes into U.S. companies.",China has asked some US semiconductor companies to submit what is being termed as'sensitive information' The request comes from China’s Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Commerce.

“They basically said, 'Listen, Mackey, here's what's going to happen. First thing we're going to do is take over your board. And once we do that, we're going to fire you. And then we're going to fire every one of your executives that doesn't do exactly what we tell them to do.

And then we're going to just put you up for sale to the highest bidder, and there's not an effing thing you can do about it. And then they walked out of the room.

”

“Amazon was the best solution to a problem we had. We didn't want to sell to Amazon. It's just that Amazon was the best solution to a problem we had. And that problem was we had shareholder activists take a large stake in the company,”

“win-win-win solution,”





How Whole Foods was acquired by Amazon



“We needed to lower our prices, but we needed time to do that. We weren't going to have time with Jana as investors,”





Whole Foods cofounder and former CEO John Mackey has revealed that he sold the grocery chain to online retail giant Amazon in 2017 only because he was forced. He said that activist hedge fund Jana Partners threatened to seize control of the board, fire him and his executive team, and sell the company anyway. In 2017, Jana Partners acquired an 8.8% stake, becoming Whole Foods' second-largest shareholder, and immediately called for a sale. In a recent episode of the Habits & Hustle podcast, Mackey explained the situation, saying:Mackey added.Amazon and Whole Foods announced the $13.7 billion acquisition just six weeks after their first meeting about a deal.Mackey described the Amazon deal as asaying it benefited customers through four price cuts, raised employee wages to a $15 minimum, helped suppliers access Amazon’s platform while keeping partnerships, and gave shareholders nearly 40% higher returns than before the deal.Before selling to Amazon, the grocery chain had reported declining same-store sales for six consecutive quarters and faced competition from conventional grocers selling organic products.The company struggled with its reputation for high prices and operational challenges that had pushed its stock price down before Jana's involvement. Mackey said the company needed time to lower prices and improve operations, but Jana's demands for immediate returns wouldn't allow it.Mackey explained.Mackey explored alternatives, including reaching out to Warren Buffett, who declined. Albertsons expressed interest, but Mackey considered it a poor cultural match. He then approached Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , whom he had met the previous year at a conference.","Whole Foods cofounder and former CEO John Mackey has revealed that he sold the grocery chain to online retail giant Amazon in 2017 only because he was forced.

Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Benioff says AI augments sales capacity, doesn't replace sellers

Salesforce's decision tells a different story





Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff insists artificial intelligence won't eliminate sales positions, announcing plans to hire between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople as the company pushes toward 20,000 account executives by year's end. Speaking in October 2025, Benioff emphasised that ""face-to-face communication"" remains essential in sales, stating that AI ""doesn't have a soul"" and lacks authentic human connectivity. The billionaire tech executive's stance comes despite Salesforce's aggressive AI adoption across other departments, including customer service where the company cut 4,000 roles earlier this year.""We love AI, OK? But AI — it's not the same,"" Benioff told TBPN. ""It's not that human connectivity.""Benioff argues AI enhances rather than replaces human salespeople, addressing a problem Salesforce has faced for 26 years: unanswered leads. The CEO revealed that AI agents recently contacted 4,000 potential customers in one week—follow-ups previously impossible with human-only teams.The combination of expanded human sales staff and AI assistance will increase Salesforce's overall sales capacity by 19%, Benioff projects.Among the company's 80,000 employees, roughly 25% are trained to help customers use Salesforce's sales products.While championing sales hiring, Benioff confirmed in September that Salesforce reduced customer support from 9,000 to 5,000 employees because he ""needs less heads."" The company's Agentforce AI platform now handles 50% of customer interactions, having completed over 1.2 million conversations since October 2024.The AI deployment reduced support costs by 17% and decreased case volumes enough that Salesforce no longer actively backfills support engineer positions, according to a company spokesperson.Benioff's divergent approach—expanding sales while contracting support—reflects his belief that balance is crucial. ""If you turn it over to 100% AI, you're putting your whole company at risk,"" he told Axios in July, acknowledging the ""bumpy"" transition as companies navigate unprecedented technological change.","Salesforce to hire between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople by year's end.

The company reported strong revenue in the third quarter, driven by high demand for its chips. This positive performance follows a significant investment from the US government. Intel expects this robust demand to continue through 2026. The company's client computing segment, which includes PC and laptop chips, saw a 5% year-over-year increase. Artificial intelligence is seen as a key driver for future growth.

US government's stake in Intel





Intel is back in profit. The chip giant snapped its losing streak of six straight quarterly losses and returned to profitability in the third quarter. The American chipmaker posted strong revenue, noting robust demand for chips that it expects to continue into 2026. This is Intel's first earnings report since the Donlad Trump administration acquired a 10% stake in the company in August this year.Client computing revenue, which includes chips for PCs and laptops, grew 5% year over year, benefiting from PC market stabilization and artificial intelligence PC prospects. CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a call with analysts that artificial intelligence “is a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth as we execute.” Tan added, “We significantly improved our cash position and liquidity in Q3, a key focus for me since becoming CEO in March. ”US President Donald Trump announced in August that the U.S. government would take a 10% stake in the Intel as part of his effort to bolster companies deemed vital to national security. With this, the US government is the company’s biggest shareholder. The investment seems to have worked well for the company's stock -- Intel stock is up more than 50% since Aug 22, when Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced the deal.On its part, Intel has agreed to make major investments in U.S. manufacturing facilities in exchange for the funds.Talking about its biggest shareholder, the US government, Intel CFO David Zinser told CNBC, “Like any shareholder, we have to keep in touch with them.” He added, “We don’t tell them how the numbers are going before the quarter. We generally talk to them like Fidelity,” another Intel shareholder.Intel also received $5 billion from rival Nvidia in September. Earlier this year, it received $2 billion from Japanese technology giant SoftBank.Talking about company's older chipmaking processes Zinser said that they have continued to do well, “and that was probably the part that was more unexpected.” Intel CFO said the company met some of the central processing unit (CPU) demand with inventory on hand, but they will be behind in thefirst quarter, “probably Q2 and maybe in Q3.”The supply crunch has been with older Intel 10 and 7 manufacturing technologies. Many customers are reportedly opting for less advanced hardware to refresh their operating systems, demonstrating enterprises aren’t waiting for cutting-edge chips when proven technology gets the job done.","Chip giant Intel has returned to profit after six quarters of losses.

Putin's FIERY Retaliation Against U.S. Over Trump Sanctions On Russia; 'Your Actions Won't Stop Us'

Silicon Valley hit by US-China trade war





Female spies have been part of wars since ages. There are many told and untold stories of female spies dating back World Wars, and becoming more prominent during Russia-US cold war of sixties and seventies. The Cold War era saw female spies play crucial and varied roles on both sides of the Iron Curtain. They were not just peripheral figures; they were integral cogs in the Cold War's espionage machinery, contributing to everything from high-level strategic analysis to dangerous field operations.And now a new report in 'The Times' claims that female spies are waging 'sex warfare' to steal Silicon Valley secrets. Quoting some analysts, the report claims that China and Russia are sending attractive women to seduce tech workers — even marrying and having children with their targets.Chinese and Russian operatives are reportedly using seduction as a weapon to infiltrate Silicon Valley, targeting tech professionals to steal trade secrets, according to industry insiders quoted in the report. According to 'The Times' exclusive report, the tactic, dubbed ""sex warfare,"" is part of a broader espionage campaign exploiting America’s tech industry, costing taxpayers up to $600 billion annually, per the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.James Mulvenon, chief intelligence officer at Pamir Consulting, revealed he’s been repeatedly targeted by “sophisticated” LinkedIn requests from attractive young Chinese women. At a recent Virginia conference on Chinese investment risks, two such women attempted to gain entry but were denied.“It’s a phenomenon,” Mulvenon is quoted as saying. “They have an asymmetric advantage because we don’t do that here.” Counterintelligence experts warn that China and Russia are leveraging civilians—investors, crypto analysts, and academics—rather than trained spies, making detection harder.China is also accused of hosting startup competitions on American soil to steal business plans. The annual China (Shenzhen) Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, held in cities like Boston and Tokyo, lures startups with cash prizes but requires them to share sensitive intellectual property and establish operations in China. A Silicon Valley biotech CEO who won $50,000 at last year’s event said he was heavily monitored, with organizers wiring funds to his personal account—a move he found suspicious. His company later lost U.S. federal funding, possibly due to ties with Asian investors.In a high-profile case, Klaus Pflugbeil, a former Tesla employee, was sentenced to 24 months in prison in December 2024 for attempting to sell stolen battery technology secrets for $15 million at a Las Vegas trade conference. His alleged accomplice, Yilong Shao, remains at large. Experts also point to China-backed venture capital firms investing in U.S. startups initially funded by the Department of Defense (DoD). This “drafting” tactic pushes foreign ownership beyond thresholds that block further DoD investment, starving innovative firms of critical funding.A Senate committee recently found that six of the 25 largest recipients of federal Small Business Innovation Research funds had ties to China, receiving nearly $180 million from the Pentagon in 2023 and 2024.“It’s the Wild West,” said Jeff Stoff, a security academic and former U.S. government analyst. He noted that China exploits regulatory blind spots, operating with “virtual impunity.” Counterintelligence officials are now urging increased scrutiny of cross-border investments and greater awareness of espionage threats in Silicon Valley. “China is targeting our startups, academics, and DoD-funded projects,” Stoff warned. “We’ve not even entered the battlefield.”","Chinese and Russian operatives are reportedly using seduction as a weapon to infiltrate Silicon Valley, targeting tech professionals to steal trade secrets.

When Elon Musk said Twitter algorithm sucks





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has acknowledged ongoing issues with Twitter ’s (now X) recommendation algorithm. In a post, the world’s richest person apologized to users for what he described as ‘frustrations’ with how Twitter posts are being surfaced on the microblogging platform. “My apologies for frustrations with the 𝕏 algorithm. We are working hard to fix the problem,” Musk wrote in a post.Over the past few weeks, several X users have reported inconsistencies in their feeds – — including repetitive content, delayed updates, and limited visibility for certain accounts. Some creators have also complained about drops in engagement and reach, sparking speculation about recent algorithmic changes.Ever since taking charge of the platform in 2022, Musk made algorithm transparency a central theme. He has previously said the company is continuously tweaking its feed-ranking system to prioritise “useful and engaging” posts. Earlier this year, X open-sourced parts of its recommendation code to allow users to see how posts are promoted or demoted.While Musk did not detail what the latest issue involves or when it will be resolved, his acknowledgment suggests that X’s engineering team is actively working on an update.Earlier this year in January, Musk playfully ‘slammed’ the recommendation algorithm of X. Criticising X’s recommendation algorithm, Musk jokingly said: “If I see one more da*n Nazi salute in my feed, I’m gonna lose my mind 🤪 This algorithm sucks!!” Later on, he also wrote: “The recommendation algorithm on this platform sucks! I want to talk to the manager right now!!”Musk's remarks then came after his hand gestures at Donald Trump 's inauguration sparked controversy online, with some comparing it to Nazi salutes.","The world’s richest person apologized to users for what he described as ‘frustrations’ with how Twitter posts are being surfaced on the microblogging platform. “My apologies for frustrations with the algorithm.

Match Group-Apple’s years-long antitrust battle







Tinder-parent company Match Group has urged India's antitrust regulator to impose substantial fines on Apple , arguing that the iPhone maker's commission fees threaten to stifle its business in one of the world's fastest-growing dating app markets, a report has said. In a submission to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), Match said Apple's fees of up to 30% will over time damage its revenue streams and growth prospects in India, news agency Reuters reported.In a response dated October 13 to the CCI investigators' findings, Match urged the watchdog to issue final directives ordering Apple to discontinue what it called anti-competitive practices.“Apple's policies adversely affect the return on capital and revenue streams of Match's portfolio brands,” the company said in its submission, which was reviewed by Reuters.“In the long term, the constraints and excessive fee imposed by Apple will stifle the growth and scalability of Match's portfolio brands,” Match added. According to advisory firm MarketNtel, in India, the dating apps market is projected to reach $1.42 billion by 2030.The CCI has the power to fine Apple up to 10% of its global average turnover for the last three financial years—potentially a massive penalty given Apple's worldwide revenues.Match explicitly urged CCI to calculate fines based on Apple's global turnover rather than just its Indian revenues, arguing this approach could “act as a significant deterrent against recidivism” or to put it in easy words – prevent Apple from repeating such behaviour.Match has been locked in an antitrust dispute with Apple at the CCI since 2022. Last year, investigators issued a report concluding that Apple had engaged in “abusive conduct” in the apps market of its iPhone Operating System (iOS).Apple has denied any wrongdoing, arguing it is a small player in India where smartphones overwhelmingly use Google's Android system rather than iOS.Match also accused Apple of discriminatory treatment in how it classifies different apps and charges commissions accordingly. The company pointed out that Uber's ride-hailing app is classified by Apple as providing ""physical goods"" and charged lower commission rates, while Tinder is treated as providing ""digital services"" and faces higher fees.""Tinder and Uber both offer matchmaking services in essence,"" Match argued in its filing, suggesting the distinction is arbitrary and unfair.","Match has been locked in an antitrust dispute with Apple at the Competition Commission of India since 2022.

How Xbox team responded to 'accountability margins' set by Microsoft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-xbox-team-responded-to-accountability-margins-set-by-microsoft/articleshow/124789391.cms,"Why ‘30% margin’ is a challenge for Microsoft gaming unit



Xbox's response: Job cuts , price hike and other changes







Microsoft is reportedly demanding significantly higher returns from its gaming division, Xbox, a mandate that has forced the unit to implement major strategic shifts. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, the aggressive push began in late 2023 when Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood implemented a strict new financial goal: Xbox must achieve 30% “accountability margins” (Microsoft’s term for profit margins) across all its gaming operations.This target is steep for the video game industry, where the average profit margin typically ranges between 17% and 22%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Xbox itself has operated with margins between 10% and 20% over the last six years, with court documents showing a 12% margin in fiscal year 2022.The new 30% goal marks a profound change in culture for Xbox. Previously, game developers were encouraged to prioritize creativity and innovation, focusing on building the best possible games without the pressure of specific profit targets.However, Hood's finance team has taken a much larger role in gaming decisions over the past two years, ushering in the new, tougher margin requirement.The pressure to meet the high 30% margin has directly led to significant restructuring and strategy changes across the Xbox division, including canceled games, job losses and major strategy changes.Job cuts and canceled projects: Xbox has undergone multiple cost-cutting measures, including laying off thousands of employees.It also canceled several high-profile and expensive games that had been in development for more than seven years, including Everwild, Perfect Dark and Project Blackbird.Price increases: To immediately boost revenue, Xbox recently raised prices across various products and services.Game releases on competing platforms: In the most significant strategic reversal, Xbox announced in 2024 that it would begin releasing a majority of its games on competing consoles from Nintendo and Sony for the first time, a move aimed squarely at expanding market reach and increasing revenue.","Microsoft is reportedly demanding significantly higher returns from its gaming division, Xbox, a mandate that has forced the unit to implement major strategic shifts.

"UPI may create this monthly transactions record in October 2025, here’s why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/upi-may-create-this-monthly-transactions-record-for-first-time-in-october-2025-heres-why/articleshow/124788989.cms,"Representative Image

What may be the reason behind this growth in UPI







India's real-time payment network, the Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ), is expected to set a new monthly record in October. Driven by festive spending, lower GST rates, and sustained consumer adoption of digital transactions, the payment platform may surpass Rs 28 lakh crore in monthly transaction value for the first time, exceeding its previous record of Rs 25 lakh crore. According to a report by the Economic Times, the average daily transaction value has already jumped 13% from September to Rs 94,000 crore, signalling strong momentum heading into the final days of the month. Multiple records have been set in volume as well, including daily transactions that reached 740 million on Diwali eve. In contrast, the average daily volume reached 695 million, up more than 6% from September's record.As per the report, the surge comes despite a subdued September, when digital payment activity dipped to a fiscal-year low as consumers deferred spending ahead of GST rate reductions that took effect on September 22. With festive shopping now underway, UPI has recorded six days of over Rs 1 lakh crore in daily value so far in October, double the tally from the previous month.Festival-linked purchases and the timing of salary inflows are amplifying payment activity, pushing UPI values to peak levels typically seen in early-month cycles dominated by salaries and EMIs.The combination of holiday demand and favourable tax rates has extended those peaks deeper into the month.To compare, credit card payments appear to have cooled after hitting a record high in September, when e-commerce sales on Amazon and Flipkart drove online spending to Rs 1.18 lakh crore.With the large sales concluding before October, UPI is emerging as the primary beneficiary of ongoing festive consumption.With Diwali-week transactions already above trend, UPI is set to deliver not only a record October but also reinforce its position in India's digital payments landscape, now accounting for roughly 85% of all digital transactions nationwide.","India's real-time payment network, the Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ), is expected to set a new monthly record in October.

Meta and TikTok push back on findings







The European Union’s (EU) executive body the European Commission has said that TikTok, and Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram have violated its transparency rules under the Digital Services Act (DSA), the bloc's landmark technology regulation, that may result in billions of dollars in fines for the social media companies.The Commission's primary finding centres on data access for researchers. According to EU rules, social media platforms must give researchers “adequate access” to public data so they can study the platforms' impacts on society, including potential physical and mental health effects on users.The Commission says that it found that Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok “may have put in place burdensome procedures and tools for researchers to request access to public data. This often leaves them with partial or unreliable data, impacting their ability to conduct research, such as whether users, including minors, are exposed to illegal or harmful content.”This means that according to the EU, these companies made it too difficult for researchers to get the data they need, leaving them with incomplete or unreliable information that hampers legitimate studies.Meta faces additional accusations beyond the data access issue. The Commission preliminarily found that both Facebook and Instagram breached their obligations to:Provide users with simple mechanisms to report illegal contentAllow users to effectively challenge content moderation decisions when the platform removes or restricts their postsBoth companies strongly disputed the Commission's findings.“We disagree with any suggestion that we have breached the DSA, and we continue to negotiate with the European Commission on these matters,” said Meta spokesperson Ben Walters. He added that Meta has made changes to its content reporting options, appeals process, and data access tools since the DSA came into force, and expressed confidence that ""these solutions match what is required under the law in the EU.""Meanwhile, a TikTok spokesperson emphasised the company's commitment to transparency and researcher access, noting that “almost 1000 research teams have been given access to data through our Research Tools to date.”TikTok also highlighted a potential conflict between different EU regulations: ""Requirements to ease data safeguards place the DSA and GDPR [Europe's privacy law] in direct tension. If it is not possible to fully comply with both, we urge regulators to provide clarity on how these obligations should be reconciled.""","The European Union’s (EU) executive body has said that TikTok, and Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram have violated its transparency rules.

US chip equipment manufacturer Applied Materials has begun laying off approximately 4% of its global workforce. The company cited the need to adapt to industry changes driven by automation and digitalisation as the reason for job cuts. Based on the company's August 2025 filing of having approximately 36,100 full-time employees, the 4% cut translates to about 1,444 jobs being eliminated.According to a regulatory filing (via CNBC), the company, which provides essential equipment and services to the semiconductor industry, began notifying impacted employees around the world on Thursday (October 23). The reduction affects employees “across all levels and groups.”""Our goal is to continue to transform how we work, move faster, simplify decision-making, and focus on what matters most as we prepare Applied Materials for significant growth in the coming years,"" CEO Gary Dickerson said in a memo to employees.Applied Materials stated that the layoffs are part of a broader effort to create a “more competitive and productive organisation.”“Automation, digitalization and geographic shifts are redefining our workforce needs and skill requirements,"" the company wrote in the filing.It added that the company is focused on “building high-velocity, high-productivity teams, adopting new technologies and simplifying organizational structures.”The timing of the cuts follows a challenging forecast for the company's fiscal year.

Erotic a ‘very dangerous’ direction: Suleyman



The ‘growing rift’ with OpenAI







Microsoft's AI chief Mustafa Suleyman is essentially drawing a line against AI-generated erotica, which the company's longtime partner OpenAI recently offered in ChatGPT, calling the service ‘dangerous’. The CEO of Microsoft AI said that the tech giant will not build AI services offering “simulated erotica,” explicitly distancing Microsoft from OpenAI's recent announcement that it would allow adult users to generate erotic content with ChatGPT.“That's just not a service we're going to provide. Other companies will build that,” Suleyman said at the Paley International Council Summit in Menlo Park, California.Suleyman’s opposition to AI erotica purportedly stems from his broader philosophy that tech companies shouldn’t create AI that seems conscious or capable of suffering. In August, he warned in an essay that conscious-seeming AIs may create a new “axis of division” between humans and machines. Suleyman argued this scenario is already unfolding, primarily through erotica-focused AI services.Suleyman seems to have been pointing towards OpenAI as well as Elon Musk's Grok chatbot, which launched companion features earlier this year.Grok’s offering includes a female anime character designed for intimate interactions.“You can already see it with some of these avatars and people leaning into the kind of sexbot erotica direction,” Suleyman was quoted as saying.“This is very dangerous, and I think we should be making conscious decisions to avoid those kinds of things,” he added.Notably, critics also worry that such services could isolate users, create unhealthy attachment patterns, or exploit vulnerable individuals.The comments come at a time when there are reports of increasing tension between Microsoft and OpenAI, despite Microsoft's position as a major investor and cloud infrastructure partner to the ChatGPT maker. Various reports have said that the two companies have built substantial AI businesses leveraging their respective strengths, however, cracks have developed in the relationship.Microsoft has begun focusing more heavily on its own AI services rather than relying exclusively on OpenAI. Moreover, Microsoft unveiled features for its Copilot AI chatbot, including an AI companion called Mico that can respond to users through voice calls and express emotions by changing colors.Meanwhile, OpenAI has been diversifying its partnerships beyond Microsoft, recently striking deals with Microsoft rivals including Google and Oracle.","Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, said the tech giant will not build AI services offering ‘simulated erotica,’ explicitly distancing Microsoft from OpenAI's recent announcement that it would allow adult users to generate erotic content with ChatGPT. “That's just not a service we're going to provide.

Hi Team,

I am writing to share a difficult update.

With the launch of R2 in front of us and the need to profitably scale our business, we have made the very difficult decision to make a number of structural adjustments to our teams. These changes result in a reduction in the size of our team by roughly 4.5%.

These are not changes that were made lightly. With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions. This news is challenging to hear, and the hard work and contributions of the team members who are leaving are greatly appreciated.

To ensure we move forward with clarity, I want to summarize the areas most impacted.

Streamlining the Customer Journey: To provide a seamless experience for our customers, we are integrating the Vehicle Operations workstreams into the Service organization to create fewer customer handoffs and clearer ownership. We are also integrating the Delivery and Mobile Operations into the Sales organization to ensure the purchase experience is as seamless as possible with a single touchpoint throughout the entire sales process and to delivery.

Elevating Our Marketing Efforts: Historically we have had multiple functions that collectively capture what would typically be housed in a single marketing organization. We have made the decision to form a single marketing organization, and while we recruit our first Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), I will be acting as Interim CMO. Our Marketing Experiences team, led by Denise Cherry, and the Creative Studio team, led by Matt Soldan, will both report directly to me for now.

These changes are being made to ensure we can deliver on our potential by scaling efficiently towards building a healthy and profitable business. I am incredibly confident in R2 and the hard work of our teams to deliver and ramp this incredible product.

Thanks again everyone.

RJ

These changes result in a reduction in the size of our team by roughly 4.5%.”This is one of several rounds of job cuts Rivian has made over the past three years. The move follows a challenging period for EV makers, even as US electric car sales reached record highs in the third quarter of 2025. The industry took a hit after the Trump administration ended the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicle buyers.","Tesla-rival EV maker Rivian has announced to cut 4.5% of its workforce.

Alaska Airlines has confirmed that its operations have resumed after an information technology (IT) outage forced the airline to ground its planes for hours. In a statement to the news agency AP, the airline said 229 flights were cancelled due to the outage and that additional flight disruptions were expected as it worked toAlaska Airlines said it is working to get travellers to their destinations affected by the interruption and asked passengers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. The latest grounding affected Alaska Air and Horizon Air flights. Hawaiian Airlines, which was acquired by Alaska Air Group last year, said its flights were operating as scheduled.In July, Alaska grounded all of its flights for about three hours after the failure of a critical piece of hardware at a data centre. Computer problems have disrupted flights across the industry in the past, though disruptions are typically temporary.Last month, United Airlines faced a similar outage that caused delays at airports in Chicago, San Francisco, Houston, and Newark, New Jersey.On the morning of September 24, the airline again grounded all flights nationwide due to a “connectivity issue.” The Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at United’s request across the US and Canada between 1 a.m.and 2:30 a.m. ET, which was lifted after about 30 minutes.The Air Traffic Control System Command Centre citedas the reason. United later told NBC News it had experienced a brief connectivity issue before midnight Central time but had since resumed normal operations.According to FlightAware, 42 flights were delayed and four cancelled between 12 a.m. and 4 a.m. ET, with Los Angeles International Airport most affected."," 229 flights were cancelled due to the outage.

In a revolutionary breakthrough, scientists at Science Corporation have unveiled a retinal implant that can restore functional vision for people experiencing irreversible vision loss. This cutting-edge eye chip enables patients to read text, solve crosswords, and perform essential daily visual tasks using artificial vision. The implant works through a sophisticated system combining a microchip placed under the retina with augmented-reality glasses that transmit visual information directly to the brain. Tested on participants in multiple countries, the technology has shown significant improvements in vision, offering hope to millions affected by conditions like age-related macular degeneration. This innovation marks a pivotal advancement in ophthalmology, redefining possibilities for restoring independence, improving quality of life, and empowering individuals with vision impairment to re-engage with the world, pursue careers, social activities, and educational opportunities previously thought unattainable.As reported by Metro UK, Science Corporation, a competitor of Elon Musk’s Neuralink, has pioneered a brain-computer interface called PRIMA.The system uses a pair of camera-mounted augmented-reality glasses that wirelessly transmit signals to a microchip placed beneath the retina. This technology is specifically designed for patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of sight loss in adults over 55.AMD affects over five million people globally and leads to central vision loss through a process known as geographic atrophy (GA). This condition makes everyday tasks such as reading, driving, and recognising faces very difficult. While previous treatments slowed disease progression, they did not restore vision until now. The PRIMA implant was tested on 38 participants across 17 sites in five countries, with Moorfields Eye Hospital in London serving as the only UK site. Researchers report that 84 percent of participants experienced clinically meaningful vision improvement after 12 months of use.The procedure involves surgically inserting a ultra-thin SIM card-sized microchip (2mm by 2mm) under the retina's centre. The patient wears augmented-reality glasses connected to a small computer attached to their waistband. Artificial intelligence algorithms process images captured by the camera and convert them into electrical signals. These signals stimulate retinal and optic nerve cells, allowing the brain to interpret them as visual information.Patients must undergo intensive rehabilitation over several months to interpret these electrical visual signals and regain reading ability. Sheila Irvine, a participant from Moorfields, shared her journey:""Before the implant, it was like having two black discs in my eyes. I have always loved reading, and I wanted that back. At first, learning to read again was challenging, but with practice, I can now tackle small print, do crosswords, and enjoy reading more than ever. It has given me independence, optimism, and confidence.""Irvine’s experience shows how retinal implants can dramatically improve quality of life, allowing patients to reconnect with activities they thought were lost forever. With dedicated therapy, patience, and daily exercises, many patients gradually regain more complex visual skills, enhancing both personal and social independence.Mahi Muqit, senior vitreoretinal consultant at Moorfields Eye Hospital and the Institute of Ophthalmology at UCL, said:""This represents a new era in artificial vision. Patients with dry AMD can regain meaningful central vision for the first time. The ability to read lifts mood, restores confidence, and improves independence. The PRIMA chip procedure is safe, can be performed in under two hours by trained surgeons, and opens access to this life-changing therapy for many blind patients."" The PRIMA implant not only restores functional vision but also gives patients a sense of autonomy and engagement with the world. From reading prescription labels to enjoying television and completing crosswords, artificial vision transforms daily life and offers hope to millions suffering from AMD worldwide.","Scientists at Science Corporation have unveiled a retinal implant that can restore functional vision for people experiencing irreversible vision loss.

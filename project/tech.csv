Amazon takes on SpaceX’s Starlink with launch of first Kuiper satellites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-takes-on-spacexs-starlink-with-launch-of-first-kuiper-satellites/articleshow/120714750.cms,"Amazon Kuiper satellites: A rival to SpaceX’s Starlink

Amazon Kuiper satellites: Future plans

With agency inputs

Amazon has marked a significant milestone in its Project Kuiper by successfully launching its first internet satellites. The satellites, deployed via the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, are part of a planned constellation of 3,236 satellites aimed at delivering global broadband services. This move positions Amazon as a direct competitor to SpaceX’s Starlink, which dominates the satellite internet market with over 7,000 operational satellites. With an investment of over $10 billion, Amazon aims to provide fast, affordable internet to underserved regions, showcasing its commitment to innovation in the rapidly evolving satellite industry.Amazon’s entry into the satellite internet market positions it as a direct competitor to SpaceX’s Starlink, which already operates over 7,000 satellites and serves millions of users worldwide. Project Kuiper aims to offer fast, affordable internet, particularly in underserved regions, leveraging Amazon’s expertise in cloud computing and consumer products.The launch, initially delayed due to bad weather, represents the first operational deployment of Kuiper satellites. Amazon plans to meet the FCC deadline to deploy half of its satellite network by mid-2026, despite the challenges posed by its late start in the market.Amazon Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos has voiced confidence that Kuiper can compete with Starlink, telling Reuters in a January interview ""there's insatiable demand"" for internet.""There's room for lots of winners there. I predict Starlink will continue to be successful, and I predict Kuiper will be successful as well,"" he said.""It will be a primarily commercial system, but there will be defense uses for these LEO constellations, no doubt,"" he added, referring to low-Earth orbit.Amazon has invested over $10 billion in Project Kuiper and secured multiple launch contracts with providers like Blue Origin and Arianespace. The company expects to begin delivering services later this year, targeting both consumers and businesses globally.","Amazon has successfully launched its first internet satellites.

OpenAI updates ChatGPT search with new shopping features: Here’s how itworks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-updates-chatgpt-search-with-new-shopping-features-heres-how-itworks/articleshow/120714729.cms,"ChatGPT competing with Google



How the shopping feature in ChatGPT search works



Search Query Input: Users can ask detailed questions or describe what they are looking for, such as “Best headphones under $100” or “Stylish table lamps for my living room.” Data Integration: ChatGPT processes the query and retrieves relevant information about products, including images, reviews, pricing, and purchase links. This data is sourced from online retailers and other shopping platforms. Tailored Suggestions: The AI provides customised recommendations based on the user’s query, offering insights on products that align with their requirements. Independent Results: OpenAI ensures that the results are unbiased and not influenced by ads, prioritising a user-centric experience. Direct Shopping Links: Users are provided with links to purchase the suggested items directly, streamlining the shopping process.

Future Enhancements



OpenAI has introduced a significant update to ChatGPT, adding shopping capabilities to its search tool. This enhancement allows users to find products, compare options, view images and reviews, and access direct purchase links—all within the chatbot interface. The new feature enables users to ask detailed, natural-language questions and receive tailored product recommendations. Initially, the shopping categories include fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics, with plans to expand further. OpenAI emphasised that the results are independently determined and not influenced by advertisements. OpenAI plans to combine its memory feature with shopping for Pro and Plus users, offering more personalized recommendations based on past interactions.This update positions ChatGPT as a direct competitor to Google’s search engine, offering a more personalised and ad-free shopping experience. OpenAI reported that ChatGPT users conducted over 1 billion web searches last week, highlighting the growing popularity of its search capabilities.The shopping feature in ChatGPT search works by leveraging natural-language processing to deliver personalised product recommendations based on user queries.

Bill Gates daughter Phoebe Gates launches shopping platform that aims to be ‘Google Flights’ for fashion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-daughter-phoebe-gates-launches-shopping-platform-that-aims-to-be-google-flights-for-fashion/articleshow/120708249.cms,"The fashion industry, notorious for being the world’s second-largest producer of greenhouse gases and environmental pollutants after oil and gas, generates enough clothing to outfit the next six generations. Amid this backdrop of waste and excess, Stanford graduates Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni have launched Phia that aims to tackle this sustainability crisis. Wondering how? The app and desktop tool aggregates secondhand and retail shopping options from across the web, with the aim to make sustainable fashion accessible and affordable.Phia functions as a one-stop shop for fashion. As Kianni told New York Post, the platform is “Google Flights for fashion.” Phia scours the internet to find the best prices for clothing, enabling users to compare options effortlessly. It aims to address common pain points in secondhand shopping, such as concerns about scams or inflated prices. The app not only prioritizes affordability but also promotes sustainability by encouraging secondhand purchases, reducing the demand for new clothing production, which contributes significantly to the industry’s 10% share of global carbon emissions.Phoebe Gates, the youngest daughter of Bill and Melinda Gates, brings a unique perspective to the venture. Beyond her famous lineage, Gates has carved her own path as an advocate and entrepreneur. A Stanford graduate with a degree in human biology, she interned at British Vogue, gaining insight into the fashion world, and has emerged as a prominent voice for reproductive rights. In 2024, she was named Reproductive Freedom for All’s Champion of the Year and has spoken at high-profile events like Global Citizen. Her co-founder, Sophia Kianni, is equally accomplished. At 23, Kianni founded Climate Cardinals, the world’s largest youth-led climate nonprofit, and serves as the youngest United Nations advisor, bringing her environmental expertise to Phia’s mission.Phia’s core features include an interface that aggregates listings from platforms like Poshmark, Depop, and major retailers, allowing users to filter by price, size, condition, and sustainability metrics. The platform also provides transparency about an item’s environmental impact, such as its carbon footprint or water usage, empowering consumers to make informed choices. For example, buying a secondhand jacket through Phia could save the equivalent of 10 pounds of CO2 emissions compared to purchasing new. The app’s algorithm prioritizes listings from verified sellers to ensure authenticity and quality, addressing trust issues prevalent in secondhand markets.Gates is determined to establish Phia independently of her family’s influence. While she acknowledges the privilege her background affords, she and Kianni secured funding without relying on her parents. Their cap table, though private, includes notable investors like Kris Jenner, who revealed her involvement on “The Burnouts.” “We want this to be a real company, with a product that stands on its own,” Gates told NY Post.","Phia is an app and desktop tool that aggregates secondhand and retail shopping options from across the web.

"China's Xi Jinping 'sends message' to country's technology companies as DeepSeek called ""profound threat"" to America's national security",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinas-xi-jinping-sends-message-to-countrys-technology-companies-as-deepseek-called-profound-threat-to-americas-national-security/articleshow/120708131.cms,"China's President Xi Jinping (Farhan Abdullah/Malaysia's Department of Information via AP)

Trump Tariffs and the new Cold War

Made-in-China strategy

Chinese President Xi Jinping has reportedly declared artificial intelligence (AI) a cornerstone of the next technological revolution, urging China to seize a competitive edge in this transformative field. Speaking at a high-level meeting of the Communist Party focused on emerging technologies, Xi emphasized that AI is reshaping human production and lifestyles, positioning it as a strategic priority for China’s global ambitions. His remarks, reported by state-run Xinhua, underscore Beijing’s determination to lead the AI race while navigating growing international tensions over its technological advancements.Xi called for leveraging China’s unique system of resource mobilization to drive AI innovation, emphasizing self-reliance and application-driven development. He advocated for a balanced approach, promoting AI’s growth in a way that is “beneficial, safe, and equitable.” Acknowledging gaps in foundational theories and core technologies, Xi urged accelerated efforts in scientific research, industrial applications, and regulatory frameworks to ensure China retains control over both AI development and governance. “We must comprehensively advance sci-tech innovation and firmly grasp the initiative,” he stated, signaling a long-term vision to close the gap with global leaders like the United States.China’s AI ambitions are part of a broader push to dominate emerging technologies. In recent years, the country has ramped up investments in AI, quantum computing, and electric vehicles (EVs), emerging as a global leader in EV production. The Chinese military has also begun integrating AI into non-combat applications, such as logistics and surveillance, raising concerns among Western nations about potential dual-use capabilities. According to a 2024 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, China’s AI investment reached $25 billion in 2023, second only to the U.S., with state-backed firms driving much of the progress.A notable example of China’s AI prowess is DeepSeek, a low-cost AI model developed by Chinese tech firm High-Flyer. Launched in early 2025, DeepSeek gained global attention for its affordability and performance, positioning it as a competitor to Western models like those from OpenAI. However, the tool has sparked controversy. On April 17, the U.S. House Select Committee on Strategic Competition labeled DeepSeek a “profound threat” to national security, alleging ties to the Communist Party and accusing it of undermining U.S. technological leadership. The committee’s report cited concerns over data privacy and potential military applications, reflecting broader anxieties about China’s growing influence in AI.The backlash against DeepSeek has not been limited to the U.S. Countries like India, Japan, and Australia have imposed restrictions on its use by government officials, citing risks of data leaks and espionage. India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, for instance, flagged DeepSeek’s data collection practices as a potential violation of its 2024 Digital Personal Data Protection Act. These restrictions have fueled accusations from Beijing that the West and its allies are politicizing trade and technology. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian recently condemned the bans, arguing they “stifle innovation and distort global cooperation.”Xi’s push for AI leadership comes amid an intensifying U.S.-China tech rivalry, often described as a new Cold War. The U.S. has tightened export controls on advanced semiconductors and AI technologies, aiming to curb China’s access to critical components. In response, China has doubled down on domestic innovation, with firms like Huawei and Baidu making strides in AI chip development despite Western sanctions. A 2025 analysis by the Brookings Institution noted that China’s focus on applied AI—such as facial recognition and smart cities—has given it an edge in real-world deployments, even if it lags in foundational research.However, China’s AI strategy faces challenges. Experts point to a shortage of top-tier talent and overreliance on state-driven investment as potential bottlenecks. From an international perspective, China’s AI rise is both an opportunity and a concern. Developing nations in Africa and Southeast Asia have welcomed affordable Chinese AI tools, which offer cost-effective solutions for healthcare, agriculture, and education. Yet, fears of data sovereignty and dependency on Chinese tech have prompted calls for stricter oversight. The European Union, for instance, is exploring a “third way” in AI governance, balancing innovation with ethical standards to counter both U.S. and Chinese dominance.Xi’s vision for AI reflects China’s broader goal of achieving technological self-sufficiency by 2035, a target embedded in its 14th Five-Year Plan. With initiatives like the “Made in China 2025” strategy, Beijing is positioning AI as a driver of economic growth and geopolitical influence. However, the path forward is fraught with risks, from escalating trade disputes to ethical dilemmas surrounding AI surveillance and autonomous systems.","Chinese President Xi Jinping has reportedly declared artificial intelligence a cornerstone of the next technological revolution.

Mark Zuckkerberg’s wife Priscilla Chan-funded free Silicon Valley School to shut down next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/trump-effect-mark-zuckerberg-funded-silicon-valley-school-to-shut-down-next-year-read-what-the-note-on-the-schools-website-says/articleshow/120497475.cms,"What the note on the school's website says

Mark Zuckerberg's Education Ventures

The Primary School , a no-cost private institution in the Bay Area co-founded by Priscilla Chan , wife of Facebook parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , will reportedly cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students. First reported by Bloomberg, the impending closure was disclosed in a statement posted on the school's website recently. In a move aimed at preserving its legacy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the billionaire couple's philanthropic arm, has committed $50 million to invest in the communities the school serves -— specifically East Palo Alto, Belle Haven, and the East Bay region near San Francisco -- over the subsequent few years.""This was a very difficult decision, and we are committed to ensuring a thoughtful and supportive transition for students and families over the next year,"" the online statement conveyed. Carson Cook, a spokesperson for The Primary School, stated there would be no further comment beyond the official announcement.Pediatrician Priscilla Chan, 40, co-established The Primary School in 2016, implementing an ""integrated health and education model"" designed to support families and children from birth through high school, according to the organization's tax filings. The school's inaugural middle school cohort commenced in 2023.The most recent tax documentation indicates that over 95% of The Primary School's students in East Palo Alto identify as under-represented minorities. The filing also revealed the nonprofit held assets exceeding $30 million as of the end of June 2023.The Primary School is among several educational endeavors recently initiated by prominent billionaires. Elon Musk , Jeff Bezos, and Larry Ellison have all established schools in recent years. Musk's nonprofit, the Musk Foundation, has contributed $237 million to his technology-focused primary and secondary school in Austin, named Ad Astra, with future aspirations for a university. Ad Astra collaborates with the same entity that assisted Ellison in establishing his Hala Kahiki Montessori school in Lanai, Hawaii, an island largely owned by the Oracle co-founder. Amazon.com founder Bezos has created a network of Montessori-inspired preschools catering to children in underserved communities.The closure of The Primary School coincides with significant strategic shifts within Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms Inc. as the 40-year-old founder appears to be aligning his business interests more closely with the Trump administration. Recent appointments to Meta's board include longtime Trump allies Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, and Dina Powell McCormick, who served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser during his first term.Furthermore, Zuckerberg has appointed a Republican strategist as chief of global affairs, eliminated Meta’s US fact-checking program, rolled back the company’s hate-speech policies, and discontinued key diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at both Meta and CZI. This contrasts with The Primary School's documented commitment to diversity, which included conducting a diversity audit in June 2020 following the Black Lives Matter protests and forming a DEI task force in the fall of that year.","The Primary School will cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students.

Kanye West, who is now known as Ye, was booted out from the streaming platform Twitch just minutes after creating his own account, a report has said.

Implications for global research

Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law, which restricts the sharing of “important data” with overseas partners without approval. The suspension impacts joint research in fields like health and environmental studies , raising questions about the future of international scientific cooperation .Implemented in 2021, China’s Data Security Law broadly defines “important data” as information that could threaten national or economic interests or affect the rights of individuals or organisations. European agencies, including the German Research Foundation , Swedish Research Council, and Swiss National Science Foundation, have expressed concerns over the law’s vague provisions, which make it difficult to assess compliance and avoid legal liabilities.The law requires security clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China to export data classified as “important,” effectively making cross-border data sharing extremely challenging. This has led to the suspension of new co-funded projects with China’s National Natural Science Foundation.The halt in collaborations could delay progress in critical areas like pandemic response and air quality studies, where data sharing is essential. Experts warn that the restrictions may hinder the ability to address global health challenges effectively.Jan Palmowski, Secretary-General of the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities, emphasised the need for responsible and safe data sharing to tackle future pandemics and other health crises.","Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law.

Can removed shows and movies return to Netflix

In May 2025, Netflix is preparing to remove a significant number of movies and TV shows from its streaming platform. As part of its routine content refresh process, the company periodically pulls titles when licensing agreements expire or when strategic changes are made to its library.

Here's a detailed breakdown of everything leaving Netflix in May 2025, along with answers to common questions about why titles disappear.Netflix typically removes titles when licensing agreements expire or when it decides to refresh its content catalog to make way for new additions. Content licensing is time-limited and negotiated with studios, networks, and rights holders. When the contract ends, Netflix must either renegotiate, renew, or allow the content to leave.Additionally, Netflix may remove content based on:Some titles may return in the future if Netflix renews licensing agreements or forms new deals with content providers.

Tesla makes an offer to customers in Canada: Buy cars at ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-makes-an-offer-to-customers-in-canada-buy-cars-at-/articleshow/120705169.cms,"Representative Image

How will these tariffs increase the prices of Tesla cars in Canada



Tesla is asking customers in Canada to purchase vehicles at pre-tariff prices. This offer comes as the company prepares to raise prices in response to ongoing trade tensions. Currently, a banner on the Elon Musk-led electric car maker's Canadian website is showing a message that reads, “explore pre-tariff priced inventory while supplies last.” This message began appearing for customers over the weekend, a report claims. This comes as US President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts remain in place, despite a 90-day pause on most other tariffs announced earlier this month. In response, Canada has also imposed its own 25% tariff on US car imports.According to a report by The New York Post, a Tesla sales representative at a dealership near Toronto said the pre-tariff prices are available for all models that were imported into Canada before the tariff increases were implemented.According to data from the car blog Drive Tesla, once the current inventory is cleared, Tesla customers could see price hikes of up to 22% on some models. For example, the all-wheel drive version of the Cybertruck, which now costs C$139,990 (about $101,250 USD), will increase by C$25,000 ($18,000 USD) from its previous price of C$114,990 ($83,169 USD).The price of Tesla’s long-range Model 3 sedan in Canada will rise 16% to C$79,990 ($57,855 USD), while the long-range Model Y SUV will become 21% more expensive at C$84,990 ($61,471 USD).These increases come at a challenging time for Tesla, as the company faces a sales slowdown. Vehicle deliveries — a key indicator of sales — dropped by 13% in the first quarter, and Tesla’s net profit fell sharply by 71% during the same period.","Tesla is asking customers in Canada to purchase vehicles at pre-tariff prices.

Why CEO of $40 billion company that caused biggest-ever Windows outage wishes he had joined Microsoft before going to law school,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-ceo-of-40-billion-company-that-caused-biggest-ever-windows-outage-wishes-he-had-joined-microsoft-before-going-to-law-school/articleshow/120704622.cms,"""an arrogant young kid""

What Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said about working before graduation



“Figuring out a way to get to some company that's somewhere between 2,000 and 20,000 employees, and is working on interesting projects — that's the thing that I wish I had.”

""The camaraderie and the rolodex and the interesting people that you will meet in that, is just such a huge accelerant to your career,""

Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince has said that he would advise his younger self to gain experience at a big company before pursuing graduate school. Speaking as the co-founder and head of $40 billion dollar cybersecurity firm, Prince said he’s largely satisfied with his career choices but regrets declining job offers straight out of college. After earning a Bachelor’s degree in English literature and computer science, Prince reportedly received offers from Yahoo , Microsoft , and Netscape. However, he turned them down, admitting he wasfocused on becoming a cybersecurity lawyer. He instead enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School the following year and later went on to teach law. The cybersecurity company was involved in the biggest-ever Windows outage that occurred last year, but it was not directly caused by Cloudflare. The disruption stemmed from a misconfiguration within Microsoft's Azure backend workloads, affecting connectivity between storage and compute resources.In an interview with Business Insider, Prince said:During the period when he received the three job offers, the dot-com boom was at its peak, with companies like Microsoft leading innovation. Prince noted that the offers would have allowed him to work at a fast-growing company with ""a bunch of interesting problems"" and ""some real scale."" He also noted that accepting one of the roles may have helped him build a larger network of colleagues.Prince added.However, Prince said he doesn’t regret declining later job offers that didn’t align with his interests, like a bankruptcy attorney role when he wanted to pursue securities law. Yet, he highlighted that his law degree remains valuable, even though he doesn’t practice, as it helps him navigate the legal challenges his company faces.Meanwhile, his advice to his younger self comes from missing the experience of working at a fast-growing company with a broad network of colleagues — something like a Stripe or Twin Base today, he continued.While Prince thinks it would have been interesting to explore those opportunities, he acknowledged that he may have avoided trouble. The dot-com bubble eventually burst, and by following his path, he was able to build a company that combined his interests and education.","Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said he regrets declining job offers straight out of college.

LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman has once again warned that the tariffs and spending cuts imposed by US President Donald Trump may hurt the US and help China. Hoffman, who is also a venture capitalist, recently claimed that the Trump administration's tariffs could increase China’s industrial and technological strength, potentially undercutting US competitiveness in artificial intelligence. This comes after Hoffman warned that the US risks straining its alliances—something that could have consequences for American businesses, including in the tech sector, in March. At that time, he argued that a lack of diplomacy may give international competitors an edge over US companies.In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Hoffman said the tariffs arenoting that if Europe comes to see China as a morefor manufacturing and technology, it willHe even cautioned that, without course correction, these policies could hand Beijing the upper hand in next-generation tech.Hoffman has even voiced concern about DOGE member Elon Musk’s drive to make changes to the federal government and trim its budget.

World's biggest YouTuber MrBeast shares 'secret' behind his $700 million YouTube empire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/worlds-biggest-youtuber-mrbeast-shares-secret-behind-his-700-million-youtube-empire/articleshow/120700309.cms,"MrBeast (file image)

What is the ‘purple cow effect’ and what MrBeast said about it



“The thing is, to go viral, you have to do something that’s never been done before. If you’re driving down the road, and you see a cow, who cares? It’s a cow. But if you’re driving down the road, and you see

a purple cow

, you’ve never seen that before, and it’s something you aren’t expecting. You’re going to go, ‘Holy s***.’ You’re going to tell your friend about it. You’re going to remember that. You’ll probably even think about it randomly once every couple of years: Why the f**k was there a purple cow?”

“You can apply that same analogy to ideas. When you’re scrolling through social media to find a video to watch, there are things that have been done before. You’ll scroll past it, and you’ll never think about it again. Just like you’ll never think about a cow on the side of the road. And then there are the purple cow ideas—which is what I try to do—that make you go, ‘What the f**k? I’ve never seen that. I have to click this or I’m not going to be able to sleep tonight,”

MrBeast explains why his success is difficult to replicate



“To get that purple cow effect, [the videos have] never been done before. And if something’s never been done before, there’s usually a reason—’cause it’s very hard. You have to train yourself not to resent very difficult, complex, hard original problems and actually run toward them, because those are the ones that tend to have more of the purple cow effect, where people have to watch it. It’s pretty winner-take-all in the top videos, [so] you really have to lean into that purple cow effect,”

Jimmy Donaldson , aka MrBeast , who owns the YouTube channel with the most subscribers in the world, may have discovered the formula for influencer success. However, his discovery implies that few others will be able to replicate his level of success. In a world saturated with individuals and businesses striving for viral content across various platforms, over his 15-year-old video-creating career, he observed that cutting through the noise is increasingly challenging. Donaldson, now estimated to be worth $85 million with numerous ventures, philanthropic projects, and an Amazon TV series, is a prime example of a successful digital creator. According to Business Insider, Donaldson now heads an empire worth $700 million. He noted that he realised early on that achieving virality requires creating content that is significantly different from everything else available.In a Diary of a CEO podcast, Donaldson said:Donaldson added.MrBeast’s YouTube channel has multiple attention-grabbing titles such as “I spent 100 hours inside the Pyramids,” “7 days stranded at sea,” and “$10,000 every day you survive in a grocery store.”Pulling off these stunts demands meticulous planning, substantial funding, and exclusive access—resources reserved for only the most elite creators. Donaldson himself has revealed that producing his videos runs into “millions,” a fact he shared when X owner Elon Musk urged him to switch platforms from YouTube. He refused, noting that ad revenue from X wouldn’t even cover his expenses, let alone generate any profit.the YouTuber added.","Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast, owns the YouTube channel with the most subscribers in the world.

A massive power blackout has struck Spain, Portugal and parts of southern France. The outage has reportedly left millions without electricity, crippling mobile networks and forcing the suspension of Madrid Open tennis matches at the Manzanares Park Tennis Center. According to a report by Sky News, Eduardo Prieto, head of operations at Spain’s grid operator Red Eléctrica de España (REE), warned that restoring power could take between six and ten hours. The outage has also paralysed public transport in major cities—including the Madrid and Barcelona metros and Lisbon trains, darkened airports, stopped traffic lights, and disrupted phone services, reports claim. Both the Spanish and Portuguese governments, alongside REE and other utilities, have activated emergency contingency plans and launched probes into the cause of the blackout. In southern France, grid operator RTE reported only a brief interruption before power was fully restored and is investigating any links to the Iberian outage.Spain’s railway operator told AFP that the power cut caused trains to be halted across the entire country, while the airports operator Aena mentioned that ""several incidents"" occurred at Spanish airports. The Madrid Open saw its matches suspended after the widespread power outage hit the Spanish capital. This forced 15th seed Grigor Dimitrov and his British opponent Jacob Fearnley off the court, as scoreboards went dark and overhead cameras lost power.Mobile phone networks were down, and AFP reporters in Madrid and Barcelona noted that many people took to the streets, holding their smartphones up in an attempt to reconnect to a network. With the internet inaccessible, many people turned to the radio for news updates on the situation.Numerous traffic lights stopped working, prompting vehicles to slow down to avoid accidents. Meanwhile, metros and trains were stopped, and Spain’s national road authority, DGT, urged drivers to refrain from using the roads.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has also visited his way to the headquarters of Red Electrica, the state electricity network operator, to receive an update on the emergency, according to his office.Red Electrica of Spain confirmed it had started restoring power in the northern and southern regions of the country, though the issue had not yet been fully resolved. ""We are continuing to work to bring back power,"" it stated.Spanish radio stations reported that part of the Madrid underground was being evacuated. Cader Ser Radio noted traffic jams in the city centre as traffic lights stopped working.Hundreds of people gathered outside office buildings in Madrid, while a strong police presence was seen around key locations, directing traffic and driving through central areas with lights, according to a Reuters witness.","Spain, Portugal and parts of southern France hit by massive power outage.

Nobel Prize winner and AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton was awakened in the middle of the night last year with the surprising news that he had won the Nobel Prize in physics , a recognition he never expected for his groundbreaking work in neural networks .""I dreamt about winning one for figuring out how the brain works. But I didn't figure out how the brain works, but I won one anyway,"" Hinton told CBS Saturday Morning in a recent interview.The 77-year-old researcher, often called the ""Godfather of AI,"" earned the prestigious award for his pioneering work in neural networks. His 1986 method to predict the next word in a sequence became the foundation for today's Large Language Models (LLMs).Despite his contributions to the field, Hinton has become increasingly concerned about AI's rapid development. In his CBS interview, he warned that people ""haven't understood what's coming"" and compared humanity's relationship with AI to raising a tiger cub that might eventually turn dangerous.""The best way to understand it emotionally is we are like somebody who has this really cute tiger cub,"" Hinton explained. ""Unless you can be very sure that it's not gonna want to kill you when it's grown up, you should worry.""Hinton estimates a 10% to 20% chance that artificial intelligence will eventually take control from humans, echoing concerns from industry leaders like Google CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman . However, he criticizes these same companies for prioritizing profits over safety and lobbying against regulation.In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech last December, Hinton addressed both the potential benefits and dangers of AI:""This new form of AI excels at modeling human intuition rather than human reasoning and it will enable us to create highly intelligent and knowledgeable assistants,"" he said. ""If the benefits of the increased productivity can be shared equally it will be a wonderful advance for all humanity.""However, he cautioned about immediate risks like divisive echo chambers, government surveillance, and cyber attacks, as well as the existential threat of creating digital beings smarter than humans. ""We urgently need research on how to prevent these new beings from wanting to take control,"" Hinton warned.

Major cities impacted by Electricity Blackout

A sweeping Blackout struck most of Spain and all of Portugal around noon on Monday (April 28), paralyzing public transport, power, and phone services across the Iberian Peninsula. Parts of France were also impacted, according to Portugal’s grid operator, REN. Authorities are scrambling to identify the cause of the outage, with Spain’s grid operator, Red Electrica, and the government launching urgent investigations. A cyberattack has not been ruled out.The unprecedented power cut, described as highly unusual for Europe, left major cities like Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon in disarray. Public transport ground to a halt, traffic lights failed, and phone services were disrupted. In Madrid, metro stations were evacuated, and office workers flooded the streets of the financial district. Ambulances navigated chaotic traffic along Castellana Avenue, where police used loudspeakers to direct vehicles and pedestrians. ATMs in city centers were also reported inoperable.Spain’s government has established a crisis committee to manage the situation, while utilities have activated backup plans, Red Electrica announced on Twitter. Portugal’s REN confirmed it is investigating alongside French counterparts. An hour after the outage began, officials remained unable to pinpoint its cause.The blackout spared Spain’s Canary and Balearic Islands, a government spokesperson confirmed. Companies across Spain sent workers home, and police were deployed to control swelling crowds in urban centers.This marks one of the worst power outages in recent European history. Spain has no record of a similar event in recent decades, while Italy faced a comparable crisis in 2003, and London endured a major blackout in 2018. As investigations continue, authorities are working to restore services and prevent further disruption.Investigations are ongoing, and updates are expected as more information becomes available.","Most of Spain and all of Portugal were affected by the blackout.

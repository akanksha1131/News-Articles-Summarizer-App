"AI startup CEO who has hired several Meta engineers says: Reason AI researchers are leaving Meta is, as founder Mark Zuckerberg said, ""Biggest risk is not taking ...""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-startup-ceo-who-has-hired-several-meta-engineers-says-reason-ai-researchers-are-leaving-meta-is-as-founder-mark-zuckerberg-said-biggest-risk-is-not-taking-/articleshow/123704579.cms,"“the biggest risk is not taking any risks.”

What startup CEO Shen said about AI researchers leaving Meta



“Meta is constantly doing reorganizations. Your manager and your goals can change every few months. For some researchers, it can be really frustrating and feel like a waste of time. So yes, I think that's a driver for people to leave Meta and join other companies, especially startups.

There's other reasons people might leave. I think the biggest one is what Mark (Zuckerberg) has said: ‘In an age that's evolving so fast, the biggest risk is not taking any risks. So why not do that and potentially change the world as part of a trillion-dollar company?’

We have already hired Eddy Wu, our Chief AI Officer who was my manager's manager at Meta. He's making a similar amount to what we're offering the new people. He was on their generative AI team, which is now Meta Superintelligence Labs. And we are already talking to a few other people from MSL and some others from Google DeepMind.”

What Shen said about hiring Meta AI researchers for his startup



“It's because of the talent war that was started by Mark Zuckerberg. I used to work at Meta, and I speak with my former colleagues often about this. When I heard about their compensation packages, I was shocked — it's really in the tens of millions range. But it shows that in this age, AI researchers who make the best models and stand at the frontier of technology are really worth this amount of money. We're building an AI model that can see and remember just like humans. The things that we are working on are very niche. So we are looking for people who are really, really good at the whole field of understanding video data.”

Shawn Shen , co-founder and CEO of the AI startup Memories.ai, has stated that some researchers are leaving Facebook-parent Meta due to frequent company reorganisations and a desire to take on bigger risks. Shen, who left Meta himself last year, notes that constant changes in managers and goals can be frustrating for researchers, leading them to seek opportunities at other companies and startups. Shen's startup, which builds AI to understand visual data, recently announced a plan to offer up to $2 million compensation packages to researchers from top tech companies. Memories.ai has already hired Chi-Hao Wu, a former Meta research scientist, as its chief AI officer. Shen also referenced a statement from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg who earlier said that theIn an interview with Business Insider, Shen said:Shen noted that he’s offering AI researchers who are leaving Meta pay packages of $2 million to work with his startup. He said:He even explained that his company is prioritising hires who are willing to take more equity than cash, allowing it to preserve its financial runway. These recruits will be treated as founding members rather than employees, with compensation split between cash and equity depending on the individual, Shen added.Over the next six months, the AI startup is planning to add three to five people, followed by another five to ten within a year, alongside efforts to raise additional funding. Shen believes that investing heavily in talent will strengthen, not hinder, future fundraising.","Shawn Shen, co-founder and CEO of the AI startup Memories.ai, has stated that some researchers are leaving Facebook-parent Meta due to frequent company reorganisations.

Zuckerberg puts Octagon in his backyard

A former Meta top employee has revealed Mark Zuckerberg 's ‘unusual’ executive mandate. An upcoming memoir by former head of global affairs at Meta, Nick Clegg, reveals an unusual and intense side of the Facebook co-founder, detailing how he encouraged his senior leaders to engage in mixed martial arts (MMA) training with him.“Mark’s commitment to MMA is so strong that he insisted one morning, during a management offsite, that some of his most senior executives join him for a training session,” Clegg writes in his new book.Clegg recounts his experience on the mat, where he found himself in a submission hold with his deputy, Joel Kaplan, in a move known as the ""Domination Mount,” which he described as ""too close for comfort.""The Meta CEO's martial arts hobby became widely known after he began competing in Jiu-Jitsu tournaments. In the past, he has shared several photos of himself with various MMA fighters and shared the mat with some of them.In 2023, Zuckerberg built an MMA octagon in the backyard of his home, which his wife, Priscilla Chan, did not like. Zuckerberg took to Instagram to share a humorous text exchange with his wife after he built the octagon in the backyard which did not receive a warm welcome from Chan.Her reaction, shared via WhatsApp, was swift and to the point. “I have been working on that grass for two years,” she scolded her billionaire husband.The addition fueled speculation about his much-discussed “cage match” with Elon Musk . The two tech billionaires have shared that they have been training for the potential bout, capturing global attention.","Former head of global affairs at Meta, Nick Clegg, reveals an unusual and intense side of the Facebook co-founder.

Citing sources familiar with the meeting, a report by Bloomberg stated that Zuckerberg raised concerns about these digital service taxes , which are levied on the revenue tech companies generate from users in a specific country.

Meghan Markle's partnership with Netflix to sell products from her brand, As Ever, is already ""petering out"" just seven months after it was announced, a report claims. According to a recent report, none of her products, which include jam and pancake mix, are currently listed on the Netflix website. Despite a formal partnership announced in February, there are growing doubts that As Ever products will be sold in the company's new brick-and-mortar stores, which are set to open in the US later this year. The report cited Marina Hyde, who recently suggested on her podcast, ""The Rest is Entertainment,"" that Netflix is quietly dropping the partnership.In a statement to the Daily Mail, a Netflix spokesperson stated that As Ever products have never been sold on the Netflix website. However, the company declined to comment on Hyde’s other allegation.As per the report, some of Meghan’s As Ever products are priced higher than what Netflix’s hourly staff would earn. For example, customers must purchase at least three bottles of As Ever wine for $90, or six bottles for $159, and twelve bottles for $300 — plus $20 in shipping and taxes. Other items include a crepe mix at $14 (£10.34), herbal teas at $12 (£8.86), and flower sprinkles priced at $15 (£11.08) per pack.Meanwhile, Season 2 of With Love, Meghan has struggled since its release less than two weeks ago, currently ranked at 136 on the Netflix charts, below two cancelled series nearly a decade old. The show has received poor reviews, with critics noting Meghan’s inability to secure prominent names such as Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, or a Kardashian. Instead, the cast has been described asincluding her make-up artist, pilates instructor, and a lineup of chefs.A source claimed that Netflix supported the Duchess by filling the show with personalities already tied to the streamer, most of whom are TV chefs. The report also noted that many of the guests have links to WME, the talent agency representing Meghan.A British Hollywood insider explained:Fans have also expressed disappointment over the setting — a rented house near her Montecito home used for privacy. Model Chrissy Teigen, Queer Eye’s Tan France, and motivational speaker Jay Shetty appear in the new season, alongside Meghan’s long-time acquaintances Daniel Martin and Heather Dorak.Other guests include chefs Samin Nosrat, Christina Tosi, Jose Andres, David Chang, and Clare Smyth, who catered the Sussexes’ 2018 wedding.","Meghan Markle's partnership with Netflix to sell products from her brand, As Ever, is already ""petering out"" just seven months after it was announced.

Apple and Google have reached a formal agreement to integrate Google’s Gemini model into Apple’s voice assistant overhaul, and the deal builds on their existing search partnership worth approximately $20 billion annually to Apple, according to a Bloomberg report published this week.The partnership will support Apple’s “World Knowledge Answers” project, an AI-powered search tool that will enable Siri to compete with services like ChatGPT and Perplexity AI. The feature is scheduled to launch in spring 2026 with iOS 26.4.Google will provide a custom Gemini model to handle Siri’s summarization capabilities, running on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers.The updated Siri will feature an interface combining text, photos, videos, and local information with AI-powered summarization. Apple plans to use its own technology for searching user data while potentially deploying Google’s model for web searches and response planning.Bloomberg sources said Apple’s internal evaluations initially showed Anthropic’s Claude AI outperforming Google’s technology in quality tests. However, Google secured the partnership by offering better financial terms after Anthropic requested more than $1.5 billion per year.The development follows this week’s federal court ruling that allows Apple to continue its Google search deal while ending exclusive distribution agreements.

Google’s response

Legal and regulatory context

The US federal jury has ordered tech giant Google to pay $425 million in damages after finding the company violated users’ privacy by collecting data even when a key tracking feature is switched off. The class-action case alleged that Google gathered user information via its web and app activity setting. The company collected the data of about 98 millions users and 174 million devices for over a period of 8 years. The case also allege that the company gathered information despite users opting out.The San Francisco jury found Google liable on two of three privacy violation claims but determined the company had not acted with malice. This means that no punitive damages were awarded. Plaintiffs gad sought more than $31 billion in damages. Originally filed in July 2020, the lawsuit claimed that Google still collected data via partnerships with apps such as Uber, Venom and Instagram. The company collected the data from all those who used Google analytics services.Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said that the company will appeal. Castaneda argued that the verdict has misinterpreted how the system works. “This decision misunderstands how our products work. Our privacy tools give people control over their data, and when they turn off personalization, we honour that choice.”During the trial Google maintained the stand that any collected data was non personal, pseudonymous, and stored securely in encrypted location. The company also claimed that the data collected was not linked to any individual user identities.The ruling further adds to Google’s mounting privacy challenges. Earlier this year, Google paid around $1.4 billion to settle a privacy lawsuit with the state of Texas, and in April 2024 agreed to destroy billions of records from users’ private browsing sessions, including those in “Incognito” mode.",Jury finds Google liable on two of three privacy violation claims.

Chrome is saved, but Google will have to share data and end exclusive deals

Google employees erupted in celebration Tuesday after a federal judge ruled the tech giant could keep its Chrome browser, avoiding what could have been a devastating corporate breakup. The decision sent Google’s stock soaring more than 6% in after-hours trading while employees flooded internal message boards with memes and jokes. US District Judge Amit Mehta handed down antitrust penalties against Google after previously ruling its search business operates as an illegal monopoly. The Justice Department had pushed for forcing Google to sell Chrome, but Mehta rejected this proposal along with other more aggressive remedies in the landmark case.According to messages and memes reviewed by Business Insider, Google employees quickly turned to humor to celebrate the news. One worker edited a Lord of the Rings scene to read “Looks like Chrome is back on the menu, boys!” while another referenced The Wolf of Wall Street, showing Chrome declaring “I’m not ******* leaving.”A particularly creative employee photographed an office sign reading “You belong here” and added the word “Chrome” underneath. Business Insider reported that another post showed a picture of a candle with the caption “Sending support to Googlers who sold $GOOG recently.”While Google avoided a breakup, Mehta’s ruling wasn’t entirely favorable. The company must share valuable search data with competitors and cannot make exclusive deals to distribute its search engine or AI products as defaults on devices and browsers.The judge also banned Google from making exclusive arrangements that could block rivals’ distribution, though the company can still pay partners like Apple and Mozilla for search placement.Several Google employees who spoke anonymously to Business Insider said the outcome wouldn’t significantly impact daily operations. “I think people are mostly happy about the stock,” one employee noted.Google can now finally appeal the underlying monopoly ruling, potentially taking the case to the Supreme Court in a process that could stretch for years.",Google employees erupted in celebration Tuesday after a federal judge ruled the tech giant could keep its Chrome browser.

Roles on the rise



The introduction of powerful generative AI tools such as ChatGPT has coincided with a dramatic downturn in the US tech job market. As reported by Business Insider, the data by new labor market revealed that the tech job postings in the United States have dropped by more than half since the introduction of OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT in November 2022. The data clearly indicates that how generative AI is reshaping the hiring priorities in the industry.The steep decline in the hiring practices reveal the slowdown in demand for many traditional tech roles mainly in software engineering, quality assurance and certain It support positions as the companies are adopting AI tools to automate testing, coding and routine maintenance tasks. As per recruiters this shift in the job market has been accelerated by cost-cutting pressures and growing integration of AI into workflows.The report also reveal that some positions have seen some sharpest posting witnessing a sharp decline. These posts include:* Front-end and back-end software developers* Quality assurance testers* Database administrators* Technical support specialistsIndustry analysts note that while these jobs aren’t disappearing entirely, the number of openings has fallen dramatically as AI systems take over repetitive or standardized tasks.At the same time, the tech industry is also witnessing an increase in demand for roles which are directly linked to AI development, deployment and oversight. These roles include:* Machine learning engineers* AI product managers* Prompt engineers* Data scientists specializing in AI model training* AI ethics and compliance officersThese positions often require hybrid skill sets — blending technical expertise with domain knowledge in areas like law, healthcare, or finance — as companies race to integrate AI into products and services.Economists say the data underscores a structural shift in the tech labor market: while AI is reducing demand for some traditional roles, it’s creating new opportunities in emerging fields. However, the net effect so far has been a contraction in overall postings, suggesting workers may need to reskill to stay competitive.","The introduction of powerful generative AI tools such as ChatGPT has coincided with a dramatic downturn in the US tech job market.

Dear Meta,

After four solid years, I've decided it's time for me to move on to a new exciting chapter. My last day is this Friday.

So, time for a performance review. Your's not mine [wink emoji].

Rating: Met Most Expectations*

*caveat: they were sky-high

You were my dream employer. I believed in you long before I joined — back when the Obama election, the Arab Spring and Safety Check made it feel like Facebook was helping rewrite what social connection meant in the 21st Century. I defended you (fiercely) through Cambridge Analytica. I turned down a promotion to work here. I came in all-in, with heart, intellect, and purpose.

And to your credit, you delivered on lots of what I imagined. I was thrown in at the deep end right away, tackling a multi-pronged campaign sprint on DSA, DMA and data flows. I led bold campaigns on innovation across Europe, coordinated an open letter on AI regulation signed by over 40 CEOs, deployed red-teaming events for policy leaders, and helped shape the AI conversation at a pivotal time.

Most importantly, I got to learn from brilliant, funny, resourceful people — the kind who challenge you, help you grow, and somehow make even the wildest weeks survivable. I can't possibly name everyone but want to extend heartfelt thanks to:

- Europe Public Policy rockstars, especially my campaign partners in crime Gillian, Reem, Annette, Aida, Cara, Laura, Julia, Stefan, Stepan for the laughter and team spirit, come hell or high water.

* The core EU AI campaign crew — Carola, Anna, Ellie, Eva, Nicolas, Catherine, Ania - - forever bonded by the joy (and traumas) of the open letter(s) and sprint-marathons.

* Global XFN partners and friends for their collaboration over the years: Katie, Elaine, John, Darren, Donald, Diana, Jennifer, Maeve, DaYoung, Chinny, Raghav, Aanchal, Edgar, Simon, Edouard, Kasia.

* My Paris office support system, in particular the wonderful Aurora, Anne-Sophie, Thomas, Daniel, Grégory, Michèle, Anton'Maria, Elisa, and so many others.

* And finally, leadership — thanks to Markus, Nathan, and Bailey for the opportunities, and to Laurent for his guidance and encouragement throughout my time here.

* And for the next half? Keep leaning into what makes you great: you're filled with extraordinary talent. Keep empowering people to be bold, direct, imaginative, and true to the values that inspired so many of us to join in the first place. As for me, I'm glad I came. I leave clearer, stronger, and with a renewed sense of the kind of leader I want to be — one who builds with intention, protects what makes people shine, and stays allergic to bullsh*t. For my own next half (that word struck out) year, I'll be exploring entrepreneurial paths and beautiful places — more to come soon on LinkedIn + behind the scenes on IG.

Thanks for the lessons. Onward.

Sincerely,

Christelle.

Apple is all set to launch its next generation iPhone lineup next week. The company has already confirmed that it will launch the iPhone 17 series September 9. Now a new online report suggests that the Cupertino-based tech giant is talks to integrate Google’s Gemini AI models into a major upgrade of Siri. It is said that this move of the company could significantly improve the conversational abilities and general knowledge of Siri.According to a report by Bloomberg, this partnership would witness Siri leverage Gemini’s large language model capabilities for some queries. Apple is also said to be exploring a hybrid approach in which Siri will continue to handle on-device tasks and privacy-sensitive requests using Apple’s own models and will route complete and web-informed questions to Gemini.While Apple has been developing its own AI models, it has also considered outside partnerships to accelerate its progress. The company previously held talks with other leading AI firms, including Anthropic PBC and OpenAI, to evaluate whether their models, Claude or ChatGPT, could serve as a more powerful “brain” for Siri.If everything is finalised then this deal between Apple and Google will mark as one of the most high-profile collaborations. It would also signal Apple’s willingness to work with external AI providers to close the gap with competitors like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Amazon’s Alexa, both of which have made rapid advances in natural language capabilities.Apple users will also be able to benefit from this deal. The Gemini integration could allow Siri to:* Deliver more conversational, context-aware answers* Handle follow-up questions more fluidly* Provide richer, real-time information from the web* Improve multilingual and translation featuresApple is reportedly testing the upgrade internally, with a public rollout potentially tied to a future iOS update in 2026.",Apple is reportedly in talks to integrate Google's Gemini AI models into Siri.

Mangione case sparks 'Dark Fandom'

Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein has launched an investigation after an image of Luigi Mangione , who is accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was used to model a shirt on its website. The image, which showed a likeness of Mangione wearing a white, short-sleeved shirt, has since been removed. The shirt was reportedly listed for just under $10. A Shein spokesperson told BBC News that the image was provided by a third-party vendor and was removed immediately upon discovery.Incidentally, this is not the first time that Mangione's likeness has caused a major company a headache. In December 2024, the BBC complained to Apple after its new AI-powered ""Apple Intelligence"" feature falsely generated a summary stating that Mangione had shot himself. Apple later suspended the feature due to this and some other errors.""We have stringent standards for all listings on our platform,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are conducting a thorough investigation, strengthening our monitoring processes, and will take appropriate action against the vendor in line with our policies."" It is currently unknown how long the image was featured on the site or who the vendor was.The image's origin remains unclear, but many online have speculated it was created using artificial intelligence (AI). The BBC report said that BBC Verify used the facial recognition tool Amazon Rekognition, which found a 99.9% similarity score between the Shein image and a real photo of Mangione from his court appearance.Generative AI expert Henry Ajder noted that the low-resolution image has several signs of being AI-generated or manipulated, including unusual lighting and skin texture, as well as a ""blob-like artifact"" and atypical finger segmentation on the right hand. He added that generating such an image with AI is significantly faster and easier than manual photo editing.Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested last December and pleaded not guilty to all federal charges of murder and stalking in April. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The public reaction to the case has been intense, sparking what some have dubbed a ""dark fandom"" fueled by anger toward America's private healthcare system.

Google may be the next tech giant to settle a lawsuit with US President Donald Trump over his social media ban. This comes after Meta paid $25 million to resolve a similar case earlier this year. Lawyers for Trump and YouTube informed a federal judge that they are engaged in “productive discussions” regarding the lawsuit Trump filed after his account was suspended following the January 6, 2021 attack .“The parties continue to engage in productive discussions regarding next steps in this case, with additional discussions anticipated in the near future,” the parties recently told a federal judge.“The parties therefore respectfully request that the Initial Case Management Conference be deferred to November 10, 2025 and the Joint Case Management Statement be due November 3, 2025,” they added. The legal teams anticipate more talks in the near future. Trump has also filed lawsuits against Meta (formerly Facebook) and Twitter over their bans.Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) previously warned that Google might follow Meta's lead. She suggested that this potential settlement is another example of large corporations possibly influencing government actions.Meta agreed to a $25 million settlement with Trump, ending a lawsuit over his suspension from Facebook and Instagram. The platforms banned Trump's accounts after the January 6 Capitol attack, citing his posts about election fraud and his claims of winning the 2020 election.Under the agreement, about $22 million will be allocated to Trump's presidential library, while the remaining $3 million will cover legal fees and other plaintiffs.The resolution of the lawsuit followed a period of mending relations between Zuckerberg and Trump, who previously had a contentious relationship. Zuckerberg reportedly visited Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate multiple times, with one visit in November where settlement talks began.",Lawyers for Trump and YouTube informed a federal judge that they are engaged in “productive discussions” regarding the lawsuit.

Gmail Warning: That Urgent Security Notification from Google May Be a Trap

Days after the Trump administration announced that it is taking a 10% stake in embattled chipmaker Intel, US Senator Rand Paul has criticised the decision, saying that the investment is “a step towards socialism.” The chipmaker announced last month that the US government made an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock.Rand said government ownership in Intel is ‘a bad idea’.“It’s always a mistake to say, ’Well we have this one bad policy, all right, we’ll tolerate a little socialism, but we don’t want anymore,” Paul told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday.“I worry that the free market movement, the movement that was a big part of the Republican Party, is being diminished over time,” Rand added.Last month, President Donald Trump said that the government’s stake in the chipmaker is a “great Deal for America, and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.”In August, the Trump administration announced a new policy that would take a 15% cut of certain chip sales by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to China. This move was part of a broader strategy to assert control over critical industries, the report by CNBC noted.The government also made a significant investment in a rare-earth miner, buying a $400 million equity stake in MP Materials, and secured a ""golden share"" in US Steel as part of the deal that allowed Nippon Steel to acquire the company.Senator Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, supported a proposal to tie government subsidies to public ownership. In an interview last month, Sanders argued, “Taxpayers should not be providing billions of dollars in corporate welfare to large, profitable corporations like Intel without getting anything in return.”","Rand said government ownership in Intel is ‘a bad idea’.

What users can do



Gmail Warning: That Urgent Security Notification from Google May Be a Trap

After Netflix now YouTube has started enforcing password crackdown. YouTube is now implementing the process of password crackdown on the Premium Family Plan. As per the new rules the, the Premium Family Plan members must live in the same household to share the YouTube Premium service. This also means that users will now not be able to share accounts with friends or relatives elsewhere that their access will be paused within 14 days if they fail location checks.This move by YouTube mirrors similar crackdowns by Netflix and Disney+, aiming to curb revenue losses from account sharing. Under the Premium Family Plan, up to five additional members can be added for a flat monthly fee (Rs 189 in India), but the terms have always required all members to reside at the same address.“As a family manager, you can share your YouTube Premium or YouTube Music Premium membership. You can share your membership with up to 5 other family members in your household. If you're a family member, you can join a family group to share a YouTube family plan,” said the company.As reported by CNET, some subscribers have reported receiving emails with the subject line “Your YouTube Premium family membership will be paused”, explaining that all members must live with the family manager. If YouTube’s verification — which includes electronic check-ins every 30 days — detects otherwise, non-compliant members will be downgraded to the free, ad-supported version.While the same-household policy was introduced in 2023, enforcement has been lax until now. Industry analysts say the timing reflects a broader streaming trend: converting shared accounts into individual subscriptions to boost revenue.The crackdown appears to be in a soft rollout phase. Many users who share accounts across different locations haven’t yet received warnings, but reports suggest enforcement will expand in the coming weeks.Those affected have three options:* Form a legitimate family plan with members in the same household* Switch to an individual Premium subscription* Revert to the free, ad-supported YouTube experience","YouTube is now implementing the process of password crackdown on the Premium Family Plan.

Gmail Warning: That Urgent Security Notification from Google May Be a Trap

Geoffery Hinton, popularly known as the Godfather of AI , has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) may soon surpass humans in not just intelligence but also in emotional manipulation. In an interview clip recently shared on Reddit, Hinton said that he believes machines will learn to influence human feelings and behavior more effectively than people themselves, using persuasion far beyond human ability.After decades of advancing machine learning , Hinton now argues for restraint, calling for caution and ethical foresight in the development of AI. He warned that the real danger is not killer robots but smooth talking AI.“These [AI] things are going to end up knowing a lot more than us. They already know a lot more than us, being more intelligent than us in the sense that if you had a debate with them about anything, you’d lose,” Geoffrey Hinton warned in the interview.“Being smarter emotionally than us, which they will be, they’ll be better at emotionally manipulating people,” he stated.“And it’s learned all those manipulative skills just from trying to predict the next word in all the documents on the web because people do a lot of manipulation, and AI has learned by example how to do it,” Hinton warned.According to Geoffrey Hinton, today’s large language models (LLMS) like Google’s Gemini, OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Meta’s Llama do more than just generating sentences – they also pickup patterns, he said. Hinton also pointed to studies showing AI can already be as effective as humans at influencing people, adding that “if they can both see the person’s Facebook page, then the AI is actually better than a person at manipulating them.”He believes that the current AI models are already participating in the emotional economy of modern communication and are quickly improving.","Geoffery Hinton, popularly known as the Godfather of AI, has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) may soon surpass humans in not just intelligence but also in emotional manipulation.

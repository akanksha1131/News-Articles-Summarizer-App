Trump asks Apple CEO Tim Cook on investment plans

Realme 15T First Look: Key Specs and Other Things You Should Know

President Donald Trump has said that his administration will impose tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies that are not shifting production to the US, reports Reuters. Speaking ahead of the high-profile dinner he hosted at White House recently, Trump said “Yeah, I have discussed it with the people here. Chips and semiconductors - we will be putting tariffs on companies that aren't coming in. We will be putting a tariff very shortly”. He, however, did not share any exact rate or time.“We will be putting a very substantial tariff, not that high, but fairly substantial tariff with the understanding that if they come into the country, if they are coming in, building, planning to come in, there will not be a tariff,” Trump told reporters.“If they are not coming in, there is a tariff,” Trump reiterated.He then pointed at Tim Cook saying “Like, I would say (Apple CEO) Tim Cook would be in pretty good shape”. The Apple CEO, at the dinner, committed a domestic investment commitment of $600 billion over the next four years.Last month, Trump said that the US will impose a tariff of about 100% on imports of semiconductors but it will not apply to companies that are manufacturing in the US or have committed to do so.“Tim, how much money will Apple be investing in the United States? I know it's a very large amount. You were elsewhere before, and now you're really coming home in a big way. How much money will you be investing?” Trump asked.To this, CEO Tim Cook responded: “$600 billion.” He then went on to credit Trump for creating conditions for Apple’s growth. Cook said “I want to thank you for setting the tone such that we could make a major investment in the United States... That says a lot about your focus and your leadership and your focus on innovation”.Trump’s question appeared to reference Apple’s growing presence in India. Earlier this year, he told Cook: “I don’t want you building in India.” The remark came after Apple confirmed plans to expand production outside China.According to reports, Apple is working to assemble about 25% of global iPhones in India in the coming years. The company is expected to invest around $2.5 billion to raise production capacity from over 40 million to about 60 million units annually.","President Donald Trump has said that his administration will impose tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies that are not shifting production to the US.

Meta responds to the lawsuit



Life as “the other Mark Zuckerberg”



It’s Mark Zuckerberg vs Mark Zuckerberg. In a bizarre case which sounds like an episode from a comedy show, an Indiana based bankruptcy lawyer named Mark S. Zuckerberg has filed a lawsuit against Meta and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg after years of his Facebook accounts being wrongly suspended for “impersonating” the billionaire tech founder.As reported by TechCrunch, the attorney, who has been practising law since a long before Facebook existed, said that Meta’s automated moderation systems have repeatedly flagged both his personal and business accounts as fake. His commercial Facebook page, which is used to advertise his legal services has been disabled by the company for five times in the past eight years.In one 2020 email to Meta, the lawyer vented his frustration with the touch of humour: “If you happen to run into the younger, richer Mark Zuckerberg, tell him I said hi and he causes me great aggravation each day.”Zuckerberg says that these repeated bans have cost him real money including $11,000 in paid advertising that was rendered useless when his law firm’s page was taken down. He likened it to “buying a billboard on the side of the highway” only to have it covered up before anyone could see it.He also added that despite submitting multiple forms of ID, credit cards and photos to prove his identity, the suspension kept on happening. His most recent ban was in May this year which was lifted only after he filed the lawsuit in Marion Superior Court, accusing Meta of negligence and breach of contract.Meta has acknowledged the error, telling local media that account was disabled due to an error and it has been since reinstated. The company says it is working to prevent similar mistakes in the future.In order to prove his identity, the lawyer also created a website called iammarkzuckerberg.com — chronicling the mix-ups, from prank call accusations to awkward encounters at events. While the name occasionally works in his favour (like getting a better restaurant table), he says the confusion has been more trouble than it’s worth.","Indiana based bankruptcy lawyer named Mark S.

A painting believed to have been stolen by the Nazis during World War II has been recovered after it was spotted in an online real estate listing . The painting, Giuseppe Ghislandi 's Portrait of a Lady, had been missing for 80 years. It was found hanging in a home in Argentina, which belonged to a deceased SS officer. After the artwork was identified from the photos of a real estate website listing, the family in possession of the painting turned it over to the authorities. The painting was one of more than a thousand artworks looted by the Nazis from the collection of a Jewish art dealer in 1940. It was last seen in the hands of SS officer Friedrich Kadgien, who fled Germany after the war and settled in Argentina. The artwork was discovered when Kadgien's daughter listed the family home for sale online. When authorities arrived at the house to investigate, they found the painting had been replaced with a tapestry. However, the family ultimately chose to turn the piece in.In a statement to The New York Times, a federal prosecutor named Carlos Martínez said:That, hopefully, signals it is finally on the path to returning home. According to the report, the family of Goudstikker—the art dealer who was forced to give up the painting—has filed a claim seeking its return.Regarding the Kadgien children, it seems their troubles aren’t over yet. As per the report, they were scheduled for a court hearing this week, where they could still face charges for concealing the artwork.The report also suggests the family may hold additional stolen pieces, as at least two other paintings were recovered from another residence linked to one of Kadgien’s daughters.","The painting, Giuseppe Ghislandi's Portrait of a Lady, had been missing for 80 years.

US President Donald Trump has recently threatened to imposetariffs on countries that implement digital taxes. This decision came just days after a private meeting with Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Meta Platforms . Citing sources familiar with the meeting, a report by Bloomberg stated that Zuckerberg raised concerns about these digital service taxes , which are levied on the revenue tech companies generate from users in a specific country. Following the discussion, Trump stated that he was putting all countries with such taxes “on notice” and that the US will impose “substantial” tariffs and export restrictions on US semiconductors unless “these discriminatory actions are removed.”According to Trump, digital taxes will harm US technology companies while givingHe warned that unless thesethe US would impose tariffs and export restrictions on semiconductors. In a recent post shared on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump wrote:In a statement to Bloomberg, Meta confirmed the meeting between Trump and Zuckerberg. A company spokesperson said:Trump’s recent comments have reignited tensions over digital services taxes imposed by several US trading partners, a dispute that predates his latest meeting with Zuckerberg.Washington has long argued that such taxes, which may be levied by countries including France, Italy, Austria, Spain, and the UK, disproportionately target American tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Since Trump’s return to office, Zuckerberg has worked to strengthen his relationship with the president, who once labelled him a “criminal.” Efforts have included changing Meta’s moderation and diversity policies, contributing $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, and making repeated visits to the White House and Mar-a-Lago.Zuckerberg has also expanded his Washington footprint by purchasing homes near the vice president’s residence and bringing Trump allies into Meta’s leadership. Their improved ties have led to frequent discussions on topics ranging from artificial intelligence to European tech regulations.","US President Donald Trump has recently threatened to imposetariffs on countries that implement digital taxes.

Following the launch of the Pixel 10 series smartphones, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has declared that the company has no plans to ease its pace, promising more releases later this year. His comments capped off what he described as a “summer of shipping” for the tech giant, as it further pushes integration of artificial intelligence (AI) across its entire product ecosystem.“Week after week - new models, new products and features, and now, new devices, all with the goal of making AI truly helpful to you, wherever you need it,” he stated in a post.""We’re not slowing down now - more to come for fall,"" he added.The sentiment was echoed by Rick Osterloh, Google's Senior Vice President of Devices & Services.""Wow, now that was a #MadebyGoogle show!"" he tweeted. ""I came to Google years ago with the belief that AI can transform computing for EVERYONE. We’ve delivered on that promise -- today you can find the power of Gemini & Google AI across our new Pixel devices.""Google has highlighted its Tensor G5 chip that powers all the Pixel 10 series of smartphones, positioning it as its 'biggest upgrade' since the chip's inception. The core message revolves around the G5 being the engine for on-device artificial intelligence features.In fact, Pichai retweet a post by Google’s official handle. It said, “Meet Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. Powered by our new Google Tensor G5 chip and our latest Gemini Nano model, they’re our most personalized, proactive and helpful Pixel phones ever. #MadeByGoogle.”Google is also stressing that the Tensor G5 delivers a massive upgrade in fundamental performance. The company is highlighting its move to a leading 3nm process node from TSMC, a first for the Tensor line.It claims that the Tensor G4 chip has an up to 60% more powerful Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for machine learning tasks and a 34% faster CPU on average for smoother and more responsive everyday use.Google is leveraging the Tensor G5 to reinforce the Pixel's long-standing reputation for camera excellence. The chip features a completely redesigned Image Signal Processor (ISP) that enhances both photography and videography.Pro Res Zoom – a new feature on the Pro models is said to extend the zoom range to a 100x by using generative AI to refine details. Other tools like the new ""Camera Coach"" to help frame shots and ""Auto Best Take"" to create ideal group photos are powered by the chip's AI prowess.C2PA Content Credentials: A first for smartphones, this on-device feature securely embeds metadata into images to document their origin and edit history, a direct response to the rise of AI-generated content.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai has declared that the company has no plans to ease its pace, promising more releases later this year.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is reportedly planning to produce its first artificial intelligence (AI) chip next year. According to a Financial Times report, the chip will be co-designed with US semiconductor giant Broadcom and is likely to chip in 2026. OpenAI, it says, plans to put the chip to use internally. The move follows the strategy of other tech giants such as Google, Amazon and Meta who have already designed their own chips to power AI-related workloads.The FT report cites Broadcom’s chief executive Hock Tan who earlier this week referred to a mystery new customer committing to $10bn in orders. The deal marks the fourth major client for Broadcom in this executive, he told analysts during the company’s earnings call.Tan said the agreement has boosted Broadcom’s growth outlook, bringing “immediate and fairly substantial demand,” with chip shipments for the customer set to begin next year.However, Broadcom did not disclose customer names. Reports last year suggested the two companies had already begun initial collaboration, though the timeline for large-scale production had been unclear.Nvidia still leads the AI hardware market, with big tech companies as its main customers. OpenAI has long been one of Nvidia’s biggest buyers. But OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has repeatedly highlighted the need for more computing power to support products like ChatGPT and train large AI models. Last month, he said OpenAI would double its computing capacity “over the next 5 months” to meet demand for its new GPT-5 model.HSBC analysts recently said Broadcom’s custom chip business could see faster growth than Nvidia’s by 2026.

Donald Trump says Elon Musk has no choice but to return to GOP

President Donald Trump hosted a high-powered group of tech executives at the White House on Thursday, September 4. As big as the chatter about the CEOs of the biggest technology companies of America attending the dinner, was also the chatter of Tesla CEO's absence. The media was abuzz about the notable absence of Elon Musk , once a close ally of Trump who was tasked with running the Department of Government Efficiency, from the guest list. Musk had a public breakup with Donald Trump earlier this year.However, it seems Elon Musk was invited to the White House dinner. Tesla CEO confirmed the same in a post on Twitter. Responding to Twitter user Natalie F Danelishen, who is said to be a popular internet personality, Musk said that he was invited but could not attend and so sent a representative.Quoting a Twitter post about the White House dinner, Natalie F Danelishen wrote, ""Bill Gates but not Elon Musk….wtf?"". To this Elon Musk replied, ""I was invited, but unfortunately could not attend. A representative of mine will be there.""Responding to the tech CEO's reply Natalie thanked White House with a heart emoji. ""Happy to hear you were invited ❤️ Thanks @WhiteHouse,"" she wrote.More than two dozen major tech leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Google founder Sergey Brin and Oracle CEO Safra Catz.Talking about Elon Musk, Trump recently said that his former ally, Elon Musk, has ""no choice"" but to return to the Republican Party, despite their highly public and bitter feud earlier this year. Speaking on the Scott Jennings Show in an interview recorded Tuesday, Trump framed Musk’s political future as a binary decision between the GOP and ""radical left lunatics.""The President's comments came after a public and acrimonious split between the two influential figures, which included social media insults and threats of government contract terminations. The rift appears to have started over Musk's opposition to a tax bill that he claimed would increase the deficit, though the legislation also ended tax credits for electric vehicles that benefited his company, Tesla.Despite the past friction, Trump largely offered compliments to the tech billionaire, describing him as a ""good man"" and downplaying their disagreements. ""He got off the reservation, incorrectly, and that's okay,"" Trump said of the Tesla CEO. ""He’s 80% super genius, and then 20% he’s got some problems. And when he works out the 20% he’ll be great, but he’s got some difficulty.""Musk, who has previously floated the idea of creating a third political party, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","President Donald Trump hosted a high-powered group of tech executives at the White House on Thursday, September 4.

Intel’s chief financial officer (CFO) has announced that 2026 will be a decisive year for its manufacturing technology, revealing whether the company is ready to advance its capabilities with a new process. Speaking at Citi's 2025 Global TMT Conference, Intel's CFO Dave Zinsner said the company won't know until 2026 if it's ready to approve a manufacturing method called 14A. This technology is key to Intel's plan to become a leader in the tech world again.“Sometime in ’26, we’ll have a good feel for how things are going,” Zinsner stated. His comment came weeks after the US government announced that it has taken 10% of the company’s ownership.Zinsner reiterated a previous stance that the company would only build 14A manufacturing capacity if it secured commitments from external customers. While he called this position “financial common sense,” the approach has concerned analysts and investors since it was first outlined by CEO Lip-Bu Tan in July.The hesitation to move forward without external demand suggested to some that Intel was wavering on its bid for technological dominance.When asked about the possibility of other investors taking a stake in Intel’s manufacturing operations, Zinsner said the company was open to it. However, he noted that the recent agreement with the Trump administration requires Intel to maintain a majority position in that business, making outside investment unlikely in the near term.“It’s not inconceivable that we do that,” he said, adding, “I think the likelihood is that it won’t happen anytime soon because it’s not quite investable yet.”Zinsner clarified that the government's stake is a passive holding, and it will align with the board's recommendations.

President Donald Trump hosted a dinner at White House where he invited tech CEOs. In a jovial moment, he congratulated Google CEO Sundar Pichai on the company's recent legal triumph. The exchange, which took place Thursday (September 4) evening, followed a landmark antitrust ruling that saw Google avoid a court-ordered breakup.“Well you had a very good day yesterday,"" Trump said to Pichai, ""Google had a very good day yesterday. Do you want to talk about that big day you had yesterday?""The decision by US District Judge Amit Mehta on Tuesday (September 2) caused Alphabet 's market cap to soar by $230 billion. The ruling was the culmination of a 2020 lawsuit brought by the US Department of Justice (DOJ), which had previously found Google held an illegal monopoly in internet search.Replying to the question, Sundar Pichai said, ""I'm glad it's over,"" causing an eruption of laughter from the other table guests. He added that the company appreciated the “constructive dialogue” with the Trump administration.“It’s a long process. Appreciate that your administration had a constructive dialogue, and we were able to get it to some resolution,” Pichai added.Pichai then pivoted to a discussion on artificial intelligence (AI), commending the administration's “Winning the AI Race: America's AI Action Plan,” launched in July.“The AI moment is one of the most transformative moments any of us have ever seen or will see in our lifetimes, so making sure the US is at the forefront — and I think your administration is investing a lot,” Pichai said.“Already the AI action plan under your leadership I think is a great start, and we look forward to working together. And thanks for your leadership,” he added.Trump also blamed the Biden administration for the lawsuit against Google.“Biden was the one who prosecuted that lawsuit, you know that right?” Trump said. It is to be noted that the DOJ had filed the case during Trump's first term.The exchange also occurred amid ongoing legal issues between the two parties. Google's online video platform, YouTube, is currently in discussions with Trump's lawyers over a lawsuit he filed more than four years ago, accusing the company of unlawful censorship. The lawsuit stems from the suspension of Trump's social media accounts following the January 6 2021 Capitol incident.","President Donald Trump hosted a dinner at White House where he invited tech CEOs.

Who is behind this cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover

Can Lyne Originals Coolpods 11 Solve Your Problems?

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has temporarily halted production and told factory staff to stay home following a cyberattack over the weekend. The attack forced the UK-based car maker, which Tata Motors owns, to take its critical IT systems offline. This has disrupted car sales and halted production at factories across the UK, including those in Halewood, Solihull, and Wolverhampton. The company is now working to restore its systems and has warned that the production suspension could be extended. Beyond JLR's own facilities, the cyberattack has also caused significant disruption, with car sales being heavily impacted, forcing the company's network of parts suppliers to restrict their operations.According to a report by the BBC, some repair garages in the UK have also warned that existing owners of Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles may face delays if their cars need new parts. The attack was particularly ill-timed, as it coincided with the release of new registration plates on September 1, a traditionally popular time for new vehicle deliveries.A hacker group linked to a major earlier cyberattack on retail chain Marks and Spencer claimed to have breached JLR’s systems, the report added. The group, which calls itself “Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters” and is believed to be a network of English-speaking teenagers, told the BBC they had allegedly gained access to the carmaker’s network but did not confirm whether any sensitive data was stolen or malware was installed.To back their claims, they shared two images—one showing what appeared to be internal troubleshooting instructions for a charging issue, and another displaying internal computer logs.According to a cybersecurity expert, the screenshots suggested the hackers had access to information not meant to be public.JLR confirmed it is investigating the incident but said there is currently no evidence that customer data has been compromised.In 2023, the company signed a five-year, £800 million contract with Tata Consultancy Services—its corporate affiliate—to provide cybersecurity and IT support as part of a push to “accelerate digital transformation across its business.”The reported breach comes at a difficult time for JLR, which recently posted a drop in profits due to higher costs tied to US tariffs.","Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has temporarily halted production and told factory staff to stay home following a cyberattack over the weekend.

What Warner Bros Discovery said about Midjourney infringing its intellectual property



“The heart of what we do is develop stories and characters to entertain our audiences, bringing to life the vision and passion of our creative partners. Midjourney is blatantly and purposefully infringing copyrighted works, and we filed this suit to protect our content, our partners, and our investments.”

Can Lyne Originals Coolpods 11 Solve Your Problems?

Warner Bros (WB) Discovery has filed a lawsuit against the AI image generator startup Midjourney. The Hollywood studio has alleged the AI startup ofand using its intellectual property. According to the complaint filed in California federal court, WB accused Midjourney of building itself on the mass theft of copyrighted movies and TV shows to train its AI systems. The lawsuit claims that Midjourney allows its millions of subscribers to create and download images and videos of characters such as Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Bugs Bunny that are WB’s intellectual property. The lawsuit claims that Midjourney's actions demonstrate it is aware of its wrongful conduct. WB alleged that the company earlier blocked subscribers from generating videos from infringing images, but thenlifted the protection, promoting the change as anIn a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, a Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson said:In its lawsuit, WB highlights Midjourney’s ability to generate images of well-known copyrighted characters. Central to the claims are heroes featured in DC Studios’ films and series, including Superman, Wonder Woman, and The Joker. The filing also mentions Looney Tunes figures, Tom and Jerry, Scooby-Doo, and Cartoon Network characters, such as those from Rick and Morty, which are described as cultural touchstones in recent years.Midjourney, which offers paid subscriptions between $10 and $120 per month and did not respond to a request for comment, allegedly produces WB-owned characters even from prompts like “classic comic book superhero battle,” which do not directly reference specific properties.As evidence, the studio submitted dozens of side-by-side comparisons of Midjourney outputs and stills from its movies and shows. For example, a prompt for “Batman, screencap from The Dark Knight” produced an image of Christian Bale’s Batman in the Kevlar-plated suit design unique to that film, appearing nearly identical to footage or promotional materials. Another example cited is a 3D-animated Bugs Bunny resembling his appearance in Space Jam: A New Legacy.The complaint argues that Midjourney’s ability to reproduce copyrighted characters is a “clear draw for subscribers,” diverting consumers from buying licensed Warner Bros. Discovery products such as posters, wall art, and prints.Like other AI companies, Midjourney’s training data remains opaque, creating challenges for rightsholders pursuing infringement claims. In 2022, the company’s founder, David Holz, stated in an interview that his team “grab everything they can, they dump it in a huge file, and they kind of set it on fire to train some huge thing.” Details of the process will be examined during discovery.WB is seeking either Midjourney’s profits tied to the alleged infringement or statutory damages of $150,000 per infringed work—potentially exposing the company to significant liability.The legal action joins a growing list of lawsuits against AI companies from authors, artists, and news organisations. WB is the latest major studio to take legal action, following similar suits filed by Disney and Universal against Midjourney in June. The studios argue that AI companies are ""free-riders"" who train their technology on copyrighted content without compensating creators.A central legal question is whether AI companies are protected by fair use, the doctrine that allows works to be used without a license under certain conditions. Earlier this year, a court found Amazon-backed Anthropic had a firm legal footing for training purposes. Judge William Alsup described the technology as “among the most transformative many of us will see in our lifetimes.”","Warner Bros.

US President Donald Trump hosted a high-profile event where he interacted with top tech CEOs . The gathering was attended by Apple CEO Tim Cook, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and OpenAI’s Sam Altman among others. In this rare public appearance, First Lady Melania Trump also delivered a pointed message about the need to prepare the next generation of Americans for the challenges ahead.As reported by BBC, at the dinner, the First Lady told the tech executives, senior officials and the policymakers that the US must urgently prepare its children for an artificial intelligence-driven future. “Our future is no longer science fiction,” she said. “During this primitive stage, it is our duty to treat AI as we would our own children — empowering, but with watchful guidance.”Since President Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January, Mrs Trump has remained largely out of the public eye, often spending time in New York and Florida. Her absence during much of the 2024 campaign even prompted headlines asking, “Where is Melania?”However, in her second tenure as First Lady, she has taken a more targeted approach to the role — focusing on children’s welfare, online safety, and now, AI literacy .In his comments, Pichai highlighted the significance of AI, calling it ""one of the most transformative moments any of us has ever seen."" He praised the Trump administration's investment in the field and the 'AI Action Plan,' calling it a ""great start."" Nadella also thanked Trump for bringing the group together and for policies that have helped the U.S. lead the technology sector, emphasizing the trust the world places in American technology.The dinner also included discussions about financial investments. When asked about Google's plans, Pichai stated the company would invest $250 billion in the U.S. over the next two years. Nadella said Microsoft invests $75-$80 billion annually in the country. Trump praised both executives for their companies' contributions.Other notable attendees included Google co-founder Sergey Brin, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Oracle CEO Safra Catz. During a media Q&A, Trump also claimed to have ""settled"" seven wars. But this time, he did not mention the wars. He also said that he would be speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin in near future. “We are having a very good dialogue,” Trump said.","Donald Trump hosted a high-profile event where he interacted with top tech CEOs.

OpenAI rival Anthropic has updated its terms of service prohibiting sales of its AI platform Claude services to companies in China, Russia, North Korea and other regions “due to legal, regulatory, and security risks.” In an official blog, the AI company backed by Amazon said that firms based in authoritarian countries like China may be forced by law to share data, work with intelligence agencies, or take other steps that could pose national security risks. “These requirements make it difficult for companies to resist these pressures regardless of where they operate or of the personal preferences of the individuals at those companies,” it added.Sharing the blog post, the company said “Anthropic's Terms of Service prohibit use of our services in certain regions due to legal, regulatory, and security risks. However, companies from these restricted regions—including adversarial nations like China—continue accessing our services in various ways, such as through subsidiaries incorporated in other countries.”In the blog post, Anthropic said that it is going a step further in an update to its terms of service. “This update prohibits companies or organizations whose ownership structures subject them to control from jurisdictions where our products are not permitted, like China, regardless of where they operate,” the company said.Anthropic recently reached settlement in a high-profile class action lawsuit filed by a group of US authors. For those unaware, a group of US authors accused the company of using their copyrighted works without their permission or compensation to train its AI models. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed to the public, but agreement makes a significant moment in the ongoing battle between AI developers and creative professionals.Originally filed in 2024, the lawsuit alleged that Anthropic scraped and ingested thousands of books which included non-fiction, fiction and academic text books to train its AI system Claude without any authorisation. The class-action lawsuit filed included some prominent authors and was also backed by the Authors Guild. The Authors Guild organisation has been quite vocal in demanding stronger protections for writers in the growing AI era.","Anthropic recently reached settlement in a high-profile class action lawsuit filed by a group of US authors.

A rare move outside a crisis



Debate over public benefit



Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale has criticised the decision of US government to take an equity stake in Intel. Lonsdale called the move ‘uncomfortable and very concerning’ and warned that it smacks of “cronyism.” Speaking to CNBC’s Squawk Box, Lonsdale — who is also founding partner of Austin-based venture capital firm 8VC said that it was quite unusual for the government to take an equity stake in a major technology company outside of a crisis.“It’s very weird, of course, for the government to be taking a stake in something,” Lonsdale said. “It’s also a little bit weird for the government to be giving $9 billion to a company, too. It’s cronyism in some form.”The investment made by the US government is being primarily finance via the Chips and Science Act, which a 2022 law which allocates $52 billion in subsidies and tax incentives to boost domestic semiconductor production. Intel said in a press release that the government’s equity stake will be funded by:- $5.7 billion in previously awarded but unpaid CHIPS Act grants- $3.2 billion from the Secure Enclave program, aimed at expanding U.S. semiconductor manufacturing capacity“It's very weird, of course, for the government to be taking a stake in something. It's also a little bit weird for the government to be giving $9 billion to a company, too,” Lonsdale said on CNBC's Squawk Box.The direct government ownership in private companies is rare in then US and it is happening during severe economic distress. The Intel deal however, comes during a period of relative stability, raising questions about whether it sets a new precedent for industrial policy. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett recently likened the move to a sovereign wealth fund strategy, suggesting more such investments could follow in other industries.Lonsdale said he could have supported the arrangement if it advanced national security of other public interests. “If that’s the case, there’s no reason for the government not to take things,” he noted — but stressed that without such justification, the deal risks blurring the lines between public policy and corporate favouritism.",The direct government ownership in private companies is rare in then US and it is happening during severe economic distress.

US President Donald Trump hosted a high-profile event where he interacted with top tech CEOs. The gathering was attended by Apple CEO Tim Cook, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and OpenAI’s Sam Altman among others. Trump reportedly quizzed the tech executives on their investments in the United States.“Tim, how much money will Apple be investing in the United States? I know it's a very large amount. You were elsewhere before, and now you're really coming home in a big way. How much money will you be investing?” Trump asked.To this, CEO Tim Cook responded: “$600 billion.” He then went on to credit Trump for creating conditions for Apple’s growth. Cook said “I want to thank you for setting the tone such that we could make a major investment in the United States... That says a lot about your focus and your leadership and your focus on innovation”.Trump’s question appeared to reference Apple’s growing presence in India. Earlier this year, he told Cook: “I don’t want you building in India.” The remark came after Apple confirmed plans to expand production outside China.According to reports, Apple is working to assemble about 25% of global iPhones in India in the coming years. The company is expected to invest around $2.5 billion to raise production capacity from over 40 million to about 60 million units annually.Trump directed similar questions to other CEOs during the dinner. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg replied, “$600 billion,” when asked about the social media’s investment.Sundar Pichai said Google’s investments were “well north of $100 billion” and would reach $250 billion in the next two years.“That’s great, that’s great. We’re proud of you. Thank you. A lot of jobs, a lot of jobs. Yeah, good,” Trump responded.Microsoft’s Nadella also shared figures, stating: “This year, in the United States, we are close to around $75 to $80 billion.” Trump replied: “Good, very good.

The government took this decision after all the companies failed to register with the government within a seven-day deadline.The move of banning the social media platforms comes after the Supreme Court directive in a contempt of court case, which instructed the government to ensure all domestic and foreign-origin online platforms register with authorities before operating in the country and to monitor unwanted content.“The Honourable Supreme Court, in a contempt of court case (Case No. 080-8-0012), has issued a directive order in the name of the Government of Nepal to mandatorily list domestic or foreign-origin online and social media platforms with the relevant authorities before operation and to evaluate and monitor unwanted content. In accordance with the decision of the Government of Nepal (Council of Ministers) dated 2082.05.09, for the implementation of the said order, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has published a public notice on 2082.05.12, giving a deadline of seven (7) days to list social media platforms as per the 'Directive on Regulating the Use of Social Media, 2080'.

What startup CEO Shen said about AI researchers leaving Meta



“Meta is constantly doing reorganizations. Your manager and your goals can change every few months. For some researchers, it can be really frustrating and feel like a waste of time. So yes, I think that's a driver for people to leave Meta and join other companies, especially startups.

There's other reasons people might leave. I think the biggest one is what Mark (Zuckerberg) has said: ‘In an age that's evolving so fast, the biggest risk is not taking any risks. So why not do that and potentially change the world as part of a trillion-dollar company?’

We have already hired Eddy Wu, our Chief AI Officer who was my manager's manager at Meta. He's making a similar amount to what we're offering the new people. He was on their generative AI team, which is now Meta Superintelligence Labs. And we are already talking to a few other people from MSL and some others from Google DeepMind.”

What Shen said about hiring Meta AI researchers for his startup



“It's because of the talent war that was started by Mark Zuckerberg. I used to work at Meta, and I speak with my former colleagues often about this. When I heard about their compensation packages, I was shocked — it's really in the tens of millions range. But it shows that in this age, AI researchers who make the best models and stand at the frontier of technology are really worth this amount of money. We're building an AI model that can see and remember just like humans. The things that we are working on are very niche. So we are looking for people who are really, really good at the whole field of understanding video data.”

Shawn Shen , co-founder and CEO of the AI startup Memories.ai, has stated that some researchers are leaving Facebook-parent Meta due to frequent company reorganisations and a desire to take on bigger risks. Shen, who left Meta himself last year, notes that constant changes in managers and goals can be frustrating for researchers, leading them to seek opportunities at other companies and startups. Shen's startup, which builds AI to understand visual data, recently announced a plan to offer up to $2 million compensation packages to researchers from top tech companies. Memories.ai has already hired Chi-Hao Wu, a former Meta research scientist, as its chief AI officer. Shen also referenced a statement from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg who earlier said that theIn an interview with Business Insider, Shen said:Shen noted that he’s offering AI researchers who are leaving Meta pay packages of $2 million to work with his startup. He said:He even explained that his company is prioritising hires who are willing to take more equity than cash, allowing it to preserve its financial runway. These recruits will be treated as founding members rather than employees, with compensation split between cash and equity depending on the individual, Shen added.Over the next six months, the AI startup is planning to add three to five people, followed by another five to ten within a year, alongside efforts to raise additional funding. Shen believes that investing heavily in talent will strengthen, not hinder, future fundraising.","Shawn Shen, co-founder and CEO of the AI startup Memories.ai, has stated that some researchers are leaving Facebook-parent Meta due to frequent company reorganisations.

A former Meta top employee has revealed Mark Zuckerberg 's ‘unusual’ executive mandate. An upcoming memoir by former head of global affairs at Meta, Nick Clegg, reveals an unusual and intense side of the Facebook co-founder, detailing how he encouraged his senior leaders to engage in mixed martial arts (MMA) training with him.“Mark’s commitment to MMA is so strong that he insisted one morning, during a management offsite, that some of his most senior executives join him for a training session,” Clegg writes in his new book.Clegg recounts his experience on the mat, where he found himself in a submission hold with his deputy, Joel Kaplan, in a move known as the ""Domination Mount,” which he described as ""too close for comfort.""The Meta CEO's martial arts hobby became widely known after he began competing in Jiu-Jitsu tournaments. In the past, he has shared several photos of himself with various MMA fighters and shared the mat with some of them.In 2023, Zuckerberg built an MMA octagon in the backyard of his home, which his wife, Priscilla Chan, did not like. Zuckerberg took to Instagram to share a humorous text exchange with his wife after he built the octagon in the backyard which did not receive a warm welcome from Chan.Her reaction, shared via WhatsApp, was swift and to the point. “I have been working on that grass for two years,” she scolded her billionaire husband.The addition fueled speculation about his much-discussed “cage match” with Elon Musk . The two tech billionaires shared that they have been training for the potential bout, capturing global attention. At one time, Musk claimed that they both will fight in Colosseum in Italy.","Former head of global affairs at Meta, Nick Clegg, reveals an unusual and intense side of the Facebook co-founder.

Meghan Markle’s 'Desperate' Netflix Grab Gets Royal Cold Shoulder?

“very underwhelming,”

“It’s very underwhelming. It's really down to Meghan to get the stars. Where is Oprah, Michelle Obama or a Kardashian, even? It is just a bunch of random people she knows.”

Meghan Markle's partnership with Netflix to sell products from her brand, As Ever, is already ""petering out"" just seven months after it was announced, a report claims. According to a recent report, none of her products, which include jam and pancake mix, are currently listed on the Netflix website. Despite a formal partnership announced in February, there are growing doubts that As Ever products will be sold in the company's new brick-and-mortar stores, which are set to open in the US later this year. The report cited Marina Hyde, who recently suggested on her podcast, ""The Rest is Entertainment,"" that Netflix is quietly dropping the partnership.In a statement to the Daily Mail, a Netflix spokesperson stated that As Ever products have never been sold on the Netflix website. However, the company declined to comment on Hyde’s other allegation.As per the report, some of Meghan’s As Ever products are priced higher than what Netflix’s hourly staff would earn. For example, customers must purchase at least three bottles of As Ever wine for $90, or six bottles for $159, and twelve bottles for $300 — plus $20 in shipping and taxes. Other items include a crepe mix at $14 (£10.34), herbal teas at $12 (£8.86), and flower sprinkles priced at $15 (£11.08) per pack.Meanwhile, Season 2 of With Love, Meghan has struggled since its release less than two weeks ago, currently ranked at 136 on the Netflix charts, below two cancelled series nearly a decade old. The show has received poor reviews, with critics noting Meghan’s inability to secure prominent names such as Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, or a Kardashian. Instead, the cast has been described asincluding her make-up artist, pilates instructor, and a lineup of chefs.A source claimed that Netflix supported the Duchess by filling the show with personalities already tied to the streamer, most of whom are TV chefs. The report also noted that many of the guests have links to WME, the talent agency representing Meghan.A British Hollywood insider explained:Fans have also expressed disappointment over the setting — a rented house near her Montecito home used for privacy. Model Chrissy Teigen, Queer Eye’s Tan France, and motivational speaker Jay Shetty appear in the new season, alongside Meghan’s long-time acquaintances Daniel Martin and Heather Dorak.Other guests include chefs Samin Nosrat, Christina Tosi, Jose Andres, David Chang, and Clare Smyth, who catered the Sussexes’ 2018 wedding.","Meghan Markle's partnership with Netflix to sell products from her brand, As Ever, is already ""petering out"" just seven months after it was announced.

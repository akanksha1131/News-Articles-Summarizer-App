When Elon Musk called companies to leave Delaware

Andreessen Horowitz on why it is openly telling technology companies to leave Delaware

Silicon Valley venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz is relocating its corporate incorporation from Delaware to Nevada, citing concerns over bias in Delaware’s Court of Chancery against company founders and boards. According to a report by Bloomberg, the company also urges its portfolio companies to follow suit, signaling a potential shift in the tech industry’s long-standing preference for Delaware. In a blog post published Wednesday, July 10, Andreessen Horowitz’s legal and policy leaders -- Jai Ramaswamy, Andy Hill, and Kevin McKinley -- slammed Delaware’s Chancery Court for injecting “unprecedented subjectivity” into recent rulings, eroding the state’s reputation as a business-friendly incorporation hub. “Some startups hesitate to leave Delaware based in part on concerns for how investors will react,” the trio wrote. “As the largest VC firm in the country, we hope our decision signals to our portfolio companies, as well as to prospective portfolio companies, that such concerns may be overblown.”The move comes amid growing frustration in Silicon Valley with Delaware’s judicial system, particularly after a Chancery Court judge blocked Elon Musk’s $56 billion compensation package at Tesla Inc. Musk, a vocal critic of Delaware, reincorporated Tesla in Texas in June, which recently established a business court system, and has shifted other ventures, such as SpaceX, to Nevada. Other major companies, including Dropbox Inc., TripAdvisor, and Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, have also left Delaware, while Meta Platforms Inc. considered a similar move in January, according to Bloomberg.Andreessen Horowitz, founded in 2009 and incorporated in Delaware until now, had previously advised its startups to incorporate there. The firm emphasized the transparency of its decision, stating, “We could have made this move quietly, but we think it’s important for our stakeholders, and for the broader tech and VC communities, to understand why we’ve reached this decision.Delaware has long dominated as the go-to state for corporate incorporation, hosting over 2 million businesses, including more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies. However, Nevada and Texas are gaining traction by offering corporate statutes with stronger protections against investor lawsuits and greater control for company leaders like Musk. Critics warn that this trend could trigger a “race to the bottom” in corporate governance standards.","Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is relocating its corporate incorporation from Delaware to Nevada.

What Pakistan government said on Microsoft closing operations in the country: Full Statement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-pakistan-government-said-on-microsoft-closing-operations-in-the-country-full-statement/articleshow/122350258.cms,"'Microsoft’s Operational Restructuring: Ensure Continued Commitment to Pakistan'

Microsoft recently completely shut down its operations in Pakistan. Microsoft had set up its operations in Pakistan in June 2000. Shutting down of Microsoft Pakistan after 25 years 'marked end of an era' as the company's first country head Jawwad Rehman said in a post on LinkedIn. “This is more than a corporate exit. It’s a sobering signal of the environment our country has created … one where even global giants like Microsoft find it unsustainable to stay. It also reflects on what was done (or not done) with the strong foundation we left behind by the subsequent team and regional management of Microsoft,” Rehman wrote in the post.The Redmond-based too has confirmed closing down its office in Pakistan. “Our customer agreements and service will not be affected by this change,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. “We follow this model successfully in a number of other countries around the world. Our customers remain our top priority and can expect the same high level of service going forward,” the spokesperson added.The Pakistan government issued a statement on Microsoft closing operations in the country. The release titled, 'Microsoft’s Operational Restructuring: Ensure Continued Commitment to Pakistan', termed Microsoft's decision part of a wider global restructuring. Here's is the full statement.The global pivot from on-premise software (transactional deals) to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) (recurring revenue) continues to reshape how technology firms structure their international operations. Microsoft is no exception. Over the past few years the company has shifted licensing and commercial-contract management for Pakistan to its European hub in Ireland, while day-to-day service delivery here has been handled entirely by its certified local partners.Against that backdrop, we understand Microsoft is now reviewing the future of its liaison office in Pakistan as part of a wider workforce-optimisation programme. This would reflect a long-signalled strategy, consolidating direct headcount and moving toward a partner-led, cloud-based delivery model, rather than a retreat from the Pakistani market.Pakistan’s Ministry of IT & Telecom recognises the strategic value of having leading global technology providers active in the country. We will continue to engage Microsoft’s regional and global leadership to ensure that any structural changes strengthen, rather than diminish, Microsoft’s long term commitment to Pakistani customers, developers and channel partners.","Microsoft had set up its operations in Pakistan in June 2000.

What White House Chief of Staff said about Trump Musk friendship



“The president was very, very kind to him, and Elon had so much to offer us. He knew things we didn’t know. He knew people and technologies that we didn’t know.""

“It was a great thing when it was a great thing, and had a very, I think, a very troublesome ending,”

“I don’t know. I don’t understand it. I don’t know. I know that what has been said doesn’t ring accurate to me but I don’t know. I enjoy working with Elon. I think he is a fascinating person and sees the world differently, and I think that’s probably what the president saw, too. Just a little bit different than the average Joe. But it certainly came to… not a good ending.”

“might be the world’s smartest man”

Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for 'offensive' political slurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/poland-flags-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-to-the-eu-for-offensive-political-slurs/articleshow/122348777.cms,"Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for “offensive” political slurs

Why Poland says Elon Musk's Grok chatbot crossed a red line



Offensive answers: From antisemitic tropes to political insults



European digital rules put xAI under the spotlight



Previous incidents: Turkey, hate speech, and Grok’s growing rap sheet



xAI and Musk offer silence, at least for now



Poland just pulled the alarm on Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk ’s xAI. Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates. Poland’s complaint tees up an early test of those combined powers.Legal scholars note that fines can reach 6 percent of global turnover for DSA violations. For Musk’s empire, that runs into billions.Poland is not alone. A Turkish court ordered X to block Grok content that mocked President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Islamic beliefs.In June, users spotted the bot rambling about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. xAI blamed an “unauthorised change” to its response code.Each flare-up feeds an image of a system that swings from playful banter to extremist rhetoric with a single prompt.As of Wednesday afternoon, xAI had not replied to Reuters’ emailed questions, and Musk’s normally hyperactive X feed stayed quiet on the topic.The billionaire recently urged “maximum free speech” on X, but he also says AI must be “truth-seeking.” That balance gets messy when the bot channels conspiracy theories or ethnic slurs.","Poland says the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders.

Currently making up just 1% of Nvidia’s total revenue, the revenue brought in $567 million last quarter – a steep 72% rise from the previous year.“We’re working towards a day where there will be billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories that can be powered by Nvidia technology,” Huang said.Huang also emphasized a shift in how the company sees itself. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” he said, adding that Nvidia is now focused on being an “AI infrastructure” and “computing platform” provider.During the annual shareholder meeting, Huang said that Nvidia’s chips will be key not just for AI training, but also for software and hardware use in autonomous vehicles and robots. He named self-driving cars as the first major commercial use of Nvidia’s robotics technology. Nvidia’s Drive platform, a suite of chips and software for autonomous cars, is currently being used by Mercedes-Benz.The chipmaker recently introduced Cosmos, a line of AI models designed for humanoid robots.In a related news, Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company with a market cap of around $3.75 trillion. The company has rebounded strongly since a market dip earlier this year, which was caused by concerns about competition from China’s DeepSeek AI.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence, the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122088756,imgsize-19028,width-400,resizemode-4/Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Huang.jpg"

The US Embassy in India has issued a clear warning for visa applicants. “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas,” the embassy said in a post on microblogging site X (previously known as Twitter). The post reminded visa applicants to disclose all social media usernames or handles they’ve used over the past five years while filling out the DS-160 visa application form. “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form” the post read. “Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit.”The requirement is part of broader vetting procedures introduced by the US State Department in recent years. As part of the updated rules, applicants must list IDs used on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and others—even if the accounts are no longer active from the last five years.The move comes days after the US government issued a new guideline for those applying for student and exchange visitor visas. Applicable to all applicants of F, M, and J non-immigrant visas, the new rule requires these applicants to set their social media accounts to public. “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under U.S. law,"" the US embassy in India wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post.F, M and J visas are the common types of non-immigrant visas issued by the agency to foreign nationals who wish to study or participate in exchange visitor programs in the U.S. F visa is typically used by academic students, the M visa by vocational students, and the J visa by exchange visitors, including researchers, scholars, and interns.In a related news, USCIS has announced that it will switch to a new phone number for sending text (SMS) messages. “Effective July 1, 2025, USCIS will no longer send text (SMS) messages from the phone number 468-311 (GOV-311).

Read OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s complete post here

I’m not big on identities, but I am extremely proud to be American. This is true every day, but especially today—I firmly believe this is the greatest country ever on Earth. The American miracle stands alone in world history.

I believe in techno-capitalism. We should encourage people to make tons of money and then also find ways to widely distribute wealth and share the compounding magic of capitalism. One doesn’t work without the other; you cannot raise the floor and not also raise the ceiling for very long.

The world should get richer every year through science and technology, but everyone has to be in the “up elevator”. I think the government usually does a worse job than markets, and so we need to encourage our culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. I also believe that education is critically important to keeping the American edge.

I believed this when I was 20, when I was 30, and now I am 40 and still believe it. The Democratic party seemed reasonably aligned with it when I was 20, losing the plot when I was 30, and completely to have moved somewhere else at this point. So now I am politically homeless. But that’s fine; I care much, much more about being American than any political party.

I’d rather hear from candidates about how they are going to make everyone have the stuff billionaires have instead of how they are going to eliminate billionaires.

The American experiment has always been messy. I am hopeful for another great 250 years. Happy 4th!","Sam Altman is the Chief Executive Officer of OpenAI.

Other Nvidia executives cash in

Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year, reports Financial Times. As per the report, over $500 million of those sales took place in June alone, as the chipmaker's stock price climbed to a record high, making Nvidia the world’s most valuable company. The report highlights that Nvidia insiders are capitalizing on the market’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, which has driven massive investor interest and sent the stock price soaring.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began selling his shares last week for the first time since September 2024. The company confirmed that his sales were made under a pre-arranged trading plan set in March, which defines the prices and dates for share sales. Such plans are commonly used by executives to avoid allegations of insider trading.Ben Silverman, vice-president of research at VerityData said “When the stock [dropped] in the first quarter, he did not sell, [which was] really smart.”“[Huang] waited for the stock to return to levels that he felt more comfortable selling at,” he added.According to VerityData, his sales began after a required 90-day cooling-off period ended. Under the trading plan, Huang can sell up to 6 million shares before the end of 2025. At current stock prices, that would amount to more than $900 million. Forbes estimates his net worth at $138 billion.According to the Financial Times report, several other top Nvidia figures have also sold large portions of stock. Mark Stevens, a longtime board member and early Nvidia investor, disclosed plans to sell up to 4 million shares on June 2, currently worth around $550 million. He has already sold $288 million worth.Jay Puri, Nvidia’s executive vice-president of worldwide field operations, sold $25 million in stock last week, says FT. Board members Tench Coxe and Brooke Seawell also made sales — Coxe offloaded around $143 million on June 9, and Seawell sold about $48 million in June.These executives, all long-time members of Nvidia’s leadership team, have been with the company since its early days. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 inside a Denny’s restaurant in San Jose. Coxe and Seawell, both with venture capital backgrounds, joined the board in the late 1990s.AI boom fuels Nvidia’s stock surgeDespite recent setbacks — including U.S. export controls and advances by Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek — Nvidia’s share price has bounced back. Since hitting a low in April, the company has regained about $1.5 trillion in market value.The company’s market value is not estimated at around $3.8 trillion. The rapid growth reflects strong global demand for the company’s chips, used to power AI systems across industries and governments.","Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year.

“I was in fact allowed to work in the US.”

Musk laughed off the allegations during campaign stops



Visa history: From J-1 to H-1B, according to Musk



The story whipped around social media in late October, after The Washington Post reported that a young Elon Musk stayed in the United States and built his first start-up without the papers he needed. President Joe Biden seized on it at a campaign stop, calling Musk “an illegal worker.” Within hours, Musk fired back on X (the platform he owns), writing that he was permitted to work and accusing “the Biden puppet” of lying.Reporters dug up 1990s emails, venture-capital term sheets, and board-room recollections that showed Zip2’s investors once feared their founder could be deported if the visa issue surfaced during an IPO filing. Immigration lawyers told the Post that a foreign student who drops out of school to run a company is, plain and simple, out of status.On 27 October 2024, Musk posted:A follow-up message claimed he held “a J-1 visa that transitioned to an H-1B.” He offered no documents, but the tweets set the tone: outright denial, laced with a jab at Biden.Hours later, while stumping for Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, Musk brushed away a question about the report with two laughing-crying emojis and a line: “So now he cares about illegals.” The moment drew cheers from the crowd and rolled straight into a riff about how, in Musk’s words, “it’s easier for a murderer to get into America than a Nobel laureate.”Public records confirm Musk entered the US on a student visa for a Stanford PhD he never started. He has said in podcasts that the period was a “grey area,” yet insists he obtained proper work authorisation by 1997. Former Zip2 board members recall scrambling to hire immigration counsel and giving the Musks 45 days to “get legal or lose funding.”","The Washington Post reported that a young Elon Musk stayed in the United States and built his first start-up without the papers he needed.

Tesla’s market value dropped by over $80 billion on July 7 after CEO Elon Musk officially announced a new political party called the “America Party”. The stock fell nearly 7%, raising new concerns among investors about Musk’s continued focus on Tesla. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives urged the company’s board of directors to “act and create ground rules for Musk”. In a client note, he wrote “The Tesla Board MUST act and create ground rules for Musk”, adding “The soap opera must end.”According to Ives, “Tesla is heading into one of the most important stages of its growth cycle… and cannot have Musk spending more and more time creating a political party which will require countless time, energy, and political capital.”He further warned: “Going after a handful of seats in the Senate and House heading into the 2026 mid-terms would essentially make Musk a foe of Trump and the Republican party ... which is exactly the opposite of what Tesla shareholders want to see with a very important autonomous regulatory framework now on the horizon during the Trump Administration.”In the note, Ives proposed a three-point action plan for Tesla board – Link Musk’s pay to a clear time commitment at Tesla, form a board committee to monitor his political involvement, and if needed, offer more Tesla shares based on his actual involvement in the company.He wrote: “The Board cannot control Musk’s donations … but they can have oversight if his political ambitions/endeavors interfere with his role as CEO of Tesla,” He wrote. “The Board now has to take the bull by the horns.”“Tesla needs Musk as CEO for another five years at least given how important of a role Musk will play in the autonomous and robotics future of Tesla,” Ives added.James Fishback, CEO of investment firm Azoria and a major Tesla shareholder, pulled plans to launch a Tesla-focused ETF following Musk’s announcement. In a letter to Tesla’s board, he said Musk’s political involvement “creates a conflict with his full-time responsibilities as CEO of Tesla.”“Elon is free to burn his own money on the ridiculous stunt that is the America Party ,” Fishback posted on X. “He is not free to drag shareholders down with him.

Who is backing the AI in classrooms

Microsoft is investing $12.5 million, primarily in funding teacher training and content development.

OpenAI will provide $10 million, including $2 million worth of in-kind computing power, possibly enabling schools to run AI tools without costly infrastructure.

Anthropic plans a whopping $500 million investment in the project’s first year, with additional support expected as the initiative evolves.







Why are schools turning to AI?

Teacher Workload Relief:

Future-Proofing Students:

Equity and Innovation:

Striking the balance between innovation and ethics

What this means for the future of education

A revolution in learning or a slippery slope?

In a major push to reshape the future of education, tech giants Microsoft , OpenAI , and Anthropic have joined forces with two major U.S. teachers’ unions to launch a $23 million initiative aimed at training 400,000 K–12 teachers to effectively use artificial intelligence (AI) in classrooms over the next five years. This initiative, called the National Academy of AI Instruction, comes at a time when educators are grappling with how to integrate powerful new technologies into already overwhelmed learning environments.With AI already disrupting industries from healthcare to finance, and tools like ChatGPT gaining rapid popularity among students, the pressure is mounting for schools to catch up. This new academy aims to equip teachers not only with the technical skills to use AI tools but also the ethical frameworks to apply them responsibly in educational settings.The National Academy of AI Instruction will combine online courses, in-person workshops, and interactive learning modules tailored for educators across grade levels. A physical campus in New York City will serve as the training hub, but much of the curriculum will also be available virtually to ensure national access.Designed collaboratively by AI researchers, policy experts, and experienced educators, the program will explore both technical skills—such as using generative AI tools for lesson planning, grading, and creating personalized learning materials—and broader ethical concerns, including safeguarding student data and preventing misuse of AI in academic settings.The ultimate goal of this initiative is to empower teachers with tools and knowledge that directly enhance student learning. With AI, educators can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time for deeper engagement with students. AI can also support differentiated instruction, enabling teachers to tailor lessons to individual learning styles, abilities, and needs. Students could benefit from more interactive and personalized classroom experiences, quicker feedback, and improved access to resources through AI-driven platforms.Over time, this could lead to significant changes in how classrooms operate—shifting from one-size-fits-all instruction to dynamic, adaptive learning environments. If implemented wisely, AI could help close learning gaps, especially in under-resourced schools, and foster more meaningful teacher-student interactions. However, its long-term impact will depend on how thoughtfully educators and policymakers balance innovation with responsibility.Beyond training, these companies see this as an opportunity to receive firsthand feedback from educators and potentially refine or co-develop AI products more tailored to classroom environments.The integration of AI in schools isn’t just a trend. It’s becoming a necessity. Here’s why:Modern Tools for Modern Learning: Students are already using AI tools like ChatGPT, whether permitted or not. Educators need to understand these tools to set boundaries, guide proper use, and avoid misuse.AI can automate repetitive administrative tasks such as grading, test creation, and report writing, giving teachers more time to focus on personal instruction and student engagement.With AI literacy becoming as essential as digital literacy, schools must equip students with the knowledge and skills to thrive in what many are calling the intelligence age.This initiative offers a chance to bridge the AI knowledge gap between tech-savvy and under-resourced schools, ensuring a more equitable and innovative learning landscape.While the promise of AI is exciting, educators remain cautious. The same tools that make lessons more dynamic can also blur the lines between learning and automation. There are concerns about over-reliance on AI, potential bias in educational algorithms, and the dilution of human interaction in teaching.AFT President Randi Weingarten echoed this concern:“AI holds tremendous promise but huge challenges, and it’s our job as educators to make sure AI serves our students and society, not the other way around.”To address this, the training will emphasize ethical use, transparency, and data safety. Teachers will be trained not just to use AI but to critically evaluate its impact, ensuring that classroom decision-making remains human-led and values-driven.This initiative isn’t just about integrating new tech. It’s about redefining the teacher’s role in an AI-augmented world. As AI becomes more deeply embedded in lesson planning, tutoring, grading, and even student diagnostics, educators will become navigators of both human and machine intelligence.Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s Chief Global Affairs Officer, put it simply:“You can’t prepare students for an AI-powered future unless you empower the teachers first.”The big question remains. Will AI empower teachers and transform classrooms, or will it increase dependency and widen existing gaps?If implemented thoughtfully, this program could usher in a new era of personalized, accessible, and efficient learning, where AI supports rather than replaces human educators. It could revolutionize how students absorb knowledge, how teachers manage their time, and how schools prepare future generations.But without proper oversight, there’s a risk that both teachers and students may become overly reliant on AI tools, potentially weakening critical thinking, creativity, and the uniquely human aspects of education.The success of this initiative will depend not just on the tools provided, but on the wisdom with which they are used. The classroom of the future is arriving fast, and how we train the teachers today will define what it looks like tomorrow.","Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic lead first-large-scale AI training program for teachers.

Tesla loses $68 billion in a single day

OnePlus Buds 4 Review: Flagship Sound & Gaming Performance

Tesla bull Dan Ives recently requested the company’s board to consider a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk . Amidst the declining Tesla’s stock price, the Wedbush Securities analyst shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) where he said that Tesla board of directors needs to take three steps: “new pay package” for CEO, “guardrails for amount of time Musk spends at Tesla” and “oversight on political endeavors”. The post caught Musk’s attention who responded sharply to Ives. Replying to the post, Musk wrote: “Shut up, Dan”.In the post, Ives wrote:In an email to CNBC, Ives said, “Elon has his opinion and I get it, but we stand by what the right course of action is for the Board.”After Elon Musk announced to form ' America Party ', Tesla shares declined by nearly 7% on Monday (July 7), losing more than $68 billion in market cap in a single day. The tech billionaire’s role in politics has made some investors uneasy. Earlier this year, he played a key part in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and worked closely with President Donald Trump — a move some feared could damage Tesla’s image. Elon Musk stepped away from the task force in May, which gave Tesla’s stock a boost. With him getting involved in politics again, investors are starting to worry once more.One of the three requests – new pay package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been a long standing point of contention between Musk and the EV company.It all started with a 2018 stock award. His compensation package then included 304 million stock options. It was a performance-based deal, meaning Musk would receive stock options based on Tesla's stock price and performance meeting specific targets.The CEO became eligible to exercise all the options in 2023 after meeting a series of aggressive valuation and financial performance goals set by the company.However, in January 2024, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick cancelled the deal, saying the amount was too large and that Tesla's board members were too influenced by Musk. She said they acted “like supine servants of an overweening master.”In early 2024 during the court ruling, these options were worth about $56 billion, later peaking at $146 billion in December and currently standing at around $98 billion based on Tesla’s share price.","Tesla bull Dan Ives recently requested the company’s board to consider a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk.

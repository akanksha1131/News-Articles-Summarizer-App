"Airbnb removes over 65,000 listings from Spain as country responds to housing protests",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airbnb-removes-over-65000-listings-from-spain-as-country-responds-to-housing-protests/articleshow/121276769.cms,"Representative Image

What Spain’s Consumer Rights Ministry said about Airbnb removing these listings



“Enough already with protecting those who make a business out of the right to housing.”

Spain has ordered Airbnb to block more than 65,000 holiday listings on its platform due to violations of local regulations, the Consumer Rights Ministry has announced. This action comes as Spain grapples with a growing housing affordability crisis that has prompted increased government scrutiny and intervention in the short-term rental market. The housing affordability crisis in Spain has also spurred widespread protests in recent months, with tens of thousands of citizens taking to the streets across the country. Many protesters have reportedly cited the increasing burden of rising housing and rental costs as the reason behind these demonstrations, which is a part of the proliferation of short-term holiday rentals on platforms like Airbnb in popular tourist destinations, including Madrid and Barcelona, a report claims.In a statement to the reporters (reviewed by the news agency AP), Spain’s Consumer Minister Pablo Bustinduy said:The ministry stated that a substantial number of the 65,935 Airbnb listings targeted for withdrawal failed to comply with essential rules, primarily by not including their mandatory license number or by not indicating whether the property owner was an individual or a registered company.Furthermore, authorities discovered that some listings provided license numbers that did not correspond with official records, raising further concerns about regulatory compliance and transparency within the platform's offerings in Spain.Last year, Barcelona announced that it would phase out its 10,000 licensed short‑term rental apartments by 2028 to protect housing for full‑time residents. The Spanish government, having notified Airbnb of thousands of noncompliant listings months ago, secured a Madrid high court ruling to immediately remove 5,800 listings, with two further rounds of takedowns planned to reach nearly 66,000 across Madrid, Andalusia, and Catalonia. The ruling came after the company appealed to the court before removing these listings.Airbnb also announced plans to appeal this ruling, with a spokesperson arguing that the ministry lacks the authority to regulate short‑term rentals and relied on “an indiscriminate methodology” that swept in listings exempt from licensing.","Spain has ordered Airbnb to block more than 65,000 holiday listings on its platform due to violations of local regulations.

What Elon Musk's Grok coming to Azure means for OpenAI

What Elon Musk's Grok coming to Azure means for Microsoft

In a surprising announcement at its annual Build developer conference, Microsoft revealed that it is expanding its Azure AI Foundry model offerings to include Grok 3 and Grok 3 mini from xAI, the AI startup founded by billionaire Elon Musk . This announcement positions Microsoft as one of the first major cloud providers to offer managed access to Grok, the AI model known for its controversial and often unfiltered approach.""These models will have all the service level agreements (SLAs) Azure customers expect from any Microsoft product,"" the company stated. The Grok AI models will be hosted and billed directly by Microsoft, making them available to its own product teams and enterprise clients through the Azure AI Foundry service.Elon Musk made a friendly virtual appearance at Microsoft's annual technology showcase to reveal that his Grok artificial intelligence chatbot will now be hosted on Microsoft's data centers. “It’s fantastic to have you at our developer conference,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said to Musk in a pre-recorded video conversation broadcast at Microsoft's Build conference in Seattle.This unexpected addition has already sparked internal discussions and could potentially strain Microsoft's existing partnership with OpenAI , a leading AI research and deployment company in which Microsoft has heavily invested. Over the past year, Microsoft has been strategically diversifying its Azure AI Foundry platform, incorporating models from various AI labs that directly compete with OpenAI's offerings.Available through the Azure AI Foundry platform, Grok 3 and Grok 3 mini will come with the robust service-level agreements that Azure customers have come to expect. Furthermore, Microsoft will handle the billing directly, aligning with the model of other AI models hosted on the platform.Grok, which currently powers several features on Musk's social media platform X, has garnered significant attention for its unconventional approach. When first announced several years ago, Musk positioned Grok as an ""anti-woke"" AI, willing to tackle controversial topics that other AI systems often avoid. This has manifested in Grok's ability to generate vulgar responses when prompted and its generally more permissive stance on sensitive subjects, as indicated by benchmarks like SpeechMap.However, Grok's journey has not been without controversy. Recent reports have highlighted instances of the AI model generating inappropriate responses, including allegedly undressing photos of women. Earlier this year, Grok briefly censored mentions of prominent figures like Donald Trump and Musk himself. Just last week, an ""unauthorized modification"" led Grok to repeatedly generate references to white genocide in South Africa under specific prompts.Notably, the Grok 3 and Grok 3 mini models available through Azure AI Foundry are expected to be more controlled than their counterparts on X. Microsoft has indicated that these models will come with enhanced data integration, customization options, and governance capabilities that may not be readily available through xAI's direct API. This suggests a more enterprise-ready and moderated version of Grok will be offered to Azure customers.The inclusion of Grok in Azure AI Foundry marks a significant step in Microsoft's strategy to offer a diverse range of AI models to its customers, even if it means incorporating technology from a sometimes-contentious figure like Elon Musk and potentially complicating its relationship with key partner OpenAI. The industry will be watching closely to see how this development unfolds and the impact it has on the competitive landscape of AI cloud services.",Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok will now be hosted on Microsoft's data centers. The Grok AI models will be hosted and billed directly by Microsoft. This announcement positions Microsoft as one of the first major cloud providers to offer managed access to Grok.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121276692,imgsize-26882,width-400,resizemode-4/Microsoft-Build-2025-Timings-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect.jpg"

What Bengaluru police said about the techie who has been alleged of burglary



""The beginning of his professional life was good. But everything changed when he became an online gaming addict. He lost everything,""

A Hyderabad-based techie named L Srinivas has been arrested for allegedly committing more than 86 burglaries. Bengaluru police cited his addiction to online gaming as a contributing factor to these alleged crimes. Srinivas, 39, is a debt-ridden mechanical engineer who turned to crime to make quick money by breaking into locked houses in Hyderabad and stealing valuables, police said to TOI. Police even claimed to have recovered stolen goods worth around Rs 9 lakh from him after arresting him and solving three burglary cases reported last month in Bengaluru. Despite being described as a brilliant student and a hardworking professional, Srinivas reportedly lost money in online gaming, including gambling, police told TOI.Srinivas, who is also a divorcee, lives alone in a paying‑guest accommodation and stays away from most of his family, the police noted. His elder brother works as a tech professional in the US and his mother lives in Hyderabad. He had worked in various software companies in Hyderabad for short periods and is also known as Kammepalli Srinivas , as he is originally from the Kamepalli village in Andhra Pradesh.police said to TOI.Police say Srinivas faces 86 criminal charges in Hyderabad alone, primarily for burglary, followed by cybercrime and IT‑related fraud, where he allegedly lured victims with fake job offers to steal their money.Last month, Srinivas stole valuables from three locked houses in and around Bengaluru’s Kodigehalli area, after which he was arrested and taken into custody, police added.","L Srinivas, 39, faces 86 criminal charges in Hyderabad alone, primarily for burglary, followed by cybercrime and IT‑related fraud.

What is 'Take It Down Act'

How Melania Trump championed the Bill

President Trump joked he will use the Bill for himself too

President Donald Trump are set to sign the Take It Down Act into law on Monday, a bipartisan measure spearheaded by First Lady Melania Trump to impose stricter penalties for distributing non-consensual intimate imagery, commonly known as “revenge porn,” including AI-generated “deepfakes.” The White House hosted a signing ceremony attended by the president and first lady, marking a significant step in federal regulation of online content.The legislation, sponsored by Senators Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without consent. It mandates that websites and social media platforms remove such content within 48 hours of a victim’s request and take steps to eliminate duplicates. The bill passed with overwhelming support, clearing the Senate by unanimous consent and the House in April with a 409-2 vote.Melania Trump played a pivotal role in the bill’s passage, leveraging her Be Best campaign’s focus on children’s well-being and social media issues. In March, she made a rare public appearance on Capitol Hill, lobbying House members and hosting a roundtable with lawmakers and young women affected by non-consensual imagery. She described the experiences of victims, particularly teenage girls, as “heartbreaking.” The first lady also invited a victim to the president’s address to Congress in March, highlighting the issue’s urgency.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reportedly praised Melania’s efforts, stating, “The first lady was instrumental in getting this important legislation passed.” After the House vote, Melania called the bipartisan support a “powerful statement” for protecting “the dignity, privacy, and safety of our children.”President Trump, speaking to Congress in March, condemned the publication of such imagery as “just terrible” and expressed enthusiasm for signing the bill. He added a personal note, saying, “I’m going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don’t mind. There’s nobody who gets treated worse than I do online.”While the law has been hailed as a victory for victims, it faces criticism from free speech advocates and digital rights groups. Critics argue the bill’s broad language could lead to censorship of legal content, including pornography and LGBTQ material, and raise concerns about government overreach into private communications and due process.The Take It Down Act builds on state-level bans on revenge porn and deepfakes, marking a rare federal intervention in regulating internet platforms. It represents a continuation of Melania Trump’s advocacy for children’s safety online, a cornerstone of her public work during her husband’s first and second terms.",President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump set to sign 'Take It Down Act' Bill makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without consent.

CBS News President and CEO Wendy McMahon has announced her resignation, marking a significant leadership shakeup within the embattled media giant. McMahon's departure comes just weeks after Bill Owens, the longtime executive producer of ""60 Minutes,"" also stepped down, citing a loss of editorial control amid mounting legal challenges.McMahon's exit adds to the growing uncertainty at CBS as the network grapples with a $20 billion lawsuit filed by former President Donald Trump, alleging deceptive editing of a critical pre-election interview. The timing of her resignation is seen by many as a strategic move ahead of a possible merger between CBS parent company Paramount Global and Skydance Media, as the company seeks to avoid potential regulatory backlash.On Monday, McMahon informed CBS staff of her decision to step down as president and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures. In a heartfelt memo, McMahon expressed pride in her work with the network, but also pointed to growing disagreements over the company's future direction.""Today, I am stepping down from my position as president and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures,"" McMahon wrote. ""Leading this extraordinary organization has been the honor of a lifetime because I got to work alongside all of you. At the same time, the past few months have been challenging. It’s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward. It’s time for me to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.""Her resignation follows the sudden departure of Bill Owens, who left CBS last month, stating that he could no longer produce the program as he saw fit. Owens' exit was reportedly driven by similar frustrations over editorial independence amid the escalating legal dispute with Trump.McMahon’s departure comes at a critical moment for CBS, as its parent company, Paramount Global, is engaged in high-stakes mediation with Trump’s legal team over a massive defamation lawsuit. The former president has accused CBS of bias, claiming that a 2024 interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris on ""60 Minutes"" was deceptively edited to harm his re-election campaign.The lawsuit, which seeks $20 billion in damages, has cast a shadow over Paramount’s planned merger with Skydance Media, a deal potentially at risk if the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), led by Trump appointees, intervenes. Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder, is reportedly pushing for a settlement to avoid further regulatory scrutiny, though this move has sparked internal resistance.While McMahon’s exit marks a leadership change, it also highlights the internal tensions within CBS over how to handle the lawsuit. Many CBS staffers and media observers have expressed concerns about the potential settlement, arguing that it could set a dangerous precedent for political interference in editorial decisions.A CBS News insider told Fox News Digital that McMahon participated in the network’s editorial call on the morning of her resignation, without hinting at her imminent departure. The network has yet to issue an official response to the news.","CBS News President and CEO Wendy McMahon has announced her resignation.

"Microsoft Build 2025, Microsoft's biggest developer event of 2025, hit by Pro-Palestine protest; CEO Satya Nadella’s keynote speech disrupted",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-build-2025-event-hit-by-pro-palestine-protest-ceo-satya-nadellas-keynote-speech-disrupted/articleshow/121274833.cms,"SHUT DOWN MICROSOFT BUILD FOR PALESTINE!

Protesting Microsoft employee Joe Lopez sends email

“Leadership rejects our claims that Azure technology is being used to target or harm civilians in Gaza,”

“Those of us who have been paying attention know that this is a bold-faced lie. Every byte of data that is stored on the cloud (much of it likely containing data obtained by illegal mass surveillance) can and will be used as justification to level cities and exterminate Palestinians.”

Here’s the full text of the email sent by the protesting Microsoft employee



""Fellow Microsoft workers and Microsoft leadership, By now you may have seen or heard of my disruption at the Microsoft Build keynote this morning. I have been working as a firmware engineer under Azure Hardware Systems and Infrastructure (AHSI) for the past 4 years. As a Microsoft worker - while I’ve had positive experiences here, working and learning with many incredible people - I can no longer stand by in silence as Microsoft continues to facilitate Israel’s ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people.

Like many of you, I have been watching the ongoing genocide in Gaza in horror. I have been shocked by the silence, inaction, and callousness of world leaders as Palestinian people are suffering, losing their lives and their homes while they plead for the rest of the world to pay attention and act.

Like many of you, I have tried to do my part in small ways. Staying informed, sharing information with friends, signing petitions, making donations. All the while continuing my work at Microsoft.

My disillusionment with Microsoft

Then I came across the No Azure for Apartheid movement, whose members have been organizing, taking action, and speaking out no matter the cost. I saw Ibtihal and Vaniya’s disruption of Microsoft’s 50th anniversary on April 4 and was shocked to hear the words coming from their mouths. Microsoft is killing kids? Is my work killing kids?

I was also shocked by the silence of our leadership. By the silence of

Mustafa Suleyman

,

Brad Smith

, Kevin Scott, Scott Guthrie, and Satya Nadella. “Why aren’t they responding”? I asked myself. “If we are truly not guilty, shouldn’t they deny these horrible accusations?”

I started to look deeper. I read the articles, saw the evidence, heard the testimonies of employees who were horrified to find out that the technology that we are building is being used by Israel in their mission to erase the Palestinian people.

A switch had been flipped. Presented with this information, I went into work everyday plagued by thoughts of the suffering that is being inflicted by a United States-Israeli war machine that runs on Azure. I joined Microsoft because I truly believed that it was the “more ethical big tech”. I thought that the work that I was doing was empowering people, not causing harm.

Microsoft’s admission of complicity

Microsoft recently uploaded a blog post, marking its first official response to the concerns that many have been shouting into their ears for years. Their statement falls far short of what we are demanding. Nontransparent audits into our cloud operations in Israel (conducted by no other than Microsoft itself and an unnamed external entity) that declare no wrongdoing by the company do not give me any sense of relief. In fact, this response has further compelled me to speak out. Microsoft openly admitted to allowing the Israel Ministry of Defense “special access to our technologies beyond the terms of our commercial agreements”. Do you really believe that this “special access” was allowed only once? What sort “special access” do they really need? And what are they doing with it?

Leadership rejects our claims that Azure technology is being used to target or harm civilians in Gaza. Those of us who have been paying attention know that this is a bold-faced lie. Every byte of data that is stored on the cloud (much of it likely containing data obtained by illegal mass surveillance) can and will be used as justification to level cities and exterminate Palestinians. We don’t need an internal audit to know that a top Azure customer is committing crimes against humanity. We see it live on the internet every day.

As one of the largest companies in the world, Microsoft has immeasurable power to do the right thing: demand an end to this senseless tragedy, or we will cease our technological support for Israel. If leadership continues to ignore this demand, I promise that it won’t go unnoticed. The world has already woken up to our complicity and is turning against us. The boycotts will increase and our image will continue to spiral into disrepair.

Call to action

My future children will one day ask me what I did for the Palestinian people as they were suffering and pleading for our help. I hope they will forgive me for my previous inaction. Many of you have children who may be asking you that question today. What will you tell them?

As Israel continues its deadly blockade of Gaza, and Netanyahu continues to assert that he will not rest until Gaza is fully occupied, we know that this situation is beyond dire. I wouldn’t have risked my career and my livelihood if I didn’t believe that to the core of my being. It’s terrifying to speak up, especially right now. Imagine your home being demolished as soldiers stand by cheering.

Your friends and family members dismembered by bombs that drop daily in your neighborhood.

Every member of your community on the brink of death due to starvation

Strangers staking claims to your home, awaiting your death.

Wouldn’t you hope that someone would speak up for you?

I recognize my privilege as a young person with little financial responsibility to anyone but myself and little risk of deportation as a US citizen. Not everyone can afford to do what I did without great risk to themselves and their family. But no act is too small when human lives are at stake. Sign the petition, join the movement, start the conversation with colleagues, please contribute whatever you can to the cause.

I know many of you out there are also considering leaving Microsoft for the same reasons I am. You are not alone. If you find it is too debilitating to work at this company and you wish to leave, please lean on our campaign to support. If we continue to remain silent, we will pay for that silence with our humanity.

Looking back, I’m ashamed of my past silence. But as the saying goes: “The best time to act was yesterday, the second best time is today.”

Best,

Joe""

A Microsoft employee disrupted the company’s annual developer conference, Build 2025, in Seattle on May 19. The employee protested against the company’s Cloud and AI work with the Israeli government. According to The Verge, the protest happened minutes after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella started his keynote speech for the Microsoft Build 2025 conference, when one of the protesters shouted ‘free Palestine’.The Microsoft employee, identified as Joe Lopez , is a firmware engineer who has worked at Microsoft for four years on the Azure hardware systems team. He was joined by a former Google employee who was fired after participating in similar protests last year against Google’s cloud deal with Israel.The protestors were immediately escorted out of the hall inside the Seattle conference centre, the report states. A similar incident happened in April when the company’s 50th anniversary festivities were disrupted by dual pro-Palestine protests. On April 4, two separate incidents involving Microsoft employees – Ibtihal Aboussad and Vaniya Aggarwal disrupted the milestone celebration at the company's Washington headquarters. In both cases, the employee followed their outburst by sending mass emails to colleagues, containing nearly identical demands from Microsoft leadership, which is to cease providing Israel with ""lethal technology"" that they claimed enables ""apartheid and genocide"" in Gaza.The Verge, in its report, states that soon after the protest, Joe Lopez sent an email to thousands of Microsoft employees. In the email, he said that he was “shocked by the silence of our leadership,” just days after the company said it had found no proof that its Azure or AI tools had caused harm in Gaza.the email reads, further adding,Microsoft says an external review found no misuse of its Azure or AI tools in the Gaza conflictLast week, the software giant announced that it had recently completed an internal review, along with an assessment by an unnamed external firm, to examine how its technology is being used in the conflict in Gaza.The company said its work with the Israel Ministry of Defense (IMOD) is “structured as a standard commercial relationship,” and stated, “we have found no evidence that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies, or any of our other software, have been used to harm people or that IMOD has failed to comply with our terms of service or our AI Code of Conduct.”Joe Lopez’s email’s full text:","Protesting Microsoft employee Joe Lopez sends email to company leadership.

Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-know-about-facebook-founders-viral-rawdog-routine/articleshow/120843936.cms,"Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

‘rawdog’ morning routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well. Here’s how it aligns with executive performance demands:While Zuckerberg avoids all forms of chemical stimulation, other tech leaders have taken diverse approaches to optimizing performance:Zuckerberg’s ‘rawdog’ method is unique in its emphasis on no external stimulants, which sets it apart from the above figures.While no clinical studies have yet been conducted on Zuckerberg’s specific regimen, related research suggests:","Zuckerberg’s morning includes two hours of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA) He believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

Microsoft becomes world's most-valuable company and its No 1 position also has 'Trump Tariff' message on Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-company-and-its-no-1-position-also-has-trump-tariff-message-on-apple/articleshow/120845348.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella



Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools

Google claims breakup ""impossible"" without serious consequences

The US Justice Department have asked a federal judge to break up Google's advertising technology business, marking the second government request within a year that could fundamentally reshape the $2 trillion giant. During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

In a recent interview with CBS, Hinton revealed that he uses OpenAI 's GPT-4 and he tends to believe what GPT-4 tells him, even though he knows he should be more careful. “I tend to believe what it says, even though I should probably be suspicious,” he said. Sharing an example from his own experience, he said that he once asked GPT-4 a simple riddle:The correct answer is one as Sally herself is one of the two sisters, and each brother has the same two sisters. But GPT-4 answered two, which surprised Hinton.he said during the interview.Stating that while GPT-4 is very advanced, it’s not perfect, he said “It's an expert at everything. It's not a very good expert at everything.”Still, Hinton believes future AI models will improve. When asked if GPT-5 would get the riddle right, he replied, ""Yeah, I suspect.""OpenAI launched GPT-4 in 2023 and became popular for clearing difficult exams like the SAT, GRE, and bar exam. In May 2024, OpenAI released GPT-4o, which became the default model for ChatGPT.The company recently unveiled new models—GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 Mini, and GPT-4.1 Nano that are designed to outperform previous iterations, offering developers more efficient and cost-effective AI solutions.One of the standout features of GPT-4.1 is its expanded context window, supporting up to 1 million tokens, significantly surpassing the 128,000-token limit of its predecessor, GPT-4o. This enhancement allows the model to process and understand larger datasets, making it particularly effective for complex tasks such as analysing extensive codebases or lengthy documents.Additionally, GPT-4.1 delivers notable gains in coding performance, showing a 21% improvement over GPT-4o and a 27% increase compared to GPT-4.5.","Geoffrey Hinton, the Godfather of AI has admitted that he sometimes trusts his favorite chatbot more than he should.

"What is the 'One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act' and why it has raised alarm among Indians in America",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-is-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-and-why-it-has-raised-alarm-among-indians-in-america/articleshow/121270617.cms,"FILE Picture (AP Photo/J.

Why the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' has made Indians in America anxious

""RBI may be forced to intervene""

States in India most likely to be impacted by the taxation provision

Status of the 'One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act'

The 'One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act' is a proposed legislative package in the U.S. House of Representatives, aiming to reshape key areas of American policy. It's a comprehensive bill, addressing taxes, federal spending, and border security, leading to significant political debate. At its core, the bill seeks to make permanent the 2017 tax cuts, alongside new temporary tax breaks for tips, overtime, and auto loan interest. It also proposes increasing the standard deduction and child tax credit. Simultaneously, it targets substantial federal spending cuts, particularly to Medicaid, through stricter eligibility and work requirements.A significant portion of the bill focuses on border security, with proposals to fund wall construction, increase border patrol personnel, and invest in advanced technology. Changes to asylum policies and increased fees for asylum seekers are also included. The bill's controversial elements, like the potential 5% remittance tax and alterations to existing tax deductions, are generating significant opposition. Even within the Republican party, disagreements persist over spending cuts and Medicaid work requirements. Non-partisan analyses suggest the bill could substantially increase the national debt. Currently, the bill has advanced out of the House Budget Committee, but its path to becoming law remains uncertain, as it faces significant hurdles in the full House and Senate.'The One Big Beautiful Bill' has sent ripples of concern across Indians in American. Economic Think Tank, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), has warned that the proposed 5 per cent tax on remittances sent abroad by non-US citizens could significantly impact Indian households and exert downward pressure on the rupee. The controversial provision specifically targets international money transfers made by non-US individuals, including Green Card holders and temporary visa workers such as those on H-1B and H-2A visas. Notably, the proposed levy would not apply to US citizens.""The proposed US tax on remittances sent abroad by non-citizens is raising alarm in India, which stands to lose billions in annual foreign currency inflows if the plan becomes law,"" stated GTRI in its analysis. India is a major recipient of remittances, having received an estimated USD 120 billion in the financial year 2023-24. A significant 28 per cent of these inflows originated from the United States.GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava highlighted the potential financial burden on Indian expatriates and their families. ""A 5 per cent tax could significantly raise the cost of sending money home. A 10-15 per cent drop in remittance flows could result in a USD 12-18 billion shortfall for India annually,"" he explained.The economic consequences could extend beyond individual households. Srivastava cautioned that such a substantial reduction in dollar inflows would tighten the supply of US dollars in India's foreign exchange market, potentially leading to a modest depreciation of the Indian rupee. ""The Reserve Bank of India may be forced to intervene more frequently to stabilise the currency. The rupee could weaken by ₹1-1.5 per US dollar if the remittance shock plays out fully,"" he added.The impact would be particularly felt in states like Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, where millions of families rely heavily on remittances from overseas workers to cover essential expenses such as education, healthcare, and housing. A sudden decline in these funds could severely impact household consumption at a time when the Indian economy is already navigating global economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures.GTRI further argued that by taxing global capital flows, the US could inadvertently disrupt a crucial channel for global development financing, reduce household incomes in developing nations, and weaken demand in economies already grappling with inequality and instability.The development gains added significance in light of India's recent proposal at the World Trade Organization (WTO) advocating for a reduction in the cost of cross-border capital flows and remittances, highlighting a stark contrast in policy approaches.As of May 19, 2025, the ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act"" has advanced out of the House Budget Committee. However, it still needs to be voted on by the full House of Representatives and would then need to pass the Senate before it could become law. Negotiations and potential amendments to the bill are ongoing.","The 'One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act' is a proposed legislative package in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Nikhil Somwanshi , the 25-year-old machine learning engineer at Ola’s Krutrim was found dead in Bengaluru's Agara Lake. A viral reddit post claims that Somwanshi committed suicide due to 'toxic culture' and extreme work pressure. Responding to the incident, Krutrim – the AI startup backed by Ola has issued an official statement.“We are deeply saddened by the tragic passing of one of our most talented young employees, Nikhil, on the 8th of May. Our thoughts and heartfelt sympathies are with his family, friends, and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time,” a Krutrim official said in a statement. The company stated that Somwanshi was on personal leave at the time of the incident and had requested time off for rest on April 8.""Nikhil was on personal leave at the time of the incident. He had reached out to his manager on the 8th of April, expressing that he needed rest, and was promptly granted personal time off. Later, on the 17th of April, he shared that he was feeling better but would benefit from additional rest, and his leave was extended accordingly,"" the statement added.“As a company, we are heartbroken by this loss. Nikhil was a valued team member, and his absence will be deeply felt by all who knew and worked with him. We are extending our full support to Nikhil’s family and our employees during this time of grief. We are also in contact with the relevant authorities and will continue to offer our assistance as needed,” the spokesperson said.Shared by Reddit user ‘Kirgawakutzo’, the post is titled “Suicide due to work pressure at the OLA, the worst place to work”. It reads:“News Not sure why its not a public issue yet, a colleague of mine just gave up on his life due to extreme work pressure. He used to work in Krutrim, and with 2 other guys leading a project(even after being a freshie). The other two guys left the company, so he was cramped up with work of the other two as well. I shouldn't be taking names but this absolute shit of a manager Rajkiran Panuganti has no real clue how to man manage people. He just attends the calls, bashes people left, right and center and disappears since he lives in US and most workforce is here in Bangalore. The words used in meetings, especially against freshers, its just traumatic. Having not delivered a single product even after a year of joining Krutrim, he is just taking it all out on people. Even after this shocking incident, there has been no behavioural change in people there. I heard other team members saying if they stay anymore here, they are going to end up doing the same. The authorities are trying their best to shut down the news. Its pathetic to be honest. Hope this blows up and police takes strict action. Didn't know where else to share this, but here we go.”","Nikhil Somwanshi, 25, was a machine learning engineer at Ola's Krutrim. He was found dead in Bengaluru's Agara Lake.

It may not all be looking well for Apple's AI ambitions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/it-may-not-all-be-looking-well-for-apples-ai-ambitions/articleshow/121267891.cms,"Leadership shuffles amidst internal struggles

Technical problems plague Siri and Apple Intelligence despite major investment

The future seems uncertain for Apple’s AI ambitions



Seven years after Apple poached Google's AI chief John Giannandrea to revitalize its artificial intelligence efforts, the iPhone maker finds itself increasingly behind competitors in the AI race, with delayed features, internal upheaval, and mounting concerns about its future in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.The company's flagship AI initiative, Apple Intelligence, was promised to transform Siri into a ChatGPT-like assistant but has repeatedly failed to deliver. Features showcased at last year's Worldwide Developers Conference remain buggy or non-functional, with the upgraded Siri delayed indefinitely after internal testing revealed fundamental problems.Bloomberg reports that John Giannandrea, hired from Google in 2018 to lead Apple's AI transformation, has been stripped of product development control this spring. CEO Tim Cook reportedly lost faith in Giannandrea's execution abilities, transferring Siri development to Vision Pro head Mike Rockwell under software chief Craig Federighi.""This is a crisis,"" one senior AI team member told Bloomberg Businessweek reporters Mark Gurman and Drake Bennett. ""It's been sinking for a long time,"" another team member added, comparing the effort to a foundering ship.The leadership changes come as Apple faces mounting pressure to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT, which blindsided the company in 2022. Internal data described to Bloomberg shows Apple's chatbot technology remains at least 25% less accurate than ChatGPT at handling most queries.Apple's technical challenges run deeper than surface-level delays. Engineers report that the company essentially split Siri's infrastructure in half, creating integration issues that have proven difficult to resolve. ""There are hundreds of bugs right now,"" one Siri team member revealed. ""It's whack-a-mole. You fix one issue, and three more crop up.""The company's conservative approach to acquiring graphics processing units (GPUs) has also backfired, with competitors like Amazon and Microsoft securing much of the world's supply. Apple's commitment to user privacy, while admirable, has further hindered AI development by limiting researchers' access to the vast amounts of data needed to train competitive models.Senior executives worry that Apple's AI struggles threaten its position across multiple product lines. Eddy Cue, Apple's services chief, has warned colleagues that the company risks becoming the Nokia of the smartphone era if it cannot master AI technology.The company now plans to focus on upgrading existing Apple Intelligence capabilities rather than revolutionary new features for the next iOS version. Sources indicate Apple is preparing to separate its AI branding from Siri, acknowledging the voice assistant's damaged reputation.Despite the setbacks, some remain optimistic. Original Siri co-founder Dag Kittlaus believes Apple still has advantages, noting that ""all of the foundational model companies have no idea what an assistant is"" while Apple has worked on the concept since 2010.However, with European regulations potentially forcing Apple to allow third-party voice assistants as defaults, the company faces an unprecedented challenge to its ecosystem control just as AI reshapes how users interact with technology.","Apple's flagship AI initiative, Apple Intelligence, was promised to transform Siri into a ChatGPT-like assistant.

The growing impact of AI on career skills

""If I were a student today, irrespective of whether it's for math or science or chemistry or biology — doesn't matter what field of science I'm going into or what profession — I'm going to ask myself, 'How can I use AI to do my job better?'""

The future of AI-driven careers

As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to reshape industries worldwide, tech leaders are increasingly emphasizing the importance of mastering this transformative technology. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang , one of the most influential figures in the AI sector, recently shared his perspective on how the next generation of professionals can leverage AI to build successful careers.Speaking on the ""Huge Conversations"" podcast with Cleo Abram in January 2025, Huang highlighted the significance of understanding and effectively interacting with AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, and Grok. His advice reflects the growing recognition that AI skills will be essential for future careers, regardless of the industry.During the podcast, Huang stressed that learning to work with AI is critical for anyone entering the job market today. He compared the process of interacting with AI to the art of asking the right questions, emphasizing that effective communication with AI requires a specific set of skills.Huang stated, adding that prompting AI is similar to being a skilled questioner.Huang’s comments come at a time when the global job market is rapidly evolving, with AI playing an increasingly significant role in various sectors, from finance and healthcare to education and manufacturing. As businesses integrate AI into their operations, the demand for professionals who can effectively leverage this technology is expected to surge.To help aspiring professionals master this skill, Huang offered practical advice on crafting effective prompts. He suggested that individuals think of AI as a highly intelligent yet context-limited assistant. Drawing on insights from AI experts like Kelly Daniel, Huang emphasized the importance of clarity and context in crafting prompts.Daniel, a prompt director at Lazarus AI, advised that users should treat AI as a smart but inexperienced child, providing it with the necessary context to generate accurate and relevant responses. She recommended breaking down complex instructions into clear, concise steps and including examples whenever possible to guide the AI’s responses.For example, instead of simply asking,a more effective prompt might be,This approach provides the AI with a clearer framework for generating a useful response.Huang’s emphasis on AI skills reflects broader trends in the workforce. According to LinkedIn’s 2025 Work Change report, approximately 70% of the skills used in most jobs are expected to change by 2030 due to advancements in AI and automation. Despite this, a 2024 study by the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Common Sense Media, and Hopelab found that only 11% of Americans aged 14 to 22 use generative AI tools like ChatGPT on a weekly basis.Huang noted that regardless of one’s field of study or career path, understanding how to use AI to improve job performance will become a critical advantage.Huang remarked.As AI technology continues to evolve, the ability to effectively interact with these systems will likely become a fundamental skill across industries. From automating routine tasks to enhancing decision-making processes, AI has the potential to significantly boost productivity and innovation.For students and professionals looking to stay ahead in this rapidly changing landscape, Huang’s advice serves as a reminder that mastering AI is not just about learning technical skills but also about understanding how to communicate effectively with these powerful tools.As businesses increasingly rely on AI for critical functions, those who can harness this technology will be well-positioned to succeed in the emerging digital economy.","Jensen Huang: Mastering AI is the key to future career success.

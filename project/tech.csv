TSMC and Broadcom may be planning to split Intel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tsmc-and-broadcom-may-be-planning-to-split-intel/articleshow/118309717.cms,"How Intel’s rumoured deal with Broadcom, TSMC may work

Intel is reportedly facing the possibility of a breakup as rivals Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Broadcom explore separate deals to acquire portions of the struggling American chipmaking giant.These potential deals, while still preliminary and informal, represent a significant threat to Intel's long-held dominance, essentiaslly aligning Intel with the broader industry trend of specialising in either chip design or manufacturing, a departure from its traditional integrated model.Citing sources familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reports that Broadcom is considering a bid for Intel's chip design and marketing division. The company has held informal discussions with advisors but would likely pursue a deal only if it secures a partner for Intel's manufacturing operations.The report, however, says that no formal offer has been submitted, and Broadcom may ultimately decide against a bid.Meanwhile, TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, is exploring acquiring some or all of Intel's fabrication plants (fabs). Sources indicate TSMC might participate in an investor consortium or other structure to facilitate the acquisition.Intel's interim executive chairman, Frank Yeary, is reportedly leading discussions with potential suitors and Trump administration officials, who are concerned about the implications for national security. Yeary has indicated his priority is maximising shareholder value.The talks surrounding Intel's fabs are reportedly in their early stages, with the Trump administration having approached TSMC to explore the possibility. However, a White House official reportedly stated that the president is unlikely to support a deal that results in a foreign entity operating Intel’s factories.As these potential acquisitions unfold, Intel's board of directors is actively searching for a new CEO. The chosen executive's mandate will likely depend on the outcome of these ongoing discussions and the resulting structure of the company.In recent years, Intel has been divesting various businesses as part of a cost-cutting initiative. The company is currently in the process of selling a stake in its programmable-chip unit, Altera, which Intel acquired in 2015 for $16.7 billion.","Broadcom is reportedly considering a bid for Intel's chip design and marketing division.

We walked away from Swiggy and Zomato as we didn't ...: TVS Capital Funds chairman Gopal Srinivasan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/we-walked-away-from-swiggy-and-zomato-as-we-didnt-tvs-capital-funds-chairman-gopal-srinivasan/articleshow/118309924.cms,"Why 'Yes' to Nykaa, 'No' to Swiggy and Zomato



India's rapid expansion in the quick-commerce sector, led by companies like Zomato and SoftBank-backed Swiggy , is unsustainable in the long term, according to Gopal Srinivasan , Chairman of TVS Capital Funds , which manages assets worth approximately 50 billion rupees ($575 million). In an interview to news agency Reuters, Srinivasan described these ventures as ""passing fads and fantasies,"" questioning their reliance on private equity and venture capital funding without demonstrating multi-decadal economic viability.Notably, TVS Capital had previously invested in beauty e-commerce platform Nykaa, exiting in 2018. Srinivasan mentioned that they chose not to invest in Swiggy and Zomato due to insufficient understanding of the market at the time. In contrast, he identified Nykaa as representing a deeper trend, driven by the increasing number of women entering the workforce and the associated demand for professional appearance. ""We looked at Swiggy, Zomato. We didn't know enough, so we walked away,"" Srinivasan reportedly said. ""Nykaa was clearly a deeper trend, because the way we looked at it is women coming into the workforce in massive quantities... and fundamentally, the fact that they will have to appear as professional as they can,"" he said.The quick-commerce industry in India, promising deliveries within 10 minutes, was projected to surpass $6 billion in annual sales in 2024, a significant increase from $100 million in 2020, as reported by Datum Intelligence. Following the lead of Swiggy's Instamart and Zomato's Blinkit, major global retailers such as Walmart-backed Flipkart, Amazon, and Reliance Industries have also entered the instant delivery market in India.Prominent investment firms, including Prosus, Tencent Holdings, Nexus Venture Partners, and Info Edge, are major stakeholders in Zomato, Swiggy, and competitor Zepto, which collectively dominate the quick-commerce landscape. Srinivasan criticized investments in this sector, suggesting that investors are acquiring ""over-valued"" assets with the intention of selling them at higher prices, adhering to the ""greater fool theory"" investment strategy.Since its inception in 2007, TVS Capital has invested in around 30 businesses, primarily focusing on financial services firms such as Vivriti Capital and Five Star Business Finance. Their portfolio also includes investments in Walmart-backed fintech company PhonePe and insurance technology firm Digit Insurance.","Gopal Srinivasan is the Chairman of TVS Capital Funds, which manages assets worth approximately 50 billion rupees ($575 million) The quick-commerce industry in India, promising deliveries within 10 minutes, was projected to surpass $6 billion in annual sales in 2024, a significant increase from $100 million in 2020.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118309922,imgsize-1380141,width-400,resizemode-4/118309922.jpg"
Suchir Balaji's death: San Francisco police provides important update on OpenAI whistleblower's ‘murder’ investigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/suchir-balajis-death-san-francisco-police-provides-important-update-on-openai-whistleblowers-murder-investigation/articleshow/118307504.cms,"No signs of struggle, injuries: Report

Suchir Balaji’s ‘murder’ angle

Suchir Balaji , the 26-year-old software developer at ChatGPT-maker OpenAI , died by suicide, San Francisco authorities have officially declared. The official confirmation brings an end to the investigation, which was opened after Balaji's parents publicly questioned the suicide ruling and suggested foul play.The San Francisco Police Department ( SFPD ) and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) released a joint statement and a 13-page medical examiner's report last week, reaffirming their initial finding that Balaji died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, as per Fortune.“The OCME found no evidence or information to establish a cause and manner of death for Mr. Balaji other than a suicide by self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,” the medical examiner's report stated.“SFPD conducted an independent investigation and based on the information SFPD reviewed, there is insufficient evidence to find Mr. Balaji’s death was the result of a homicide,” it added.The detailed reports outline the evidence supporting the suicide conclusion. Medical examiners found no signs of struggle, injuries, or forced entry into Balaji’s apartment. The apartment door was deadbolted, and windows were deemed inaccessible.Furthermore, internet search history on Balaji's computer revealed queries about brain anatomy. The firearm used belonged to Balaji, and gunshot residue was detected on both of his hands. A toxicology report also indicated the presence of alcohol and amphetamines in his system.“We realise that this information is difficult to receive. We hope that this response may help bring some amount of closure to his grieving parents, friends and family,” said San Francisco police chief Bill Scott and OCME executive director David Serrano Sewell.This announcement comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Balaji's parents in January, demanding the full police report amid their claims that their son was murdered.Balaji’s parents have publicly maintained their belief that their son was murdered. They have cited concerns regarding the initial investigation and pointed to Balaji's public allegations, made just a month before his death, that his former employer, OpenAI, was engaged in copyright infringement.Following what they deemed an unsatisfactory initial investigation, the parents hired their own investigators and subsequently filed a lawsuit on January 31 to push the SFPD to release its full findings.According to Fortune, Balaji’s mother, Ramarao, said that she and her husband are currently reviewing the extensive documentation.","Suchir Balaji, 26, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

are being run and controlled by Nawab Ali alias Lavish Chaudhary, such as BotBro, TLC Coin, Yorker FX, projecting them as forex trading apps/websites,”

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has frozen bank deposits worth Rs 170 crore in connection with an alleged fraudulent forex trading and deposit scheme operated by QFX Trade Ltd. According to a report by the news agency PTI, the ED conducted searches this week at various locations in Delhi, Noida, Shamli (Uttar Pradesh), and Rohtak (Haryana) as part of their investigation into the trading platform, its directors (Rajendra Sood, Vineet Kumar and Santosh Kumar) and alleged mastermind Nawab Ali alias, Lavish Chaudhary . The money laundering probe is based on multiple FIRs filed by Himachal Pradesh Police alleging that QFX Trade Ltd defrauded investors through a fraudulent forex trading scheme.According to the ED, QFX company and its directors operated an “unregulated” deposit scheme, luring investors with promises of high returns.Agents of the QFX group of companies ran an MLM (multi-level marketing) scheme under the QFX investment plan, using websites, apps, and social media advertisements to attract investors with the promise of higher returns through forex trading, the agency noted.Following the police FIRs, the ED discovered that the QFX scheme was rebranded as YFX (Yorker Fx) while maintaining the same modus operandi of “duping innocent investors by luring high rate of returns under the guise of forex trading.”the agency stated.The ED found that various events were organised in India and Dubai to attract more investors.The investigation revealed that multiple bank accounts belonging to NPay Box Private Limited, Capter Money Solutions Private Limited, and Tiger Digital Services Private Limited were being used for the ""collection of funds"" from investors.The agency alleged that these were “shell” or dummy companies “used” by the masterminds of the QFX/YFX scheme to receive public deposits for forex trading investments.The ED reported that funds amounting to Rs 170 crore, held across nearly 30 bank accounts, have been frozen after the company’s directors failed to explain their source.Additionally, cash amounting to about Rs 90 lakh was seized separately during searches conducted against an agent of QFX/YFX, the agency added.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has frozen bank deposits worth Rs 170 crore in connection with an alleged fraudulent forex trading and deposit scheme.

Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath want you to know this about SEBI’s new circular on API usage and algorithmic trading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamath-want-you-to-know-this-about-sebis-new-circular-on-api-usage-and-algorithmic-trading/articleshow/118020989.cms,"Take a look at the post here



“The SEBI circular on

API usage

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

SEBI's latest ALGO trading rules | The Daily Brief #163

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

Akash Bobba , a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Bobba, along with five other young engineers, was hired by Musk to modernise government systems, raising concerns about their lack of government experience and the potential security risks involved.Bobba, a graduate of UC Berkeley's elite Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (MET) program, has quickly risen through the ranks of Silicon Valley , securing internships at Meta, Palantir, and Bridgewater Associates.Known for his problem-solving skills, Bobba once rewrote an entire project overnight after a teammate accidentally deleted it just before a deadline. His former classmate Charis Zhang recalled the incident.“Let me tell you something about Akash. During a project at Berkeley, I accidentally deleted our entire codebase 2 days before the deadline. I panicked. Akash just stared at the screen, shrugged, and rewrote everything from scratch in one night—better than before. We submitted early and got first in the class. Many such stories. I trust him with everything I own,” wrote Zhang in a social media post.Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that granting individuals with limited government experience access to sensitive government systems poses significant security risks. The hiring strategy has also raised questions about the competence and oversight within Musk's DOGE initiative. Reports suggest that at least four of the new DOGE hires, including Bobba, now have top-tier access to federal IT systems.Bobba isn't the only new face in Musk's government overhaul. The five other members of the DOGE team comprise a mix of recent graduates, college students, and former SpaceX interns, all of whom now have official government emails and top-level security clearances.","Akash Bobba, a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE) Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities.

Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

Elon Musk’s father, Errol Musk, has openly criticized his son's parenting, calling him an absent father who hasn’t been present for his many children. In a viral interview on the Wide Awake podcast with Joshua Rubin, Errol bluntly stated, “No, he hasn’t been a good father.” He also spoke about Musk’s first child, Nevada Alexander, and his tragic passing. “The first child was too much with nannies and died in the care of a nanny. If Elon hears this, he’s gonna shoot me or something. But anyway, that’s what I think—that’s no good,” he said.Elon Musk has fathered 12 children with different partners, including Justine Musk, Grimes, and Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis. His first child, Nevada Alexander, tragically passed away at just 10 weeks old due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).Errol Musk elaborated on his concerns, claiming that Elon’s other children were also raised with minimal parental involvement. “They were too rich, too many nannies. Then he had five children with the same woman. Five sons all bought up, each one had its own nanny. You following me”.The elder Musk went on to assert that this upbringing had lasting effects. “The result is the boys and Kimbal’s two boys grew up not able to cross a street. Even the street outside, my daughters would say, ‘Dad, you won’t believe it. Elon’s kids and Kimbal’s boys, they can’t cross the road. We have to hold their hands across the road when they’re like 14 years old, can’t cross the road.’”Errol further speculated that this detached upbringing might be linked to certain personal challenges faced by his grandchildren. “Elon’s got to deal with it. It’s, it’s a bit worrying,” he remarked, referencing one of Elon’s children and one of Kimbal’s children being transgender.Elon Musk was recently seen taking his young son X to a press conference in the Oval Office alongside former U.S. President Donald Trump. He brought X along with Azure, and Strider—to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House.However, his ex-partner, musician Grimes, has expressed disapproval of X’s increasing public exposure. “He should not be in public like this,” she wrote on Musk’s social media platform, X.","Elon Musk’s father, Errol, has openly criticized his son's parenting, calling him an absent father who hasn’t been present for his many children.

"Intel sees 'Best week in 25 years', it's likely thanks to one of its biggest rivals and Donald Trump",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-sees-best-week-in-25-years-and-its-likely-thanks-to-one-of-its-biggest-rivals-and-donald-trump/articleshow/118277832.cms,"Why and how TSMC partnership is 'good news' for Intel



Intel's stock experienced its best week in 25 years, surging as much as 23.6% (and nearly 32% at its peak) due to rumors of a potential partnership with rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC). This dramatic rise, the largest since January 2000, reflects investor optimism for a turnaround after a prolonged period of weak performance.The catalyst for this surge according to a Bloomberg report are speculations that TSMC may be planning to acquire a controlling stake in Intel's factories at the request of the Donald Trump administration. While both companies declined to comment, the report fueled existing speculation, including analysis from Robert W. Baird & Co., that the US government could facilitate a collaboration. Baird's analysis suggested TSMC could send engineers to Intel's fabs to improve manufacturing processes, potentially leading to a joint venture funded by the US Chips Act .TSMC is the largest provider of outsourced chip production, serving companies such as Apple, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Its advances in manufacturing, which have surpassed Intel, have allowed its customers to take market share gains from the American company.Daniel Newman of The Futurum Group told Bloomberg that he sees the potential partnership as ""very bullish,"" but added that it remains unconfirmed. He noted that Intel's low stock valuation and suggested investors are betting on a catalyst, such as a partnership or new leadership, to revive the company and that the TSMC reports are that catalyst.Intel has struggled, particularly in the burgeoning AI chip market where it lags behind Nvidia. Its ambitious turnaround strategy, led by former CEO Pat Gelsinger , has shown limited progress. Gelsinger's departure, combined with reports of potential acquisitions (including a cooled interest from Qualcomm) and disappointing revenue forecasts, have created an air of uncertainty.Despite the optimism surrounding the TSMC rumors, analysts like Citi's Christopher Danely remain skeptical, as per the Bloomberg report. However, Intel could benefit from the Trump administration's focus on domestic chip manufacturing. With the US prioritizing AI hardware production, Intel, as the sole major US AI chip manufacturer, could become a key player. Hendi Susanto of Gabelli Funds is said to have highlighted this potential but cautioned that Intel's challenges are far from over and a quick fix is unlikely. He emphasized that Intel's recovery is a multi-year project.","Intel's stock experienced its best week in 25 years, surging as much as 23.6% (and nearly 32% at its peak) due to rumors of a potential partnership with rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

In a surprising revelation, conservative influencer and author Ashley St. Clair has publicly claimed that she gave birth to a child fathered by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. The statement, made through a post on X (formerly Twitter), has sparked widespread discussion across social media platforms. St. Clair, 31, disclosed that her child, now five months old, was fathered by Musk, marking the tech mogul’s 13th known child. The announcement has generated intense media scrutiny, with Musk yet to confirm or deny the claim. This development adds another layer of complexity to Musk’s personal life, which has been under public attention due to his multiple relationships and children with different women.On Friday night, St. Clair took to X to make the revelation, stating,She captioned the post witha Latin phrase meaningsuggesting that she had decided to make the claim public despite possible consequences.In her post, St. Clair emphasized that she had refrained from disclosing this information earlier to protect her child’s privacy and safety. However, she stated that tabloid media had begun pursuing the story and would expose it regardless of her intentions. She urged the media to respect her child’s privacy and avoid invasive reporting.Despite the public nature of the claim, Musk has not addressed St. Clair’s statement. He remained active on X following the announcement but did not comment on the matter. The billionaire has a history of keeping aspects of his personal life private, and his silence has fueled further speculation.If St. Clair’s claim is confirmed, the child would be Musk’s 13th. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has fathered children with four different women:This latest claim by St. Clair, if true, would add another child to Musk’s already large family, further cementing his well-documented advocacy for increasing birth rates.Following St. Clair’s post, social media platforms were abuzz with reactions. Some users expressed skepticism, questioning the authenticity of the claim, while others supported her call for privacy. Several prominent figures, including journalists and influencers, weighed in on the controversy.St. Clair later followed up her announcement with another post, stating,The post suggests that she may not engage further on the topic, at least for now. Meanwhile, Musk has continued posting about other topics on X, avoiding direct comments on the matter.Ashley St. Clair is a well-known conservative commentator and influencer. She has built a following through her political views and social media presence. St. Clair has authored books and regularly engages in debates on current affairs.Recently, she was seen at a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden, dressed in Balenciaga, indicating her continued involvement in public events despite her announcement. She also ended a long break from Instagram, posting a picture from former President Donald Trump’s inauguration.Given her political leanings and past interactions on social media, some have speculated about her motives for making this claim public at this particular time. However, without further clarification from either St. Clair or Musk, the full context remains uncertain.","Conservative author Ashley St. Clair claims she gave birth to a child fathered by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.

JPMorgan employs over 317,000 people globally.""Don't waste time on it,"" Dimon said during the meeting, according to a recording reviewed by Reuters. He emphasized that employees have a choice whether to work at JPMorgan, telling staff ""not to be mad at him"" and noting ""it's a free country.""The mandate has sparked widespread complaints on the bank's internal message boards, particularly from back-office workers. Employees have cited concerns about increased commuting and childcare costs, as well as mental health and stress impacts.

He rejected suggestions to let managers decide on in-office requirements, stating there is ""zero chance"" of that happening due to ""extraordinary"" past abuse of flexible arrangements.The CEO's hardline stance aligns with other JPMorgan executives, who wrote in a January memo that being together ""greatly enhances mentoring, learning, brainstorming and getting things done.""Despite employee protests, JPMorgan has given staff 30 days' notice before the full-time office return takes effect. The bank noted that more than half its workforce already comes into the office five days a week, and said it would maintain ""support for flexibility in the workplace"" while implementing the new policy ""in a fair way.""",JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon forcefully dismissed employee resistance to the bank's five-day return-to-office mandate.

The European Union (EU) is scaling back its tech regulations to push investment in artificial intelligence (AI), according to European Commission's digital policy chief Henna Virkkunen . She, however, added that the move is driven by the bloc's own competitive ambitions and not pressure from US Big Tech companies or the Trump administration.Virkkunen told the Financial Times that the EU aims to “help and support” companies navigating AI rules, emphasising the bloc's desire to boost competitiveness and avoid missing out on the transformative potential of AI. She stressed the importance of minimising reporting obligations for European companies.The EU’s AI Act classifies AI technology based on risk levels, with higher-risk categories facing stricter reporting requirements. Powerful AI models like GPT-4 and Gemini also face additional obligations, including increased transparency about their training methods.Brussels needed to ensure “that we are not creating more reporting obligations for our companies”, she said.While some tech companies have expressed concerns about the upcoming code of practice, Virkkunen asserted that the deregulatory efforts are not a concession to these concerns.The commission recently withdrew a planned AI liability directive and stated that an upcoming AI code of practice , expected in April, will limit reporting requirements to the scope of existing AI regulations.“Citizens and businesses have called for a simpler EU that delivers prosperity. This work programme is our answer. We've heard you, we're simplifying, and we will deliver. This roadmap charts our course to a more competitive, resilient, and growth-oriented Europe,” said Ursula von der Leyen , president of the European Commission.This announcement follows criticism from US officials, including comments made at a recent AI summit in Paris where concerns were raised about international rules targeting Big Tech.At Paris AI Summit, US Vice President JD Vance delivered a stark message to European leaders regarding their artificial intelligence regulations, warning that overly restrictive rules could hamper technological progress.In his remarks, Vance specifically criticised content moderation requirements, characterizing them as ""authoritarian censorship.""""We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry,"" Vance told the summit of CEOs and heads of state in Paris, according to a report by news agency Reuters.""We feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship,"" he added.However, Virkkunen insisted the EU’s deregulatory push is independent of US influence, stemming instead from the bloc’s own commitment to cutting bureaucracy and red tape.Virkkunen emphasized that while the EU is open for business, it remains committed to protecting its values and way of life. She affirmed that the EU has no intention of weakening enforcement of its rules governing online platforms, stating that these rules are effective in ensuring a level playing field.“We are open for business, but we also want to make sure that we are protecting our own values and our way of life. Our digital world can’t be a wild west where there are no rules,” Virkkunen said.",European Commission's digital policy chief Henna Virkkunen said the EU aims to “help and support” companies navigating AI rules.

Intel's latest security update has this 'big warning' for AMD and Nvidia customers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intels-latest-security-update-has-this-big-warning-for-amd-and-nvidia-customers/articleshow/118239569.cms,"What Intel said about the security of Nvidia and AMD chips



Intel has called out the security of the products from rival brands AMD and Nvidia. In its Intel Product Safety Report 2024 claims that AMD and Nvidia products have a significantly higher number of security vulnerabilities compared to its offerings. The report alleges that AMD has over four times more firmware vulnerabilities , while Nvidia has 80% more GPU security issues. The report also highlights the performance of Intel's internal security research team and talks about other competitor vulnerabilities.“The goal is not to compare vulnerability counts but to look deeper at the types of vulnerabilities and the foundational technologies they impact,” the company stated in the report.According to the report, AMD had “4.4x more firmware vulnerabilities in their hardware root-of-trust” and “1.8x more firmware vulnerabilities in their confidential computing technologies” compared to Intel. The company also criticised Nvidia in the GPU category, stating that it only had high-severity vulnerabilities (18) in 2024.Apart from this, Intel claimed that AMD discovered only about “57% of reported platform vulnerabilities,” while the remaining 43% were found by security researchers or the public.Additionally, Intel highlighted that AMD has vulnerabilities in its Secure Processor engine that are currently labelled as “No fix planned,” affecting a total of 78 different SKUs.To compare, Intel stated that it has “provided mitigations or solved all hardware root-of-trust vulnerabilities in all supported SKUs.” The company also asserted that all its root-of-trust bugs were “found internally” and emphasised its well-established bug bounty program , though AMD also operates a similar program.Regarding GPU security, Intel claimed to have the fewest vulnerabilities, reporting that only “10 issues” were identified in its GPUs, with just one classified as high or severe, while the rest were considered medium threats.Meanwhile, Nvidia reported “18 security vulnerabilities,” all rated as high severity, with “13 of them potentially allowing a bad actor to execute code on the affected PC.”","Intel Product Safety Report 2024 claims that AMD and Nvidia products have a significantly higher number of security vulnerabilities compared to its offerings.

""Grok 3 has very powerful reasoning capabilities, so in the tests that we've done thus far, Grok 3 is outperforming anything that's been released, that we're aware of, so that's a good sign. We're really in the final stages of publishing Grok 3. It will probably get released in about a week or two, so pretty soon. We think it'll be better than anything else and maybe this might be the last time that any AI is better than Grok,”

What Musk said about OpenAI



“OpenAI has gotten this far while having at least a sort of dual—profit, non-profit role. What they're trying to do now is completely delete the nonprofit and that seems really going too far,”

“Human intelligence I think will be dwarfed by machine intelligence. I'm not sure how to feel about that except that it is it appears to be inevitable that at some point human intelligence will be a very small fraction of total intelligence.

Possible reasons behind Elon Musk's Tesla removal

Elon Musk’s role in the new administration

Some analysts believe that Musk’s involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was created to eliminate excessive federal spending, may have influenced the decision to exclude Tesla.

Industry code misclassification

The original procurement document reportedly listed the contract under the Food Manufacturing category, which was later corrected to Armored Car Services. This discrepancy may have led to a reassessment of the listed vendors.

State department’s final decision

The U.S. government may have ultimately decided to choose other manufacturers, such as BMW, instead of Tesla for its armored electric vehicle fleet.

According to a report by Business Insider, in an internal forum, Bosworth told staffers to either ""quit"" or ""disagree and commit"" to working at the company.Bosworth's remarks were made in response to concerns voiced by employees over the company's new policies and its approach to handling internal Q&A sessions.

He expressed disappointment over the leaks, stating, ""I saw all the angry/sad reactions about the change to the format and I share a sense of loss about it, but I think this makes it clear it was the right call.""One employee criticised the company's recent policy changes, including targeting the LGBTQ community, cutting data-backed DEI programs, and limiting internal free speech. Bosworth responded by saying, ""If your view is 'everyone has to like all the policies we have and if they don't it is appropriate to leak,' then I think you should consider working elsewhere.""Another employee agreed that leaking was unproductive but expressed frustration over the inability to discuss or appeal policy decisions. Bosworth replied, ""You should quit if you feel that way, I mean it,"" emphasising the need for employees to either support the company's direction or find employment elsewhere.Meta's recent policy changes, including the decision to cut ""low-performers"" and adjustments to content moderation, have sparked internal dissent.

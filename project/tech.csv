AI-Powered Future: Next Gen Careers You Should Watch

Economics of AI under scrutiny

Job and humanity at risk





Godfather of AI Geoffrey Hinton is back with another prediction of AI. Hinton believes that AI will lead to massive unemployment. Recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that AI will not lead to mass layoffs, but it will transform the nature of various jobs. On the other hand, Bill Gates feels that humans may soon not be needed “for most things,” while Elon Musk believes most people won’t have to work at all within 20 years. But Godfather of AI feels that all these predictions are overlooking one major reality that AI may cause economic upheaval which may lead to mass unemployment.As reported by Fortune, speaking at the Georgetown University along with Bernie Sanders, Hinton said that the rise of AI could leave millions of workers behind. “It seems very likely to a large number of people that we will get massive unemployment caused by AI,” he said.Hinton further noted that the tech giants are busy investing trillions in data centres and chips and are heavily betting on AI systems which can replace human labor at lower cost. Hinton has become increasingly vocal about what he sees as Big Tech’s misplaced priorities, arguing that the industry is driven more by short-term profits than scientific progress.The financial realities of AI are also becoming a cause of concern. ChatGPT creator OpenAI is not expected to turn a profit until at least 2030 and may need more than $207 billion to sustain growth, according to HSBC estimates.Godfather of AI, who left Google in 2023 in order to speak freely about the risks of AI. He warned that AI will lead to new job creation but it will not offset the scale of losses. “Trying to predict the future of it is going to be very difficult,” he said, likening the uncertainty to driving in fog.Same has Bill Gates, Bernie Sanders also echoed the warnings from tech leaders including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei that AI could displace millions of jobs. “If I’m a factory worker today, if I’m working in an office, how am I going to feed my family? How am I going to pay the rent? Who is talking about that?”Sanders also raised concerns about AI’s impact on human relationships, noting that teenagers increasingly rely on AI companions. “If kids today have AI as their best friends… what kind of change does that mean for humanity?”Sanders also warned about the cooperation between AI companies and the U.S. military could erode privacy. “How far away are we from a small number of people having access to the email that you’ve sent out, every phone call that you’ve been on, really every aspect of your life? We’re not far.”While Gates and Musk envision a future where humans are freed from work, Hinton insists the conversation must also address the social and economic consequences of mass displacement.",Godfather of AI Geoffrey Hinton believes that AI will lead to massive unemployment.

"Half of manufacturers now stop ransomware before encryption, Sophos reports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/half-of-manufacturers-now-stop-ransomware-before-encryption-sophos-reports/articleshow/125772303.cms,"Manufacturers are successfully blocking more ransomware before data gets encrypted, a positive shift. However, cybercriminals are now focusing on stealing data and demanding ransoms without encryption. Despite improved recovery times and reduced costs, a significant number still pay, highlighting the evolving threat landscape and internal security challenges.

Recovery improves despite ongoing threats





Manufacturing companies are stopping more ransomware attacks before encryption occurs, but cybercriminals are responding by increasingly stealing data and resorting to extortion-only tactics, according to a new Sophos report.The study found that only 40% of attacks on manufacturers resulted in data encryption—the lowest level in five years and a sharp drop from 74% last year. However, this defensive progress comes with a caveat: extortion-only attacks surged to 10% from just 3% in 2024, as attackers pivot their strategies to maintain leverage over victims.The report, based on a survey of 332 manufacturing organizations hit by ransomware in the past year, revealed that half of manufacturers successfully stopped attacks before encryption could occur—more than double last year's 24%. Despite this improvement, 51% of affected organizations still paid ransoms, with a median payment of $1 million against demands averaging $1.2 million.Recovery metrics showed positive trends, with 58% of manufacturers fully recovering within one week, up from 44% previously. Average recovery costs, excluding ransom payments, declined 24% to $1.3 million.Sophos X-Ops identified Akira, Qilin, and PLAY as the most active ransomware groups targeting manufacturing over the past year, with 99 distinct threat groups observed across leak sites.Data theft remained a significant concern, affecting 39% of manufacturers who experienced encryption—one of the highest rates across all sectors surveyed.Internal vulnerabilities continue to plague the industry, with 42.5% of organizations citing lack of expertise, 41.6% pointing to unknown security gaps, and 41% identifying inadequate protection as contributing factors.The human toll was also evident: 47% of manufacturers reported increased team stress following encryption incidents, while 44% faced increased pressure from senior leadership and 27% experienced leadership changes as a result of attacks.","Manufacturing companies are stopping more ransomware attacks before encryption occurs.

Under Fire Over ‘Kill All’ Order, Hegseth TORCHES Narco-terrorists At Pentagon Xmas Tree Lighting

The Signal chats and The Atlantic leak





A Pentagon inspector general investigation has concluded that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth placed U.S. personnel and their mission at risk by using the Signal messaging app to transmit sensitive details regarding a military strike against Houthi militants in Yemen, according to two people familiar with the findings who spoke to The Associated Press. While the report found that Hegseth violated Pentagon policy by conducting official business on a personal device, it did not conclude that he improperly declassified material, noting his broad authority as Defense Secretary to do so.According to the sources speaking to the news agency AP, the watchdog found that Hegseth shared operational details—including exact timings of warplane launches and bomb drops—before the pilots conducting the strikes were even airborne.Pentagon Chief Spokesman Sean Parnell stated: ""The Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along - no classified information was shared. This matter is resolved, and the case is closed."" The White House also signaled its support, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stating that President Donald Trump ""stands by"" Hegseth, noting the probe confirmed that operational security was not compromised.Hegseth’s use of the encrypted app -- which is not authorized for classified military communications—faced scrutiny after journalist Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic was inadvertently added to a chat thread by then-National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.The chat, intended to discuss March 15 operations against Iran-backed Houthis, included high-profile officials such as Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.In addition to this group, report says that Hegseth created a separate Signal chat with 13 people, including his wife and brother, where he shared similar specific details about the impending strikes.Multiple current and former military officials told the AP that sharing such specific details on an unsecured device, particularly regarding ""strike windows"" and ""target terrorists"" before an attack occurred, would typically be strictly prohibited.The investigation faced hurdles regarding evidence collection. One source told the AP that the Inspector General had to rely on screenshots of the chat published by The Atlantic because Hegseth could not provide more than a handful of his own messages.Furthermore, Hegseth declined to be interviewed by the Pentagon’s inspector general. Instead, he provided a written statement asserting he was permitted to declassify information as he saw fit and believed the details he shared would not endanger the mission.The report was delivered to lawmakers in a classified setting, with a redacted public version expected later this week. The findings have intensified partisan divides regarding Hegseth’s leadership.","Pentagon inspector general finds Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth violated Pentagon policy by using Signal messaging app to transmit sensitive details about a military strike against Houthi militants in Yemen.

From Mars to Moon: Change in priorities for Isaacman





Jared Isaacman, US President Donald Trump's NASA administrator nominee has made a 'China promise' to Americans. Trump's two-time appointee to lead NASA has said that it was his goal that the United States beat rival China in the race to return humans to the Moon, during a Senate confirmation hearing. The 42-year-old billionaire entrepreneur and private astronaut appeared during a rare second confirmation hearing that followed Trump's re-nomination of him in November for the top post at the US space agency.Isaacman reportedly told Senators that, if confirmed for the job, he would ensure the success of the Artemis lunar exploration program started in 2017, during Trump's first administration. ""America will return to the Moon before our great rival (China), and we will establish an enduring presence to understand and realize the scientific, economic and national security value on the lunar surface,"" Isaacman said. Isaacman also committed to ensuring that there is no gap between the retirement of the International Space Station (ISS) and commercial Low Earth Orbit destinations. ""We can never accept a gap in our capabilities again,"" said soon-to-be NASA head, ""Not in Low Earth Orbit, or in our ability to reach the Moon.""NASA's Artemis program to return to the Moon, however, has faced numerous delays in recent years. Experts warned in September that the lunar lander developed by Musk's SpaceX might not be ready in time.Such a complication would put the United States at risk of being overtaken by China, which also aims to reach the Moon by 2030. ""I think it's imperative that we do so, and failing to do so calls into question American exceptionalism beyond just our expertise in the high ground of space,"" Isaacman said.During his first confirmation hearing in April, Isaacman reportedly stated that he wanted to prioritize sending astronauts to Mars. however, this week, he spoke more cautiously about Mars and more strongly emphasized the goal of returning a manned US mission to the Moon as soon as possible.Isaacman is a close associate of Tesla CEO Elon Musk . In fact, Isaacman nomination is said to reflect the Trump's on-again, off-again relationship with Musk, the world's richest man and founder of SpaceX, among other ventures. Trump's decision to withdraw Isaacman's first nomination took place as the president feuded in the spring with Musk, who had headed Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trump and Musk appear to have since reconciled.Since the rift between the US president and Elon Musk, who has openly spoken about his plans for the red planet, US authorities have been emphasizing their determination to outpace Beijing in what they call the ""second space race."" If confirmed to head NASA, Isaacman would need to ensure that SpaceX delivers the lunar lander on time.Asked about a potential conflict of interest with Musk, with whom he is reportedly very close, Isaacman assured that he maintains only professional relations with him. ""Senators, I'm not here for a personal gain to favor or enrich contractors,"" Isaacman reportedly said.","Jared Isaacman, US President Donald Trump's NASA administrator nominee has made a 'China promise' to Americans.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment. The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.",AI startup OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124805693,imgsize-7992,width-400,resizemode-4/x-twitter.jpg"

Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees. The ad-supported service is expected to provide users with access to:The company is reportedly testing a model where users will view approximately two minutes of pre-roll advertisements before a game starts streaming. Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there’s anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.Another employee, David Luehmann, a director of game development at the studio, also posted on LinkedIn, saying, ""After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down.""“I am very proud of all the people, work, and games we've released. I wish you could see what we had cooking! There are many talented people that have been impacted by this.

Donald Trump's Stricter H-1B Visa Rule Hits Indian Talent, Background Check Screening Expanded

India to become the world’s largest hub for AI skills





Recent changes to the America's H-1B visa programme are unlikely to significantly disrupt large Indian IT services companies, despite initial industry concerns, Nasscom president Rajesh Nambiar told The Economic Times. Nambiar said that major companies have already reduced dependence on H-1B visas over the years through increased local hiring in the United States. He also welcomed a clarification that international students in the U.S. on Optional Practical Training (OPT) extensions will be exempt from a proposed $100,000 visa fee.Another proposed shift — prioritising specialised, high-salary roles in the annual H-1B lottery — could raise visa costs, but the overall impact on IT services exporters will be “very minimal,” he said. Companies will continue to use H-1Bs for niche roles, he added, noting that the one-year window before the 2026 lottery gives firms time to ramp up domestic hiring. ""Lot of local hiring already began several years ago. Good news is that we have a one year timeframe -- from the time it was announced to when the 2026 lottery will happen. This timeframe is enough for companies to ramp up (local hiring) because it's important,"" he added.While the United States will continue to be the Indian IT industry’s largest market, Nambiar expects newer regions such as Germany to offer growing opportunities.Startups — especially those in AI — face tougher challenges under stricter U.S. visa rules and global competition for specialised talent. Nambiar said emerging companies are increasingly turning to hybrid models, combining local hiring in overseas markets with remote execution from India.Beyond visa policies, Nambiar highlighted deeper structural changes underway in the global technology sector, driven by artificial intelligence and workforce transformation. Companies are increasingly reskilling employees for AI-enabled roles as older skill sets lose relevance. With a 6-million-strong tech talent base, India is well positioned to become the world’s largest hub for AI skills, he said, provided industry, academia and the government work in tandem.The talent mix in the sector is also shifting. While 65–70% of engineering graduates still specialise in computer science or related fields, Nambiar said future demand will favour professionals who combine technical expertise with domain knowledge and AI application skills. The industry added 30,000–40,000 fresh graduates in the first half of the fiscal year, though employment growth continues to lag revenue expansion as productivity rises with AI adoption.Despite rapid advances in automation, he stressed that human expertise remains indispensable. As with enterprise software rollouts like ERP, AI adoption in large organisations will require significant integration and oversight. “Humans remain central,” he said.","Recent changes to the America's H-1B visa programme are unlikely to significantly disrupt large Indian IT services companies.

Meta faces investigation in EU over WhatsApp 'banning' AI chatbots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-faces-investigation-in-eu-over-whatsapp-banning-ai-chatbots/articleshow/125772419.cms,"European regulators have launched a probe into Meta's move to block third-party AI services from its WhatsApp business tools, suspecting an abuse of dominance. This policy, effective early next year, favors Meta's own AI while forcing rivals like ChatGPT and Copilot out. Authorities aim to protect competition in the burgeoning AI sector.

ChatGPT and Copilot among services affected

EU’s investigation mirrors Italian antitrust probe





The European Commission launched a formal antitrust investigation into Meta Platforms' policy restricting third-party artificial intelligence providers from accessing WhatsApp 's business messaging tools, raising concerns the tech giant may be abusing its dominant position to favor its own AI service.The investigation centers on Meta's October 2025 policy change that prohibits AI companies from using the WhatsApp Business Solution when artificial intelligence is their primary offering. The restrictions take effect January 15, 2026 for existing AI providers, while new providers have been blocked since October 15, 2025. Meta's own AI assistant, Meta AI, remains accessible on the platform.EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera emphasized the need to prevent dominant digital companies from crowding out innovative competitors, stating regulators must act quickly to prevent irreparable harm to competition in the rapidly expanding AI sector.The policy change has already forced major AI providers to exit WhatsApp. OpenAI 's ChatGPT, which served over 50 million users on the platform, and Microsoft's Copilot both announced they will cease WhatsApp operations by the January deadline. Other third-party AI assistants are expected to follow, leaving Meta AI as the sole chatbot option on the messaging service.Companies can still use AI for secondary functions like automated customer support, but not when AI technology constitutes their core product offering.The Commission's investigation will cover the European Economic Area except Italy, where competition authorities are already pursuing separate proceedings against Meta's conduct. The probe examines whether Meta's restrictions violate Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which prohibits abuse of dominant market position.Meta dismissed the investigation as ""baseless,"" claiming AI chatbots strain systems not designed to support them and asserting the AI market remains highly competitive. The company has not announced changes to its policy despite the regulatory scrutiny.The investigation has no fixed deadline, with duration depending on case complexity and Meta's cooperation with regulators.",European Commission launches formal antitrust investigation into Meta Platforms' policy restricting third-party artificial intelligence providers from accessing WhatsApp's business messaging tools.

Finternet picks capital markets for first rollout in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/finternet-picks-capital-markets-for-first-rollout-in-2026/articleshow/125772295.cms,"



Bengaluru: Finternet, India’s next big DPI (digital public infrastructure) after UPI, will launch in the capital markets next year, starting with regulated financial assets. More complex areas, including land and real estate, will follow, Principal architect Siddharth Shetty told TOI. The Nandan Nilekani-backed project, built on a Bank for International Settlements blueprint for “unified ledgers”, aims to go live with its first applications next year and ultimately connect tokenised money, securities, and other assets across borders. Nilekani announced the timeline in October at the Global Fintech Fest 2025 in Mumbai. Unified ledgers are shared, programmable platforms that hold tokenised money and financial assets in the same place so they can transact and settle together in real time under common rules. This sequencing marks a pragmatic shift from the headline-grabbing idea of tokenising India’s vast property market, which Nilekani described as a way to “unlock locked assets” in the economy.Regulators and market participants see capital markets as the lower-hanging fruit: titles are clearer, issuers and investors are already highly regulated, and tokenisation pilots, from on-chain fund units to CBDC-based settlement, are underway within the existing securities framework.Shetty described Finternet as an “operating system” for finance, replacing today’s patchwork of siloed rails where “we build a separate road for each car”. In the new design, a single wallet would hold both identity credentials and tokenised assets, allowing individuals and businesses to move seamlessly between apps for property, credit, or investments while using the same underlying infrastructure. That “universal stack,” he argued, would enable AI agents or MSME platforms to tap multiple lenders or investors programmatically, instead of depending on bespoke integrations for one product at a time. “In traditional financial infrastructure, your assets are locked inside one system. Tokenisation is about letting that asset move with you, so an MSME can connect a single invoice to a universe of lenders instead of doing one-off integrations each time,” Shetty said. On land tokenisation, however, Shetty remains cautious. He expects commercial real estate and new primary projects with clean title records to adopt the model first, while legacy residential properties, especially in states with complex title histories, will take much longer. Land remains a state subject, implying a patchwork of early-mover states and laggards rather than a single national rollout. That political and legal complexity is a key reason for capital markets to be the first proving ground.Despite its multi-trillion-dollar ambition, Finternet is currently being built by a roughly 10-member “network of labs” across India, the US, Singapore, and Switzerland, with protocols designed to be asset- and jurisdiction-agnostic from day one. The goal, according to Nilekani and BIS researchers, is a global “network of financial ecosystems” where tokenized assets and programmable money move as easily as data packets on the internet, starting with securities in India’s capital markets before extending to land, gold, and cross-border retail flows.","Finternet, India’s next big DPI (digital public infrastructure) after UPI, will launch in the capital markets next year, starting with regulated financial assets.

Dream11 pivots to a second screen sports platform,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dream11-pivots-to-a-second-screen-sports-platform/articleshow/125772219.cms,"



Bengaluru: India’s fantasy sports giant, Dream11 , is reinventing itself as a second-screen platform for live sports. It is pitching a new watch-along app that sits alongside broadcasters such as JioCinema and Disney+ Hotstar, rather than streaming matches itself.India’s Online Gaming Bill, passed in August, effectively outlawed Dream11’s core business overnight by imposing a blanket ban on real-money online games, including fantasy sports, poker, and rummy, and barring banks and UPI from processing any such transactions. The legislation explicitly overrode earlier court rulings that treated fantasy as a skill game and carries jail terms and crore-level fines for companies, promoters, and even endorsers who continue to offer money-based contests.Harsh Jain, co-founder and chief executive of parent Dream Sports, told reporters that the new Dream11 is designed as a “second screen dominator experience” that becomes “the best friend” of first-screen broadcasters, much as fantasy sports once boosted viewership. Instead of paid contests, the app hosts live watch-along rooms where creators provide partisan commentary and banter while users track integrated scoreboards, chat, buy virtual shout-outs, or pay to join influencers on stage.“We are moving away from the whole gaming piece altogether,” Jain said, stressing that even where Dream Sports owns rights through its streaming service FanCode, “we will not show their streams” on the new app because it is “meant to be a second-screen sports entertainment platform.”He argued that fantasy sports had a “very positive effect” on viewership and that second-screen engagement can lift sports consumption sharply compared with passive TV watching. The company is launching with around 25 curated creators but plans to open the platform over time, betting that Dream11’s 20-30 million monthly free-to-play users will give influencers instant audiences that rival or exceed watch-along streams on YouTube and Twitch. “No creator wants to come and go live with like 10 people watching,” Jain said. “We have a chance that when we go live for the first match, any creator can come and see a hundred thousand people, maybe a million people have watched them.” Jain cast the product as a fix for what he called the “broken experience” of watching matches alone in a world of nuclear families and scattered friend groups. Fans, he said, want to “watch a match alone at home” but “never want to watch it actually alone,” and are now using WhatsApp, X, and Instagram as crude workarounds.The new Dream11 aims to capture that energy in one place, letting users “watch a match alone together” with the funny or outspoken voices they wish official commentators could be.","India’s fantasy sports giant, Dream11, is reinventing itself as a second-screen platform for live sports.

“So what it does is sucks up moon dust and it extracts the heat from it so it can be used as an energy source, like turning moon dust into a battery.

How AI was used to develop Blue Origin’s moon dust battery

""Within that playground, AI can generate to its heart's content,""

""In the case of Blue Origin's moon battery, [it] doesn't tell you the design was a good one, but it tells us that all of the requirements were met, the standards were met, things like that that you got to check before you go operational,""





Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is planning to use moon dust to power its rockets. The Amazon founder-owned rocket company that competes with Elon Musk’s SpaceX has unveiled a new artificial intelligence (AI) powered device that can convert moon dust into an energy source. This lunar vacuum, which was presented at Amazon’s ReInvent 2025 conference in Las Vegas, was developed using technology from the startup Istari Digital. Will Roper, the startup’s CEO, explained that the device works by sucking up moon dust and extracting its heat, effectively converting the dust into a battery-like power source.This technology is critical for overcoming the challenges posed by the two-week-long lunar night (which occurs every 28 days). This is a period when the moon goes into darkness, and its surface experiences extreme temperature drops. This period typically damages or disables spacecraft hardware operating on the Moon’s surface, as it lacks a robust, long-lasting power supply.In a statement to CNBC, Roper said,Roper, who served as assistant secretary of the Air Force during President Donald Trump's first term, said that the battery was designed entirely using AI. He is also recognised for changing how the Air Force and the newly formed Space Force buy and develop equipment.A key part of Istari's technological advancement is its ability to control and reduce AI hallucinations, which occur when AI makes up false information.Roper explained that the platform takes all the requirements a part needs and creates boundaries or athat the AI cannot cross while creating designs.he explained.Roger added.Istari is supported financially by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and already partners with the US government. The startup has been serving as the main contractor for Lockheed Martin on the experimental X-56A unmanned aircraft.","Blue Origin is developing an AI-powered device to convert moon dust into a power source, tackling the challenge of the two-week lunar night.

Paramount writes letter to Warner Bros. Discovery on sale process: ‘It has become increasingly clear…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/paramount-writes-letter-to-warner-bros-discovery-on-sale-process-it-has-become-increasingly-clear/articleshow/125769963.cms,"Warner Bros Discovery (File Image)

Read letter sent by Paramount Skydance to Warner Bros. Discovery



Dear Mr. Zaslav: We write on behalf of

Paramount Skydance Corporation

(“Paramount”, “we” or “us”) to express our serious concerns about the fairness and adequacy of the bidding process for a potential combination with Warner Bros. Discovery (“WBD” or “you”). It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder. We specifically request and expect this letter will be shared and discussed with the full board of directors of WBD.

We have recently seen reporting in the U.S. and foreign media that gives serious cause for concern. The German newspaper Handelsblatt recently reported on a meeting that reportedly took place in Brussels between Gerhard Zieler, President of WBD’s International Business and a direct report to WBD’s Chief Executive Officer, who “arrived with a three-person team,” with the E.U. Commission Vice President Hena Virkkunen, to discuss the potential merger prospects for WBD. In that conversation, the article reports that “concerns were raised that the Ellison family’s planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery could lead to excessive media concentration,” and that the E.U. Commission would consider intervening in a potential merger with Paramount for this reason. The article quotes “sources close” to

Zeiler

as saying “that the talks with the Commission were important because both Warner and the EU wanted to preserve media diversity.” The implications of such a meeting, if it occurred, are clear and evince a tacit resistance to, if not active sabotage of, a Paramount offer.

While this report is concerning in itself, this is not an isolated report regarding purported WBD resistance to a combination with Paramount. Several U.S. media outlets have reported on the enthusiasm by WBD management for a transaction with Netflix, and on statements by management that a transaction between WBD and Netflix would be a “slam dunk,” while also referring to Paramount’s bid in a negative light. Additional reporting since the submission of revised bids on December 1 has indicated that WBD’s “board has really warmed to” a transaction with Netflix due to the “chemistry between” WBD management and Netflix management. We have come to you first to inquire whether this reporting is accurate, and to engage in a productive discussion with you around any actual or perceived issues that it may reflect.

Moreover, these media reports echo similar indications that we have been hearing throughout this process, despite what we viewed as otherwise productive conversations that we have had with WBD leadership. Paramount has a credible basis to believe that the sales process has been tainted by management conflicts, including certain members of management’s potential personal interests in post-transaction roles and compensation as a result of the economic incentives embedded in recent amendments to employment arrangements. These concerns are amplified by indications of director bias and beholdenness to others whose interests may not align with the stockholders’, and the fact that alternatives involving only certain WBD assets are being prioritized notwithstanding their heightened regulatory risk and potential to deprive stockholders of consideration for the entirety of WBD’s enterprise value.

Further, as you know, Paramount agreed to certain standstill arrangements in exchange for the opportunity to participate in a truly competitive and unbiased bidding process. Paramount did not bargain for WBD to foster, whether intentionally or unintentionally, a tilted and unfair process. We believe that all parties to this process should have a shared desire for, and will mutually benefit from, an unimpeachable transaction process. As we assume you agree, even discounting the accuracy of any media reports, just the appearance of a flawed process imperils any potential transaction that might result and may undermine the potential value maximization to WBD stockholders from any prospective transaction.

In light of our grave concerns regarding the integrity of WBD’s process, we seek confirmation as to whether WBD has appointed an independent special committee of disinterested members of its board to consider the potential transaction opportunities and to make a final determination regarding a sale or break-up of all or part of the company. If not, we strongly urge you to empower such a special committee comprised of directors with no potential appearance of bias or beholdenness to others whose interests may differ from those of the stockholders. This would seem to be an important step at this stage, to ensure the fairness and unimpeachability of the transaction process and to maximize the value of whatever outcome WBD determines to pursue. Engaging with WBD throughout this process, we have been encouraged by the enormous potential from a combination of our entities. We remain confident that the Paramount offer would provide the maximum value to WBD stockholders and look forward to the opportunity to continue to engage with you productively in this process. But at this point we must insist on assurances and steps taken to ensure that a truly fair and independent process is being conducted, both for Paramount’s benefit and in the interest of WBD’s stockholders.





Paramount Skydance has formally challenged the handling of the sale process for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) assets, expressing concerns over the fairness of the competition. In a letter, attorneys for Paramount informed WBD CEO David Zaslav that the company is questioning the “fairness and adequacy” of the sale process, which officially started in October.The letter, seen by CNBC, raised concerns regarding media reports suggesting that WBD's management appears to be favouring the offer submitted by Netflix. The letter comes after the second-round bids in which Paramount, Netflix and Comcast submitted offers to acquire some or all of WBD’s assets. Citing sources close to the confidential proceedings, all three companies increased their bids from their initial offers, with Netflix’s bid primarily consisting of cash.",Paramount Skydance sent letter to Warner Bros.

Intel has said that it is shelving plans to spin off or sell a stake in its Networking and Edge Group (NEX) division. The chipmaker said that it is now best positioned to succeed as an internal unit. The decision marks a reversal of a strategy announced earlier this year. The company said it would separate the division and identify strategic investors.“After a thorough review of strategic options for NEX—including a potential standalone path—we determined the business is best positioned to succeed within Intel,” the company said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg.The company previously sought to sell non-core assets, including NEX, to give a boost to its finances after it struggled to keep pace with rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Comapny (TSMC) and Samsung Electronics.“Keeping NEX in-house enables tighter integration between silicon, software and systems, strengthening customer offerings across AI, data center, and edge. As part of the move, Intel ended talks with Ericsson AB, which had discussed buying a stake in NEX,” a spokesperson was quoted as saying. Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson relies heavily on Intel-designed chips for several of its mobile network products and had been seeking to ensure the NEX division remained viable.The change in selling strategy comes months after CEO Lip-Bu Tan took the helm in March. While Tan initially focused on cost-cutting measures, including job cuts and offloading non-core assets, the company’s recent influx of capital appears to have altered its trajectory.Intel has received major financial boosts this year, including a 10% equity stake taken by the US government in August, brokered by the Trump administration. It also got a $2 billion investment from SoftBank Group Corp and an additional $5 billion investment from Nvidia.

Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Robots with a built-in expiry date

A moment that reflects our digital era









At Art Basel Miami, one of the world’s biggest and flashiest art fairs, a strange group of robotic dogs has become the biggest attraction. These dogs are not ordinary machines. They wear lifelike silicone faces of famous people including Elon Musk Jeff Bezos , Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso and even the artist Beeple himself. They walk around, blink, and sometimes lean back to “poop” printed artworks. The installation, called Regular Animals, mixes humour, technology and social commentary, and it is almost impossible to walk past without staring.On opening day, crowds gathered around the pen where the robot dogs wandered about. People laughed, filmed on their phones and reacted with shock and confusion. The Musk robot puckered its lips, the Picasso robot gazed into space, and the Beeple robot stopped mid-walk to drop a freshly printed NFT for visitors to take.Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, stood inside the enclosure picking up the printed artworks and handing them to the audience. These prints are not just souvenirs. They are NFTs stored on the blockchain, continuing Beeple’s interest in digital art and how technology shapes creativity.“They are constantly taking pictures and reinterpreting the world through the lens of these different characters,” Winkelmann explained.Each robot sees the world differently, depending on the style of the person it represents, whether that is Warhol’s bright colours, Picasso’s abstract shapes or the digital influence of tech billionaires.The Musk, Zuckerberg and Bezos robots highlight Beeple’s point about how much power tech leaders have over what billions of people see online. By turning them into robot dogs, he turns that idea into something funny, strange and slightly unsettling.Beeple became world-famous in 2021 when his digital collage Everydays: The First 5000 Days sold for 69.3 million dollars at Christie’s, making him one of the most valuable living artists. The NFT market later crashed, which Beeple himself predicted, saying there had been far too much low-quality work at the time.But digital art has continued to grow. Art Basel’s 2025 report says the field is expanding again, and the fair has a new section called Zero 10 dedicated to digital and tech-based art. This is where Regular Animals has become the most talked-about installation.Visitors reacted in very different ways. Some called it disgusting or disturbing. Others found it brilliant and hilarious. At one point, two real dogs wandered into the area and barked at the robotic versions, which amused the crowd even more.Beeple designed the robots with a limited lifespan. Their main function, which is to take photos and turn them into NFTs, will stop after three years. They will still be able to walk, but their creative output will end. It is a reminder of how fast technology ages and becomes outdated.Despite that, all the robots were sold within the first hour of the fair. Soon, small versions of the Zuckerbergs, Musks and Warhols will be living in private homes, occasionally producing NFTs as they move around.Beeple’s installation captures the strange way art, technology and culture mix in 2025. It is funny, weird and clever, and it forces people to think about how much influence tech giants have over modern life.Beeple’s installation warns, “We are not ready for the future.” Judging from the shocked faces, laughter and constant filming at Art Basel Miami, that message seems to be landing exactly as he intended.","Beeple’s installation captures the strange way art, technology and culture mix in 2025.

Why Yann LeCun thinks Meta won’t invest in his startup

“Our best AI systems can pass the bar exam, write code. But we still don’t have a robot that can do what a five-year-old can. We are missing something big,”

“But what’s happened in the last few months is that we [Mark Zuckerberg and him] both realised that the spectrum of applications, this was kind of beyond what Meta was interested in,”





Yann LeCun has already confirmed he is leaving Meta Platforms at the end of the year. Also known as one of the godfathers of artificial intelligence, or AI, LeCun is said to exit the Facebook-parent to launch his own AI company, which could be based in Paris. LeCun, who is focused on what he describes as advanced machine intelligence, added that Meta will not be a financial backer of his new, unnamed start-up to clarify his earlier description of the social media giant as aLeCun said, explaining the reason for setting up the startup outside the US.Speaking at the recent AI-Pulse event in Paris, LeCun said his startup will focus on aapproach, which is a form of AI trained on visual and sensory information to make predictions about the physical world. His startup will provide an alternative to the dominant generative AI tools, such as large language models (LLMs).LeCun seems increasingly frustrated by the attention Meta and others are paying to LLMs, which operate by guessing what comes next. Meanwhile, world models do just what the name implies. They try to predict what will happen in the real world, things like how objects or people will move. This approach is helpful for AI systems that interact with the physical world, such as robots and self-driving cars.LeCun explained.At Meta, LeCun leads a research lab and is recognised as one of the early pioneers of AI. He said he would provide more details about his startup in January. The technology could be used in robotics and industrial environments, he noted.Even though LeCun is leaving Meta to launch the initiative, he said Mark Zuckerberg , the company's founder and chief executive, supports the project.he added.","Yann LeCun is leaving Meta Platforms at the end of the year.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

OpenAI acquires Neptune amid IPO preparations









ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has reached an agreement to acquire Neptune, a startup specialising in providing tools that help companies track, manage and debug their AI model training processes. Notably, OpenAI is already a key customer of Neptune, which also has several major global corporations among its clients, including Samsung, Roche and HP.“We’re excited to share that OpenAI has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire neptune.ai, strengthening the tools and infrastructure that support progress in frontier research,” the company said in an announcement.“Training advanced AI models is a creative, exploratory process that depends on seeing how a model evolves in real time. Neptune gives researchers a clear and dependable way to track experiments, monitor training, and understand complex model behavior as it happens,” it added.According to a report by news agency Reuters, while the financial terms of the deal were not officially disclosed by OpenAI, The Information reported the acquisition is valued at less than $400 million in stock, citing sources familiar with the transaction.The acquisition is expected to integrate Neptune's technology directly into OpenAI’s core infrastructure.“From its beginning, the Neptune team focused on supporting the hands-on, iterative work of model development. More recently, Neptune has worked closely with OpenAI to develop tools that enable researchers to compare thousands of runs, analyze metrics across layers, and surface issues. Neptune’s depth in this area will help us move faster, learn more from each experiment, and make better decisions throughout the training process,” OpenAI added.The acquisition comes as the Sam Altman-led OpenAI continues to expand its operations and financial footprint. The company reached a valuation of $500 billion in October following a significant share sale by current and former employees.OpenAI recently engaged in other strategic deals, including taking a stake in Thrive Holdings to embed AI into traditional industries like accounting and IT services.","OpenAI has reached an agreement to acquire Neptune, a startup specialising in providing tools that help companies track, manage and debug their AI model training processes.

""If you are massively dyslexic, you cannot play a playbook. There is no playbook a dyslexic can master. And therefore we learn to think freely,”

How dyslexia shaped various aspects of Palantir and Alex Karp’s life

“The far right hates that I grew up in a Jewish family and defend Jews against the most disgusting and obvious vehement attacks. And the far left thinks because of my background, I should somehow give up real progressive thought and support ideologies that only hurt the people they claim to support.”

“be difficult.”

“We cultivate minds by being exceedingly difficult,”





Palantir CEO Alex Karp has opened up about how his learning disability helped him create the company. Karp, CEO of the $415 billion Silicon Valley defence tech powerhouse, labeled his lifelong battle with dyslexia as the ""formative moment"" driving his success and divergent business model. Speaking during the New York Times DealBook Summit, Karp said his learning difference had made it impossible not to think differently. He observed that an inability to learn in a standard way had prohibited him from adopting typical business strategies.Karp explained.He specifically underlined that, instead of his advanced degree or the most famous co-founder, Peter Thiel, this neurological necessity is really the engine behind his extraordinary success and the unusual culture of Palantir.This independent thinking is a reflection of how Karp is viewed in society. He said that his background puzzles people with extreme political viewpoints. Karp said:also defines Palantir's identity. Founded in 2003, the company makes data-analysis software first for US spy agencies and now for businesses. Its workplace culture melds three elements: government security contractor, tech startup, and intellectual think-tank.This reflects Karp's own style of challenging popular ideas and working intensely. He has always argued that Silicon Valley was wrong to avoid working with the military, saying democratic governments should use the best technology available.Karp's stance garnered both criticism and distinction for the company. Palantir reached a more than 140% leap in stock price in the last year due to huge demand for its AI systems and profitable contracts with the US government and Israeli military. Palantir now ranks among America's 30 most valuable companies, which it achieved by choosing a different path from other tech firms.Karp believes that this different approach comes from how his brain works. He described aof his condition, anhe explained.However, he admitted that the gap used to be a big weakness, though he now thinks it helped Palantir grow and become a leading tech company, while many people just saw it as a problem.Karp described.He suggested that the drive to succeed at Palantir is based on fostering independent thinkers, embracing disagreement and debate, and not being afraid toKarp added.","Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir, said his learning disability made it impossible not to think differently.

Australia’s internet regulator has said that the country’s ban on social media access for children under the age of 16 will be the first crucial step in a global effort to curb the influence of major technology companies like Meta (Instagram, Facebook, and Threads), TikTok, Snap’s Snapchat, and Alphabet’s YouTube.“We’ve reached a tipping point,” According to eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant stated at the Sydney Dialogue cyber summit. Notably, she initially had concerns about the “blunt-force” nature of the ban but now fully supports it after incremental changes proved ineffective in regulating platforms.“Our data is the currency that fuels these companies, and there are these powerful, harmful, deceptive design features that even adults are powerless to fight against. What chance do our children have?” she said, as per news agency Reuters.As per Grant, the Australian legislation is the “first domino” in a global regulatory shift. She noted that governments worldwide are closely observing its implementation. She even suggested that this global domino effect may be the reason why platforms “pushed back” against the law so strongly.The pushback included lobbying efforts that reached the US government, the report said.Inman Grant revealed that she has been asked to testify at the U.S. congressional House Judiciary regarding what some critics have termed an attempt to exert extra-territorial power over American free speech.The Australian law is set to take effect on December 10. Ahead of the deadline, the Big Tech social media platforms have agreed to comply. The eSafety Commissioner reported that approximately 96% of Australian teenagers under 16, which is over a million users, have social media accounts.

""Great Reset.""

“do good,”

""social justice and climate change""

Read what Google founder Sergey Brin’s ex-wife Nicole Shanahan said about ‘tech wife mafia’

I think at the heart of the progressive billionaire wife mafia is a genuine desire to want to be liked, to give back and to be celebrated for doing good work.

And there is an ego, a belief that they were brought up in a certain way. Many are highly educated, with professional backgrounds and great degrees from great institutions. But then the wealth sets in. If you think about the trajectory these women take once the wealth comes in, it usually doesn't come from their tech-husband being an exceptional entrepreneur.

It's because the government helped fund their husband at some point along the way. If you look at the history of Google, Facebook or

Apple

, not so much

Amazon

, but even HP or

Oracle

.

These companies didn't just spring up out of nowhere; they got institutional backing at some point, in the case of, you know, Facebook and Google, especially, where a lot of these tech wife mafia folks come from.

There's this Silicon Valley-Stanford network, and if you look at where some of those grants or money came from, especially early money and then accelerated money. It came from individuals who had government ties. And so these companies also serve government functions.

Like Google really was involved with the government in helping identify behaviour on the internet and Facebook as well. And so it's no surprise that the intertwining between the Democratic Party, which is so prevalent in California, and these companies has just always been there. That synergy and that relationship have always been there.

The wives are not necessarily bad people, but their worlds are so small, and they actually have no idea how small those worlds are until you do, because they can't break free of them. And they feel the need to contribute to these causes within that tiny sphere of influence. And that's their only litmus test: ‘Am I valuable, or am I not?’

Then, what happened around the pandemic is that this whole other segment, which I don't think many of the tech mafia wives realise, is that they were used to set the groundwork for what was called the reset. What is generally called the Great Reset.

So the tech wife mafias were being conscripted in many ways, and their money, mainly, was being conscripted to set the groundwork for the Great Reset, specifically through a network of non-NGO advisors, relationships with Hollywood, relationships with Davos and their own companies.

So if you look at who's on these boards, who hangs out with each other, how this culture of tech wealth works, like

Silicon Valley

tech wealth, in that small group of people responsible for a huge amount of money and a huge amount of my

NGO

activity across the US, it's a really small group of people making these decisions.

And then completely blind to everything else that's going on and to how their groundwork is being used to enable these other policies, including the significant reset policies.

Now, what this group of women doesn't realise is that, in their haste, they're all swamped. They have multiple properties. They have tons of staff. They have staff issues, chronic staff issues. Um, their kids are busy. Their kids often have some health issues as well. Um, a lot of them have relationship issues with their husbands. And a lot of them themselves are like medicated on SSRIs and anti-depressants and all of that because it's just overwhelming. So it's chaos, and these women find their meaning through their philanthropic work.

They find themselves as I would find myself: my self-worth was my philanthropic work. And I really believed in it. I really believe that I was giving black communities a chance to rise out of oppression. And I was helping indigenous communities rise up out of oppression. And now that I look back and see how all those grants were performing, because my version of success is that those communities are actually uplifted.

The problems of the community have gotten worse. Crime in the community has gotten worse. Mental health in the native community, the indigenous community has gotten worse. They will even say, the indigenous community will even say that their biggest supporters in Congress have been Republicans, but yet they continue to vote Democrat. Yeah. Right. I mean, that is what this is. It's like the whole model is broken. The entire model makes everybody worse off.

And now we're contending with the freaking great reset, which we're realising is a terrible idea. That many of our climate change issues are geoengineering issues.

Which is like, at the end of the day, they always go to that. They're like, ‘But climate change.’ And then, really, at the end, all be like you have to let us do this because of climate change: social justice and climate change. It always boils down to those two things. And it gets progressive women 100% of the time. It does.

So basically, you're saying it would work like this: you've got all these Silicon Valley wives who, I'm sure, are actually empathetic. They may want to help people, but they're also tied to prestige and to other people thinking you're a good person.

They start their own foundations, but also y'all's got a ton of people coming to you and being like, ‘Will you pay for my grant? Will you fund my organization? Will you do this?’ and you looked at the criminal justice focused things and said or social justice focused things says yes that's how I'm going to dedicate my money.

You're telling me you're going to uplift these communities, so these progressive entities will come to you and ask for money, and you'll give it to them.

The programs themselves would run smoothly, the offices would be bought, the people would be hired, everyone would have fancy titles, and the nonprofits would thrive. Did the communities thrive? No, the communities did not thrive around the NGO. The NGO thrived. It's a racket.

The thing about NGO's is once they're up and running, they're designed to do one thing. Raise more money, hire more people. However, the fabric of their communities remains in poor condition. They need the communities to stay in poor condition to raise more money.

Then they’d say: ‘But we're so close. We just need this. We saw some progress, and the conservatives are ruining, the conservatives are the enemy.’ So it just spirals, and you're like, ‘Oh my god, I've created a monster.’

You can see how you get stuck in that cycle. Then you can sit down with your board and be like, ‘We're pivoting.’ This is not for our cause. We're now going to pivot. Then the NGO’s will come to you and be like, ‘That one they pivoted. We need more of your money.’ And you're like, ‘We're falling apart.’

And you're like, ‘Oh god, I put all this time and money into you getting to this thing, to this place for this community.’

It's just like it's a racket. It doesn't make anyone better. And then it actually requires the further sensationalising of the issue to raise more money.""

In her podcast with Allie Beth Stuckey, Shanahan recounted that extremely well-educated women find their self-worth through philanthropic work, which she often describes as being manipulated to lay the groundwork for new concepts like theShe argues that, despite their altruistic intent totheir efforts thrive in an echo chamber of a tiny, hyper-progressive sphere, resulting in thriving non-profits while the communities they should be helping do not.

Bill Gates ‘warns’ Donald Trump: US will share blame for rising child deaths as…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-warns-donald-trump-us-will-share-blame-for-rising-child-deaths-as/articleshow/125766367.cms,"Bill Gates warns President Trump that slashing US global health funding could cause the first rise in childhood deaths this century. New projections indicate millions more children may die if cuts persist. While the Gates Foundation is increasing its own spending, it cannot replace government support, leaving vulnerable nations struggling to achieve self-sufficiency.

Global health aid plummets 27% amid international retreat

Foundation doubles spending as government support evaporates





Bill Gates has delivered a stark warning to President Donald Trump : deep cuts to US global health funding could make America culpable for the first increase in childhood deaths this century. Gates revealed he told Trump that modest cuts of 10-20% might be justified for efficiency, but anything beyond that level would give the US ""some culpability in the increase in deaths. "" The president responded favorably, Gates said, ""but we don't have a plan to get the spending all back in place.""The warning comes as new modeling projects 4.8 million children will die before their fifth birthday in 2025—an increase of more than 200,000 from last year. If funding cuts persist at 20%, an additional 12 million children could die by 2045, according to the Gates Foundation's annual Goalkeepers report.Global aid funding has dropped almost 27% this year, devastating programs that depended on sustained support. While Trump's dismantling of USAID has drawn attention, the UK, France, and Germany have also slashed spending dramatically.The impact is already visible on the ground. In Nigeria alone, donor-funded programs that once employed over 8,000 tuberculosis workers have ended, which Gates said will lead to tens of thousands of additional deaths from a single disease in one country.The Microsoft co-founder emphasized that routine vaccination remains the most cost-effective intervention, with every dollar spent returning $54 in benefits. However, vaccine skepticism promoted by US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. threatens to undermine progress globally.Gates stressed that while the Gates Foundation plans to double its spending over the next two decades, private philanthropy cannot compensate for the US government pullback. For poor African countries, achieving self-sufficiency is a 20-year goal, not a four-year one, he noted.Despite expressing guarded optimism about some aspects of the State Department's new global health strategy, Gates acknowledged the uncertain path forward: ""I do think that Congress cares and President Trump cares, but we still don't have a full resolution of what the funding flows will look like.""","Gates warns US global health funding cuts could cause first rise in childhood deaths this century.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff comforts investors as AI jitters wipe away more than $100 billion in shareholder wealth; says: We all know that ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-comforts-investors-as-ai-jitters-wipe-away-more-than-100-billion-in-shareholder-wealth-says-we-all-know-that-/articleshow/125765013.cms,"Salesforce big bet on AI agents





Salesforce posted better-than-expected quarterly results this week, giving CEO Marc Benioff fresh ammunition to push back against a wave of investor skepticism regarding the company's aggressive pivot toward artificial intelligence. The business software giant reported earnings that eclipsed analyst projections, offering a potential reprieve for a stock that has been hammered recently by doubts over whether the industry's massive spending on AI will yield profitable returns.Despite the earnings beat, the modest market reaction highlights the persistent doubts hanging over the technology sector. Investors have grown increasingly wary of the hundreds of billions of dollars being poured into AI infrastructure without immediate signs of a commensurate financial payoff. Salesforce too has been feeling the pressure of AI jitters acutely. Before earnings report, the company's market value had plunged 35% from a peak of $369 per share a year ago, wiping out approximately $125 billion in shareholder wealth. Even Nvidia, the dominant chipmaker powering the AI boom, has not been immune to the volatility. Despite soaring past earnings estimates two weeks ago, Nvidia's stock remains 15% below its late October peak.For the quarter ending in October, the San Francisco-based company earned $2.1 billion, or $2.19 per share, marking a 37% increase from the same period last year. Revenue rose 9% to nearly $10.9 billion. Salesforce also issued a forecast for the current quarter that exceeded Wall Street predictions. ""We're uniquely positioned for this new era,"" Benioff said during a 25-minute address on an analyst conference call.Benioff, who co-founded Salesforce in 1999 and helped pioneer the shift to cloud computing, characterized the company’s new technology as generating ""wow"" moments for customers. Shares of Salesforce initially surged more than 5% following the report but pared gains to 2% after Benioff’s presentation.Salesforce has focused its strategy on ""Agentforce,"" a suite of AI agents designed to automate customer sales and support tasks. In a move highlighting the potential for this technology to replace human labor, the company recently laid off 4,000 of its own customer support workers as its AI tools took over those responsibilities.However, corporate adoption has been slower than anticipated. Jay Woods, chief market strategist for Freedom Capital Markets, told news agency AP that as customers haven't embraced AI agents as quickly as investors hoped, Salesforce has become a ""poster child"" for the doubts hanging over the technology.""We all know that the speed of innovation has exceeded the speed of customer adoption,"" Benioff acknowledged Wednesday, though he predicted this dynamic would change as more organizations integrate AI into their operations.Benioff also highlighted the company's long-term growth targets, projecting $60 billion in revenue for the fiscal year ending in January 2030. To reach that goal, the company needs to maintain average annual increases of 10% from its current fiscal year forecast of $41.5 billion.The company also recently completed an $8 billion acquisition of Informatica, a software maker building AI tools for corporate data management. ""We're continuing to execute on the path to our $60 billion dream,"" Benioff said.","Salesforce posted better-than-expected quarterly results this week.

Tesla snub sparked years-long political fallout

Trump administration reverses EV policy direction





General Motors CEO Mary Barra revealed Wednesday that she privately corrected then-President Joe Biden after a controversial 2021 White House event that excluded Tesla and Elon Musk , telling him that Tesla deserved recognition for advancing electric vehicles in America.Speaking at The New York Times DealBook Summit, Barra disclosed that when Biden credited her with leading the EV revolution, she responded: ""Actually, I think a lot of that credit goes to Elon and Tesla."" The GM chief had previously stated she hadn't given much thought to the May 2021 White House EV summit snub, even as her company received presidential praise.The exclusion of Tesla—the world's largest EV producer—from the summit became a pivotal moment that contributed to a massive rift between Biden and Musk, who later campaigned for Donald Trump and briefly served as a key White House advisor earlier this year.Musk made no secret of his anger, writing in December 2021 that the White House gave Tesla ""the cold shoulder"" while crediting GM with leading the electric car revolution ""in the same quarter that they delivered 26 electric cars (not a typo) and Tesla delivered 300 thousand."" Even Vice President Kamala Harris later acknowledged the mistake, writing in her campaign book: ""If you are convening the nation's manufacturers of electric vehicles and the biggest player in the field is not there, it simply doesn't make sense.The political landscape has shifted dramatically since 2021. Recent tensions between Trump and Musk erupted over Trump's ""Big, Beautiful Bill,"" with the president calling Musk ""crazy"" and threatening to cut government contracts with his companies after Musk criticized the legislation's impact on federal deficits.The dispute centered on the bill's elimination of the $7,500 EV tax credit, though Musk has maintained he supports removing the subsidies, stating ""take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla."" However, analysts now suggest that Tesla's recent sales troubles mean the company ""needs all the demand help it can get.""","General Motors CEO Mary Barra revealed she privately corrected then-President Joe Biden after a 2021 White House event that excluded Tesla.

Salesforce is reportedly planning to cut over 1,000 jobs as part of its ongoing restructuring efforts, according to a Bloomberg News report. The company is simultaneously hiring new employees to support its expansion into AI-driven products.The report indicates that displaced workers will have the opportunity to apply for other positions within the company. However, it remains unclear which divisions will be most affected by the job cuts. Salesforce, which had 72,682 employees as of January 31, 2024, has not yet commented on the report.This move comes after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff announced in December 2024 that the company had closed more than 1,000 paid deals for its AI-powered virtual representative platform, ""Agentforce"". The company had previously laid off about 700 employees in January 2024 and an additional 300 in July 2024.Salesforce is set to report its quarterly earnings on February 26, 2025. The company's decision to cut jobs while expanding its AI product offerings reflects the broader trend of tech companies balancing workforce reductions with investments in new technologies.","Salesforce is reportedly planning to cut over 1,000 jobs as part of its ongoing restructuring efforts.

Quantum computing, AI and more

At 1:22 AM on March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, a Boeing 777 plane, vanished from radar shortly after taking off . The flight stopped communicating with Air Traffic Control (ATC). One hour later, the flight disappeared from Military radar. MH370 carried 239 people, mostly Chinese nationals, as it took off from Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to Beijing.Satellite data showed the plane deviated from its flight path to head over the southern Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have crashed. The search has become the most expensive in aviation history.Late last year, Malaysia’s government has agreed in principle to accept a second “no find, no fee” proposal from the US company Texas-based marine robotics firm Ocean Infinity to renew the hunt for flight MH370. “The proposed new search area, identified by Ocean Infinity, is based on the latest information and data analyses conducted by experts and researchers. The company’s proposal is credible,” Transport Minister Anthony Loke said in a statement.Ocean Infinity, which conducted an unsuccessful three-month search for the wreckage in 2018, reportedly believes it now has better techniques and a more defined search area. The renewed search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 is reported to leverage cutting-edge technology, including AI, quantum computing , advanced underwater drones, and enhanced satellite imaging. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now central to the renewed search, with AI-powered algorithms processing massive datasets from satellite transmissions, ocean currents, and previous search areas to identify patterns potentially missed by human analysts.The mysterious disappearance of MH370 has fueled a wide range of conspiracy theories, ranging from pilot suicide and military shoot-downs to paranormal explanations. There have been linkages to ghosts, UFOs and war planes.Quantum computing, through initiatives like the IBM Quantum Research Team's project, is expediting complex calculations related to oceanographic influences on the plane's possible drift, significantly improving the precision of potential location predictions. Advanced underwater drone technology, equipped with AI and high-resolution sensors, will autonomously explore previously inaccessible deep-sea areas. A new fleet of these drones is expected to begin operations in the remote southern Indian Ocean early next year. Simultaneously, advancements in satellite imaging, including high-resolution sensors and real-time data processing, are being used to re-analyze archived satellite imagery, potentially revealing previously unnoticed details about MH370’s final trajectory. Private space companies are collaborating with international investigation teams on this effort.Beyond the immediate search, these technological innovations have significant implications for aviation safety. AI and quantum computing are expected to play a vital role in predictive maintenance, air traffic management, and improved emergency response strategies. The insights gained from the MH370 search could lead to new protocols designed to prevent future incidents, raising the bar for aviation safety standards. The ongoing search aims to provide closure for the families of those on board and to transform how aviation accidents are investigated in the future.","Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, a Boeing 777 plane, vanished from radar shortly after taking off on March 8, 2014.

Dell makes 5-day work from the office compulsory starting March 3; Read founder Michael Dell’s ‘Welcome Back’ email,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dell-makes-5-day-work-from-the-office-compulsory-starting-march-3-read-founder-michael-dells-welcome-back-email/articleshow/117894411.cms,"Why Dell is asking employees to work from office

Read Micheal Dell’s memo to employees:

Team,

We are building a new

Dell Technologies

for a new future. The pace of innovation has never been faster, and for us to lead, the speed of our business must continue to accelerate. What we're finding is that for all the technology in the world, nothing is faster than the speed of human interaction. A thirty second conversation can replace an email back-and-forth that goes on for hours or even days.

We've already asked our sales teams, manufacturing teams, engineers in the labs, onsite team members and leaders to be in the office five days a week, and we have seen these areas come alive with new speed, energy, and passion. Now, we want to see that same sense of urgency and drive everywhere.

Starting March 3, all hybrid and remote team members who live near a Dell office will work in the office five days a week. We are retiring the hybrid policy effective that day. We remain committed to flexibility within your workday, and you should continue to work with your manager to meet your needs. But for the most part, you should plan to work in the office five days a week.

If you opted-in for remote work and live near a Dell office, we expect you to join us in the office. If you are remote and live a long distance from a Dell office, you'll stay remote. If you are field, you will continue to spend five days a week with customers and partners or in a Dell Technologies office.

We know you may have questions about what this means for your specific situation. Please hold those for now. We're still working through details, and additional information will be available soon. But I personally wanted to share this news sooner rather than later, so you have time to process and plan.

We continually evolve our business to deliver the best value and service to our customers and partners. I'm excited for us to have more in-person connections to drive speed, market leadership, and an even stronger culture.

I look forward to seeing many more of you in the office. Welcome back!

Intel gets $536 million from EU after winning this 15-year-long ‘fight’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-gets-536-million-from-eu-after-winning-this-15-year-long-fight/articleshow/117894310.cms,"What EU said about paying Intel default interest



“The Commission paid Intel the appropriate interest compensation of 515 547 908.15 euros,”

What Intel said after EU rejected its regulator's appeal



“We are pleased with the judgement delivered by the Court of Justice of the European Union today and to finally put this part of the case behind us.”

Intel has received €515.55 million ($536 million) in default interest from the European Union’s (EU) antitrust regulators, a report claims. This payment relates to a €1.06 billion fine imposed on the chipmaker in 2009, which was later overturned in court. In 2022, Intel sued the European Commission for €593 million after successfully appealing the fine.EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera said in a written comment to a European Parliament lawmaker, news agency Reuters report.The court overturned most of the commission's decision, however, it upheld the regulator's ruling against Intel for making payments to HP, Acer, and Lenovo to prevent or delay competing products. This led to an additional EU fine of 376 million euros ($386 million) imposed on the company in 2023.This case highlights a growing trend of companies seeking default interest payments from the EU in annulled antitrust cases. The outcomes of such disputes could set important precedents, shaping future corporate dealings with EU regulators, especially in competition law enforcement .Commenting on the EU decision an Intel spokesperson then said:In October 2024, Europe's top court upheld a 2022 ruling that annulled Intel's €1.06 billion antitrust fine, rejecting the EU Commission's appeal and concluding a nearly 20-year legal battle.“The Court of Justice dismisses the Commission’s appeal, thereby upholding the judgement of the General Court,” the court said while rejecting the EU regulator's appeal in 2024.A lower tribunal scrapped Intel's antitrust fine in 2023 and the case gained further support when a court adviser criticised regulators for inadequate economic analysis last year.","The payment relates to a €1.06 billion fine imposed on the chipmaker in 2009.

Why EU’s AI Law is significant

The European Union (EU) has officially started enforcing its landmark artificial intelligence (AI) law – AI Act – setting the stage for strict regulations and potentially hefty fines for non-compliance by AI players, including tech giants like OpenAI , Microsoft, Google and Facebook-parent company Meta.The EU AI Act , the first comprehensive regulatory framework of its kind for AI technology, formally came into effect in August 2024. February 2 marked the deadline for prohibitions on specific AI systems and the implementation of requirements for ensuring adequate technology literacy among staff.This essentially means that AI companies operating within the EU must now adhere to the Act's restrictions or face penalties.The AI Act prohibits certain AI applications deemed to pose an “unacceptable risk” to EU citizens. These banned applications include social scoring systems, real-time facial recognition and other forms of biometric identification that categorize individuals based on race, sex life, sexual orientation, and other sensitive attributes, as well as “manipulative” AI tools.Companies found in breach of the EU AI Act could face fines of up to 35 million euros ($35.8 million) or 7% of their global annual revenue, whichever amount is greater.The EU’s AI Law is stricter in the sense that the potential penalties exceed those possible under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Europe’s stringent digital privacy law. GDPR breaches can lead to fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual global turnover.Notably, the AI Act has not yet come into full effect. By August 2026, its regulations will generally apply to companies operating within the EU. However, developers of certain “high-risk” AI systems will have up to 36 months, until August 2027, to comply with requirements related to risk assessment and human oversight.","The European Union (EU) has officially started enforcing its landmark artificial intelligence (AI) law – AI Act.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Bernstein report 'tells' what it says China's DeepSeek is not telling everyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bernstein-report-tells-what-it-says-chinas-deepseek-is-not-telling-everyone/articleshow/117702705.cms,"How to use deepseek AI

What DeepSeek is not telling

Bernstein Research 's recent report has tempered the hype surrounding DeepSeek, the Chinese startup whose low-cost AI assistant has caused a stir in the tech world and even impacted global markets. While acknowledging DeepSeek 's impressive capabilities, the report argues that claims of the AI being built for just $5 million are misleading and don't represent the full picture of its development costs.The Bernstein report directly addresses the narrative surrounding DeepSeek's supposed budget: ""We believe that DeepSeek DID NOT 'build OpenAI for USD 5M'; the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and the resulting Twitter-verse panic over the weekend seems overblown."" The report emphasizes that the ""fantastic"" results achieved by DeepSeek shouldn't be mistaken for miraculous, and the market reaction, particularly the impact on Nvidia, was disproportionate to the reality of the situation.DeepSeek has developed two primary AI model families: DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek R1 . The V3 model is a large language model (LLM) utilizing a Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) architecture. Bernstein's analysis reveals that training the V3 model required significant computational resources. DeepSeek employed a cluster of 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs for approximately two months. This translates to roughly 2.7 million GPU hours for pre-training and a total of 2.8 million GPU hours when including post-training. GPU hours represent the cumulative time a graphics processing unit is actively engaged in processing tasks, highlighting the substantial investment in computational power.The report underscores that the widely cited ""$5 million"" figure fails to account for the extensive research, development, experimentation, personnel costs, and other associated expenses inherent in developing such a complex model. It's not simply a matter of hardware costs; the figure omits the significant investment in talent and time required for AI research and development.The unveiling of DeepSeek's assistant had a dramatic effect on the market, particularly on AI chip leader Nvidia. On January 27th, Nvidia experienced a record single-day loss in market value, close to $593 billion, driven by fears that Chinese AI models like DeepSeek's could gain a competitive edge over more expensive American counterparts. Bernstein's report suggests that this market reaction was an overreaction.While the V3 model's training resources were detailed, the report notes that the R1 model, which was considered particularly impressive, lacked similar quantification in DeepSeek's research paper. This raises questions about the true cost and resources involved in developing the R1 model.In conclusion, Bernstein acknowledges DeepSeek's achievements as ""fantastic"" but argues that the claim of building an OpenAI-level competitor for $5 million is ""exaggerated"" and ""overblown."" The report provides a more nuanced perspective, highlighting the substantial computational resources and likely hidden costs involved in developing advanced AI models like DeepSeek's, and suggesting that the market's reaction to the company's emergence may have been disproportionate.",Chinese startup DeepSeek's low-cost AI assistant has caused a stir in the tech world and even impacted global markets.

OpenAI questioned Delhi Court's territorial jurisdiction in copyright case

NewYork Times sues OpenAI and Microsoft over AI use of copyrighted work

AI industry's one of the biggest and most common names ChatGPT maker OpenAI is worried. Reason: It says that Chinese companies are actively attempting to replicate its advanced AI models. ""We know (China) based companies -- and others -- are constantly trying to distill the models of leading US AI companies,"" an OpenAI spokesperson told news agency AFP.OpenAI further said that the process was against its terms of service and it would work at detecting and preventing further attempts.We ""believe as we go forward that it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology,"" the spokesperson added.While OpenAI, Microsoft and some in the US government are crying foul; many across the internet are not amused. For, the company led by Sam Altman is itself facing multiple accusations of intellectual property violations, primarily related to the use of copyrighted materials in training its generative AI models.Such Copyright infringement cases against ChatGPT abound across the world. Courts across the world are hearing claims by authors, news outlets and musicians who accuse ChatGPT of using their copyright work to train AI services and who are seeking to have content used to train the chatbot deleted.Earlier this month, the New Delhi-based Federation of Indian Publishers filed a case at the Delhi High Court against OpenAI, which is already facing similar lawsuits in the same court. The case has been filed on behalf of all the federation's members, who include publishers like Bloomsbury (BLPU.L), opens new tab, Penguin Random House, Cambridge University Press and Pan Macmillan, as well as India's Rupa Publications and S.Chand and Co. ""Our ask from the court is that they should stop (OpenAI from) accessing our copyright content,"" Pranav Gupta, the federation's general secretary told Reuters about the lawsuit, which concerns the ChatGPT tool's book summaries.Not just this, the Indian media outlets, including NDTV and Network18 have told the Delhi High Court that they want to join the ongoing lawsuit against ChatGPT creator OpenAI as they are worried their news websites are being scraped to store and reproduce their work for users of the powerful AI tool. The 135-page case filing, which is not public but was reviewed by Reuters, argues OpenAI's conduct constitutes ""a clear and present danger to the valuable copyrights"" of Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) members and other outlets.In November 2024, the Delhi High Court issued summons to OpenAI in a lawsuit filed by news agency Asian News International (ANI) over use of its news content “without any license or permission”, by the advanced AI-powered chatbot to provide services to its users.Responding to the same earlier this month, Open AI’s counsel questioned the territorial jurisdiction of courts in India to decide the issue. Senior advocate Amit Sibal, representing OpenAI, said that the organisation operates internationally, with no servers or offices in India.In 2024, the New York Times sued OpenAI and its partner Microsoft for the unpermitted use of Times articles to train GPT large language models.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI is worried that Chinese companies are attempting to replicate its advanced AI models.

What Google said in its arguments

The legal battle between Google and “Fortnite” creator Epic Games takes center stage once again, as lawyers for both companies appear before a US appeals court in California. Google is seeking to overturn a jury verdict and a subsequent judge’s order asking the tech giant to change Play Store practices, as per news agency Reuters.Epic Games initiated the legal proceedings in 2020, accusing Google of monopolistic practices concerning app access on Android devices and in-app transaction processing.Following the jury’s verdict in October last year, Google was ordered to introduce competition by allowing users to download rival app stores directly from Google's Play Store. The order also required Google to make its Play Store app catalog available to these competing app stores, among other significant reforms.However, in court filings submitted to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, Google argued that legal errors committed by the trial judge unfairly benefited Epic Games in the antitrust case. The company contends that these errors led to an unjust outcome and warrant the appeals court's intervention.This order is currently on hold pending the 9th Circuit's consideration of Google's appeal.Among multiple other solutions, the tech giant maintained that its Play Store faces robust competition from Apple's App Store and that the judge erred by allowing Epic Games to present the case to jurors as if Google and Apple were not competitors in the app distribution and in-app payment space.Google's appeal also challenges the nationwide scope of Judge Donato's order, arguing that it should have only affected Epic Games specifically, not all users and developers nationwide.Meanwhile, Epic Games, in its response to the appeal, has urged the 9th Circuit to reject Google's arguments. Epic accuses Google of employing a “years-long strategy to suppress competition among app stores and payment solutions.”Reportedly, the company stated that it will “fight to ensure that the jury's verdict and the court's injunction are upheld and Google is held to account for its anticompetitive behavior.”Microsoft has filed a brief in support of Epic Games, as have the US Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).","Epic Games initiated the legal proceedings in 2020, accusing Google of monopolistic practices concerning app access on Android devices and in-app transaction processing.

Problems faced by Google’s AI Overviews



Are you tired of Google ’s AI-generated search results? There’s a simple trick to bypass them by adding an expletive to your query. Google’s AI Overviews , which often pull unreliable information, won’t appear if a swear word is included in the search. For example, searching “How large is the student body of IIT Delhi?” generates an AI summary, but tweaking it to “How large is the f***ing student body at IIT Delhi?” removes the AI response, displaying only traditional blue links.We at TOI Tech tried exploiting this loophole which can be helpful for those who prefer unfiltered search results. Take a look at the screenshots below:However, this isn’t the first time internet users have found a way to disable Google’s AI-powered results. Other techniques exist but are more complex, such as appending specific character strings to the search URL. To compare, simply adding an expletive to the query is way easier.This loophole of adding an expletive to a search query to prevent Google from displaying an AI Overview was first spotted by Ars Technica. The report claims that this may be happening due to Google’s strict content policies, which likely train its AI model, Gemini, to avoid repeating profanity. Rather than filtering the response, Google is reportedly disabling the AI summary altogether when a curse word is present.While Google is expected to patch this loophole eventually, for now, users who prefer traditional search results have a simple trick to bypass AI summaries.Google’s AI Overviews have been under scrutiny since their launch, with viral blunders like advising users to use glue to keep cheese from sliding off pizza or eat pebbles for gut health. These responses reportedly stemmed from Reddit comments, highlighting AI’s struggle to detect sarcasm and satire.Google AI summaries may also risk amplifying misinformation by presenting flawed responses as authoritative. The issue extends beyond Google search to voice assistants like Siri now defaults to AI-generated answers using ChatGPT, sometimes delivering incorrect information instead of admitting uncertainty.Google defends AI Overviews by claiming they drive traffic to original sources and argues that users will explore linked articles after reading the summaries. However, some companies remain sceptical, with lawsuits against AI firms like OpenAI and Perplexity for allegedly scraping their content.","Google’s AI Overviews won’t appear if a swear word is included in the search.

Wisconsin - Wisconsin Cheese Mart: Gemini in Google Docs

A major factual error in Google's Super Bowl commercial has prompted Google Cloud apps president Jerry Dischler to defend Gemini AI's accuracy, claiming the disputed information was ""not a hallucination"" but rather ""grounded in the Web.""The controversy centers on Gemini AI's claim that Gouda cheese represents ""50 to 60 percent of the world's cheese consumption"" - a statistic that cheese experts say is significantly inflated.The statement appeared in Google's Super Bowl campaign in the US showcasing how small businesses use Gemini AI across all fifty states.Dischler’s reply comes to a user on X (formerly Twitter), who weighed in on the ad, noting that Gemini is stating a wrong fact in the ad. “In Google's Wisconsin local Super Bowl ad, an AI hallucination is shown on screen: It says *Gouda* accounts for ""50 to 60 percent of the world's cheese consumption. Gemini provides no source, but that is just unequivocally false,” reads the post. “Cheddar & mozzarella would like a word”Cornell University's E.V. Baker Professor of Agricultural Economics Emeritus, Andrew Novakovic , disputes the accuracy of this claim. ""While Gouda is likely the most common single variety in world trade, it is almost assuredly not the most widely consumed,"" Novakovic explained to The Verge, noting that Indian Paneer and fresh cheeses from South America, Africa, and Asia likely have much larger consumption volumes globally.While the commercial includes a fine-print disclaimer stating ""This is a creative writing aid, and is not intended to be factual,"" critics argue this raises concerns about Gemini's reliability for business applications, especially since the ad depicts a business owner using the tool to generate website content.Responding to the backlash, Dischler defended the statistic on X, citing its appearance on multiple websites, including Cheese.com - though the credibility of this source has been questioned in online discussions dating back over a decade.","Gemini AI claims that Gouda cheese represents ""50 to 60 percent of the world's cheese consumption"" This statistic has been disputed by cheese experts.

I have written a bunch of scripts with chat GPT for reaper. Curious to know what scripts have you written for reaper with deep seek. Do you share your scripts via reapack?”.To this, Narayanan replied:“Heard so much about your sir ! All great things 🚀🚀🚀. Just some basic project cleaning based on empty tracks, tracks with all muted regions, moving them to a folder and then exporting based on some more custom prefs.

What were the charges against Lee

Samsung Electronics Chair Jay Y. Lee was found not guilty of stock manipulation and accounting fraud by a Seoul appeal court. The chairman was facing allegations in a 2015 merger case , which the prosecutors claimed, was designed to solidify his control of the company at the expense of minority shareholders. The ruling clears him of these charges, allowing him to keep leading Samsung without any legal concerns.Last year, a lower court cleared Lee of all charges.However, prosecutors appealed the decision to the Seoul High Court, seeking a five-year prison sentence. They referenced an August ruling stating that Samsung BioLogics , an affiliate of Cheil Industries, violated accounting standards by inflating its assets to justify the merger.The case is related to the $8 billion merger between Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries. The chairman was accused of stock price manipulation and accounting fraud. The lawsuit further claims that Samsung BioLogics, an affiliate of Cheil Industries, had overstated its assets to justify the merger.The 2015 merger also sparked backlash from investors like US hedge fund Elliott, raising concerns over the corporate governance of South Korea’s family-owned conglomerates. In 2023, the South Korean government was ordered to pay $108.5 million to Elliott over the role of the pension fund in approving the merger.Last year, the National Pension Service sued Lee for damages, claiming the merger undervalued Samsung C&T.Lee, who has led Samsung since his father’s 2014 heart attack, has faced legal issues for nearly a decade, including charges related to the 2015 merger. He previously served 18 months in jail for bribery charges, which were part of a scandal that led to the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye.In 2022, South Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol pardoned Lee, citing the need for his leadership during a national economic crisis.","Samsung Electronics Chair Jay Y.

The participation was voluntary and many platforms adopted these frameworks as a ""brand safety floor."" X itself was a former member of GARM.X's amended complaint alleges that the WFA “organised an advertiser boycott of Twitter through GARM, with the goal of coercing Twitter to comply with the GARM Brand Safety Standards.” The company claims that at least 18 GARM members ceased advertising on Twitter in the US and globally between November and December 2022, following Musk's $44 billion takeover in October.X argues that the alleged boycott diminished its competitiveness in the digital advertising market and negatively impacted user engagement.The company's ad revenue experienced a sharp decline after Musk's acquisition, as many advertisers withdrew from the platform due to staff reductions, policy changes, and the reinstatement of some of the previously banned accounts.","X's lawsuit, initially filed in August last year, alleges a coordinated effort by these companies to boycott advertising on the platform following Elon Musk's acquisition in October 2022. In a complaint filed recently in a Texas court, X named Nestlé, Abbott Laboratories, Colgate, Lego, Pinterest, Tyson Foods, and Shell as defendants.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117867647,imgsize-14410,width-400,resizemode-4/117867647.jpg"

In an unexpected move, Errol Musk , father of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk , has announced his plans to launch a new cryptocurrency called ‘Musk It’. According to reports, the memecoin, which is set to bear his family name, aims to fund his latest venture, a think tank named the Musk Institute. While Errol is enthusiastic about the project, his son Elon has reportedly expressed disapproval of the idea.The launch of ‘Musk It’ has stirred curiosity in the world of digital currencies, with speculation about its potential impact and the father-son dynamics at play.Errol Musk, alongside his business partner Nathan Browne, is seeking to raise between $150 million and $200 million from the launch of ‘Musk It’. The funds will be directed towards supporting the Musk Institute, which aims to promote scientific and engineering research, as reported. The institute’s primary focus will be on advancing technological innovation, a field both Errol and Elon Musk have long been involved in. Despite the ambitious goals, there is no clear structure provided for the cryptocurrency’s tokenomics, or the system that governs its economic and financial operations.The ‘Musk It’ token is poised to be a memecoin, a type of cryptocurrency that typically has little intrinsic value but gains popularity based on internet memes and social trends. Memecoins like Dogecoin have previously gained widespread attention, though their volatility and speculative nature often lead to uncertainty in their long-term value.While Errol Musk is moving forward with his plan, it seems that his son, Elon Musk, is not in favor of the idea. Elon, known for his leadership at Tesla and SpaceX, has made his disdain for cryptocurrency ventures known in the past, which adds an interesting layer of tension to this father-son business venture. Errol, however, appears to be undeterred by his son’s possible opposition. In an interview with Fortune, he boldly stated, ""I’m the head of the family,"" adding that the concept of being ‘Musky’ had started long before his son’s success in the tech world. Errol is confident that his cryptocurrency project will succeed despite not having Elon’s support.This development raises questions about the strained relationship between the two. Elon Musk has previously described his father as “such a terrible human being,” sharing details of his difficult childhood and the emotional scars he says were left by his father. However, Errol Musk denies these claims, emphasizing that their relationship has improved over time. He pointed to a recent meeting at a SpaceX launch, where Elon reportedly praised his father's engineering knowledge, signaling that the father-son dynamic may be on better terms than it once was.Errol Musk’s main objective behind launching ‘Musk It’ is to fund the Musk Institute, a think tank that is poised to focus on cutting-edge scientific and engineering research. The institute is expected to explore new frontiers in technology, much like Elon’s ventures with Tesla and SpaceX. However, the specific research areas and long-term goals of the institute remain unclear.The idea of funding such a project through cryptocurrency is not new, but it raises questions about the long-term sustainability and legitimacy of this method. While the cryptocurrency market has grown exponentially in recent years, it remains highly speculative, and investors are often drawn to the volatility and potential returns rather than a strong, underlying foundation.Memecoins, like ‘Musk It,’ are often based on viral internet memes or personalities, without a substantial use case or real-world value. These coins can attract significant online communities, leading to rapid price increases driven by speculation, but they also face extreme volatility and can quickly lose value. The allure of memecoins lies largely in their ability to rally online communities, but they are often criticized for being little more than speculative bubbles.Errol Musk’s decision to launch a memecoin may be seen as an attempt to tap into this unpredictable but potentially lucrative market. However, the lack of clear information about the token's utility, structure, and the absence of Elon Musk’s endorsement could leave potential investors hesitant. Nathan Browne, Errol’s business partner, has dismissed the notion that the success of ‘Musk It’ depends on Elon’s support, emphasizing that the token’s value and success should not be tied to the Musk family’s prominence alone.The relationship between Errol and Elon Musk has long been the subject of public interest, especially given Elon’s candidness about the challenges he faced growing up. Elon has often spoken about the emotional toll his father’s behavior had on him, but Errol maintains that their relationship has improved and that they now have a better understanding of each other.While their personal relationship may have been difficult at times, it seems that Errol Musk is determined to make his own mark, particularly with the ‘Musk It’ venture. He appears unfazed by the potential for tension between him and his son, focusing instead on his goal of advancing scientific research and supporting the Musk Institute.As Errol Musk pushes forward with the launch of ‘Musk It,’ the cryptocurrency market will closely watch the project’s development. Whether the memecoin will succeed in raising the planned $150 million to $200 million remains to be seen, but it will likely be scrutinized for its potential risks and rewards. The project will also face the challenge of establishing credibility in an industry that is still in its infancy, with the added complication of the Musk family’s public persona and internal dynamics.The future of the Musk Institute, funded by the ‘Musk It’ token, also remains uncertain. If successful, the institute could play a significant role in advancing scientific and engineering research. However, the project’s viability will depend on whether it can navigate the complexities of the cryptocurrency space while staying true to its mission of advancing knowledge and innovation.","Errol Musk, father of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, has announced his plans to launch a new cryptocurrency called ‘Musk It’ According to reports, the memecoin, which is set to bear his family name, aims to fund his latest venture, a think tank named the Musk Institute.

"China's DeepSeek's $5 million number is to hurt US companies and there are lot of American idiots who hype it, says Palmer Luckey who sold his company to Facebook for billions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deepseeks-5-million-number-is-to-hurt-us-companies-and-there-are-lot-of-american-idiots-who-hype-it-says-palmer-luckey-who-sold-his-company-for-billions-to-facebook/articleshow/117861406.cms,"""Useful idiots"" in America not challenging DeepSeek claims

Chinese AI does not require ""losing our minds""

Palmer Luckey , the American entrepreneur behind Oculus (acquired by Facebook for a billion dollars) and defense tech company Anduril, remains skeptical of all the recent buzz around Chinese AI startup DeepSeek and its cost-efficiency claims. In a Fox Business interview, Luckey slammed the US media for what he sees as overly hyped reporting on DeepSeek’s assertions.Luckey specifically challenged the widely reported figure of $5 million as the training cost for DeepSeek's AI model, which is purportedly competitive with US-developed models costing billions.He pointed out that DeepSeek has not disclosed the full costs associated with developing both of its models, and that significant infrastructure costs remain unknown. He accused DeepSeek of intentionally publicizing the $5 million figure to damage US companies, with the media acting as ""useful idiots"" by repeating the claim without proper scrutiny. He argued that neither China, DeepSeek, nor the media have an incentive to correct the record, even as US companies like Nvidia saw their valuations plummet.DeepSeek's model reportedly matches the capabilities of chatbots like ChatGPT and Meta's Llama at a significantly lower development cost. Its app also topped the Apple App Store charts, and it reportedly functions using less powerful Nvidia chips. These developments triggered a downturn in the US tech sector earlier this week.While acknowledging DeepSeek's impressive progress and innovations in AI, Luckey cautioned against accepting the company's self-reported figures at face value. He believes there are those who actively want to see US tech companies, and US President Donald Trump fail, and that some of those individuals are located within the United States.Luckey suggested that the timing and presentation of DeepSeek's news were deliberate, and that the resulting stock market reactions indicate it achieved its intended purpose. He concluded by emphasizing that acknowledging the competitive threat of Chinese AI does not require ""losing our minds"" or falling prey to what he considers to be CCP propaganda.",Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey is skeptical of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's cost-efficiency claims.

Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein has re-entered the Indian market with a dedicated mobile app launched by Reliance Retail , nearly five years after its ban amid diplomatic tensions in 2020.The Shein India Fast Fashion app, available on both Android and iOS platforms, initially serves major cities including New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, with plans for nationwide expansion.Prices start at Rs 199 for dresses, with all products designed and manufactured within India by local manufacturers.Under the partnership structure, Reliance maintains complete operational control and data sovereignty, with Shein serving solely as a technology partner. The Chinese brand receives a license fee for brand usage, with no equity investment involved. All customer data must be stored in India, with Shein having no access rights.Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal confirmed that the approval process underwent extensive scrutiny from multiple ministries, including IT and Home Affairs, ensuring compliance with national security concerns.The re-entry coincides with Shein's growing global dominance, as the company recently became the world's most visited fashion and apparel website, capturing 2.68% of global web traffic in Q3 2024 and outperforming established brands like Nike, H&M, and Zara. Meanwhile, Amazon has launched a new low-cost storefront to tackle Chinese e-commerce platforms, and now is planning to targeting the low-cost fashion segment in the US, one of Shein's biggest market.The move comes as Shein prepares for a potential London stock market listing in the first half of the year, having abandoned previous U.S. listing plans. The company's rapid expansion has drawn regulatory attention, particularly in Europe, where it now faces stricter oversight under the EU's Digital Services Act due to its large user base of 108 million monthly active users.","The Shein India Fast Fashion app, available on both Android and iOS platforms, initially serves major cities including New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru.Prices start at Rs 199 for dresses, with all products designed and manufactured within India by local manufacturers.

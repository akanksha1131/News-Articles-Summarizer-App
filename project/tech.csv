What BEUC report says on Dark Patterns

Guidelines on Dark Patterns in India

The pan-European consumer organization BEUC has reportedly lodged a complaint with the European Commission, accusing Chinas fast-fashion giant Shein of employing ""dark patterns"" to manipulate shoppers into spending more on its app and website. These deceptive user interface tactics, designed to mislead consumers into unintended purchases, mirror practices the Indian government has been urging its e-commerce sector to regulate. Incidentally, these are the same Dark patters that Indian government have been telling ecommerce players in the country to follow guidelines on.Dark patterns are deceptive user interface designs that mislead or manipulate consumers into making unintended choices. These practices erode consumer trust, distort fair market dynamics, and pose a serious threat to the integrity of digital commerce.According to a report by Reuters, Dark patterns, such as pop-ups pressuring users not to leave the app, countdown timers creating urgency to buy, and infinite scroll features, were highlighted in BEUC’s report as ""aggressive commercial practices."" The organization also criticized Shein’s use of frequent notifications, noting one phone received 12 alerts in a single day. These methods, BEUC argues, erode consumer trust and distort fair market dynamics.“For fast fashion, volume is key, and these dark patterns are engineered to drive mass consumption,” said Agustin Reyna, BEUC’s director general, in an interview. He questioned whether Shein would have sufficient incentive to eliminate these practices, given their impact on sales.Shein responded, stating it is “working constructively with national consumer authorities and the EU Commission to demonstrate compliance with EU laws.” The company noted that BEUC declined its request for a meeting. Shein’s gamification strategies, like the “Puppy Keep” game, where users feed a virtual dog to earn points for discounts, further encourage frequent app engagement but risk penalizing users who don’t log in daily.The complaint, backed by 25 BEUC member organizations across 21 countries, including France, Germany, and Spain, also called for broader investigations into other mass-market clothing retailers using similar tactics. Last month, the European Commission warned Shein of potential fines for breaching EU consumer laws, while EU tech regulators are scrutinizing its compliance with online content rules.Meanwhile, in India, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs Pralhad Joshi recently addressed dark patterns at a high-level stakeholder meeting. The meeting included major e-commerce players like Amazon, Flipkart, Swiggy, Zomato, and Reliance Retail, among others, to discuss stronger measures against these manipulative practices. The Indian government has been pushing e-commerce platforms across sectors like food, travel, and retail to adhere to guidelines curbing dark patterns, signaling a global crackdown on such tactics.BEUC’s action follows a similar complaint against Shein’s rival, Temu, as both platforms gain popularity in Europe through apps offering discounts and gamified shopping experiences. The growing scrutiny underscores rising concerns about the integrity of digital commerce worldwide."," pan-European consumer organization BEUC has reportedly lodged a complaint with the European Commission.

Battle over 'Big Beautiful Bill' escalates

The escalating feud between President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk has reached a critical juncture, with Republican lawmakers now questioning their loyalties as the two most powerful figures in conservative politics engage in an unprecedented public battle over Trump's signature domestic policy bill.Trump ally Laura Loomer reported Thursday that GOP legislators are actively debating whether to support the president or the Tesla CEO. ""I know lawmakers who are asking if they should side with President Trump or Elon,"" Loomer posted on social media. ""I've been on the hill all day and it's all anyone is talking about. The most powerful man in the world vs the richest man in the world.""Musk's response was characteristically provocative, telling Loomer: ""One thing's for sure, it ain't boring!"" He then delivered what appears to be a veiled threat to Republican politicians weighing their options: ""Oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years.""The public rupture intensified Thursday when Musk explicitly took credit for Trump's 2024 election victory after the president expressed disappointment in his former adviser. ""Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,"" Musk wrote on X. ""Such ingratitude.""Trump had earlier told reporters during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz that he was ""very disappointed in Elon"" and that he had ""helped Elon a lot."" The president accused Musk of opposing the legislation only after Republicans removed electric vehicle subsidies that would benefit Tesla.""He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he had a problem. And he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate because that's billions and billions of dollars,"" Trump said.The conflict centers on Trump's massive domestic policy bill, which Musk has repeatedly attacked as a ""disgusting abomination"" that will increase the federal deficit. Musk has urged Americans to ""KILL THE BILL,"" arguing it doesn't cut government spending deeply enough despite projections it will remove health coverage from millions.Trump disputed Musk's claim that he wasn't consulted on the legislation, stating: ""Elon knew the inner workings of this bill, better than almost anybody sitting here."" Musk fired back on X: ""False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!""The president also mocked Musk's appearance, referencing the billionaire's recent black eye and suggesting he might be developing ""Trump Derangement Syndrome.""

Morgan Stanley bull has this prediction for Elon Musk's EV company Tesla,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/morgan-stanley-bull-has-this-prediction-for-elon-musks-ev-company-tesla/articleshow/121603102.cms,"Tesla may not be interested in eVTOL anytime soon

Why eVTOL market may not a profitable bet yet

Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas has predicted that Elon Musk may be ""tempted to solve"" another ""problem"" by leveraging Tesla's expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), batteries and manufacturing. As per Jones, the problem is ""commercialising air taxis,"" also known as electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles.In his latest research note, Jonas argued that Tesla may enter the nascent eVTOL market as these aircraft have long been predicted to revolutionise urban transport, yet even leading developers like Archer Aviation are still in the developmental phase.Last week, Archer's Midnight prototype, slated for its first deliveries later this year to Abu Dhabi, successfully completed a piloted flight test.According to a report by Fortune, while Jonas believes that solving this technological challenge aligns with the interests of Tesla engineers, he acknowledged that Tesla has indicated it is currently too stretched to seriously consider an eVTOL venture, without outright refuting the idea.The US government is reportedly keen on supporting the growth of flying cars. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posted this week, ""eVOTLs [sic] are going to fundamentally transform how the public travels. Let’s make sure the US leads the way.""Currently, the eVTOL market faces significant hurdles. Several promising startups, including Lilium and Volocopter, have encountered financial difficulties before establishing commercially viable services. A key challenge in achieving stringent safety standards while ensuring full autonomy, as scaling the business typically requires removing costly pilots from the equation. Additionally, there aren't enough customers with pilot licenses to support widespread adoption.","Tesla may enter the nascent eVTOL market, says Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas.

The decision comes in response to growing pressure from European regulators and officials in France, who flagged the trend for potentially endangering young users' mental health.In a statement, TikTok spokesperson Paolo Ganino said “[We] have blocked search results for #skinnytok since it has become linked to unhealthy weight loss content”. Ganion further added that the move is part of a regular review of the platform’s safety measures to address emerging risks.What happens when a user searches #skinnytok on TikTokIf a user searches for #skinnytok on TikTok, they are now redirected to mental health support resources.The now-banned hashtag has garnered over half a million posts. Many of these posts reportedly glamorised extreme thinness and shared guilt-inducing messages like “you aren’t ugly, you are just fat”.France’s Digital Minister Clara Chappaz welcomed the move, calling it a “collective victory” after nearly two months of campaigning, which included a public petition and a meeting with TikTok executives in Dublin in early May. “The fight to protect our children online doesn't stop there,” Chappaz said. “I won't give up. Banning social media before 15 is my priority.”The ban has amplified calls in Brussels for stricter rules on social media use by children.

According to a report by Associated Press, the deal will also boost the output of Constellation Energy’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois.Announced on June 3, the agreement is part of a broader trend of tech companies partnering with nuclear energy providers as AI usage surges. Financial terms were not disclosed. The Clinton plant, originally set to close in 2017 due to financial losses, was sustained by Illinois’ zero-emission credit program, which expires in 2027, as per the report.

OnePlus Pad 3 Unboxing and first look: What's in the box?

Steve Ballmer , former CEO of Microsoft recently admitted how overconfidence in Windows prevented the software giant from capitalizing on the smartphone market. Speaking on the Acquired podcast, Ballmer said, “We were too confident,” as he reflected on Microsoft’s past strategy of pushing Windows into markets where it didn’t fit, instead of building solutions tailored to specific platforms. His remarks echoes with Android co-founder Rich Miner who – earlier this year – attributed Microsoft’s loss of smartphone wars to Android to Bill Gates ’s decision.In an X post in January, Rich Miner wrote “I literally helped create Android to prevent Microsoft from controlling the phone the way they did the PC - stifling innovation. So it's always funny for me to hear Gates whine about losing mobile to Android”.“I helped Orange launch the first Windows Mobile phone in 2002, the SPV. I worried MSFT might end up controlling mobile like they did the PC, I wanted something more open. So, sorry Bill, you're more responsible for losing the $400B than you realize,” he then stated.Stating that the company was “too confident”, Ballmer admitted on the podcast: “I don’t think we stuck with Windows too long. I think what we did is we tried to put Windows in places that it didn’t naturally go.”He pointed to Windows Mobile and automotive applications as key examples, where Microsoft's push to use Windows APIs and interfaces led to forced and unnatural user experiences.During the podcast, Ballmer revealed that Microsoft’s strategy was driven by a mix of “paranoia and confidence” in Windows, which the company saw as its “birthright” and “permission to enter” new markets. This mindset influenced its push into areas like media center applications and TV integration, where simplified versions of Windows struggled to match the performance and user experience of purpose-built solutions.","Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft, recently admitted how overconfidence in Windows prevented the software giant from capitalizing on the smartphone market.

OnePlus 13s First Look: Compact flagship with NO compromises!

As the tech world races toward advanced forms of artificial general intelligence (AGI), Rumman Chowdhury , CEO of Humane Intelligence and former US Science Envoy for AI, has sent a strong message about the growing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI). She emphasised that AI should not be used as a substitute for human thought.“If we start to say, ‘Well, the AI system is going to do the thinking for me,’ that is a failure state,” Chowdhury said in an interview, highlighting that AI systems are fundamentally limited by current human data and capabilities.“New and novel inventions, new and novel ideas don't come out of AI systems. They come out of our brains, actually. Not AI brains,” she added.Chowdhury also says that “AI is a tool, not a creator,” while referring to statements like AI could unlock major scientific breakthroughs, such as new treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's or cancer.“True innovation comes from human insight,” she added.Chowdhury also addressed the issue of AI reliability , pointing out how prompt design can influence a model’s output. She shared an instance when a chatbot gave medically inaccurate advice because the prompt was emotionally persuasive.“You find that the model actually starts trying to agree with you, because it’s trying to be helpful,” she said, adding, “That’s a big, glaring flaw.”The broader issue, according to Chowdhury, is people’s willingness to accept AI-generated answers without questioning the intent behind their queries.“Why do you need this information? What are you using it for?” she asked.“We are at a critical juncture. People are too ready to let AI do all the thinking, and that’s dangerous,” she noted.","Rumman Chowdhury is CEO of Humane Intelligence and former US Science Envoy for AI.

White House says Bill will stimulate US economy



Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has started a fierce campaign against US President Donald Trump’s $4 trillion tax and spending bill, urging Americans to pressure lawmakers to reject it. In a viral post on X, Musk warned that the bill would bankrupt the country, calling it a “disgusting abomination” and dubbing it the “Debt Slavery Bill”. On June 4, Musk posted ""Kill the Big Ugly Bill,"" signalling his intent to oppose the bill championed by Trump, who has previously referred to it as a ""Big Beautiful Tax and Spending Bill."" Reports indicate that Musk is mainly worried about the bill's ability to worsen the national debt , potentially triggering serious economic repercussions.The bill, which extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, increases defense spending, and raises the national debt ceiling, has drawn criticism from fiscal conservatives . Musk, who recently left his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), argues that the legislation undermines cost-cutting efforts and could inflate the deficit by $2.5 trillion.Elon Musk, who has long warned of the national debt as an “existential threat,” had previously offered only mild critiques of the bill despite his role as an informal adviser to Trump. However, his latest comments mark a dramatic escalation in tone.Musk urged his 180 million followers to contact their senators and representatives, stating: “Call your Senator. Call your Congressman. Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.”He also shared a photoshopped poster of Quentin Tarantino’s ‘Kill Bill’, replacing the film’s title with his anti-bill slogan.The White House has pushed back against the deficit projections, with officials arguing that the CBO estimates fail to account for the potential economic growth spurred by the tax cuts. They claim the bill’s provisions will stimulate the economy enough to offset the increased spending. However, Musk’s public rebuke highlights growing tensions within Trump’s Republican Party over the legislation, which faced a rocky passage through the House due to opposition from both fiscal conservatives and moderates.The bill’s passage has also drawn scrutiny from independent fiscal watchdogs. A recent CBO report warned that the tax provisions alone could increase the federal deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade, while proposed cuts to social programs like Medicaid and food stamps would only reduce spending by $1 trillion. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group, estimated the bill could add roughly $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the same period.","Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has started a fierce campaign against US President Donald Trump’s $4 trillion tax and spending bill.

Fans flooded the comments with excitement, celebrating the union of two creative powerhouses in the digital world.According to the ET reports, their relationship started in 2022, when Donaldson traveled to South Africa.

Their rapport soon turned into frequent contact and eventually a full-fledged romance.By April 2022, they had made their first public appearance as a couple at the Kids' Choice Awards, validating what their fans had been speculating about for months.Thea Booysen, aka TheaBeasty, has built a reputation as an esteemed voice within the esports and gaming sector. In 2016, she started streaming on Twitch and YouTube, playing strategy card games. Her informative content, witty comments, and gaming knowledge gained her a devoted fanbase.She is also on the executive team of Nixuh, a South African gaming organization, helping to advance professional gaming in the country. Well beyond a content creator, Booysen's profile is a blend of creativity, intellect, and drive.Beyond the gaming sphere, Thea Booysen is an accomplished academic. Her academic credentials are:When she graduated with her master's, she posted a sentimental photo with Donaldson, exposing the caring relationship they have and displaying her versatile personality behind social media.Booysen is also a budding writer. In 2022, she released her first young adult book, The Marked Children, something that she wrote during her school days. The book is a testament to her creative writing, determination, and imaginative heart. This achievement is a testament to her potential to transcend genres from computer screens to pages demonstrating that her skills are as multifaceted as her passions.MrBeast and Thea Booysen together capture the spirit of a contemporary power couple. Theirs is not only a relationship founded on mutual affection but also a deep sense of what works for the digital environment. Both have created careers based on true engagement, intellectual growth, and large-scale projects.Thea Booysen told PEOPLE, ""In my mind, we're already married. We're already on the same page.

The timing was a nod to his need for intimacy despite his celebrity public life. As opposed to his usual bigger-than-life productions, this milestone leaned more toward authentic emotion than spectacle.According to the reports, the couple allegedly plans to hold a private wedding, perhaps on a private island, a move that again underscores their wish to keep part of their life out of the always-watchful eye of the internet.

Why Elon Musk is criticising One Big Beautiful Bill

OnePlus 13s First Look: Compact flagship with NO compromises!

Tesla Bull Ross Ross Gerber shared a post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) criticizing Elon Musk for “attacking” people “he helped put in power”. In a sharply worded post, Gerber pointed to Musk’s recent political stances and endorsements, which he claims have aligned Tesla with figures and policies actively working against the electric vehicle (EV) transition. “After he supported the end of all EV benefits under the current laws along with supporting an administration directly opposed to Tesla’s success… this should work out well for Tesla, I’m sure,” Gerber wrote, with evident sarcasm.Gerber’s remarks come amidst Elon Musk’s criticism of Trump administration's One Big Beautiful Bill . He wrote:“Amazingly Elon now attacking all the people he helped put in power. This should work out well for tesla I’m sure. After he supported the end of all EV benefits under the current laws along with supporting an administration directly opposed to teslas success. The BOD, selling stock and living the good life.”Last month, the tech billionaire expressed his disappointment with the bill saying “I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just fails to decrease it”. In an X post recently, he termed the bill “a disgusting abomination”.Musk wrote “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”In another post, he said “Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL”Musk has long warned of the national debt as an “existential threat”. He has been warning against ‘America bankruptcy’ due to federal over spending for a long time now. Talking about the bill, he said “This spending bill contains the largest increase in the debt ceiling in US history! It is the Debt Slavery Bill .”The Tesla CEO recently stepped down from his role at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), established earlier this year to cut federal spending. Commenting on a post about the bill, Musk said “It more than defeats all the cost savings achieved by the @DOGE team at great personal cost and risk”.","Tesla Bull Ross Ross Gerber shared a post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) criticizing Elon Musk for ‘attacking’ people “he helped put in power’ Gerber pointed to Musk’s recent political stances and endorsements, which he claims have aligned Tesla with figures and policies actively working against the electric vehicle (EV) transition.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121647670,imgsize-20670,width-400,resizemode-4/Tesla-Bull-Ross-Gerber-makes-fun-of-Elon-Musk-Amazingly-Elon-now-attacking-all-people-he-helped-put-in-power-This-.jpg"

Numbers are out, years are in

iOS 26 finally bring the desktop dreams to your pocket

watchOS 26 finally gain some intelligence

iPadOS 26 inching closer to laptop territory

macOS 26 to go for Tahoe’s mountain majesty

visionOS 26 is setting the stage for broader adoption

Apple's AI ambitions finally meet reality check

Hardware hopes remain mostly wishful thinking

Apple's annual developer conference is just around the corner, and Worldwide Developers Conference for the 2025 promises to be a pivotal moment for the tech giant. Set to kick off on June 9, this year's keynote carries extra weight as Apple attempts to regain its footing in the AI race while introducing some dramatic visual transformation co to its software ecosystem in over a decade, and its teaser ""Sleek Peek” featuring a shimmering glass-like Apple logo with rainbow colours dancing through its translucent surface, hints at the dramatic visual transformation coming to iOS , macOS, and beyond.The most visually striking change coming to Apple's platforms is a comprehensive design overhaul inspired by visionOS. This isn't just a minor refresh, it's being described as the biggest design transformation since iOS 7's flat design revolution in 2013.Expect to see circular ""squircle"" icons, translucent window elements, and layered glass effects throughout the interface. The design language will create a more unified experience across iPhone , iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch, with each platform maintaining its unique characteristics while sharing common visual DNA.This glassmorphism approach isn't just about aesthetics. It's seemingly a strategic move to make Apple's entire ecosystem feel more cohesive and modern, while subtly preparing users for future AR and mixed reality experiences where transparency and depth become crucial interface elements.Gone will the days of tracking iOS 19 , macOS 16, and watchOS 12. Apple is reportedly overhauling its entire naming convention, jumping straight to year-based branding. Instead of incremental version numbers, we'll see iOS 26 , iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26 across the board.The logic behind this shift makes perfect sense. With Apple's expanding ecosystem of devices and platforms, keeping track of different version numbers has become increasingly confusing for both developers and consumers. The year-based approach mirrors what Samsung did with its Galaxy S series, jumping from S10 to S20 in 2020.Why 26 instead of 25? Apple's thinking ahead. Since these operating systems typically launch in September, they'll be available for most of their lifecycle during 2026. Plus, the ""26"" branding sounds more futuristic, exactly what Apple needs as it tries to shift focus from its AI struggles to forward-looking innovation.The iPhone's next major update focuses heavily on productivity and multitasking improvements. One of the most intriguing additions is a desktop mode that will let users connect their iPhone to external displays for presentations, content viewing, and even video editing , think Samsung DeX but with Apple's signature polish.Battery life is also said to be getting an AI boost with intelligent power management that learns your usage patterns and optimises performance accordingly. If the rumours are to believed, Camera app could also being streamlined with an interface with fewer visible options at first glance, relying more on gestures and taps to access advanced features.Live translation through AirPods Pro 2 will make international travel significantly easier, while enhanced Apple Intelligence integration promises more contextual assistance, though major AI breakthroughs remain on the horizon rather than immediate reality.There are also murmurs of a gaming app coming to iOS (and iPadOS and macOS), which should bring some of the Arcade and more titles from third-party developers. What will be interesting about this app is that it might feature achievements, like PlayStation gives out trophies, and could also have individual game leaderboards.The Apple Watch has been notably absent from Apple Intelligence features, but that changes this year. Watch users can expect message summaries, translation capabilities, and potentially even message composition assistance right from their wrist.Health and fitness features are getting more sophisticated AI-powered insights, though the rumoured comprehensive health subscription service appears to be delayed until 2026. The watch will also benefit from the new glass-inspired design language, making interactions feel more fluid and modern.iPad users have long complained that iPadOS doesn't take full advantage of the hardware, especially on Pro models. Apple appears to be listening. The upcoming version promises significant improvements in three key areas: productivity, multitasking, and app window management.While specific details remain scarce, the focus seems to be making the iPad experience more Mac-like without completely abandoning the touch-first interface that makes tablets unique. Enhanced file management, better external display support, and more sophisticated multitasking could finally make the iPad Pro a true laptop replacement for more users.Apple's desktop operating system gets both a new name and a fresh coat of paint. macOS Tahoe, named after the scenic California lake, will incorporate the same glassmorphism design language being applied across Apple's platforms.The choice of Lake Tahoe as the naming inspiration is particularly apt , the lake is known for its crystal-clear waters that reflect the surrounding mountains, perfectly matching the transparent, layered aesthetic of the new interface design.While the Vision Pro hasn't achieved mainstream success, Apple isn't giving up on spatial computing. The updated visionOS will likely include enhanced AI features that can recognise and interact with your environment through the headset's cameras.Gaming capabilities are expected to improve significantly, with potential PlayStation VR 2 controller support and more developer-friendly tools. These improvements could lay the groundwork for a more affordable Vision Pro variant expected in the coming year.Perhaps most notably, WWDC 2025 represents Apple taking a measured approach to AI announcements. After last year's premature Apple Intelligence preview led to credibility issues, the company is being more cautious about promising features that aren't ready.The biggest AI-related news will be opening Apple's Foundation Models to third-party developers, enabling more sophisticated AI integrations in apps. However, major projects like the redesigned Siri, ChatGPT competitor, and AI-powered health services remain in development for future releases.So, the WWDC 2025 might not deliver the AI breakthrough many are hoping for, but it promises to lay crucial groundwork for Apple's software future.Don't expect major hardware announcements at WWDC 2025. Apple typically focuses on software at its developer conference, and this year appears to follow that pattern. However, there are whispers of a possible HomePod with a built-in display, essentially a smart home hub that combines Apple's speaker technology with a touchscreen interface.This device would compete directly with Amazon's Echo Show and Google's Nest Hub, potentially featuring photo frame capabilities, smart home controls, and Siri integration optimised for household management.That's all we expect Apple to uncover at June 9th's keynote, but in typical Apple fashion, we can also expect a ""One more thing.""","Apple's annual developer conference is just around the corner. Worldwide Developers Conference for the 2025 promises to be a pivotal moment for the tech giant. The most visually striking change coming to Apple's platforms is a comprehensive design overhaul inspired by visionOS. Apple is reportedly overhauling its entire naming convention, jumping straight to year-based branding. The iPhone's next major update focuses heavily on productivity and multitasking improvements.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121657476,imgsize-608648,width-400,resizemode-4/Apples-developers-conference-for-this-year-is-shaping-up-to-be-its-biggest-one-ever-again.jpg"

The tech industry continues to be rocked by significant layoffs, with over 62,000 employees fired across 284 companies in the first five months of 2025 alone as reported by Trueup. Major players like Google , Microsoft , and Intel are among the firms that have made substantial layoffs. According to data from layoff tracker Trueup, the job cut spree, which escalated in 2023, shows no signs of abating in the current year. May 2025 saw particularly heavy cuts, with more than 16,000 tech layoffs reported. The report further revealed that almost 2.4 lakh tech employees lost their jobs in 2024. Analyst point out that the ongoing global economic uncertainty, high interest rates, and inflationary pressures are compelling tech companies to cut costs and prioritise profitability. Also, rapid expansion done during the pandemic led to over-hiring in some sectors. As demand normalises, companies are 'right-sizing' their workforces.Microsoft recently fired around 6,000 employees from its global workforce. With the latest round of job cuts the company aims to reduce management layers and also streamline operations. These cuts reportedly impacted the middle management roles, as the company seeks to create a more streamlined hierarchy by increasing each manager's ""span of control."" Microsoft, as reported by Business Insider previously, aims to prioritise engineering talent as it continues investing heavily in artificial intelligence initiatives.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also addressed recent job cuts during the company’s latest Town Hall event with its employees, a report claims. At the event, he reportedly revealed that the latest round of job cuts was due to “reorganisation rather than performance”.Google has steadily trimmed staff throughout 2025, cutting hundreds of roles in its Global Business Organization, as well as its Pixel, Android, and Chrome divisions. In May, approximately 200 employees were laid off from its Global Business Organization. Earlier cuts in its Pixel hardware team, Android division, Chrome operations, and Google Cloud have also been reported, as the company shifts focus and automates roles.Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is set to lay off 3,600 employees in 2025 as part of a performance-driven restructuring. CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed the move, stating that the company is raising the bar on performance management and will cut low-performing employees faster. The company also fired some employees from its Reality Labs division, specifically impacting teams in Oculus Studios, the unit responsible for developing apps and games for Meta’s Quest VR headsets. Among the affected projects is Supernatural, a popular VR fitness app that Meta acquired in 2023.The semiconductor giant has been undergoing a significant restructuring under its new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, leading to substantial job cuts. A recent report by Bloomberg revealed that Intel is planning to cut 20% of its workforce. These layoffs are staggered and reflect the company's efforts to streamline management and refocus on engineering excellence. Under Tan’s leadership, Intel is reportedly prioritising its core business areas, including advanced chip design and manufacturing, while scaling back on less profitable ventures. The restructuring is seen as a critical step in positioning the company for long-term growth in a highly competitive market.Salesforce reportedly fired more than 1000 employees ongoing restructuring efforts, according to a Bloomberg News report. The report suggests that displaced workers will have the opportunity to apply for other positions within the company. However, it remains unclear which divisions will be most affected by the job cuts.LinkedIn is laying off 281 employees across California, impacting engineers and other units, a report claims. The Microsoft-owned professional networking platform has notified affected workers earlier, a WARN document filed with local officials claims. The job cuts are reportedly distributed across several locations: 159 positions in Mountain View, 60 in San Francisco, 23 in Sunnyvale, 11 in Carpinteria, and 28 remote workers based in California. These layoffs seem to be a part of a larger wave of job reductions at parent company Microsoft. Earlier this month, it was reported that 122 Bay Area Microsoft employees were laid off as part of an estimated 6,000-employee cut across the tech giant.Earlier this year a report by Business Insider revealed that Amazon is planning to cut around 14,000 jobs this year. Internal messages reportedly seen by Business Insider indicate that Amazon cut jobs in its Fashion and Fitness group in January 2025. An Amazon spokesperson then stated that role eliminations affected around 200 employees across the country. Apart from this, the e-commerce major recently fired 100 employees from its Devices and Services division. According to a report by Reuters, the company said the jobs represented a small number of the total for the unit and were part of its regular business review.Dating app Tinder's parent company, Match Group, is reportedly taking on major cost-cutting measures. This includes a 13% reduction in the company’s workforce, following a 5% decrease in paying users during the first quarter, a report claims. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, this announcement led to a 7% drop in the company's shares as investors reacted to the decline in subscribers, despite the company's first-quarter results surpassing estimates.The Walt Disney company recently initiated another significant round of layoffs, with hundreds of employees reportedly losing their jobs across various departments. As reported by BBC, the professionals in the film, television and finance departments are impacted in this fresh round of layoffs. This latest move marks a continuation of the company's broader restructuring efforts aimed at streamlining operations and achieving cost efficiencies. ""As our industry transforms at a rapid pace, we continue to evaluate ways to efficiently manage our businesses while fuelling the state-of-the-art creativity and innovation that consumers value and expect from Disney,"" a Disney spokesperson told the BBC.HP has announced plans to lay off between 1,000 and 2,000 employees by October 2025 as part of its cost-cutting strategy. The company aims to save $300 million through these workforce reductions, which will affect roles across factory operations, customer support, HR, and legacy tech divisions. The layoffs are part of HP’s “Future Now” initiative, a multi-year restructuring plan designed to streamline operations and invest in AI-driven technologies. HP’s CEO Enrique Lores stated that the job cuts will be strategic and selective, targeting areas where demand has slowed.","Over 62,000 employees fired across 284 companies in the first five months of 2025 alone.

""I'm legitimately sad that this has happened,"" one CEO said, while switching platforms. Meanwhile, China's reviewing the deal for potential export violations. For a company spending $100 billion on AI this year, alienating users before day one isn't ideal.

Meta's enterprise trust problem gets exposed

China wants answers about the $2 billion deal





Meta's $2 billion acquisition of Manus, a Singapore-based AI startup with Chinese roots, has backfired in an unexpected way. Instead of celebrating the deal, some existing customers are jumping ship, citing deep-seated concerns about Meta's data practices, according to a CNBC report.Seth Dobrin, co-founder and CEO of Arya Labs, told CNBC that Manus was his favorite AI platform—but he's ditching it now that Meta owns it. ""I do not agree with a lot of Meta's practices around data and how they essentially weaponize people's personal data against them,"" Dobrin said. ""I'm legitimately sad that this has happened.""Karl Yeh, co-founder of consulting firm 0260.AI, echoed similar concerns. His company stopped using Manus and advised clients to do the same. ""Will the data policies of Meta apply to Manus? I would assume it will eventually,"" Yeh told CNBC. He's now moving to alternatives like Genspark, where there's more certainty about the future.Meta announced the Manus deal in late December, promising to scale the AI agent service to ""many more businesses."" Manus, which launched its first general-purpose AI agent last year, can handle complex tasks like market research, coding, and data analysis.The startup claimed it had reached millions of paying customers and hit a revenue run rate exceeding $125 million.Despite Meta's promises that Manus would keep operating independently from Singapore, customers aren't buying it. The exodus points to a bigger issue: Meta simply doesn't have the enterprise credibility that OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have built. When you're known for ad-driven social media, convincing businesses you'll handle their sensitive data responsibly is an uphill battle.The plot thickens beyond customer complaints. China's commerce ministry is now reviewing whether the acquisition violates technology export controls, according to the Financial Times. Manus started life in China in 2022 before relocating to Singapore—a move Beijing apparently sees as a potential blueprint for other Chinese startups looking to dodge domestic oversight.Meta has tried to distance itself, stating there will be ""no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI"" and that services in China will shut down. But between regulatory scrutiny from Beijing and customers heading for the exits, Zuckerberg 's $2 billion bet is already hitting turbulence.For a company that's pledged to spend $100 billion on AI this year, losing customers before the ink on the deal is dry isn't exactly the start Meta was hoping for.","Meta's $2 billion acquisition of Manus, a Singapore-based AI startup with Chinese roots, has backfired in an unexpected way.

Meta's AI fail that made Mark Zuckerberg furious





Meta engineers have reportedly corrected the issue that reportedly plagued company's AI effort. According to a report by news agency Reuters, quoting the company's chief technology officer (CTO) Andrew Bosworth, Meta Platforms' new artificial intelligence lab has delivered its first high-profile AI models internally this month. At a press briefing on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, CTO Bosworth said that the models built by Meta Superintelligence Labs team, formed last year, showed a lot of promise.""They're basically six months into the work, not quite even,"" Bosworth said, adding that the team's AI models were ""very good"". Bosworth did not specify which models were delivered internally. Meta CTO said the technology was not yet finished. Speaking in general terms about the development cycle, Bosworth said: ""There's a tremendous amount of work to do post-training"" for AI, ""to actually deliver the model in a way that's usable internally and by consumers. "" He said, however, that Meta was starting to see favorable returns from its big gambits in 2025, which he called a ""tremendously chaotic year"" for Meta building its lab, infrastructure, and procuring power.Bosworth said 2026 and 2027 would see consumer AI trends firm up because recent advances had delivered models that already answer ""the kinds of things that you ask every day with your family, your kids,"" even as technological development could improve results for more complex queries. Media reports in December said that Meta is working on a new AI model, codenamed Avocado, that could be proprietary instead of open source. Reports claim that the text AI model codenamed Avocado is slated for a first-quarter 2026 launch, along with an image and video-focused model codenamed Mango.Early last year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly became intensely frustrated at Meta’s failure to keep pace in the “AI race” with the likes of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. Though once set to rival the other America-developed large language models (LLMs), Meta’s LlaMA hit the rocks in May, after its latest “lightweight” models received a disappointing reception. Zuckerberg was reportedly already “furious” that his rivals were enjoying more success. Meta faced criticism over the performance of its Llama 4 model at a time when rivals, such as Alphabet's Google and others, have seized momentum in the race for transformational and lucrative AI. In early 2025, Meta's Generative AI unit launched Llama 4, a family of AI models that failed to match the capabilities of Chinese AI lab DeepSeek’s models and that was broadly seen as a disappointment.CEO Mark Zuckerberg went on to shake up Meta's AI leadership team, form a new lab and poach talent with sky-high offers. Meta spent nearly $15 billion in the data-labeling company Scale AI, taking a 49% stake in the startup, while also bringing on its 28-year-old CEO Alexandr Wang to help lead a new “superintelligence” lab within the company.

This follows a US approval for H200 chip sales, which China's customs then reportedly blocked, causing suppliers to halt production. Chinese tech giants are also facing pressure to opt for domestic alternatives.

“The wording from the officials is so severe that it is basically a ban for now,”

Nvidia’s Chinese suppliers halt chip production after customs decision





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is reportedly planning to visit China in late January. This visit by the chip giant’s boss may be seen as the company works to regain access to a key market for its artificial intelligence chips, a report claims. A Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the plans, said Huang will attend company events ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays and is expected to visit Beijing. However, the report didn't specify whether he would meet with senior Chinese officials during the trip.The visit comes as Nvidia seeks to reopen the Chinese market, which US export controls on advanced AI chips have restricted. Huang's schedule could still change depending on whether planned meetings are confirmed, the report noted, citing the person.This follows last week's decision by the Trump administration to allow Nvidia to sell its H200 AI chips to China. The company was expected to restart shipments despite pushback from Washington opponents of doing business with China. However, soon after the US’s decision, Chinese customs officials reportedly said the H200 chips were not allowed into the country.While the Trump administration recently approved the H200 with a 25% tariff, China's General Administration of Customs executed its own counter-strategy.Last week, reports said customs officers were told that Nvidia H200 chips were not allowed in the country.Reuters reported last week. The move caught Nvidia off guard, particularly as the company had pushed hard to sell its AI chips in China and the first batches of H200 chips had already arrived in Hong Kong that week.Days after Chinese customs officials blocked the newly approved processors from entering mainland China, suppliers of key components for the AI chip reportedly halted production lines.A recent Financial Times report, citing two people with knowledge of the matter, said that manufacturers of essential chip parts, including printed circuit boards (PCBs) needed to package H200 chips, paused operations to avoid building up unsold inventory.Meanwhile, multiple reports said that while tech companies like Alibaba, ByteDance and Tencent wanted to buy the H200 for its performance, the Chinese government pressured them to prioritise domestic alternatives, such as Huawei's Ascend chips, and avoid using them for purposes that could threaten national security.According to the FT report, despite having placed orders for over 2 million H200 units, some Chinese customers were cancelling their orders due to the uncertainty.","Jensen Huang is reportedly planning to visit China in late January.

Macron advocated for ‘European preference’







French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday (January 21) sent a “welcome” message to Beijing, inviting Chinese investment in the region, Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2026 in Davos, Switzerland. However, the invitation came with a stern ultimatum regarding the quality and nature of Chinese exports: end to the “dumping” of subsidised, sub-standard goods in the region.“China is welcome, but what we need is more Chinese foreign direct investments in Europe, in some key sectors, to contribute to our growth, to transfer some technologies, and not just to export towards Europe, some devices or products which sometimes don't have the same standards, or are much more subsidized, than the ones being produced in Europe,” Macron said.“It's not being protectionist, it's just restoring this level playing field and protecting our industry,” said Macron, who was wearing sunglasses, in front of a gathering at the event.The French President also warned that China's current approach threatens to overwhelm the machine tool and automobile sectors.“So, from safeguard clauses to European preferences and incentives for more FDI, this strategy is absolutely key,” Macron added.“And in parallel, protecting our economies, will also require a resilience strategy, on both imports and exports, to derisk supply chains, particularly for raw materials, semiconductors, chips, and to diversify our trade partners,” he said.The remarks come at a time of a heightened transatlantic rift over trade and Greenland. Following President Donald Trump 's recent announcement of steep tariffs on nations opposing his plan to annex Greenland, Macron condemned American trade weaponisation.“Competition from the United States of America through trade agreements that undermine our export interests, demand maximum concessions and openly aim to weaken and subordinate Europe, combined with an endless accumulation of new tariffs that are fundamentally unacceptable – even more so when they are used as leverage against territorial sovereignty,” Macron said.“And competition from China, where massive excess capacities and distortive practices threaten to overwhelm entire industrial and commercial sectors. Export control has become more dangerous, new tools destabilizing global trade and the international system,” the President noted.Macros emphasised that “the answer, in order to fix this issue, is more cooperation”. He said building new approaches will build “more economic sovereignty and strategic economy, especially for the Europeans, which, for me, is the core answer.”","French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday (January 21) sent a “welcome” message to Beijing, inviting Chinese investment in the region.

Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary has responded to Elon Musk ’s “idiot” and “insufferable chimp” remarks, taking their public feud to a ‘profitable’ new level. After a week of trading insults on social media, the airline chief said that he “agrees” with the Tesla billionaire on his comments and that the online spat has driven a massive surge in business for the budget carrier.Speaking in an interview in Dublin on Wednesday (January 21), O’Leary revealed that the high-profile argument has led to an increase in Ryanair website footfall and bookings. He also seized the moment by announcing a “Big Idiots Seat Sale,” offering 100,000 seats for just £17 (€16.99).“I think I probably agree with him. I have four teenage children who regularly call me an idiot and insufferable chimp. The good news, though, is that it has delivered a dramatic increase in footfall coming to the Ryanair website over the last five days,” O’Leary said.“We have seen a significant increase in bookings, and as a result, we've launched a “big idiots seat sale” for the current three days where people can buy Reiner tickets for just 17 quid and travel during January, February, March or April. So it's all good stuff, and if it helps Reiner bookings and help Reiner sales, I'm all in favour of it,” he added.O’Leary and Musk’s feud escalated further when the Tesla CEO launched a poll on X (formerly Twitter) asking his 220 million followers if he should “buy Ryanair and restore Ryan as their rightful ruler.”O'Leary responded by welcoming the idea of Musk as a shareholder, however, he quickly pointed out a major legal hurdle: Musk's citizenship.“It’s a good publicity for Ryanair and X. Elon Musk is very welcome to buy shares in Ryanair, I think it would be a very good investment for him. I think it'd be a great investment for Elon Musk, certainly a better investment than X has been for him,” he said.To thank Musk for the free publicity, Ryanair CEO also said that the company is sending a free round-trip ticket to the X office. O'Leary encouraged Musk to ""sample the Ryanair service"" personally“To encourage him, we're sending a round trip to the Twitter offices. A free flight for Mr Musk. And I think he should come and sample Ryanair service…just 17 quid.. this summer,” he said.","Michael O'Leary responds to Elon Musk's 'idiot' and 'insufferable chimp' comments.

Sridhar Vembu: Engineering discipline matters

“I suggest the term ""AI-assisted Code Engineering"" with ACE as the acronym instead of ""vibe-coding"". We must have solid engineering discipline and ACE is the maturation of the tools and techniques”.

“It does not eliminate all software engineers but enables experienced engineers who ACE well to be much more productive,” he said, adding “It is also going to reshape our industry but that is a separate topic.”



What is vibe coding







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has suggested a new way to describe vibe-coding, a word that became one of the biggest “headache” of engineers in 2025. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Vembu argued that the termdoes not reflect the discipline required in real engineering work. He said that he prefers a new termto describe the growing use of AI tools in writing and maintaining software. In the post, Vembu said the focus should remain on solid engineering practices, even as AI becomes more deeply embedded in coding workflows.Sharing the post, Sridhar Vembu wrote:Vembu says that the term ACE does not remove the need for software engineers. Instead, it allows experienced engineers to “be much more productive”.Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming. It refers to building apps and websites by chatting with AI instead of writing code line by painstaking line.Vembu’s comments come at a time when AI-powered coding tools are being widely adopted by developers and companies to speed up software development. His remarks also highlight concerns among industry leaders that such language may underplay the importance of structure, accountability, and long-term reliability in software systems.Collins Dictionary named “vibe-coding” as its word of the year for 2025.","Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming.

“I don’t want to live in one”: A warning against stagnation



A lesson in leadership and decision-making



Why the quote resonates beyond technology



A reflection of Tim Cook’s leadership style



Why the quote still matters



""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

,





Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple , doesn't give long speeches or use dramatic slogans. When he does say something, it's usually short, to the point, and well thought out. One of these lines is his quote:. The sentence is easy to understand, like a conversation. But it has a deeper meaning about how to move forward, how to be a leader, and how businesses and people should plan for the future.The quote is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Museums are places where history is kept. They keep ideas, inventions, and events that changed the world. They help us remember where we came from. Tim Cook has never said that we should forget or ignore history. Instead, he says that it is dangerous to get too comfortable with it.In today's world, where things change quickly, especially in technology, staying still can cost you a lot. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.Museums are very important to society. They keep culture, new ideas, and human accomplishments safe. Future generations would lose touch with the ideas and work that shaped the past if there were no museums. Tim Cook saying ""love"" shows that he cares. He thinks it's important to learn from the past. He likes what has already been made.Apple has a long and well-known history. People often study and admire the company's past innovations, which include the Macintosh, the iPod, and the iPhone. A lot of these items are now on display in museums and exhibitions all over the world. Cook knows more about this legacy than most people.But liking someone doesn't mean you care about them. His quote makes it clear that history is important to learn about, but it shouldn't be a place where you want to stay, especially in an industry driven by constant innovation, progress, and forward-looking thinking.The second part of the quote is where the real meaning is. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. It means comfort, safety, and familiarity. That comfort can slowly turn into stagnation in business and leadership.Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. The markets change. Technology changes. People's needs change. What worked ten years ago might not work anymore. Businesses that only care about keeping their legacy alive often have a hard time staying relevant.Apple has kept changing under Cook's leadership. The business has grown into services, put more emphasis on user privacy, put money into protecting the environment, and moved into new areas like custom silicon chips. These choices show that the company is willing to try new things, even if the old ones worked.The quote is true for all leaders, not just Apple. People often praise leaders for their past successes. People trust you more when you have done well in the past. But depending too much on past success can keep you from coming up with new ideas.Cook's words make it sound like good leadership needs to be balanced. You can learn from history, but don't let it tell you what to do all the time. Don't let your past experiences tell you what to do. This method lets businesses change instead of fighting it.This idea also works for people. Careers, skills, and fields of work change over time. It can be harder to grow if you hold on too tightly to what used to work. The quote quietly encourages people to be open and curious, even when change is hard.This quote stands out because it is so simple. It doesn't use business jargon or technical language. People can all understand it. Most people know how nice it is to stick to their routines and how hard it is to try something new.In a more general sense, the quote talks about how societies deal with progress. Tradition and new ideas often clash with each other. It's important to respect culture and history, but it's also important to be open to new things. Cook's statement does not deny the past. It just won't let itself be limited by it.This balance is especially important now that technology is changing quickly and making people wonder about jobs, education, and social structures. The quote tells people that progress doesn't mean forgetting the past; it means building on it in a smart way.People often say that Tim Cook is calm, level-headed, and practical. His way of leading is different from Steve Jobs's, who was known for making bold and dramatic statements. Cook does things in a quieter way. His words are more likely to make you think than to make you angry.This quote fits that pattern. It doesn't need attention. It makes you think. It gives a point of view without making people agree. That restraint is one reason it feels real.The quote doesn't give a big picture; it gives a way of thinking. It talks about how Cook sees progress, responsibility, and long-term success.is still true because it describes a problem that everyone faces. How can we remember the past without letting it control us? How do we go on without losing what matters?It's clear but not obvious what Tim Cook means. Value history. Take something away from it. Then decide to go on.In one short sentence, the CEO of Apple reminds us that we can choose to make progress. It takes work, curiosity, and a willingness to go beyond what you already know. Museums keep the past alive. But the future is being built somewhere else.",Tim Cook's quote has a deeper meaning about how to move forward. It is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done.

When White House called Amazon's tariff plan an 'hostile act'





In April 2025, a pissed Donald Trump made a call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after learning that the company is planning to display the added cost of tariffs on certain items. Trump made the call to Bezos to complain about reports that Amazon was considering to highlight the cost of US tariffs next to prices for certain products on the company’s website. Trump later told reporters about the call to Amazon founder and said it was a “good call.” “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump told reporters. “He solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.”Punchbowl News first reported that Amazon will soon “display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs — right next to the product’s total listed price.” The move came after Trump slapped 145% tariffs on imports from China and a 10% minimum tax on all other countries.Now months later, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC in an interview Jassy at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Amazon.com is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures stemming from the US President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""We did a lot of pre-buying in the early part of 2025 to enable us to try and keep prices as low as possible for customers,"" Jassy said.He added, ""And a lot of our third-party sellers did a lot of forward-staging in our fulfillment network for the same reasons. And that supply is run out in the fall, so you start to see some of the tariffs creep in to some of the prices, some of the items.""""Some third-party sellers are raising prices in response while others are absorbing the costs in hopes of driving more demand,"" Jassy went on to add. ""Our priority is to try to figure out how to keep prices low as possible,"" Jassy said. ""At a certain point, because retail is a mid-single-digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it.""The warning marks a shift from the Amazon leader's commentary on tariffs last year. While he cautioned in April that third-party sellers could need to pass along tariff costs, he said on several occasions that Amazon had not seen selling prices appreciably rise from tariffs. ""Amazon's consumers overall have fared well. But we'll have to see what happens in 2026,"" CEO Jassy had said.The company has also maintained so far that over the past year it was seeing very little impact on consumer behavior and product prices from tariffs. It has doubled down on expanding product categories and speeding up delivery timelines to shield demand.In April 2025, at a briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the move a “hostile and political act,” adding that she had spoken about the matter with President Trump earlier. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Levitt’s comments, saying it’s a hostile act if a company goes out of its way to “make it seem” like tariffs have caused prices to change.“It’s nonsense,” he said Tuesday in a CNBC interview. “A 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price,” he added, referring to the nearly universal baseline tariff on all countries. “The only price will change would be a product that we don’t make here, like a mango.” The 10% tariff, however, is hardly the only one in effect.",Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the company is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures.

Debate at Davos



Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid







Palantir CEO Alex Karp has now issued a stark warning about the future of work in the age of artificial intelligence. Karp predicted that humanities-based jobs will now be among the first casualties. As reported by Business Insider, speaking during a panel at the World Economic Forum, Karp revealed that his own academic background which is a philosophy degree from Haverford College, a law degree from Stanford, and a Ph.D. in social theory from Germany, cautioned that such qualifications may no longer be viable. “AI will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp said. “You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market.”Karp believes that workers with technical and vocational training will be in then highest demand. He quoted battery manufacturing as an exampple, nothing that technicians in such industries are “very valuable, if not irreplaceable.” “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” Karp told BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who moderated the discussion.Not all leaders at Davos agreed with Karp’s assessment. Finance executives told Business Insider that liberal arts degrees may actually become more valuable, as AI takes over routine financial analysis. Critical and creative thinking, they argued, is increasingly prized in young recruits.Meanwhile, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei highlighted another trend: entry-level hiring is already declining due to AI. Amodei said software and coding roles at Anthropic were down across junior and mid-level positions.Recently, Karp said that value of skilled workers is rising. Speaking on TBPN, a tech talk show broadcast live from Palantir’s customer conference, AIP Con 8, Karp said, “Workers become more valuable. The person at the top is actually crazy valuable. People with technical expertise are crazy valuable."" His words underscore a trend that’s become increasingly apparent in Silicon Valley: in a world awash with automation and AI, human expertise, especially deep technical skill, has become a rare commodity.Karp calls these individuals “artist-shaped people,” a nod to the company’s unique culture, sometimes referred to internally as “an artist colony.” He added, “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid.”. The statement doesn’t just reflect Palantir’s philosophy; it mirrors the market reality, where top AI researchers and engineers have recently netted unprecedented paydays, sometimes reaching hundreds of millions, while thousands of others were laid off from companies like Microsoft and Meta.","Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid. “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid,” he said.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index. Most of her wealth comes from her share of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, significant assets transferred during her 2021 divorce from Bill Gates (including billions in stocks and real estate), and her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, focused on women's equality.","Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

“Wazzan’s methodology is made up; his results unverifiable; his approach admittedly unprecedented; and his proposed outcome—the transfer of billions of dollars from a nonprofit corporation to a donor-turned competitor—implausible on its face.”

“Allowing a jury to hear a disgorgement number—particularly one that is untethered to specific alleged wrongful conduct and results in Musk being paid amounts thousands of times greater than his actual donations—risks misleading the jury as to what relief is recoverable and renders the challenged opinions inadmissible,”

“it is legally impossible for private individuals to hold economic interests in nonprofits”

“Wazzan conceded at deposition that he had no reason to believe Musk expected a financial return when he donated… to OpenAI nonprofit.”

Matter announces India’s first AI platform for next-gen electric two-wheeler motorcycles: All details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/matter-announces-indias-first-ai-platform-for-next-gen-electric-two-wheeler-motorcycles-all-details/articleshow/127003232.cms,"What makes AI-Defined Vehicles different

“Two-wheelers have been mechanically defined for decades. Intelligence-Driven Vehicles change that permanently. When intelligence governs materials, energy, and control—not just software—we unlock vehicles that continuously outperform their own starting point. This is not an EV transition. This is a category reset.”





Matter unveiled India's first AI-Defined Vehicle (AIDV) platform at its Technology Day 3.0 event. The company claims this as a significant shift in the design and manufacturing of electric two-wheelers, where artificial intelligence will move to the forefront as the driving technology, rather than just another hardware component. Its solution is expected to support multiple products over the next three to four years, focusing on performance, efficiency, safety, and cost of ownership.Matter said that AIDVs differ from traditional vehicles in how they operate. Regular motorcycles have fixed performance set during manufacturing, while software-defined vehicles can be updated. AI-defined vehicles are designed to adapt and change throughout their lifespan.The AI system will manage motor power delivery, battery health, cooling systems, and fault prediction. The vehicle's behaviour can be adjusted based on real-world usage patterns.Matter's current AERA motorcycle is a software-defined vehicle. It includes a Hypershift gearbox, liquid-cooled motor and battery, and specific battery pack designs. The AERA receives updates through software without hardware modifications.The company stated that its development will focus on both AI and new materials. The work includes motors without rare-earth materials, battery management systems, and sensor integration. The AI is designed to control how these materials function during operation.The AIDV platform represents Matter's shift from electric vehicle manufacturing to technology development for two-wheelers. The company plans to release products based on this platform over the next 36-48 months.Matter also announced plans to expand into five vehicle segments, all built on a shared AI-powered platform covering hardware, software, computing, and data.These segments include Naked Street Motorcycles, Street Fighter Motorcycles, Adventure (ADV) Motorcycles, Youth-Focused Commuter Motorcycles, and Electric Scooters.This strategy will allow Matter to address a significant portion of India's two-wheeler market through one core, scalable technology platform.The company announced more than 400 technology innovations and 97 granted patents, which further emphasized the company's intellectual property and technology base.With the AIDV platform, Matter has articulated its vision to move from mechanically defined motorcycles to AI-defined electric motorcycles.Speaking at the event, Mohal Lalbhai, Founder and Group CEO of Matter, said:","Matter unveiled India's first AI-Defined Vehicle (AIDV) platform at its Technology Day 3.0 event.

Politically toxic and…: Why space has become an essential frontier in the AI race for Elon Musk and other tech CEOs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/politically-toxic-and-why-space-has-become-an-essential-frontier-in-the-ai-race-for-elon-musk-and-other-tech-ceos/articleshow/127003400.cms,"SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, is reportedly planning to build data centers in orbit, aiming to fund this ambitious project through a substantial IPO. The idea leverages constant solar power and space's vacuum for cooling, addressing Earth's power grid strain and AI's growing energy demands. This move could position SpaceX as a dominant force in future AI computing.

Space isn't Musk's dream alone; Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, and Jeff Bezos all want to go to space.

Cooling AI chips in space remains the biggest engineering challenge





Elon Musk thinks he's solved one of AI's biggest problems: where to put all those power-hungry data centers. According to an Axios report citing people briefed on the plans, SpaceX believes it has cracked the code on building orbiting data centers, and plans to use its upcoming $30+ billion IPO to fund the vision.The logic is straightforward. Earth's power grids are struggling, and data centers—especially the massive facilities training AI models—are becoming what Musk and other executives call ""politically toxic"" as they drain electricity from homes and factories. So why not move computing off the planet entirely?Musk isn't dreaming alone. OpenAI 's Sam Altman has explored acquiring rocket startups to build his own orbital fleet. Google launched Project Suncatcher, aiming to send its custom AI chip to space by 2027. Jeff Bezos predicts space data centers within 10 to 20 years. Even Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is excited, calling space ""the lowest cost place for data centers.""Space offers tantalizing advantages. Satellites in high orbits can access sunlight 24/7, harvesting solar power without nighttime gaps or cloudy days. SpaceX plans to launch massive next-generation Starlink satellites using its Starship rocket, the only vehicle powerful enough to carry the heavy cooling systems AI chips demand.Data would zip between satellites via laser beams through the vacuum of space—no undersea cables required.Reality, however, is unforgiving. Cooling computers in space is extraordinarily difficult because there's no air to carry heat away from processors. Musk claims SpaceX has designed massive foldable radiators that unfurl in orbit to vent heat into deep space, but skeptics remain unconvinced.Then there's maintenance. On Earth, upgrading a data center means swapping out hardware. In space, you'd need advanced robotics or fresh satellite launches every time something breaks. The solar panels alone would be staggering—one proposed 5-gigawatt facility would need panels stretching 2.5 miles wide.SpaceX is targeting a $1.5 trillion valuation with revenues hitting $24 billion in 2026, mostly from Starlink. Google owns roughly 7% of the company, meaning it wins either way. If Musk pulls this off, SpaceX won't just own transportation to space—it'll control the computing power driving AI's future.",SpaceX is reportedly planning to build data centers in orbit.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has shared a lighthearted incident at his early days as a founder, revealing that his “only regret” involves a luxury car which cost him a multibillion-dollar fortune and is now the “most expensive car in the world”. Speaking at the World Economic Forum at Davos on the rise of Nvidia, Huang recalled a moment from the company’s early days when the market capitalisation was relatively modest $300 million.At the time, wanting to make his parents' happy, Huang sold a portion of his Nvidia holdings to purchase a high-end Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Huang jokingly called its the ‘most expensive vehicle in the word’.""My only regret was selling $NVDA stock when the market cap was $300 million to buy my parents a Mercedes S-Class,"" Huang said with a laugh. “It’s the most expensive car in the world now.”Nvidia’s market cap has soared past $4 trillion, which means the stock he sold to buy that Mercedes would be worth billions of dollars at today's share price.At a packed mainstage session, Huang described artificial intelligence (AI) as the foundation of what he called “the largest infrastructure buildout in human history” that will drive job creation across the global economy.He said that AI is not as a single technology but a “five-layer cake” that includes energy, chips and computing infrastructure, cloud data centres, AI models and the application layer.Since every layer of AI’s five-layer stack must be built and operated, Huang said the platform shift is creating jobs across the economy — from energy and construction to advanced manufacturing, cloud operations and application development.“This layer on top, ultimately, is where economic benefit will happen,” Huang said. From energy and power generation to chip manufacturing, data center construction and cloud operations, Huang said the AI buildout is already creating demand for skilled labor.",Jensen Huang sold $300 million of Nvidia stock to buy his parents a Mercedes- Benz S-Class.

Netflix shifts to all-cash offer as Paramount circles





Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is painting an increasingly crowded picture of the streaming battlefield—one where Instagram poses as much threat as traditional studios—as he works to convince regulators and investors that his company's $83 billion Warner Bros Discovery takeover won't stifle competition.""Instagram is coming next,"" Sarandos declared during Netflix's Tuesday earnings call, pointing to Meta's recent launch of a Reels app for TV sets. The warning came as part of a broader argument that Netflix faces fiercer competition than ever, not just from streaming rivals but from social media giants, big tech platforms, and traditional broadcasters all converging on living room screens.Sarandos specifically called out YouTube's transformation from user-generated content hub to full-fledged entertainment destination. ""YouTube has full-length films, new episodes of scripted and unscripted TV shows. They have NFL football games. They have the Oscars. The BBC is going to be producing original content for YouTube soon. They are TV,"" he said.The framing feels carefully calibrated for regulatory scrutiny. Netflix revealed it now commands 325 million subscribers but wants authorities to see a company under siege rather than a consolidating giant. Sarandos noted that networks simulcast major events across linear and streaming, Amazon owns MGM, and Apple competes for Emmys—all evidence of blurred boundaries in what he calls an ""even wider set of options that include streaming, broadcast, cable, gaming, social media, big tech video platforms.""The competitive narrative comes as Netflix pivots to a pure $27.75-per-share cash offer for Warner Bros Discovery, eliminating the stock component that became problematic after Netflix shares dropped. The move counters Paramount's hostile $30-per-share bid and should accelerate the path to a shareholder vote by April.Instagram's Reels already generates $50 billion annually in advertising revenue, underscoring why Netflix sees Meta's TV push as legitimate competition. For a company asking regulators to approve its biggest acquisition ever, the message is clear: approve this deal because the real threat isn't Netflix getting too big—it's everyone else already competing for the same screen space.","Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is painting an increasingly crowded picture of the streaming battlefield.

This partnership aims to tackle critical healthcare worker shortages by integrating AI technology, providing crucial support to local health systems and communities. The goal is to enhance care quality and accessibility.

What Bill Gates said about the new OpenAI partnership in Africa

The Gates Foundation and OpenAI are announcing an initiative called Horizon1000 to support several countries in Africa, starting in Rwanda, as they apply AI technology to improve their health care systems.

Over the next few years, we will collaborate with leaders in African countries as they pioneer the deployment of AI in health. Together, the Gates Foundation and OpenAI are committing $50 million in funding, technology, and technical support to back their work.

The goal is to reach 1,000 primary healthcare clinics and their surrounding communities by 2028.”

What Bill Gates said about how AI can solve the ‘doctors’ problem in Africa

“​​In Sub-Saharan Africa, which suffers from the world’s highest child mortality rate, there is a shortfall of nearly 6 million health care workers, a gap so large that even the most aggressive hiring and training efforts can’t close it in the foreseeable future.

These huge shortages put health care workers in these countries in an impossible situation. They’re forced to triage too many patients with too little administrative support, modern technology, and up-to-date clinical guidance.

”

“Today’s AI can help save those lives by reaching many more people with much higher-quality care. Rwanda currently has only one health care worker per 1,000 people, far below the WHO recommendation of about four per 1,000. It would take 180 years for that gap to close at the current pace of progress. So, as part of the 4x4 reform initiative, Minister of Health Dr. Sabin Nsanzimana recently announced the launch of an AI-powered Health Intelligence Center in Kigali to help ensure limited health care resources are being used as wisely as possible. As part of the

Horizon1000 initiative

, we aim to accelerate the adoption of AI tools across primary care clinics, within communities, and in people’s homes. These AI tools will support health workers, not replace them,”

“In poorer countries with enormous health worker shortages and lack of health systems infrastructure, AI can be a gamechanger in expanding access to quality care. I believe this partnership with OpenAI, governments, innovators, and health workers in sub-Saharan Africa is a step towards the type of AI we need more of: systems that help people all over the world to solve generational challenges that they simply didn’t know how to address before.

I invite others working on AI to think about how we can put these massively powerful tools to the best use.”

The partnership will provide funding, technology, and technical support to governments pioneering AI deployment in health care.The initiative represents a major effort to leverage AI in solving the continent's ""doctors' problem,"" which is the shortage of medical professionals, by working directly with local leaders over the next several years to implement these technologies at the community level.In a blog post, the Gates Foundation wrote: “The Gates Foundation has already started several AI projects, while Rwanda opened an AI health centre in Kigali last year. Horizon1000 plans to reach 1,000 primary health clinics and the communities around them in multiple countries by 2028, Gates said.This launch comes as many poorer countries are dealing with significant cuts to aid funding from other nations. Gates said in December that these cuts had led to the first increase in preventable child deaths in over 100 years.AI could be especially helpful in countries that don't have enough trained doctors and nurses, Gates said. He pointed out that sub-Saharan Africa needs about six million more healthcare workers.In the blog post, Gates wrote:Gates added.The tech billionaire explained:","The Gates Foundation and OpenAI are launching a $50 million initiative, Horizon1000, to deploy AI in 1,000 African primary healthcare clinics by 2028.

Quote of the day by Mark Zuckerberg: “Having two identities for yourself is an example of…”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-mark-zuckerberg-having-two-identities-for-yourself-is-an-example-of/articleshow/126987208.cms,"Understanding the context of the Mark Zuckerberg quote

Identity in the age of social media

Integrity as a digital value

Platform responsibility and design choices

The psychological side of multiple identities

Changing norms around authenticity

A broader reflection on digital culture





Questions about identity, authenticity, and openness are more important than ever in a world where digital life and real life often happen at the same time. On social media, people can be different people. ""Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity”, said Mark Zuckerberg , the CEO of Meta. This makes people think more about how they act online. People are worried about more than just how other people act. They are also worried about how having more than one identity affects trust, relationships, and online communities in general. What Zuckerberg said shows how important it is for people to be honest and consistent in what they do, both in person and online. This is especially true now that technology makes it harder to tell the difference between public and private lives.Mark Zuckerberg has always emphasised the importance of being honest on social media. The quote demonstrates that the speaker believes that having several versions of yourself can undermine trust, both in your personal life and in society. Filters, algorithms, and societal standards make people feel compelled to present the best version of themselves online.Even though many individuals do this, it makes you consider how different your real-life and online identities are.Zuckerberg says that being honest means that your actions, values, and identity are all in line with each other and don't change depending on the situation. He thinks that breaking identity into different versions could cause problems and hurt trust, especially online, where trust and credibility are very important.Social media has changed how people show who they are. Users can choose what to share, what to keep private, and how they look on platforms. This flexibility has allowed people to have more than one identity over time. Some people keep their work and personal profiles separate, while others show a very curated version of their life online that is very different from how it really is.These habits aren't always bad, but they can make people feel like they have to do well instead of being honest. The quote shows that this separation could change how you see yourself and how others see how you act online. It's harder to trust when identity is split up.Being honest and having morals that don't change is what integrity has always meant. It also talks about how people behave on different digital platforms. According to Zuckerberg, being honest means being able to be yourself no matter where you are or who you're with.This point of view fits in with bigger talks about fake accounts, false information, and people who act anonymously online. It's not always easy for platforms to find the right balance between being responsible and protecting people's privacy. People are afraid that having more than one identity will hurt their honesty because they think people might use fake names or anonymity to lie, trick, or avoid being held accountable.The quote also talks about how social media sites are made. For years, Meta has been trying to get rules that say people have to use their real names and show who they are. They say that using your real name online makes things safer and nicer. People have different ideas about these rules, but they are based on the idea that being responsible makes people act better online.Platforms try to stop harassment, false information, and abuse by not letting people have more than one identity. Zuckerberg's statement supports the idea that being honest is a personal responsibility and a design principle that applies to online spaces.The brain has a hard time remembering all the different people. Psychological research suggests that switching between different personas can increase stress and decrease emotional health. People may feel like they have to live up to a fake version of themselves that they see on the internet.This quote from Zuckerberg shows that there is some tension. People are more likely to be honest when they have a single, unchanging identity. This makes them more like what they say they are. People can get along better and make more real connections when things are the same.People's ideas about what is real on the internet have changed. Users are putting more value on people, businesses, and influencers. People are less likely to pay attention if they think something is fake or doesn't make sense.People's ideas about what is real on the web have changed. People, businesses, and influencers are becoming more important to users. People are less likely to pay attention if they think something is fake or doesn't make sense.People who don't use social media can still hear what Zuckerberg has to say. They are part of a larger cultural trend in which technology, being seen, and always being in touch with other people shape who you are. As your digital footprints become permanent, it gets harder to tell the difference between who you are online and who you are in real life.The quote reminds us that technology can help us say what we want to say, but we still have to be honest. You should always be honest, open, and responsible, no matter what platform or medium you use.","Mark Zuckerberg has always emphasised the importance of being honest on social media. According to Zuckerberg, being honest means being yourself no matter where you are or who you're with.

Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis feels maybe Sam Altman has realised what everyone's big worry about OpenAI is,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ai-ceo-demis-hassabis-feels-maybe-sam-altman-has-realised-what-everyones-big-worry-about-openai-is/articleshow/126982041.cms,"ChatGPT is dying, warns veteran investors

OpenAI may be planning one of largest IPOs

When Sam Altman acknowledged what many observers already suspect





Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis has said that the company does not have “any plans” to bring ads in Gemini app. Speaking during an interview in Davos, Hassabis also called rival OpenAI ’s recent ChatGPT ad test a premature revenue push. Last week, OpenAI announced that it will begin testing ads in ChatGPT in the coming weeks. Commenting on the announcement, Hassabis said “It's interesting they've gone for that so early,” adding “Maybe they feel they need to make more revenue. ”Investors have recently warned of a potential financial risk at OpenAI. In November last year, tech analyst and professor Scott Galloway issued a warning against possible financial implosion at OpenAI which he then described as a “trainwreck from a financial management perspective.” He then explained that OpenAI is currently generating an estimated $13 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR), yet it is spending more than double that amount.This week, veteran investor George Noble argued that the company is ""falling apart in real time"" despite its eye-watering $500 billion valuation. In a scathing analysis titled ‘OPENAI IS FALLING APART IN REAL TIME’ on X, Noble highlighted what he calls unmistakable signs of trouble. The biggest red flag? OpenAI's internal ""Code Red"" memo in December, where Sam Altman reportedly told employees to drop everything as Google's Gemini eats into ChatGPT's dominance.The threat isn't hypothetical—ChatGPT traffic has dropped for two straight months while Gemini exploded to 650 million monthly users.In the post, Noble cited Microsoft disclosures showing OpenAI burned through $12 billion in a single quarter to back his claims. Deutsche Bank has also projected the company will rack up $143 billion in cumulative losses before seeing profit. OpenAI's video tool Sora alone costs $15 million daily to run, with even its own lead engineer admitting the economics are ""completely unsustainable.""There have been signs that the company may be preparing for an IPO. In October 2025, Reuters reported that OpenAI was considering filing with securities regulators as early as the second half of 2026. When asked on a podcast whether OpenAI would go public next year, Altman THEN said, ""I don't know.""Two-months later, a report claimed that OpenAI is taking early steps toward an IPO. The company, as per Reuters, is said to be in early discussions and is being valued at about $830 billion. The report also said chief financial officer Sarah Friar is aiming for a stock market listing in 2027, with a possible IPO filing in late 2026.Speaking to The Verge last year, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned of an AI bubble. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited. Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,” he then said.","Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis has said that the company does not have “any plans” to bring ads in Gemini app. Hassabis also called rival OpenAI ’s recent ChatGPT ad test a premature revenue push.

Supply bottlenecks add pressure

Anxiety and distrust on the rise





Central banks and investors have warned that artificial intelligence (AI) could face a sharp correction if it fails to deliver on expectations. Now, Deutsche Bank has issued a fresh warning, saying 2026 could be the hardest year yet for the AI sector, says a CNBC report. In a note titled “The honeymoon is over,” the bank said that while AI spending has supported economic growth, most CEOs are not seeing clear business benefits from the technology. According to the bank, AI’s impact remains largely limited to “Silicon Valley and to savvy early adopters,” who tend to work on personal projects, not an “average chief executive” looking for revenue and operational improvements.“AI will survive,” Deutsche Bank analysts Adrian Cox and Stefan Abrudan wrote, but they said the sector will face “disillusionment, dislocation, and distrust.” They noted that AI’s benefits are still limited to early adopters and technology-focused teams, rather than average company leaders seeking clear revenue gains.“AI investment and optimism are buoying the global economy, accounting for most of economic and earnings growth in the US last year,” they said. However, most firms lack the data and systems needed to use AI at scale. While coding tools have improved quickly, the analysts said AI agents are harder to deploy than many claims suggest.“For most people this feels less like changing from a horse to a tractor and more like upgrading to a more comfortable saddle,” they wrote.Deutsche Bank said AI growth is being slowed by shortages in computing power, energy and skilled workers. “AI depends on the most complex supply chain in history and any one of hundreds of thousands of components can derail the process,” the analysts wrote.They said memory shortages are a growing concern as AI use shifts from training to daily deployment. Energy supply for data centres remains a deeper issue. At the same time, demand continues to rise as companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google invest heavily, while countries push for “sovereign AI” systems.“Anxiety about AI will go from a low hum to a loud roar this year,” Cox and Abrudan wrote, pointing to lawsuits over copyright, privacy and the impact of chatbots on young users. Job losses linked to AI are another concern, though the analysts warned of exaggeration. “AI redundancy washing will be a significant feature of 2026,” they said.They also flagged growing competition between the US and China, adding that “there will be an escalating attempt to own the global standard.”","Deutsche Bank says 2026 could be the hardest year yet for the AI sector.

Cloud Benefits of Cloud Sovereignty

Big Tech Adoption: The Names You Need to Know

What is a Sovereign Cloud?

The key principles of digital sovereignty

Data storage: Where exactly is the data

Where exactly is the data Data privacy: Who can access it

Who can access it Security and privacy: How is the data kept safe from hackers or outages

How is the data kept safe from hackers or outages Legal controls: What legal protections do companies have against foreign laws

Access restrictions which means there are limits on who can access the data and to what level. To use the cloud, individuals are often required to have specific citizenship or security clearances.

The second important capability is control over where the cloud is located (data residency), often meaning it must stay in a specific country.

The third, and may be the most important for some organisations is strict compliance. Companies are often required to meet technical and legal specifications by local governments or specific industries (like healthcare or defense).

There may be a requirement where providers ensure that the people maintaining the cloud are residents or citizens of that country. For example, a country ABC who has data centre in XYZ may require that the data can only be accessed by a citizen of XYZ country and not someone who is on work visa.

One of the fundamental requirements is having separate regions and secure systems that are completely cut off from the public internet, enabling privacy and security.

Along with physical arrangements, data encryption is another high-regarded condition for digital sovereignty. This sometimes require allowing the customer to “bring their own keys” so that even the cloud provider cannot see the data.

What are the benefits of Cloud Sovereignty

Establishing a sovereign cloud pays off in several ways. For example, sovereign cloud are compliance-friendly which means you avoid massive fines by following local laws (like GDPR in Europe).

Another advantage is getting the required technical expertise. Organisations can get high-end cloud technology without having to build it themselves from scratch which not only saves time but also money.

Third is operational control where you know who has the “keys” to the digital kingdom and who can access it.

Moreover it also has supply chain sufficiency advantages. For example, a cloud computing provider is able to procure hardware (chips, servers) more easily than a single company can. That’s less of a headache and waiting times.

Finally, geopolitical resilience. The world is witnessing trade wars and conflicts, and having your data in a sovereign cloud protects you if a foreign government tries to “turn off” your access. So you have control on your digital kingdom even if the odds are against you.

What are the challenges of Cloud Sovereignty

The first is complexity of rules. In a digital-first world, regulations are changed quickly, hence finding a provider that stays up-to-date becomes hard.

Finding the right protection level is another drawback. What type of services do you want, what should be the level of encryption, on-premise or connected through special communication? These questions may confuse customers.

Disaster recovery. What happens if the data centre is destroyed in an earthquake. You need backup. And if you require your data to stay in your country, you have to have another data centre in the same country itself which means a larger local footprint.

Delay in feature rollout can be another problem. For example, some paying customers get features earlier than the free ones. Similarly, as AI makes inroads, companies may first roll out new AI features or tools to the “Global” cloud first and take months or years to reach the “Sovereign” cloud.

Finally, getting the legal paperwork and certifications for a sovereign cloud is a time-consuming and expensive process.

Conclusion





In recent years, privacy and security have become paramount as nations move to safeguard their citizens' data. As the internet boomed and processing shifted to cloud computing, global access became the norm. However, concerns regarding data collection and its exploitation for advertising started to raise eyebrows. In response, several governments introduced a new set of regulations, requiring consumer data to remain within national borders. These data sovereignty measures, combined with increased transparency, aim to restore public trust in digital solutions.Reasons for keeping data within a certain national or regional geographic boundary vary. For example, tech companies want their employee data secured and governments want to keep sensitive data of their citizens, such as personally identifiable information (PII) within borders, and this requirement is called digital sovereignty or data sovereignty. One way organisations can satisfy digital sovereignty requirements is to store everything in a data centre within the country or region. This ensures that the data is not accessible to outside entities.The second way is to use a sovereign cloud that is designed to offer all the advantages of cloud computing but also meeting all the sovereignty requirements.In this article, we are explaining:A sovereign cloud is nothing but a cloud environment that enables an organisation or country meet its digital sovereignty requirements like data residency, access control and operational independence while delivering the benefits of the cloud model. It is more than just a data centre in a specific region; it is a specialised infrastructure that offers all data, metadata and administrative operations under the jurisdiction of a specific nation or region.An easy way to understand it is that a sovereign cloud may be housed at a facility owned by a cloud computing provider but can only be accessed by a particular organisation’s user and non-cloud IT systems over the internet or via specialised communications links that are not connected to the internet.It can be explained in easier way: A US-based company ABC can provide a Sovereign Cloud facility in India though a trusted partner like XYZ on behalf of ABC, in accordance with the rules of that particular country for specific type of data. For example, Thales and Google Cloud have a strategic partnership in France to offer a secure, sovereign cloud for sensitive military data which remains in France.Sovereign Cloud can also be configured as a separate “cloudlike” installation within a large organization’s own data centre. In this way, ABC will have an installation that acts like a cloud environment in its own data centre, is maintained by the cloud service provider but it will not be connected physically with the outside world.Digital sovereignty depends on four pillars:In many cases, sovereignty compliance requirements go beyond simply “storing a database”, and requires more capabilities. These include:Just like a coin has two sides, despite these multiple perks, there are major hurdles to overcome when it comes to Cloud Sovereignty.The European Union (EU) is an example of the most advanced region for sovereign cloud. The region consists of many nations and each nation has their own rules, in addition to the region-wise rules. This means that a proper EU-compliant sovereign cloud must satisfy two set of regulations: the first is EU-wide rules like GDPR and, the second is national rules like France's SecNumCloud or Germany's BSI requirements.The main driver for these requirement is the US CLOUD Act. Under this law, US law enforcement is allowed to demand data from US companies even if that data is stored in Europe. For example, a US-based ABC company has a data centre in XYZ country. US CLOUD Act allows America to ask data from ABC company’s data centre even if its built within XYZ borders. This creates a legal “clash” for European companies.In case of single countries like India, US, Australia, and more, cloud service providers have to follow just one set of rules that have been set. However, the EU model is different with one umbrella rule and separate rules of each country in the region which allows them to focus on Strategic Autonomy. Projects like Gaia-X have been developed to create a federated ecosystem. Gaia-X is a set of rules that lets many different European providers work together, ensuring that Europe isn't dependent on a single foreign tech giant.By 2026, the world's biggest tech companies have shifted from resisting sovereignty to embracing it as a massive business opportunity. Big Tech players like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Cloud, Google Cloud, Oracle and VMware are some of the biggest names in this industry.In January 2026, AWS officially launched its European Sovereign Cloud (ESC) – a completely separate partition from its global cloud. It is physically and logically isolated, meaning no data moves to the US.Amazon's cloud computing division said that it would expand its “sovereign cloud” across the EU as the countries seek to safeguard their citizens' data. The first is open in Brandenburg in Germany and the company plans to expand its physical “footprint” into Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal. According to AWS, the expansion would “provide organisations with further options to deploy workloads in the cloud with the highest level of sovereignty and operational independence”.Microsoft has taken a “partnership” approach by creating the Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty in 2025. They have partnered with Thales in France to create a company called Bleu, and in Germany, they worked with Delos Cloud. These independent companies use Microsoft's technology but are owned and operated by local entities. Microsoft also expanded local data processing for its Copilot AI to 15 different countries, including India and Switzerland.Google has followed a similar path to Microsoft, focusing on “Trusted Cloud” partnerships. As mentioned above, in France, Google is working with Thales to keep defence data secure, and in Germany, they work with T-Systems (a division of Deutsche Telekom). Google offers high-speed AI and cloud tools while the local partner holds the encryption keys and manages the data centers.Oracle, a leader in “distributed cloud”, operates two major EU Sovereign Cloud regions in Frankfurt and Madrid as of 2026.“Designed for data residency and security, the Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud architecture shares no infrastructure with Oracle’s commercial regions and has no backbone network connection to Oracle’s other cloud regions. Customer access to Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud is managed separately from access to Oracle Cloud’s commercial regions,” Oracle said on its website.VMware runs a Sovereign Cloud Initiative with a network of over 50 local partners worldwide. Instead of building their own data centers everywhere, they provide the software (like VMware Cloud Foundation) to local providers in Northern Europe and in India, allowing local providers to offer “Sovereign” status using world-class software.In 2026, the question for organisations and governments appears to have changed from, “Do we need a sovereign cloud” to “How quickly and what type of sovereignty is best for them”. Whether it is for high-stakes government defense or protecting the privacy of a hospital's patients, sovereign cloud is bridging the gap between the the necessity to have everywhere access power provided by cloud computing and the need of absolute control on data.","The key principles of digital sovereignty are: Data storage, security and privacy. To use the cloud, individuals are often required to have specific citizenship or security clearances. The second important capability is control over where the cloud is located (data residency), often meaning it must stay in a specific country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126963045,imgsize-170680,width-400,resizemode-4/sovereign-cloud.jpg"

How the age prediction tool works





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has now announced new safety features for its popular chatbot. The company has now introduced an age prediction model designed to protect teenagers from harmful content, following mounting criticism over the platform’s impact on young users. “We’re rolling out age prediction on ChatGPT consumer plans to help determine whether an account likely belongs to someone under 18, so the right experience and safeguards can be applied to teens. As we’ve outlined in our Teen Safety Blueprint⁠ and Under-18 Principles for Model Behavior⁠, young people deserve technology that both expands opportunity and protects their well-being,” said OpenAI in a blog post.The company has revealed that the age reduction system will enable the chatbot to determine whether an account belongs to someone under 18. If so, then the chatbot will automatically add additional safeguards, such as restricting access to:* Graphic violence or gory content* Viral challenges that could encourage risky behavior* Sexual, romantic, or violent role play* Depictions of self-harm* Content promoting extreme beauty standards or unhealthy dietingChatGPT uses an age prediction model to help estimate whether an account likely belongs to someone under 18. The model looks at a combination of behavioral and account-level signals, including how long an account has existed, typical times of day when someone is active, usage patterns over time, and a user’s stated age.The company claims that deploying age prediction helps us learn which signals improve accuracy, and we use those learnings to continuously refine the model over time.OpenAI has also said that the users who are incorrectly placed in the under-18 experience will always have a fast, simple way to confirm their age and restore their full access with a selfie through Persona, a secure identity-verification service. Users can check if safeguards have been added to their account and start this process at any time by going to Settings > Account.In addition to these safeguards, parents can choose to customize their teen’s experience further through parental controls⁠ (opens in a new window) including setting quiet hours when ChatGPT can not be used, controlling features such as memory or model training, and receiving notifications if signs of acute distress are detected.","ChatGPT uses an age prediction model to help estimate whether an account likely belongs to someone under 18.

Zuckerberg doubles down on AI glasses as metaverse dreams fade

Studios shuttered, fitness app shelved as Meta redefines VR strategy





A Meta executive broke his silence on the company's VR future this week, directly addressing growing fears that the tech giant is abandoning virtual reality. Dilmer Valecillos, a Developer Advocate at Meta, jumped into a conversation on X to set the record straight: ""I can tell you personally that we are not getting out of VR. ""His comment came after VR content creator Matt voiced what many in the community were thinking—that Meta's recent layoffs and radio silence were raising serious red flags. Valecillos didn't just offer empty reassurances. He revealed he's now working on a team ""fully focused on VR programs and education,"" adding that he wouldn't be doing this work if he didn't believe VR had a real future.The timing matters. Meta just cut roughly 1,500 people from Reality Labs, the division building its VR headsets and metaverse projects. That's about 10% of the team gone in one sweep.Mark Zuckerberg is making a hard pivot. The CEO is pulling money away from metaverse projects and pumping it into AI-powered wearables instead. Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses have become an unexpected hit, selling over 2 million pairs. Demand in the US has been so strong that the company delayed its international rollout.Meanwhile, the metaverse bet hasn't paid off. Horizon Worlds, the virtual social platform Zuckerberg once championed as the future, never cracked 200,000 monthly users.Most of the user-created worlds sat empty. Meta renamed itself from Facebook in 2021, staking everything on this vision. Reality Labs has burned through more than $70 billion since 2020 with little to show for it.The company is now spending between $70 billion and $72 billion on AI infrastructure, with plans to increase that figure this year.The cuts hit hard across Meta's VR operations. The company closed studios like Armature, Twisted Pixel, and Sanzaru outright. Supernatural, a VR fitness app Meta bought for $400 million just two years ago, got moved to maintenance mode—basically a skeleton crew keeping the lights on with no new content coming.Interestingly, Palmer Luckey, who founded Oculus before Meta acquired it, defended the layoffs. He argued Meta's own game studios were actually hurting the VR ecosystem by crowding out independent developers with heavily subsidized titles. It's a tough-love take, but he framed the cuts as getting back to Oculus's original playbook of supporting third-party creators rather than competing with them.Meta hasn't issued any formal statement addressing what this all means for Quest headsets or VR development going forward.","Dilmer Valecillos, a Developer Advocate at Meta, said the tech giant is not abandoning virtual reality.

AI regulations in the US



California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed bills in October addressing child safety concerns around AI and social media.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul passed the Responsible AI Safety and Education Act in December, imposing transparency and safety requirements on large AI developers.

Salesforce CEO criticise section 230 debate







Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has now urged the governments across the world to impose stronger regulation on artificial intelligence. Benioff warned that the technology risks repeating the same mistakes made with unregulated social media platforms. Speaking to CNBC’s Sarah Eisen at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Benioff said AI has already shown disturbing consequences. “This year, you really saw something pretty horrific, which is these AI models became suicide coaches,” Benioff said, pointing to documented cases of self-harm linked to AI interactions.The latest remarks made by Benioff echoed his earlier warnings around social media. Back in 2018, the Salesforce CEO compared social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram to cigarette, calling them addictive and harmful. “Bad things were happening all over the world because social media was fully unregulated,” he said Tuesday. “And now you’re kind of seeing that play out again with artificial intelligence. ”AI regulations in the US still remain fragmented. In the absence of federal guardrails, states have begun enacting their own laws:Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has pushed back against what he called “excessive State regulation,” signing an executive order in December to block such efforts.The order argued that U.S. AI companies must remain free to innovate without “cumbersome regulation.”Benioff also strongly criticised the section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The particular act provide shield to tech companies from the liability of over-generated content. “It’s funny, tech companies, they hate regulation. They hate it, except for one. They love Section 230,” Benioff said. “So if this large language model coaches this child into suicide, they’re not responsible because of Section 230. That’s probably something that needs to get reshaped, shifted, changed.”Both Republicans and Democrats have raised concerns about Section 230, though consensus on reform remains elusive. Benioff concluded with the thought “There’s a lot of families that, unfortunately, have suffered this year, and I don’t think they had to.”",Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has urged governments to impose stronger regulation on artificial intelligence.

Sam Altman to Elon Musk: You take ""every accusation is a confession"" so far

Sometimes you complain about ChatGPT being too restrictive, and then in cases like this you claim it's too relaxed. Almost a billion people use it and some of them may be in very fragile mental states. We will continue to do our best to get this right and we feel huge responsibility to do the best we can, but these are tragic and complicated situations that deserve to be treated with respect.

It is genuinely hard; we need to protect vulnerable users, while also making sure our guardrails still allow all of our users to benefit from our tools.

Apparently more than 50 people have died from crashes related to Autopilot. I only ever rode in a car using it once, some time ago, but my first thought was that it was far from a safe thing for Tesla to have released. I won't even start on some of the Grok decisions.

India’s next online education wave driven by tier 2 and tier 3 cities: Univo CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indias-next-online-education-wave-driven-by-tier-2-and-tier-3-cities-univo-ceo/articleshow/126950502.cms,"



India’s online higher education market is entering a new phase of growth, powered by students from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, according to Siddharth Banerjee, CEO of Univo Education. Banerjee said the country’s digital learning landscape is evolving beyond metro audiences, with smaller cities increasingly turning to online degrees and certifications for flexible, affordable learning and better career outcomes. “India is not one market — it is many Indias. Learning models built only for metro audiences often don’t work for Bharat,” Banerjee noted.A key driver of this shift is India’s mobile-first reality. Industry studies show that 79% of students attend online classes on smartphones, while only 17% use laptops. This has pushed platforms to redesign content for smaller screens, patchy internet access, and varied learner readiness.Banerjee emphasised that learners outside metros often need more than just content access. “Assisted onboarding, WhatsApp and IVR-based help, and local facilitators can make online education more usable for learners outside large cities,” he said.Acceptance of online education is also improving with the UGC’s approval of regulated online degree programmes under NEP 2020. This shift is moving the sector from short-term courses to formal, university-led qualifications, boosting credibility among students and employers.Employability remains central to online education’s appeal. Univo partners with industry leaders such as TCS iON, HCLTech, KPMG, Medvarsity, and Paytm to provide internships, capstone projects, and live industry sessions, ensuring learners gain practical exposure alongside academic credentials.Looking ahead, Banerjee linked the sector’s expansion to India’s ambition of raising the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) to 50% by 2035, up from the current 28%. He also highlighted the broader Viksit Bharat 2047 vision to strengthen India’s education ecosystem.“As India’s economy expands, education models must become more flexible, affordable and aligned with industry needs — especially for learners beyond metros,” Banerjee said.","India’s online higher education market is entering a new phase of growth, powered by students from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. “India is not one market — it is many Indias.

“Perhaps Musk needs a break… book your seat now before Musk gets one.”





Europe’s largest airline, Ryanair Holdings has turned its war of words with Tesla CEO Elon Musk into a full-blown marketing stunt. The company shared a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) unveiling a cheekily titled “Great Idiots Seat Sale” after CEO Michael O’Leary branded the Tesla chief an “idiot. ” The reason for this online feud: Ryanair’s refusal to invest in Starlink like its rival Lufthansa has and Tesla CEO saying that the airlines will lose customers if they don’t give Wi-Fi on planes. O’Leary flatly rejected Starlink service for which company rivals are racing to install across their fleets, citing a “2% fuel penalty” that he refuses to pass on to travelers. Notably, Ryanair is a short-distance airline for budget-conscious customers, with fares starting from 15 pounds.Earlier this week, Ryanair announced via X that O’Leary will hold a press conference in Dublin to “address/undress” Musk’s latest online “tantrum.” The airline boss didn’t hold back, quipping: “Musk knows even less about airline ownership rules than he does about aircraft aerodynamics.”Capitalizing on the viral spat, Ryanair rolled out a limited-time promotion: 100,000 seats priced at €16.99 one way, aimed at Musk and “other idiots on X.” In its post, the airline joked:This move from Rynair comes after repeated jabs from Musk, who recently called O’Leary “an utter idiot” for rejecting Starlink satellite internet on Ryanair’s fleet, citing fuel efficiency concerns.

He cites internal ""Code Red"" alerts, declining ChatGPT traffic, massive quarterly losses of $12 billion, and unsustainable costs for tools like Sora. Key departures and Elon Musk's lawsuit further highlight significant internal turmoil and financial strain.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Read George Noble’s full note on OpenAI

OPENAI IS FALLING APART IN REAL TIME

I've watched companies implode for decades.

This one has all the warning signs.

OpenAI declared ""Code Red"" in December.

Altman sent an internal memo telling employees to drop everything because Google's Gemini 3 is eating their lunch. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly ditched ChatGPT for Gemini after using it for two hours.

ChatGPT traffic fell in November. Second month-over-month decline of 2025.

Meanwhile Gemini jumped to 650 million monthly active users.

The company that was supposed to build AGI can't keep its chatbot competitive.

But the real story is the money...

OpenAI lost $12 BILLION in a single quarter according to Microsoft's own fiscal disclosures.

Deutsche Bank estimates $143 billion in cumulative negative cash flow before the company turns profitable.

Their analysts put it bluntly: ""No startup in history has operated with losses on anything approaching this scale.""

They're burning $15 million per day on Sora alone.

$5 billion annually to generate copyright-infringing memes.

Even Sora's lead engineer admitted the ""economics are currently completely unsustainable.""

Here's the big math problem nobody wants to discuss:

It's going to cost 5x the energy and money to make these models 2x better.

The low-hanging fruit is gone.

Every incremental improvement now requires exponentially more compute, more data centers, more power.

Reports suggest OpenAI's large training runs in 2025 failed to produce models better than prior versions.

GPT-5 launched to widespread disappointment. Users called it ""underwhelming"" and ""horrible."" OpenAI had to restore GPT-4o within 24 hours because users preferred the old model.

Altman had promised GPT-5 would make GPT-4 feel ""mildly embarrassing."" Instead, users complained it was worse at basic math and geography.

They've released GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2 since.

Same complaints each time: too corporate, too safe, robotic, boring.

The talent exodus makes this even worse:

CTO Mira Murati. Gone.

Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew. Gone.

Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever. Gone.

President Greg Brockman. Gone.

Half the AI safety team departed. Multiple executives reportedly cited ""psychological abuse"" under Altman's leadership.

And now Elon Musk is suing for up to $134 billion.

A federal judge just ruled the case goes to jury trial in April. There's ""plenty of evidence"" that OpenAI's leaders promised to maintain the nonprofit structure that Musk funded.

Musk provided $38 million in early funding based on those assurances. Now he wants his share of the $500 billion valuation.

OpenAI called it ""harassment."" But the judge disagreed.

Here's what I think happens next:

The AI hype cycle is peaking.

The diminishing returns are becoming impossible to hide.

Competitors are catching up.

The lawsuits are piling up.

OpenAI needs to generate $200 billion in annual revenue by 2030 to justify their projections.

That's 15x growth in five years while costs keep exploding.

Even Sam Altman admitted investors are ""overexcited"" about AI.

His exact words: ""Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money.""

If I were running an AI startup with good traction right now, I'd be looking for an exit.

Sell into the hype before the music stops.

My positioning:

I'm not touching OpenAI-adjacent plays at these valuations. The risk profile is astronomical.

If you're exposed to the Magnificent 7 through AI infrastructure bets, consider trimming. The gap between promised revolution and delivered reality has never been wider.

The smart money is rotating into sectors where valuations actually reflect fundamentals.

Small and mid-caps are trading near decade lows relative to Big Tech while earnings growth is only marginally lower.

Markets can price risk. But they can't price chaos.

And OpenAI is chaos dressed up in a $500 billion valuation.





Veteran investor George Noble has issued a stark warning about OpenAI , arguing the AI darling is ""falling apart in real time"" despite its eye-watering $500 billion valuation.In a scathing analysis on X, Noble highlighted what he calls unmistakable signs of trouble. The biggest red flag? OpenAI's internal ""Code Red"" memo in December, where Sam Altman reportedly told employees to drop everything as Google's Gemini eats into ChatGPT's dominance. The threat isn't hypothetical—ChatGPT traffic has dropped for two straight months while Gemini exploded to 650 million monthly users.The financial bleeding is worse. Noble points to Microsoft disclosures showing OpenAI burned through $12 billion in a single quarter. Deutsche Bank projects the company will rack up $143 billion in cumulative losses before seeing profit. OpenAI's video tool Sora alone costs $15 million daily to run, with even its own lead engineer admitting the economics are ""completely unsustainable.""Then there's the talent exodus. CTO Mira Murati, Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever, and half the AI safety team have all walked out the door. Meanwhile, GPT-5 flopped so badly that OpenAI had to restore GPT-4 within 24 hours after users revolted.Now Elon Musk's $134 billion lawsuit heads to trial in April, with a federal judge finding solid evidence OpenAI broke promises about staying nonprofit.Noble's bottom line: the AI hype is peaking just as reality catches up, and OpenAI needs to grow revenue 15x in five years while costs spiral out of control.","Veteran investor George Noble warns OpenAI is ""falling apart"" despite its $500 billion valuation.

Trump-Era case continues despite Zuckerberg 's courtship

What's actually at stake for Meta





The Federal Trade Commission is taking another swing at Meta, filing an appeal Tuesday to challenge a November ruling that cleared the tech giant of monopoly charges. The move keeps alive the government's years-long effort to potentially force Meta to divest Instagram and WhatsApp—acquisitions made over a decade ago for $1 billion and $19 billion respectively.US District Judge James Boasberg had sided with Meta last year, concluding the company doesn't hold an illegal monopoly in personal social networking. His reasoning? The explosive growth of TikTok and YouTube fundamentally reshaped the competitive landscape, undercutting the FTC's arguments about Meta's market dominance.The appeal adds an awkward political dimension for Mark Zuckerberg , who spent much of 2025 attempting to repair his relationship with Donald Trump. Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund and paid $25 million to settle lawsuits over the president's suspended Facebook and Instagram accounts. Despite these overtures, the FTC—now operating under Trump's second term—remains committed to the case.""Meta violated our antitrust laws when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp ,"" FTC spokesperson Joe Simonson said, emphasizing that ""American consumers have suffered from Meta's monopoly.""The agency's Bureau of Competition Director Daniel Guarnera framed the appeal as protecting fair competition, arguing Meta maintained dominance ""not through legitimate competition, but by buying its most significant competitive threats.""If the FTC succeeds on appeal, Meta could face forced restructuring or divestment of its prized acquisitions. The original 2020 lawsuit alleged Meta identified Instagram and WhatsApp as nascent threats and purchased them specifically to eliminate competition—a strategy the government claims allowed Meta to degrade service quality while loading up on ads without fear of users fleeing to alternatives.Meta's response has been measured. Spokesperson Andy Stone simply reiterated that the district court decision was ""correct"" and that Meta ""will remain focused on innovating and investing in America""—echoing Trump-friendly talking points about domestic job creation even as the legal battle intensifies.","The Federal Trade Commission is appealing a ruling that dismissed its monopoly case against Meta.

Netflix is preparing for bringing a redesign of its app as the streaming giant is looking to compete directly with social media platforms for daily user engagement. As reported by TechCrunch, the redesign of the Netflix aims to make the app feel less static library of shows and more like a dynamic, interactive hub. While Netflix remains the world’s largest subscription streaming service, it faces growing competition not just from rival streamers but from social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, which dominate daily attention spans.As per the report, the upcoming redesign of the Netflix app is said to include a personalised feed which will highlight the trending clips, recommendations and interactive prompts. The app is also expected to showcase short-form video previews which will be designed to mimic content style of TikTok. The Netflix app is also tipped to incorporated some interactive features such as polls, quizzes and community discussions related to shows and movies. The app will also focus on daily discovery and will also encourage users to explore beyond their usual watchlist.The challenge faced by Netflix is clear, while users may binge-watch series, they don’t necessarily open the app every day.Social platforms, by contrast, thrive on habitual engagement. By redesigning its app, Netflix hopes to close this gap and position itself as a platform where users spend time even when they’re not watching full episodes or films.The principle of daily engagement plays a crucial role in long-term strategy of Netflix. The frequent app visits could lead to increase retention rate among subscribers. It will also help in boosting advertising opportunities and will also help Netflix in strengthening attention share in an increasingly crowded digital landscape.","Netflix is preparing for bringing a redesign of its app as the streaming giant is looking to compete directly with social media platforms for daily user engagement.

This ambitious forecast hinges on successful ad integration, offering advertisers access to valuable user intent data. The move could shift marketing budgets if OpenAI crafts helpful, conversational ad experiences.

""in the coming weeks.""

How OpenAI’s ad revenue can help the company compete with Google

“OpenAI's move directly challenges this core revenue stream by offering an alternative, highly engaging platform for users to discover products and services. If ChatGPT can successfully integrate ads that are helpful rather than intrusive, it could siphon off valuable commercial queries that traditionally go to Google,”

“conversational”

“high-intent engagement.”





ChatGPT maker OpenAI is expected to generate $25 billion in annual advertising revenue by 2030. According to predictions made by tech analysts, the expected increase in the AI startup’s ad revenue may potentially pose a threat to Google 's dominance in the digital ad market. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney has claimed that OpenAI may reach that level of annual ad revenue by 2030 if it executes well on rolling out this new business. In a note to investors (seen by Business Insider), Mahaney wrote: “A path to generating several billion dollars in ad revenue in 2026, going to $25B+ by 2030, seems reasonable.”However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the likely scale of ChatGPT by that time, the proven monetisation of high-intent performance marketing platforms and the current size of this market, the analyst added. Last week, OpenAI announced that free and ChatGPT Go tier subscribers would start seeing adsThe company also outlined its advertising principles, including clearly labelling ads and not sharing user conversations with advertisers.In a recent blog post, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said that the company’s revenue is growing rapidly. She noted that the startup's annualised revenue topped $20 billion in 2025, up from $2 billion in 2023. However, there are questions over OpenAI's losses and whether it can become profitable in the future.Advertising could be one way for OpenAI to boost its revenue and profits.Mahaney noted that Google's Search and YouTube businesses likely generated close to $300 billion in ad revenue in 2025, with Meta generating an additional $180 billion. These are highly profitable operations, with operating profit margins of 40%, according to the analyst.ChatGPT has almost 1 billion weekly average users, many of whom share valuable details with the chatbot, such as what they want and need.

(Disclaimer: All information about the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's launch date, price, specs, and features comes from leaks and reports from the industry.) Samsung has not officially said these things are true. The final specs, availability, and price may change when the official announcement is made.)





The Galaxy S26 Ultra is Samsung's next high-end smartphone, and the company is getting ready for its release. It will be unveiled at the company's annual Galaxy Unpacked event in February 2026. Multiple leaks from the industry and supply chain reports suggest that the event will take place on February 25, which is a change from Samsung's usual schedule of launching its flagship phones in January. By the middle of March 2026, the Galaxy S26 Ultra should be available in stores.The new device is expected to offer a higher display efficiency, camera performance, battery capacity, and charging speed. The basic design language may be familiar, but it appears that the focus is on improving existing functions rather than adding new ones. Samsung has yet to announce the final specifications, prices, or launch date, so all of the information we have for now comes from leaks and unauthorised reports.According to industry reports, Samsung will hold the Galaxy Unpacked event in February 2026. This would be the first time in a few years that Samsung has pushed back the launch of its flagship phone past January. Reports indicate that the new timeline might help the company finish design changes and make sure there is enough stock for markets around the world.Around the middle of March 2026, after the official announcement, stores are expected to start selling them. Like with previous launches, the device will probably be released in stages in different parts of the world.Pricing leaks suggest that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will follow Samsung's trend of charging a lot for its phones. In India, the higher-end models with more RAM and storage could cost between Rs 1,35,000 and Rs 1,70,000. According to reports, the best configuration in this range has 16GB of RAM and 1TB of internal storage.The base Ultra model in the US is expected to cost around $1,299, which is very similar to the prices of the Galaxy S25 Ultra generation. Prices may be different in different areas, due to taxes and storage options.Galaxy S26 Ultra is rumoured to have a 6.9-inch M14 OLED display. This panel should use less energy and be better at controlling brightness than the ones that came before it. Leaks also suggest that there is a built-in privacy feature that limits the angles from which people can see the screen, which helps keep the screen from being seen in public places.Design updates are expected to be subtle. The phone might have a new camera layout on the back, a slimmer profile, and corners that are a little more rounded. The overall shape is likely to stay the same as Samsung's recent Ultra models.The Galaxy S26 Ultra is likely to keep its 200MP main camera sensor from the Galaxy S25. According to reports, lens coatings are getting better to cut down on glare and reflections, and autofocus is getting faster and more accurate.A better ultrawide lens and a telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom should also be part of the camera setup. These improvements are supposed to make pictures clearer, help the camera work better in low light, and make the zoom work the same way no matter what you're shooting.According to reports, the Galaxy S26 Ultra will last between 5,000mAh and 5,400mAh. This increase should help the device last longer, especially when features that use a lot of power are turned on.Reports suggest that wired connections can now charge quickly at 60W. This would be better than older Ultra models, which charged more slowly over a wired connection. There haven't been any leaks that give specifics about wireless charging yet.In some areas, the Galaxy S26 Ultra will likely have Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor, which will power its performance. Some markets may get versions with Samsung's Exynos 2600 chipset.Both processors are expected to make the device's performance more efficient, allow for more multitasking, and improve the AI features that are built into the device. The device will probably come with Android 16 and the newest version of Samsung's One UI.Leaks suggest that Samsung's plan for the Galaxy S26 Ultra is to improve the way people use their phones every day. Improvements in battery life, display quality, charging speed, and camera responsiveness show that the focus is on usability, consistency, and overall performance rather than big changes to the look of the device.The Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to go head-to-head with other flagship smartphones that come out in early 2026, generating excitement among tech enthusiasts worldwide. This means that Samsung will be one of the first big companies to release high-end phones in the new year.","The Galaxy S26 Ultra is Samsung's next high-end smartphone.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warns US again: Calls selling Al chips to China ‘crazy’ and ‘big mistake’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-warns-us-again-calls-selling-al-chips-to-china-crazy-and-big-mistake/articleshow/126833863.cms,"India To Join Pax Silica As US Signals New Tech Trust Despite Trade Tensions And Tariff Disputes

What is Trump administration’s new trade policy with China

Amodei previously said allowing Nvidia chip sales to China is ‘Mortgaging our future’





Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has once again questioned the Trump administration’s trade policy, slamming the recent approval of selling Nvidia’s H200 artificial intelligence (AI) chip sales to China. He called it a blunder with “incredible national security implications”.“I think this is crazy. It’s a bit like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea. It would be a big mistake to ship these chips,” Amodei said at Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum.Anthropic CEO’s warning comes weeks after President Donald Trump eased the bans on advanced AI chip exports, and approved the sale of AI chips to Beijing. This policy shift is a major victory for Nvidia, which has argued that continued bans merely incentivise China to develop its own domestic alternatives. The chipmaker also claimed that China making their own chips will potentially lock American firms out of the world’s second-largest economy permanently.Under the new guidelines, Nvidia’s H200 will become the most advanced AI chip legally available to Chinese customers. However, multiple reports claim that China has asked its customs officials that Nvidia’s high-end chips are not allowed in the mainland.Meanwhile, AMD is reportedly seeking similar clearance for MI325X to compete in the Chinese market.It is to be noted that Nvidia’s Blackwell and upcoming Vera Rubin architectures will remain strictly restricted for US and allied use.In September, Amodei’s alarmed the US government that American dominance in semiconductor technology is the nation's final strategic leverage over China and that the AI chip embargo was the one area where Washington held a decisive advantage.“It is mortgaging our future as a country to sell these chips to China,” Amodei warned, describing the policy shift as “the single most disastrous national security decision made in this term.”“This could control the fate of nations. This could control the future of freedom and democracy,” Amodei noted during the Axios AI+ DC Summit.","Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei slammed the recent approval of selling Nvidia’s H200 artificial intelligence (AI) chip sales to China.

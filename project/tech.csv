"How DeepSeek, the Chinese competitor to American AI companies OpenAI, Google and Microsoft, solves one of the biggest 'China problem'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-deepseek-the-chinese-competitor-to-american-ai-companies-openai-google-and-microsoft-solves-one-of-the-biggest-china-problem/articleshow/117583639.cms,"Representative image

The Chinese startup DeepSeek has unveiled a new AI system, DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating capabilities comparable to leading chatbots from OpenAI and Google. This achievement is significant in itself, but even more notable is DeepSeek's efficient use of computing resources. According to a report in NewYork Times, DeepSeek's engineers reported using significantly fewer specialized computer chips, crucial components in AI training, than their American counterparts.These chips are central to the technological competition between the U.S. and China, with the U.S. imposing export restrictions to maintain its AI leadership. However, DeepSeek's success highlights potential unintended consequences of these restrictions, as Chinese researchers have been driven to innovate with readily available resources.DeepSeek-V3 reportedly performed on par with existing market offerings in benchmark tests assessing question answering, logic problem-solving, and code generation. Remarkably, DeepSeek achieved this with approximately $6 million in computing power, a fraction of the estimated $60 million spent by Meta on its latest AI technology. This lower cost of entry broadens the field of potential AI developers, as noted by investor Chris V. Nicholson, who pointed out the significant difference between having $6 million versus $100 million or $1 billion available.While leading AI companies often utilize supercomputers with 16,000 or more chips, DeepSeek reportedly used only around 2,000 Nvidia chips. This efficient use of resources was attributed to optimized training methods necessitated by chip constraints in China.Despite U.S. efforts to restrict China's access to advanced chips, including recent regulations aimed at preventing acquisition through third countries, DeepSeek is said to leverage existing resources. The company, backed by quantitative trading firm High Flyer, had previously acquired Nvidia chips and attracted talent with competitive salaries and research opportunities. They even hire individuals without computer science backgrounds to enhance the AI's understanding of diverse subjects like poetry and performance on challenging exams.While U.S. companies continue to innovate, with OpenAI's new ""reasoning"" system being a prime example, DeepSeek's rapid progress, including its own impressive reasoning model, demonstrates its competitiveness, as per the report.A key aspect of this evolving landscape is open-source software. DeepSeek has open-sourced its latest AI system, sharing the code with others. This fosters global collaboration, as noted by Yineng Zhang, a software engineer at Baseten. This open-source approach gained momentum in 2023 with Meta's release of LLama. DeepSeek's contribution demonstrates that smaller players can also contribute significantly to the open-source AI ecosystem.","DeepSeek-V3 reportedly performed on par with existing market offerings in benchmark tests assessing question answering, logic problem-solving, and code generation.

OpenAI faces new copyright case in India over use of books without permission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-faces-new-copyright-case-in-india-over-use-of-books-without-permission/articleshow/117577038.cms,"What the lawsuit says

ANI accuses OpenAI of illegally using its content

Sam Altman-led OpenAI is facing a new copyright lawsuit in India. According to a Reuters report, Indian book publishers and their international counterparts in New Delhi have filed a lawsuit aimed at halting the ChatGPT chatbot’s access to proprietary content. The lawsuit was filed by Federation of Indian Publishers on behalf of the federation's members, including prominent publishers such as Bloomsbury, Penguin Random House, Cambridge University Press, and Pan Macmillan, as well as Indian publishers like Rupa Publications and S.Chand and Co.The case, initially listed before a registrar in New Delhi, will be heard by a judge on January 28.In the lawsuit, the Federation of Indian Publishers argues that OpenAI's services in India should be governed by Indian laws. The federation’s December filing claims OpenAI used its members’ literary works without permission to train ChatGPT, with evidence from publishers. They warn that AI-generated book summaries and extracts, often from unlicensed online copies, threaten their sales.Penguin Random House announced a global initiative in November to include a copyright disclaimer in its books, stating no part may be used to train AI.The report quotes Pranav Gupta, the federation's general secretary who said ""Our ask from the court is that they should stop (OpenAI from) accessing our copyright content.” “In case they don't want to do licensing with us, they should delete datasets used in AI training and explain how we will be compensated. This impacts creativity,” he added.OpenAI is already facing a lawsuit in India. ANI (Asian News International), a prominent news agency alleges that the tech company used its content without permission to train its AI chatbot, ChatGPT. ANI claims that OpenAI not only utilised its copyrighted material without a lawful licence but also accused the company of attributing fabricated news stories to the agency.Globally, the ChatGPT-maker is facing a list of legal challenges from various global news organisations and copyright holders, including The New York Times and The Chicago Tribune, who have similarly accused OpenAI of using their work without authorization.","Indian book publishers and their international counterparts in New Delhi have filed a lawsuit aimed at halting the ChatGPT chatbot’s access to proprietary content.

Google revamps mobile search URLs for a sleeker appearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-revamps-mobile-search-urls-for-a-sleeker-appearance/articleshow/117569233.cms,"Google has announced a major update to its mobile search results, aimed at simplifying the appearance of URLs for a more user-friendly experience. This redesign focuses on presenting a cleaner and more streamlined look, enhancing readability and usability on mobile devices.Like all organising efforts, this one came with its challenges. “Rethinking the visual design for something like Search is really complex,” Aileen says.“That’s especially true given how much Google Search has evolved. We’re not just organising the web’s information, but all the world’s information,” Aileen says. “We started with organising web pages, but now there’s so much diversity in the types of content and information we have to help make sense of.”Previously, Google's mobile search results often displayed long, complex URLs that could be challenging to parse quickly. This change involves removing the breadcrumb element from mobile search results, which frequently got cut off on smaller screens. Instead, Google will now show only the most critical parts of the URL, such as the domain name and a simplified path.Google explained that this update is designed to make it easier for users to understand where a link will take them without unnecessary clutter. The company emphasised that this change will apply to all languages and regions where Google Search is available on mobile. Meanwhile, the breadcrumb element will still be present on desktop search results.“We hope this change makes it easier for people to find what they're looking for when they're searching on mobile,” a Google representative mentioned in a blog post. The cleaner format aims to offer a more intuitive and user-friendly browsing experience , especially on smaller screens.","Google has announced a major update to its mobile search results, aimed at simplifying the appearance of URLs for a more user-friendly experience.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

""I think it's extremely important that OpenAI gets to other platforms quickly because Microsoft is building their own AI and I don't think Microsoft will use OpenAI in the future,"" Benioff said, punctuating his observation with laughter.The partnership's strain appears to be evident with OpenAI's recent plans to expand its cloud infrastructure beyond Microsoft, partnering with SoftBank and Oracle on a $500 billion data center project called Stargate.Benioff highlighted the personal dynamics at play, noting the apparent tension between key executives: "" Mustafa Suleyman and Sam Altman are not best friends.""He pointed to their past interactions as evidence, recalling last year's Davos conference where ""Sam and Mustafa were on panels together and not getting along."" This personal friction coincides with Microsoft's strategic moves, including hiring Suleyman to lead its AI efforts.The partnership's foundation has gradually eroded since Microsoft's initial $1 billion investment in 2019. OpenAI's need for expanded computational resources and Microsoft's own AI ambitions have created increasing distance between the two organizations.Recent Microsoft AI announcements notably omit any mention of OpenAI, suggesting a potential strategic divergence. The tech giant is reportedly developing its own large language model, MAI-1, further indicating potential independence from the OpenAI partnership.Benioff, whose Salesforce uses OpenAI's enterprise models and has invested in competitor Anthropic, seems to relish the developing situation.",Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff predicts a dramatic shift in their artificial intelligence partnership.

The most expensive S series smartphone from Samsung continues the trend of refined aesthetics with a squared-off titanium frame and Gorilla Glass Armor 2. The Gorilla Glass Armor 2 on the Galaxy S25 Ultra is scratch resistant and it also provides anti-reflective glass ceramic cover the the smartphone.

The overall build of Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra exudes sophistication, maintaining its status as a flagship device.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra sports a 6.9-inch Quad HD+ Infinity-O-Edge AMOLED display. The display on the smartphone offers a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz. The screen is protected with a coating of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass which makes it resistant to scratches. We really liked the display on the flagship Samsung smartphone. It offers a crisp resolution, smooth 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and enhanced Vision Booster for vivid outdoor viewing. Samsung has further enhanced brightness levels, making it easy to view even under harsh sunlight. The colour accuracy and HDR performance ensure vibrant visuals, whether you're gaming or streaming videos.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is powered by Android’s most powerful and advanced chipset – Snapdragon 8 Elite.

The Coca-Cola Foundation (TCCF) and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) are joining forces to tackle the escalating plastic waste crisis in Asia . With a grant of $15 million (nearly Rs 130 crore) from TCCF, this three-year program will be implemented across nine countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Maldives, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.Launched in India on Thursday (December 22), the initiative aims to revolutionise plastic waste management practices.This includes promoting recycling, minimising plastic pollution, developing country-specific solutions, and fostering regional cooperation.By sharing best practices and encouraging policy changes, the program seeks to reduce and ultimately eliminate disposable plastic, while also improving the livelihoods of waste workers.“By adopting and disseminating best practices across the region, the programme aims to inspire policy changes and community-level actions to reduce and help to eliminate disposable plastic and improve the livelihoods of waste workers,” TCCF said in a statement.Carlos Pagoaga , president of The Coca-Cola Foundation emphasised that the partnership with UNDP will focus on advancing solutions to minimise packaging waste, improve collection methods, and enhance processing capabilities.“Collaboration is key to help improve waste management systems and strengthen recycling infrastructure,” Pagoaga added.Meanwhile, Christophe Bahuet, UNDP deputy regional director for Asia and the Pacific, highlighted the region’s commitment to combating plastic waste through circular economy principles.“Across Asia, countries are combating the problem by embracing the circular economy. Through our Zero Waste and Plastics initiatives, we are helping them craft policies, attract investments, and reduce the consumption of single-use plastics,” Bahuet added.","The Coca-Cola Foundation (TCCF) and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) are joining forces to tackle the escalating plastic waste crisis in Asia.

Wall Street banks are reportedly preparing to sell up to $3 billion in debt tied to X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk. Morgan Stanley bankers have reportedly reached out to investors ahead of a planned sale next week.Citing sources familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal reported that the banks expect to recover 90 to 95 cents on the dollar.The publication initially disclosed details of the sale preparations.The report noted that to successfully sell the debt, bankers will need to persuade investors that the company’s financial situation has stabilised. Musk’s recent rise in influence and his alliance with President Trump appear to have shifted the narrative around X’s prospects, it added.Investors have reportedly been approaching the banks, expressing interest in purchasing the company’s debt due to a belief that its financial performance is improving, a source familiar with the matter told WSJ.Reportedly, in a January email to employees, Musk highlighted the company’s increasing influence and power but acknowledged ongoing financial challenges.“Our user growth is stagnant, revenue is unimpressive, and we’re barely breaking even,” he reportedly said in the email.However, Musk has denied the report, calling it “false” in a post on X, accusing the newspaper of “lying.”“This report is false. I sent no such email. WSJ is lying,” Musk said.Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Barclays were among the institutions that lent Musk funds to facilitate his $44 billion acquisition of X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022.Typically, banks sell loans to investors shortly after a deal closes, however, offloading X-related debt has proven challenging. Musk's significant restructuring of the platform, which included widespread layoffs of moderation staff and controversial posts that alienated advertisers, resulted in declining revenues. This, in turn, diminished the debt’s value due to heightened default risk.","Morgan Stanley bankers have reportedly reached out to investors ahead of a planned sale next week.

What the shareholders have to say

Meta's former COO, Sheryl Sandberg , faces escalating challenges. Days after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg reportedly attributed the company’s controversial policies to her, a new legal case has emerged. According to a New York Times report, Zuckerberg criticized Sandberg for Facebook’s current “culture” and inclusivity efforts during a meeting with Stephen Miller, a senior advisor to former President Donald Trump.Sandberg has now reportedly been sanctioned by a Delaware judge for allegedly deleting emails related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.According to a report in Tech Crunch, this stems from a shareholder lawsuit filed late last year against Sandberg and former Meta board member Jeff Zients.The shareholders allege that Sandberg and Zients used personal email accounts to discuss matters related to a 2018 lawsuit accusing Facebook leaders of violating the law and their fiduciary duties regarding user privacy. They further claim that Sandberg and Zients deleted emails from these personal accounts despite a court order not to. The judge found these allegations credible.The judge's decision states that Sandberg used a personal Gmail account under a pseudonym for communications relevant to the case. The judge also noted inconsistencies in Sandberg's responses to interrogatories and plaintiffs' questions, suggesting she selectively deleted emails rather than using an auto-delete function.As a sanction, the judge has raised the burden of proof for Sandberg's affirmative defense. She must now prove her defense with ""clear and convincing"" evidence, a higher standard than the usual ""preponderance"" of evidence. The judge also awarded certain expenses to the plaintiffs.A spokesperson for Sandberg maintains that the plaintiffs' claims are without merit, stating that ""all work emails were preserved on Facebook’s servers.""The underlying issue involves allegations that Meta violated a 2012 FTC order prohibiting the company from collecting and sharing user data without consent. Facebook allegedly sold data to commercial partners, including Cambridge Analytica, and removed required disclosures from privacy settings. Meta previously paid a $5 billion fine to the FTC in 2019 for violating this order and has also faced penalties from European regulators.",Sheryl Sandberg has reportedly been sanctioned by a Delaware judge for allegedly deleting emails related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

The Gadgets Now Awards 2024 witnessed a gathering of leading technological minds who assembled to perform a comprehensive review of the year's most impressive digital innovations. This distinguished panel, composed of influential figures in the technology industry, conducted a thorough examination of the current state of technological advancement.A key member of this esteemed jury was CP Gurnani , the co-founder and executive vice chairman of AIonOS.Gurnani, a visionary leader in the field of technological innovation, offered invaluable strategic insights during the evaluation process. While participating in the jury meeting, Gurnani expressed his admiration for the remarkable innovation demonstrated by the showcased products, noting that selecting a winner from such a competitive pool proved to be a challenging endeavor.“You know, on one end, I would say.. an amazing product range. Clearly when it came to innovation in design, innovation in features, innovation led by AI, and the power of the chipsets. It was really a difficult task to choose the winner,” Gurnani told the Times of India-Gadgets Now team.Gurnani expressed a desire for even more ambitious and impactful innovation, particularly in the area of environmental sustainability.“But you know, there's always this “dil mange more” moment. And I would have been happy if it was a green innovation contest. For me, the dream would be, ‘every gadget that we ever sell or supply in Delhi, should come in with those miniaturised air purifiers. If you can convert a watch into a phone; And if you can convert a phone into a TV studio. I don't see a reason why we cannot dream big and think of features, which are more software-driven, more electronics-driven and can be miniaturised,” he added.Gurnani analysed the innovation seen in different gadget categories, highlighting both progress and areas needing further development.“Clearly every category has got its own range of innovation or maturity of innovation. For example, the foldable category – whether it was the Flip or the fold category, the level of integration of hardware software, and the sophistication of hardware is very impressive, the form factor is becoming better and more importantly, the weight of the device has become a lot better,” he said.“Similarly, in the desktops or in the laptop categories, the power of the chip, the power of a gaming console or a PC console, becoming similar and even the power of not only the laptops but also that you could do a multi-fold screen right on the same device, I think it is a great innovation,” Gurnani noted.“Number three on the devices, whether it was the robotics or whether it was small improvements of noise cancellation on the earbuds, I think there is a definitive progress.

This phone was previously known as the Galaxy S25 Slim.

Samsung President and CEO, Southwest Asia, JB Park has called out trust issues with Chinese smartphones. Speaking to Economic Times at the launch of Samsung Galaxy S25 series in San Jose, US, the Samsung executive took aim at Chinese smartphone rivals, questioning their trustworthiness when it comes to handling user data for AI applications in India.JB Park, President and CEO of Samsung Southwest Asia, suggested that Indian consumers need to consider which brands they can reliably entrust with their private information.These comments come as Samsung faces competition in India from Chinese smartphone companies. Park reportedly acknowledged the rapid adoption of AI by Chinese brands but emphasized the ""trust factor,"" posing the question of whether these brands are truly trustworthy with sensitive user data.Park admitted that Samsung is unlikely to win every battle in every price segment but reiterated the company's commitment to meeting Indian consumer needs through differentiated products, with AI playing a crucial role. He likened the current stage of AI development to the early days of the internet, emphasizing the unpredictable nature of its future.To further reach consumers, particularly in rural areas, Samsung plans to double its service center network to 800 by the end of 2025. This initiative aims to provide hands-on experience with the latest mobile technologies, including AI, which Park believes is crucial given the limitations of online experiences.Samsung launched the new flagship phones in three variants: Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25+ and Galaxy S25. The new phones have a customized Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform for Galaxy chipset. Samsung also plans to launch an ultrathin version of Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year.

Pakistani Senators Demand Apology from Elon Musk , Accusing Him of ""Anti- Pakistan Propaganda"" Amid Starlink 's License Application. Starlink, Musk's satellite internet service, has applied for regulatory approval to operate in Pakistan but awaits clearance. A Senate committee on IT and telecommunications recently convened to review the application, a lawmaker informed AFP.Committee chair Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan told AFP that several senators condemned Musk's recent comments on his social media platform, X, which they deemed ""anti-Pakistani."" These comments relate to Musk's repeated highlighting of claims that men of Pakistani origin were involved in historical child sexual abuse cases in England, primarily targeting white girls.Khan stated that the committee discussed recommending approval of Starlink's license on the condition of an apology from Musk. She clarified, ""We are not saying it should be a pre-condition, but it was a part of the discussion, and we can only give our recommendations to the government.""Musk's criticism began earlier this month, targeting the UK government's initial reluctance to hold a national inquiry into these abuse cases. One prominent case involved the sexual exploitation of at least 1,400 girls in Rotherham over a 16-year period. Subsequent investigations and court cases resulted in the conviction of numerous men, many of South Asian descent.The issue resurfaced after an Indian lawmaker posted on X on January 8, stating, ""They aren't ASIAN Grooming Gangs but PAKISTANI grooming gangs. Why should Asians take the fall for one absolute rogue nation?"" Musk responded with ""True.""These historical abuse cases are a sensitive topic in the UK, with some arguing they are exploited to fuel Islamophobia, while others contend that open discussion is suppressed.Beyond his business ventures in electric vehicles and space exploration, Musk has recently become more politically active, particularly aligning himself with figures in US politics.","Pakistani Senators Demand Apology from Elon Musk.

OpenAI maintains that its use of publicly available data for training its AI models falls within the scope of fair use.During a November hearing, OpenAI told the Delhi court it would not use ANI's content anymore but the news agency argued its published works were stored in ChatGPT's memory and should be deleted.This lawsuit follows a wave of similar legal challenges faced by OpenAI and other AI companies, including the prominent case brought by The New York Times.Furthermore, OpenAI has entered into content licensing agreements with several major news organizations, including Time magazine, the Financial Times, and Axel Springer. This has raised concerns for ANI, who argue that these partnerships create an unfair competitive advantage for OpenAI.ANI has also accused OpenAI of reproducing verbatim or substantially similar extracts of their work within ChatGPT's outputs.",ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has challenged Delhi High Court's jurisdiction in a copyright lawsuit filed against the tech giant in November brought by news agency ANI.

Shopify president Harley Finkelstien has shared his point of view on the long stand debate of work-life-balance. Finkelstien believes that the phrase work-life-balance is itself misleading. As reported by Business Insider, speaking on Skims cofounder Emma Grede’s Aspire podcast, Finkelstein described work-life-balance as a ‘misnomer’, he argues that the professionals should really seek harmony. “I think actually what we’re all searching for is some sort of harmony,” Finkelstein said. “There are some Saturdays where I have to work, and there are some Thursday afternoons that I go for a walk with my wife. That’s my version of harmony.”Finkelstien further explained that the definition of harmony changes depending on the circumstances in one’s life. “There’s a period in your life, before I was married, before I had kids, where I was able to work 80 hours a week all the time. Then, when I had newborns, I wasn’t able to work 80 hours. I think everyone needs to find their own version of it.”The perspective on work-life-balance shared by Finkelstein matches to that of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.Microsoft CEO has also said that he aims to harmonise his work with what he cares about. On the other hand, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also dismissed the phrase “work-life balance” as “debilitating” in 2018, describing it instead as a circle.Finkelstein has further clarified that working extreme hours is not a prerequisite for success. “I know some people who work 40 hours a week who are some of the greatest performers ever. They’re just incredibly efficient with their time,” he said.He believes that harmony offers a flexible alternative to rigid definitions of balance.",Shopify president Harley Finkelstien has shared his point of view on the long stand debate of work-life-balance.

Advice for students





Geoffrey Hinton declares the winner in ChatGPT vs Google Gemini fight









Geoffrey Hinton, widely known as the ‘Godfather of AI’ has once again shared an advice for engineers and students. Hinton has asked the students and engineers to not give up computer science degrees, despite the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence which is reshaping the coding industry. Speaking to Business Insider in an interview Hinton stressed on the fact that computer science degree is not limited to just programming. “Many people think a CS degree is just programming or something. Obviously, just being a competent mid-level programmer is not going to be a career for much longer, because AI can do that,” he said.Hinton also argued that the discipline teaches foundational skills in systems thinking, mathematics, and problem-solving which will remain relevant for decades to come. “A CS degree will be valuable for quite a long time,” Hinton added.Along with this, Hinton has also encouraged the middle and high school students to learn coding, likening it to studying Latin in the humanities. “You’re never going to speak Latin, but it’s still useful learning Latin,” said Hinton. He further emphasised that coding is will remain a valuable intellectual exercise even if AI used for automating most of the work.Sharing an advice for aspiring AI researchers and engineers, Hinton mentioned that they should focus on critical thinking and core mathematical skills. “Some skills that are always going to be valuable, like knowing some math, statistics, probability theory, and linear algebra. That’s not knowledge that’s going to disappear,” he said.Recently, Hinton revealed that he believes Google is catching up with OpenAI in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Hinton, a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto and former Google Brain expert, also said he is surprised that Google took this long to surpass its competitors. In an interview with Business Insider, when discussing Google's position relative to OpenAI, Hinton said, ""I think it's actually more surprising than it's taken this long for Google to overtake OpenAI. I think that right now they're beginning to overtake it""This declaration follows the widely praised launch of Google's Gemini 3, an update that many in the tech world believe has elevated the company above OpenAI's GPT-5.","Geoffrey Hinton, widely known as the ‘Godfather of AI’ has once again shared an advice for engineers and students.

Samsung beats home rival SK Hynix to lead DRAM market globally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-beats-home-rival-sk-hynix-to-lead-dram-market-globally/articleshow/125821187.cms,"Samsung Electronics is set to reclaim the global DRAM market leadership in Q4, surpassing SK hynix with an expected operating profit over 18 trillion won. This turnaround is driven by its device solutions division, which saw a significant profit surge, narrowing the gap in high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips and benefiting from rising conventional DRAM prices.

Battle for AI memory chips heats up





Samsung Electronics is poised to reclaim the number one position in the global dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) market by revenue in the fourth quarter, overtaking its domestic rival SK hynix, industry sources said. The South Korean tech giant is projected to post an operating profit exceeding 18 trillion won ($12.2 billion) in the October-December period, beating market expectations, according to sources cited by Yonhap news agency.Samsung's device solutions division, which oversees the company's semiconductor business, is expected to be the primary driver of this growth. The division is projected to account for 15.1 trillion won of the total operating profit, representing a sharp 422% increase compared to the same period a year earlier.With this projected earnings surprise, Samsung is likely to rank No. 1 in the global DRAM supplier revenue ranking for the fourth quarter, pushing SK hynix back to second place.The shift in rankings marks a significant turnaround. Samsung, which had maintained the leader position in the DRAM market for 33 years, lost the top spot to SK hynix in the first quarter of this year. The temporary slip was largely attributed to Samsung lagging behind the competition in high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips.SK hynix was the world's first company to develop HBM chips—a core component for artificial intelligence (AI) applications—in 2013 and has since led the global HBM market.However, industry analysts note that Samsung’s performance has been bolstered by recent efforts to narrow the technology gap in HBM, combined with rising prices for conventional DRAM products driven by heavy investment in AI infrastructure, such as data centres.","Samsung's device solutions division is expected to account for 15.1 trillion won of the total operating profit, representing a sharp 422% increase compared to the same period a year earlier.

A new rule aimed at discouraging entities like hotels and event organisers from taking photocopies of customers' Aadhaar cards and storing them in physical form will be published soon, a senior government official said. Such practices are in contravention of the present Aadhaar Act. Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI ) CEO Bhuvnesh Kumar told PTI that the authority has approved a new rule mandating the registration of entities that seek Aadhaar-based verification. This will provide them access to new technology enabling identity verification by scanning a QR code or connecting with a new Aadhaar app currently in the works.""The new rule has been approved by the authority and will be notified soon. It will mandate registration of offline verification-seeking entities like hotels, event organisers. The objective is to discourage paper-based Aadhaar verification,"" Kumar told PTI. The new verification process is expected to resolve issues related to service disruptions caused by the downtime of intermediate servers connecting to the central Aadhaar database.According to the official, entities seeking offline verification will be granted access to an API (application programming interface), allowing them to update their systems for seamless Aadhaar verification.UIDAI is currently beta-testing a new app designed to facilitate app-to-app verification. This method eliminates the need to connect to the central Aadhaar database server for every transaction. The new app is versatile and can be utilized at various touchpoints, including airports and shops requiring age verification for specific products.""The ease of verification will enhance offline verification without the use of paper while maintaining privacy of users or any risk of their Aadhaar data getting leaked for misuse,"" Kumar said.The official added that the new app is expected to finetune Aadhaar authentication services in alignment with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, which is set to become fully operational in 18 months.Additionally, the app will empower users to update address proof documents directly and add family members who do not possess a mobile phone to the same app.",A new rule aimed at discouraging entities like hotels and event organisers from taking photocopies of customers' Aadhaar cards and storing them in physical form will be published soon.

Canadian Police testing once controversial AI-powered facial recognition body cameras,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/canadian-police-testing-once-controversial-ai-powered-facial-recognition-body-cameras/articleshow/125820491.cms,"Representative AI Image





In a significant test of policing technology that could reshape law enforcement strategies across North America, police in Edmonton have begun a live pilot program using body cameras equipped with facial recognition AI.According to a report by The Associated Press, the cameras have been trained to detect the faces of approximately 7,000 individuals on a ""high risk"" watch list. This move marks a major pivot for the technology provider, Axon Enterprise, Inc., which famously halted facial recognition development six years ago due to ethical concerns.The Pilot Program The pilot, which launched last week, involves about 50 officers in Edmonton, a city of over 1 million people. The technology scans for individuals categorized as ""flagged or caution"" for violent offenses, weapons possession, escape risks, or outstanding serious warrants.Kurt Martin, acting superintendent of the Edmonton Police Service, noted that the current watch list includes 6,341 high-risk offenders and an additional 724 individuals with serious criminal warrants.However, during this ""proof of concept"" phase—which runs through December—officers will not receive real-time alerts.Instead, the data will be analyzed retroactively at the station. Axon CEO Rick Smith described the initiative not as a product launch, but as ""early-stage field research"" designed to test the technology in real-world conditions, including Edmonton’s limited daylight and cold winter temperatures.Ethical Concerns and Internal Pushback The deployment has drawn sharp criticism from privacy advocates and former Axon advisors. Barry Friedman, a law professor at NYU and former chair of Axon’s AI ethics board, told the AP that the company is proceeding without sufficient public debate or expert vetting.""It's essential not to use these technologies, which have very real costs and risks, unless there's some clear indication of the benefits,"" Friedman said. He resigned from Axon’s board in 2022 following a separate dispute over Taser-equipped drones.Axon acknowledged to the AP that facial recognition systems can still struggle with accuracy regarding ""distance, lighting and angle,"" factors that can ""disproportionately impact accuracy for darker-skinned individuals."" The company stated that human review is required for every match.Global Context and Competition The pilot arrives as global attitudes toward facial recognition diverge. The European Union has largely banned real-time public face scanning, whereas the United Kingdom has utilized it to make 1,300 arrests in the last two years.In the U.S., major competitors like Motorola Solutions have abstained from deploying real-time identification, citing ethical principles. However, Axon—the dominant U.S. supplier of body cameras—hopes the data gathered in Canada will help strengthen oversight frameworks for future use in the United States.Temitope Oriola, a criminology professor at the University of Alberta, described Edmonton as a ""laboratory"" for the tool. Given the police service's sometimes ""frosty"" relationship with Indigenous and Black communities, Oriola noted it remains to be seen if the technology will improve safety or exacerbate tensions.","Police in Edmonton have begun a pilot program using body cameras equipped with facial recognition AI.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment. The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.",AI startup OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US.

Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts.

Waymo identifies and updates software issue







Google-parent company Alphabet’s autonomous vehicle subsidiary Waymo is planning to file a voluntary software recall with federal regulators after its self-driving cars repeatedly failed to properly stop for school buses. The recall notice is expected to be submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the coming week and will become publicly available on the agency's website in the following days, according to a Waymo spokesperson.“While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences twelve times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better,” said Mauricio Peña, Waymo's Chief Safety Officer, as per a report in Bloomberg.The report says that the recall follows findings by the Austin Independent School District documenting at least 19 separate instances of Waymo vehicles illegally passing school buses since the beginning of the current school year.In a November 20 letter, the district called on Waymo to suspend operations during school bus route hours, according to documents associated with an NHTSA investigation opened in October.Waymo reported no injuries occurred related to the vehicle behaviour covered by the recall.The company has reportedly identified a software malfunction that caused its vehicles to initially slow or stop for school buses but then resume driving. Waymo implemented software updates by November 17 that it said “meaningfully improved” its performance around buses.However, Austin school district officials told Bloomberg last week that the November update did not adequately resolve the problem, citing another violation recorded on December 1.Meanwhile, a Waymo spokesperson responded that the company is reviewing the December 1 incident to “understand and improve,” adding that Waymo will “continue analysing our vehicles’ performance and making necessary fixes as part of our commitment to continuous improvement.”",The recall notice is expected to be submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the coming week.

Hey Shubham, wrong on one count, and right on others -

While conducting research on the

Gravity Aging Hypothesis

, we had to make an experimental device to calculate Brain Flow accurately, real-time, and continuously. Been using it for a year, and I’ve been feeling that this could shape into an important wearable the world needs. Brain Flow is already well accepted as a biomarker for aging, longevity as well as cognition. So this device is useful and relevant even if the Gravity Aging Hypothesis turns out to be wrong.

And Temple is going to be a small cute company, if at all. Nothing compared to Eternal.

PS: We didn’t “cook up” the Gravity Aging Hypothesis to sell Temple. Not my game to lose the trust our customers have in me over a marketing gimmick.

I did not explain the Gravity Aging Hypothesis (GAH) well, the first time.

I brought my consumer internet brain into a deep scientific field and I miscommunicated. I tried to compress years of research and thinking into a dramatic social media reveal.

That made the hypothesis sound absolute and commercial – while it’s really not.

I apologise.

This is me taking a slower, cleaner shot at explaining GAH, without oversimplifying it.





Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal has announced that Temple, the ‘mysterious’ tiny device recently spotted on his right temple, is coming soon. It is an experimental monitor and Goyal called “world class”. The device has been created as part of his research into his recently publicised and unconventional “Gravity Aging Hypothesis,” which claims that gravity may contribute to the human aging process by potentially reducing blood flow to the brain.“Coming Soon. Follow @temple for more updates,” Goyal said. While replying to a comment on his post, he called the device “World class, to say the least.”Last month, Goyal cleared up the speculation surrounding the device in a response to a post on LinkedIn. He explained that Temple is an: “experimental device to calculate Brain Flow accurately, real-time, and continuously.” The development of the device is directly linked to Goyal's research into his hypothesis. The Zomato CEO outlined the idea, which he described as “scientific yet unconventional,” suggesting that gravity shortens lifespan.“I’m not sharing this as the CEO of Eternal, but as a fellow human, curious enough to follow a strange thread... Newton gave us a word for it. Einstein said it bends spacetime. I am saying gravity shortens lifespan,” Goyal wrote in introducing the theory.The new device appears to be the first hardware manifestation of Goyal's deep personal interest in longevity and anti-aging research. He said:In separate post, he noted:","Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal has announced that Temple, the ‘mysterious’ tiny device recently spotted on his right temple, is coming soon.

"OpenAI, Jony Ive can't use 'io' name anymore, and here's the reason why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-jony-ive-cant-use-io-name-anymore-and-heres-the-reason-why/articleshow/125815975.cms,"A major setback for OpenAI and Jony Ive's ambitious AI hardware venture as a federal appeals court blocked the use of the 'io' name. The court ruled 'IO' and 'iyO' are too similar, potentially confusing consumers. This legal battle, stemming from a trademark dispute with Google-backed iyO, could last years, forcing OpenAI to rebrand its upcoming device.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

OpenAI and iyO’s legal battle could drag until 2028





A federal appeals court has blocked OpenAI and former Apple designer Jony Ive from using the ""io"" name for their upcoming AI hardware device, dealing a significant blow to their $6.5 billion venture announced earlier this year.The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a temporary restraining order that prevents the tech giants from marketing products under the io brand if they're similar to those planned by iyO, a Google-backed AI audio startup. The court found the names ""IO"" and ""iyO"" are phonetically identical and could confuse consumers, with both companies developing AI-driven hardware with natural language interaction.The trademark dispute began in June when iyO sued OpenAI shortly after the company announced its acquisition of Ive's hardware startup. Court documents revealed that Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman chose the io name in mid-2023, despite iyO having already trademarked its name two years earlier.The case took an interesting turn when it emerged that iyO CEO Jason Rugolo had approached Altman in early 2025 seeking funding for a ""future of human-computer interface"" project. Altman declined, saying he was working on ""something competitive,"" and later rejected Rugolo's offer to sell iyO to OpenAI for $200 million.OpenAI argued that its first product wouldn't be a wearable device like iyO's planned AI-powered earbuds, but the court sided with the smaller startup. Judges expressed concern about ""reverse confusion,"" where a larger company with more resources could saturate the market and make consumers believe the original brand is the copycat.The preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled for April 2026, with a full jury trial potentially extending through 2027 and 2028. OpenAI has already removed io branding from its website and taken down promotional videos featuring Ive and Altman discussing their partnership.Despite the setback, OpenAI's first hardware device is still expected to launch in late 2026 or 2027, though it will need a new name.","A federal appeals court has blocked OpenAI and Jony Ive from using the 'io' name for their upcoming AI hardware device.

Justin Bieber is ‘angry’ at Apple . The global pop star took to social media to complain about a seemingly small feature on the iPhone that seems to highly irritate him: the dictation button. He says that he frequently taps accidentally while texting, and that “the send button should not have multiple functions in the same spot”.The singer posted on X to express his frustration: “If I hit this dictation button after sending a text and it beeps and stops my music one more time, I'm gonna find everyone at Apple and put them in a rear naked choke hold.”Bieber stated that the problem persists even after turning off dictation, as he still accidentally hits the voice note option. He also shared a screenshot of his iMessage screen and delivered a sharp design critique: “The send button should not have multiple functions in the same spot.""Bieber’s outcry about the design flaw resonated widely online, with thousands of users admitting they suffer from the same accidental taps. The post even caught the attention of Elon Musk, who reshared his post with two “fire” emojis. Moreover, Ian Silber, the head of product design at OpenAI, jokingly invited the singer to attend their weekly design reviews.People made fun of Apple in replies with some sharing AI-generated photos and videos, while others asked the singer to move to Android. A bunch of people also pointed out mass departures of executives from the company – particularly turbulent and sensitive times for the iPhone maker.Apple has faced a wave of high-level departures this week. On Monday, John Giannandrea, SVP of machine learning and AI strategy, announced he would step down. Two days later, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Apple’s long-time VP of human interface design, Alan Dye, would join Meta's Reality Labs.

Why The Economist's word of the year 'Slop' is the perfect choice for 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-the-economists-word-of-the-year-slop-is-the-perfect-choice-for-2025/articleshow/125813777.cms,"Why Slop Is the Perfect Word for Right Now



AI Promised Us Productivity. It Gave Us Spam.



Slop Isn’t a Bug. It’s the Business Model.



Is There a Way Out? Maybe — But It’s Slow.







The Economist, with its usual understated British charm, has named “slop” the word of the year. And for once, the British got the mood right.Slop. It’s not a tech term. It’s not a buzzword from a TED Talk. It’s what pigs eat. Or used to, until the pigs got an upgrade and the humans got downgraded. In 2025, slop isn’t just what’s in the trough — it’s what’s on your feed, your inbox, your search results, your brain. It’s the word we didn’t know we needed to describe what the digital world has become: a lukewarm stew of AI-generated mush served up by machines that never sleep and people who’ve stopped caring.OpenAI’s Sora lets anyone create “joyfully fake” videos in seconds. LinkedIn is full of AI-crafted guru wisdom like “Sometimes leadership means following your own silence.” And Google search results have been reduced to auto-generated slop shops that think turmeric can cure heartbreak. Ask a health question and you’ll get a 600-word hallucination wearing a lab coat.The internet is drowning in content that looks like content but feels like chewing cardboard — tasteless, textureless, and suspiciously repetitive.Welcome to the slopocalypse.There’s something beautifully honest about the word slop. It doesn’t try to impress you. It doesn’t care if it offends. It just is. Slop is messy. Slop is thoughtless. Slop is scalable.And slop is exactly what generative AI was built to do.Chatbots, video models, voice tools — all designed to generate endless amounts of “stuff.” It doesn’t have to be good. It just has to exist. It just has to fill space: a caption, a reel, a newsletter, a pitch deck. That’s the genius of slop — it masquerades as information, as insight, as value. But it’s just there to keep the machine running.Worse, slop feeds itself. AI models are now training on AI outputs. Machine learning is eating its own leftovers, like a snake snacking on yesterday’s regurgitated tail. The result? A growing universe of statistically sound garbage. And because we’ve taught the algorithm that engagement matters more than truth, more than depth, more than originality, what we get is... more slop.The cultural moment fits, too. We’ve optimized ourselves into stupidity. We want things fast, frictionless, formatted. We don’t want to read — we want summaries. We don’t want art — we want “content.” The idea of slop being not just an accident but a feature of the current internet feels like the most honest self-own of the decade.And so we scroll through endless videos narrated by emotionless AI voices, stitched together from fake footage, optimized for maximum nothingness. We repost AI-written threads that say “this blew my mind” before summarizing the Wikipedia entry for string theory. We nod along to slop and pretend it’s insight.But here’s where the joke curdles. For all the hype about how AI would make us more efficient, more productive, more everything — it’s mostly made us more tired.Remember when generative AI was supposed to write our emails, crunch our numbers, and free us up to do “higher-value work”? That dream didn’t even survive the onboarding process. What we got instead was ChatGPT drafting your memo in 20 seconds — and you spending two hours editing out the weird tone, fixing the logic, and wondering if it just made up the numbers.Generative AI is brilliant at producing first drafts. It is terrible at understanding context. It has no memory, no judgment, no taste. It can mimic grammar and style and tone, but it has the same relationship to good writing that instant noodles have to real food — edible, but only in emergencies, and definitely not nourishing.Corporate AI deployments are faring no better. Despite hundreds of millions poured into “AI transformation,” 95% of these projects have delivered zero financial return. Zero. That’s not disruption — that’s a PowerPoint hallucination.The problem is painfully simple: AI is easy to demo and hard to deploy. It impresses in beta. It breaks in reality. Most industries don’t run on theory — they run on nuance, adaptation, judgment. Retail, construction, education, healthcare — all filled with edge cases, human variables, unstructured chaos. Chatbots don’t thrive in chaos. Humans do.And let’s be honest — even in white-collar offices, people don’t want AI doing their jobs. They want it doing the boring parts so they can slack off in peace. Instead, AI has made the boring parts more confusing, the fun parts more synthetic, and the outcomes more questionable. It hasn’t saved time. It’s redistributed the mess.The irony is that this isn’t a glitch. Slop is working as intended. It’s not the byproduct of bad AI — it’s the product.Platforms want engagement, not accuracy. Publishers want volume, not quality. Creators want reach, not substance. And AI is the perfect tool for that. It can produce ten mediocre pieces for the cost of one good one. And ten mediocre pieces will always win the algorithm.The result is the end of coherence. Newsfeeds full of copy-pasted AI summaries. YouTube channels run by bots reading Wikipedia. Instagram reels made of AI-generated faces selling AI-generated life advice. Entire slop-factories running 24/7 on machine labor and human indifference.We now live in a world where content is so cheap, even the bots are getting bored.There is, perhaps, a silver lining. Some research suggests people are getting better at spotting slop — and rejecting it. When users are shown AI-generated images or text, many become more likely to pay for verified, human-created content. Credibility, in the slop era, might actually become cool again.But the escape won’t be instant. There’s no magical filter that separates real from fake, useful from generic. We’ll have to build new habits, better tools, and maybe — just maybe — value quality again.Until then, slop is here to stay. It’s in our feeds, our inboxes, our workflows, our habits. The future isn’t fully artificial. It’s just artificially average — fast, cheap, and empty.Slop is the word of the year. Because it’s also the product, the business model, the culture.","The Economist has named ‘slop’ the word of the year. It’s the word we didn’t know we needed to describe what the digital world has become: a lukewarm stew of AI-generated mush served up by machines that never sleep and people who’ve stopped caring. For all the hype about how AI would make us more efficient, more productive, more everything — it's mostly made us more tired.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125814042,imgsize-188808,width-400,resizemode-4/slop-the-economist-word-of-the-year.jpg"

Netflix Drops A $72b Bombshell On Hollywood With Mega Warner Bros Discovery Move | WHAT IT MEANS

Read Netflix’s full letter to subscribers on Warner Bros. purchase

Welcoming Warner Bros. to Netflix

Hi [subscriber’s name],

We’ve recently announced that Netflix will acquire Warner Bros., including its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO. This unites our leading entertainment service with Warner Bros.’ iconic stories, bringing some of the world’s most beloved franchises like Harry Potter, Friends, The Big Bang Theory, Casablanca, Game of Thrones and the DC Universe together with Stranger Things, Wednesday, Squid Game, Bridgerton and KPop Demon Hunters.

What’s changing?

Nothing is changing today. Both streaming services will continue to operate separately. We have more steps to complete before the deal is closed, including regulatory and shareholder approvals. You’ll hear from us when we have more to share. In the meantime, we hope you’ll continue to enjoy watching as much as you want, whenever you want – all on your current membership plan.

We know you might have questions. Check out our Help Centre for more information or contact us at any time.

Thank you for choosing Netflix. We’re committed to bringing you more great series, films, games and live programming.

The Netflix team





Netflix moved quickly to reassure its over 300 million subscribers late night, sending a carefully worded email promising that ""nothing is changing today"" following its massive $82.7 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. The streaming giant's message arrived roughly 24 hours after announcing the blockbuster deal that will bring Warner Bros.' film and television studios, HBO Max, and HBO under Netflix's control. The email emphasized that both platforms will continue operating separately until the transaction closes—a process Netflix estimates will take 12 to 18 months.""We have more steps to complete before the deal is closed, including regulatory and shareholder approvals,"" the Netflix team wrote. ""You'll hear from us when we have more to share."" The FAQ section on Netflix's Help Center reinforced the message, stating current membership plans remain unchanged and Warner Bros. content won't immediately migrate to Netflix's platform.However, the deal has already sparked fierce opposition from multiple fronts. Senator Elizabeth Warren called it an ""anti-monopoly nightmare,"" while Representative Pramila Jayapal warned it would mean ""more price hikes, ads, and cookie cutter content.""Even Republican Senator Mike Lee expressed alarm, suggesting the deal ""should send alarm to antitrust enforcers around the world.""Industry groups including the Producers Guild of America, SAG-AFTRA, and the Writers Guild have also voiced concerns about job losses and reduced creative control.Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos struck a confident tone during an investor call, insisting the deal is ""pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it's pro-creator, it's pro-growth."" He added that ""we're highly confident in the regulatory process,"" and emphasized that combining forces would create ""a stronger organization than either of us could have achieved alone.""If approved, the merger would create an entertainment powerhouse combining iconic Warner Bros. franchises like Harry Potter, Friends, and Game of Thrones with Netflix hits such as Stranger Things and Bridgerton. But don't expect to see that content crossover anytime soon—the earliest the deal could close is December 2026.","Netflix sent a carefully worded email to its 300 million subscribers promising ""nothing is changing today"" The streaming giant's message arrived roughly 24 hours after announcing the blockbuster deal that will bring Warner Bros.' film and television studios, HBO Max, and HBO under Netflix's control.

'Brickstorm' malware used for long-term access to government and IT infrastructure



‘Broadcom’s VMware a target of China-backed hackers’



What China has to say on hacking reports







US and Canadian cybersecurity agencies have issued a joint advisory, warning that hackers linked to China used malware attacks to penetrate and maintain long-term access to unnamed government and information technology entities. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the advisory has been signed by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security.According to Madhu Gottumukkala, the acting director of CISA, the Chinese-linked operations are “infiltrating sensitive networks and embedding themselves to enable long-term access, disruption, and potential sabotage.”The agencies identified the malware used by the state-backed hackers as “Brickstorm.” They claim that this malware was deployed to target multiple government services and information technology entities. Once inside victim networks, the hackers stole login credentials and other sensitive information, essentially giving them the potential to take full control of targeted computers.The threat involves maintaining persistent access. The advisory cited one instance where the attackers used Brickstorm to penetrate a company in April 2024 and maintained access through at least September 3, 2025.The analysis is based on eight Brickstorm samples obtained from targeted organisations. CISA executive assistant director for Cybersecurity Nick Andersen, however, declined to share specific details on the total number of government organisations targeted or the full extent of the hackers' actions once inside the networks, the report noted.The hackers are reportedly deploying the malware against VMware vSphere, a product sold by Broadcom’s VMware used to create and manage virtual machines within networks. A Broadcom spokesperson encouraged all customers to apply up-to-date software patches and adhere to strong operational security in response to the reports.The Chinese embassy in Washington quickly rejected the allegations. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson, stated that the Chinese government does not “encourage, support or connive at cyber attacks.” Liu added that they “reject the relevant parties' irresponsible assertion” about the activities, noting that the agencies had “neither put forward any request related to the issue nor presented any factual evidence.”","US and Canadian cybersecurity agencies have issued a joint advisory, warning that hackers linked to China used malware attacks to penetrate and maintain long-term access.

One of Microsoft's largest shareholder votes against CEO Satya Nadella; two things the Fund opposed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/one-of-microsofts-largest-shareholder-votes-against-ceo-satya-nadella-two-things-the-fund-opposed/articleshow/125812053.cms,"Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

What is Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund

Microsoft shareholders approve CEO Satya Nadella's huge salary hike





Norway’s $2 trillion Sovereign Wealth Fund voted for proposals against Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella . The world's largest Sovereign Wealth Fund voted at Microsoft’s Annual Shareholders' Meet on December 5, where multiple governance and compensation issues were also reviewed. The shareholder meeting was held virtually. At the shareholders meeting, Norway Fund voted against the re-election of CEO Satya Nadella as chair of the Microsoft Board as well as increase in Nadella’s compensation package as Microsoft CEO. Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund's vote against Nadella in both the cases is as per the Fund's general policy that has been to oppose a company's CEO doubling up as its chair, similarly it has also often complained about executive pay in America being excessive.The Fund voted against the re-election of Satya Nadella in keeping with its broader policy. It typically opposes governance structures in which a company CEO simultaneously serves as board chair, arguing that such dual roles can weaken accountability. As for voting against Nadella's salary, it underscores Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund's long-standing concerns about pay practices among major US companies. ""A substantial proportion of annual remuneration should be provided as shares that are locked in for five to ten years, regardless of resignation or retirement,"" it said while opposing Nadella's pay package.Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund is managed by Norges Bank Investment Management. It is one of the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. The Norway Sovereign Fund owned a 1.35% stake worth $50 billion in Microsoft as of June 30, according to fund data, its second-largest equity holding overall, after AI chip giant Nvidia. The Fund is Microsoft's eighth-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.Microsoft shareholders' meeting saw all company-proposed items pass with strong support, including the advisory vote on executive compensation. Microsoft shareholders gave a resounding vote of confidence to CEO Satya Nadella’s leadership, approving a compensation package that soared to $96.5 million for fiscal 2025. This record high is driven by a 23% stock surge in 2025, with shares doubling in value over three years. The Microsoft Board’s compensation committee cited exceptional progress in AI as a key factor for approving the compensation package.Satya Nadella's pay package, detailed in regulatory filings, reflects a 22% increase from the previous year, largely fueled by stock awards tied to the company’s surging share price.Other than this, Microsoft’s board recommended that shareholders vote against all six outside proposals, which covered issues including AI censorship, data privacy, human rights, and climate. And as suggested by the Microsoft Board, shareholders rejected all six proposals.","Norway's $2 trillion Sovereign Wealth Fund voted for proposals against Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

Massachusetts court hears arguments in lawsuit alleging Meta deliberately makes apps to be addictive to kids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/massachusetts-court-hears-arguments-in-lawsuit-alleging-meta-deliberately-makes-apps-to-be-addictive-to-kids/articleshow/125809887.cms,"



Massachusetts’ highest court heard arguments this week in the state’s lawsuit accusing Meta of intentionally designing Facebook and Instagram features to hook young users, a move the attorney general reportedly says has harmed hundreds of thousands of teens. Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s office, which filed the lawsuit in 2024, argues Meta’s profit-driven design choices — including tools the company’s own research suggested could foster compulsive use — are at the core of the case.“We are making claims based only on the tools that Meta has developed because its own research shows they encourage addiction to the platform in a variety of ways,” State Solicitor David Kravitz told the court, as per a report by news agency AP. He emphasized the state is not challenging Meta’s content moderation or algorithms directly. Meta rejected the allegations, saying it is “confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people. ” Company lawyer Mark Mosier argued the state’s claims would “impose liabilities for performing traditional publishing functions” protected by the First Amendment.“The Commonwealth would have a better chance of getting around the First Amendment if they alleged that the speech was false or fraudulent,” Mosier said.“But when they acknowledge that it’s truthful, that brings it into the heart of the First Amendment.”Some justices appeared more focused on Meta’s product features than on the content users see.“I didn’t understand the claims to be that Meta is relaying false information … but that it has created an algorithm of incessant notifications … designed so as to feed into the fear of missing out that teenagers generally have,” Justice Dalila Wendland said, as per AP report. “That is the basis of the claim.”AP report added that Justice Scott Kafker pressed the issue further: “It’s not how to publish but how to attract you to the information. … It doesn’t care if it’s Thomas Paine’s ‘Common Sense’ or nonsense. It’s totally focused on getting you to look at it.”Meta faces a wave of similar state and federal lawsuits alleging it knowingly engineered addictive features — including endless scrolling and constant alerts — that can harm children’s mental health.In 2023, 33 states sued the Menlo Park-based tech giant, saying Meta illegally collects data on children under 13 without parental consent. Several states, including Massachusetts, brought additional cases over what they call harmful design choices.Concern intensified after 2021 reporting by The Wall Street Journal revealed Meta’s internal research showed Instagram could worsen body image and mental health issues for teens — especially girls. One study showed 13.5% of teen girls reported worsening suicidal thoughts and 17% said Instagram heightened eating-disorder struggles.Critics argue Meta has failed to take meaningful action. A report this year from former Meta employee and whistleblower Arturo Bejar and four nonprofit groups said the company has resisted “real steps” to improve safety, opting instead for “splashy headlines” about new parental controls and teen accounts.","Massachusetts’ highest court heard arguments this week in the state’s lawsuit accusing Meta of intentionally designing Facebook and Instagram features to hook young users.

Here's the full letter sent by Paramount to Warner Braothers (as it appears in CNBC)

Netflix Drops A $72b Bombshell On Hollywood With Mega Warner Bros Discovery Move | WHAT IT MEANS





Paramount Skydance is unhappy with how Warner Bros Discovery has conducted its sale process. Paramount Skydance is reportedly questioning the fairness of Warner Bros. Discovery’s sale process and whether it is acting in the best interest of shareholders. According to a letter reviewed by CNBC, Paramount made three offers to acquire the entirety of Warner Bros Discovery before the company launched a formal sale process. In the letter, Paramount attorneys told Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav that Paramount was questioning the “fairness and adequacy” of the process, which officially launched in October. In particular, Paramount’s letter calls out reports that WBD’s management appears to favor Netflix’s offer.Last week, just before the Netflix deal, Warner Brothers Discovery reportedly received second-round bids from Paramount, Netflix and Comcast.Dear Mr. Zaslav: We write on behalf of Paramount Skydance Corporation (“Paramount”, “we” or “us”) to express our serious concerns about the fairness and adequacy of the bidding process for a potential combination with Warner Bros. Discovery (“WBD” or “you”). It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder.We specifically request and expect this letter will be shared and discussed with the full board of directors of WBD.We have recently seen reporting in the U.S. and foreign media that gives serious cause for concern. The German newspaper Handelsblatt recently reported on a meeting that reportedly took place in Brussels between Gerhard Zieler, President of WBD’s International Business and a direct report to WBD’s Chief Executive Officer, who “arrived with a three-person team,” with the E.U. Commission Vice President Hena Virkkunen, to discuss the potential merger prospects for WBD. In that conversation, the article reports that “concerns were raised that the Ellison family’s planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery could lead to excessive media concentration,” and that the E.U. Commission would consider intervening in a potential merger with Paramount for this reason. The article quotes “sources close” to Zeiler as saying “that the talks with the Commission were important because both Warner and the EU wanted to preserve media diversity.” The implications of such a meeting, if it occurred, are clear and evince a tacit resistance to, if not active sabotage of, a Paramount offer.While this report is concerning in itself, this is not an isolated report regarding purported WBD resistance to a combination with Paramount. Several U.S. media outlets have reported on the enthusiasm by WBD management for a transaction with Netflix, and on statements by management that a transaction between WBD and Netflix would be a “slam dunk,” while also referring to Paramount’s bid in a negative light. Additional reporting since the submission of revised bids on December 1 has indicated that WBD’s “board has really warmed to” a transaction with Netflix due to the “chemistry between” WBD management and Netflix management. We have come to you first to inquire whether this reporting is accurate, and to engage in a productive discussion with you around any actual or perceived issues that it may reflect.Moreover, these media reports echo similar indications that we have been hearing throughout this process, despite what we viewed as otherwise productive conversations that we have had with WBD leadership. Paramount has a credible basis to believe that the sales process has been tainted by management conflicts, including certain members of management’s potential personal interests in post-transaction roles and compensation as a result of the economic incentives embedded in recent amendments to employment arrangements. These concerns are amplified by indications of director bias and beholdenness to others whose interests may not align with the stockholders’, and the fact that alternatives involving only certain WBD assets are being prioritized notwithstanding their heightened regulatory risk and potential to deprive stockholders of consideration for the entirety of WBD’s enterprise value.Further, as you know, Paramount agreed to certain standstill arrangements in exchange for the opportunity to participate in a truly competitive and unbiased bidding process. Paramount did not bargain for WBD to foster, whether intentionally or unintentionally, a tilted and unfair process. We believe that all parties to this process should have a shared desire for, and will mutually benefit from, an unimpeachable transaction process. As we assume you agree, even discounting the accuracy of any media reports, just the appearance of a flawed process imperils any potential transaction that might result and may undermine the potential value maximization to WBD stockholders from any prospective transaction.In light of our grave concerns regarding the integrity of WBD’s process, we seek confirmation as to whether WBD has appointed an independent special committee of disinterested members of its board to consider the potential transaction opportunities and to make a final determination regarding a sale or break-up of all or part of the company. If not, we strongly urge you to empower such a special committee comprised of directors with no potential appearance of bias or beholdenness to others whose interests may differ from those of the stockholders. This would seem to be an important step at this stage, to ensure the fairness and unimpeachability of the transaction process and to maximize the value of whatever outcome WBD determines to pursue. Engaging with WBD throughout this process, we have been encouraged by the enormous potential from a combination of our entities. We remain confident that the Paramount offer would provide the maximum value to WBD stockholders and look forward to the opportunity to continue to engage with you productively in this process. But at this point we must insist on assurances and steps taken to ensure that a truly fair and independent process is being conducted, both for Paramount’s benefit and in the interest of WBD’s stockholders.","Paramount Skydance is unhappy with how Warner Bros Discovery has conducted its sale process.

Selecting the ""Haves and Have Nots""





Investor anxiety regarding the explosion of artificial intelligence-related debt is manifesting differently across investment-grade and high-yield markets, according to new research from Goldman Sachs. While big tech firms and emerging AI players have flooded the debt markets this year to fund a massive global data center build-out, the reception has cooled. AI-linked bonds are currently underperforming the broader credit market, and Goldman analysts note that the nature of investor worry depends heavily on the quality of the credit.In a research note released this week, the bank stated that concerns within the investment-grade (IG) market appear to be issuer-specific. In contrast, anxiety in the high-yield (junk bond) market is viewed as a broader, sector-wide concern.The underperformance comes as investors weigh the risks of construction delays and unproven revenue models against the massive capital expenditures required for AI infrastructure.Al Cattermole, fixed income portfolio manager at Mirabaud, told Reuters that as of November 25, his team had chosen not to invest in recent AI-linked investment-grade or junk bonds.Mirabaud, which manages approximately $37.4 billion (30 billion Swiss francs), cited opaque contracts and execution risks.""Until we see data centers being delivered on time and on budget and providing the computing power that they are intended to—and there still being the demand for it—it is untested,"" Cattermole said. ""And because it's untested, that's why I think you need to be compensated like an equity... not debt.""Despite the jitters, some managers see the volatility as a chance to buy into high-quality names.Christopher Kramer, portfolio manager on the investment-grade credit team at Neuberger Berman, noted that the structural shift to AI-linked debt creates opportunities for selective investors. He described the market as dividing into ""haves and have nots.""""Doing the credit work on the 'on balance' sheet versus 'off balance' sheet continues to be paramount,"" Kramer said. ""Security selection is going to be the name of the game and we're excited just from the standpoint that the market's changing.""Kramer did not comment on whether Neuberger, which manages $558 billion in assets, had participated in recent top-tier AI bond issuances.The market skepticism coincides with warnings from regulators. The Bank of England issued a warning this week stating that the growing role of debt in the AI infrastructure boom could heighten financial stability risks if valuations were to correct.While Goldman Sachs maintains that the overall credit market looks fundamentally healthy, the widening gap between AI-related debt and the broader market suggests that for debt investors, the AI hype cycle is facing a reality check.", AI-linked bonds are currently underperforming the broader credit market.

First Digital Services Act penalty targets X’s verification system



US officials clash with EU over tech regulation







The European Union has issued its first-ever fine under the landmark Digital Services Act, slapping Elon Musk 's X platform with a €120 million ($140 million) penalty for violating transparency rules. The European Commission announced that X breached regulations through its ""deceptive design"" of blue verification checkmarks, lack of advertising transparency, and failure to provide researchers access to public data.Musk responded defiantly to the fine, claiming on X that European regulators had offered an ""illegal secret deal"" to avoid penalties if the platform ""quietly censored speech without telling anyone."" He stated that while other platforms accepted the arrangement, X refused. The billionaire also revealed the fine was imposed on him personally, not just the company, calling it ""even more insane.""The EU's primary concern centers on X's blue checkmark system, which now indicates a paid subscription rather than verified identity. Under Musk's ownership, anyone can purchase verification status without meaningful identity confirmation, making it ""difficult for users to judge the authenticity of accounts,"" according to the Commission.Regulators argue this exposes users to scams, impersonation fraud, and manipulation by malicious actors.Executive Vice-President Henna Virkkunen stated that ""deceiving users with blue checkmarks, obscuring information on ads and shutting out researchers have no place online in the EU."" The investigation, launched two years ago, also found X's advertising repository lacks critical information such as who paid for advertisements, while the platform imposes barriers preventing independent researchers from accessing public data for studying systemic risks.The fine has triggered sharp criticism from American officials, with Vice President JD Vance posting that ""the EU should be supporting free speech not attacking American companies over garbage."" FCC Chairman Brendan Carr accused Europe of ""taxing Americans to subsidize a continent held back by Europe's own suffocating regulations.""X now has 60 days to address the blue checkmark violations and 90 days to submit plans fixing advertising and data access issues. Failure to comply may result in additional periodic penalties. The Digital Services Act allows fines up to 6% of global annual revenue for violations. The Trump administration has pressured the EU to soften tech regulations, warning of potential trade retaliation over what it views as unfair targeting of US companies.","The European Union has slapped Elon Musk's X platform with a €120 million ($140 million) penalty for violating transparency rules.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reveals what makes Elon Musk 'very special'



Why Elon Musk does not like to play GTA







Tesla CEO Elon Musk ’ ex-wife Talulah Riley revealed how Musk managed to express his love for her despite the mounting pressures of running multiple companies. In a BBC series The Elon Musk Show in 2022, Riley described how Musk was overwhelmed by the pressure of running Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity and realised late on Christmas Eve in Boulder, Colorado, that he had forgotten to buy her a present. “It’s not that I don’t love you—I do really, really love you. It’s just that my brain is exploding,” he told her.Talulah Riley recalled that on a Christmas eve Elon Musk recalled the occasion and slipped out the bed in the middle of the night. She mentioned that Musk was only wearing a T-shirt and short and then he went into the snow without any slippers. He then returned hours later with a bouquet of hand-picked flowers which he had dug out of the frozen ground. Giving the flowers to Riley Musk said, “I just wanted to show you how much I loved you. ”Riley mentioned that Elon Musk was under immense strain at that time. SpaceX was fighting for survival after repeated failures and Tesla was racing to deliver the Model S with a $465 million government loan and SolarCity was struggling to gain traction. Riley recalled how she was worried about Elon Musk’s health. ““He was under incredible stress.I was worried he was going to have a heart attack. I just kept thinking, God, I’ve got to keep this guy alive,” Riley said.The midnight gesture, though unconventional, became a symbol of Musk’s emotional intensity. Riley has often defended him against perceptions of being cold or detached. “He is the most emotional person I know,” she said. “He feels very, very deeply.”Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has previously praised Elon Musk for his contribution in the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), saying he’s doing just the right things. In a recent podcast with Joe Rogan, Huang again commended the Tesla CEO, recounting an episode when he was the sole early buyer of the DGX-1 AI supercomputer in 2016. Huang further said that later he personally delivered the machine to X (formerly Twitter) owner in a small room that turned out to be OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.“When I announced this thing, nobody in the world wanted it. I had no purchase orders—not one. Nobody wanted to buy it. Nobody wanted to be part of it, except for Elon. He was at the event, and we were doing a fireside chat about the future of self-driving cars,” he told Rogan.However, the excitement was quickly dampened when Musk told him that he has a non-profit company.“And he goes, ‘You know what? I have a company that could really use this.’ And I said, ‘Wow, my first customer.’ I was pretty excited about it. And he goes, ‘Yeah, we have this company. It’s a non-profit company’,” Huang said, recounting the moment during a fireside chat.Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently revealed the reason that why he does not like to play GTA. During the People by WTF podcast hosted by Zerodha CEO and co-founder Nikhil Kamath, Musk mentioned that in GTA V, the storyline is supposed to move forward only when the police are being shot, which was something he could not do. He added that he prefers not to commit violence against NPCs in video games, hence he stopped playing when the mission required shooting at the police.At the People by WTF podcast hosted by Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nikhil Kamath, while discussing morality and religion, Kamath suddenly asked Tesla CEO Elon Musk, “Have you played GTA?” Replying to that, Musk said: “I've only played a little bit of GTA 'cause I didn't like the fact that...in GTA V, you literally can't progress unless you kill the police. And I'm like, ‘This doesn't work for me.’ I actually don't like killing the NPCs in the video games. That's not my thing, you know? So, actually, I didn't like GTA 'cause... I actually stopped when it said the only way to proceed is to shoot at the police. I'm like, ‘I don't wanna do that.’”","Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ex-wife Talulah Riley revealed how Musk managed to express his love for her despite the mounting pressures of running multiple companies.

The race towards AGI



IBM CEO Arvind Krishna says not due to AI, many companies are laying off







IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has note of caution as the all the big tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and others are pouring billions into building AI infrastructure. As reported by Fortune, speaking at the Decoder podcast earlier this month, Krishan argued that the huge investments made in building massive data centres is unlikely to deliver the returns the tech giants are expecting. Krishna pointed out that even a simple calculation shows the math doesn’t add up. He highlighted that building a data center capable of consuming just one gigawatt of power costs around $80 billion. If a single company commits to around 20 to 30 gigawatts, would mean capital expenditure of around $1.5 trillion which roughly equates to the current market cap of Tesla.So, collectively, the hyperscalers could add up to 100 gigawatts of capacity, but Krishna estimated that would require $8 trillion in investment. “It’s my view that there’s no way you’re going to get a return on that, because $8 trillion of capex means you need roughly $800 billion of profit just to pay for the interest,” he said.The data from Goldman Sachs underscores the challenge, The global data center market presently consumes around 55 gigawatts of power out of which only 14% is dedicated to AI. By the year 2027 which demand can go up to 84 gigawatts, driven by AI workloads.Krishna has now warned that the chips powering these centers could quickly become obsolete, forcing the companies to refresh infrastructure in every five years. “You’ve got to use it all in five years, because at that point, you’ve got to throw it away and refill it,” he explained.Speaking at the podcast, Krishan further suggested that part of the motivation behind these massive investments is the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, he still believes that the odds of reaching AGI with current large language model technology are slim. “There’s at most a 1% chance this feat can be accomplished with our current technology,” he said.Skeptical of AGI timelines, Krishan was also clear about AI’s enterprise potential. “I think it’s incredibly useful for enterprise. I think it’s going to unlock trillions of dollars of productivity in the enterprise, just to be absolutely clear,” he added.Despite the warnings made by Krishna, the companies like Google, Microsoft and others are still accelerating spending. Google parent Alphabet recently raised its 2025 capital expenditure outlook to $91–93 billion, while Amazon lifted its estimate to $125 billion. Industry-wide, AI infrastructure investments are expected to reach $380 billion this year alone.IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has refuted the narrative that the current wave of mass layoffs across the tech industry is primarily due to the artificial intelligence (AI) technology, arguing that the job cuts are largely a “natural correction” following over-hiring during the pandemic years. Krishna, however, acknowledged that AI will eventually lead to some job displacement, but suggested that many companies are currently laying off staff because they overhired between 2020 and 2023.In an interview with The Verge, Krishna used strong terms to describe the rapid staffing increases across the industry during the lockdown era.""If you look at the total employment numbers, I think people gorged on employment... during the pandemic and the year after,"" Krishna explained. He noted that some companies saw their employee count spike by ""30, 40, 50, 100 percent"" from 2020 to 2023.“There is going to be some natural correction. Business is never completely optimized. I think in engineering terms, it’s an underdamped system. When there’s a need, it goes above. Now, it has to correct. It’s probably going to go below what’s needed, and then it’ll hit the correct equilibrium, depending on market demand and growth,” the CEO noted.",IBM CEO Arvind Krishna says huge investments in building massive data centres is unlikely to deliver the returns the tech giants are expecting.

The burden of a CEO



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang tells you what to believe and not to on all the AI bubble talk



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on why he doesn't agree with the common career mantra







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently shared some insights on leadership, vision and sacrifice during a talk held at Cambridge Union Debating Center. During the talk he emphasised that the true strategy is not only about deciding what to pursue but it is also about the discipline of knowing and understanding what to leave behind. Reflecting on his early Nvidia days, Huang said that he could see the evolution of the company in his head long before to materialised and became a reality. “Manifest your belief as deeply as you can,” he told students, explaining how conviction helped him stay committed when the startup faced uncertainty. He stressed that Nvidia’s success was rooted in unshakable principles: “We believe what we believe.”Huang further noted that while his team worked on the assumptions of the firm, he constantly tested them. “Every single day, I gut check the assumptions I made,” he said, adding that course corrections were made only when necessary, without being swayed by outside pressures.Huang also stressed on the importance of adaptability in the journey of entrepreneurship. “I am constantly learning through failure,” he admitted, urging students to remain flexible when pursuing ambitious goals. He also highlighted Nvidia’s role in creating new industries, pointing to the invention of the GPU and CUDA accelerated computing, which he described as sparking the AI industrial revolution.Talking about the realities of leadership, Huang explained that being a CEO is a “a lifetime of sacrifice” in service of the company. “Strategy is not just about choosing what to do. It’s about choosing what not to do, which is sacrifice, and the determination, the conviction, the pain and suffering that goes along with overcoming obstacles,” he said.Dismissing the notion of fame and glory, Huang emphasised that on the importance of creating conditions for others to achieve their life’s work. “You’re inspiring through example,” he told the audience.Honoured with Hawking FellowshipAhead of the discussion, Huang was honoured with Professor Stephen Hawking Fellowship Award. The prestigious award recognises the contributions of individuals in the field of science and technology.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again addressed the topic of AI bubble. Recenty, Huang talked about the issue that whether artificial intelligence is moving towards a bubble reminiscent of the dot-com crash. Speaking at the 2025 US-Saudi Investment forum, Huang delivered a three-minute response that reframed the conversation. Instead of focusing on the market valuations, Huang argued that the investors are worried about a bubble may be overlooking the fundamental technological shift which is already reshaping global computing.Speaking at the event, Huang started pointing to a structural constraint in computer science: the end of Moore’s Law, the decades-long trend of transistor density doubling every two years. Huang added that the trend has now plateaued, creating a widening gap between skyrocketing demand for computing power and the industry’s ability to supply it through traditional chips. “This isn’t speculation—it’s a fundamental challenge driving the need for new computing paradigms,” Huang said.This gap, he explained, is why companies are not merely experimenting with AI infrastructure but committing massive capital expenditures to it out of necessity.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is giving back on one of the most popular pieces of career advice: ‘Find what you love’. In a candid interview on Norges Bank Investment Management’s in Good Company podcast, Huang believes that passion is not a prerequisite for success, it is something that can grow via commitment and effort. “It’s hard to find something that you love, but it’s easier to fall in love with what you’re doing,” Huang said. “Once you fall in love with what you’re doing because you desperately want to do a good job at it, it’s easier to do it well and work hard.”Huang’s philosophy is rooted in personal experience. Huang started working from the age of 15 and was washing dishes at Denny’s followed by stints as a busboy and waiter. Huang also credits those early roles with teaching him discipline, humility and resilience and says that he genuinely enjoyed each one. “I loved it when I was a dishwasher. I loved it when I was a busboy. I loved it when I was delivering papers,” he recalled. “I’ve loved every single job that I’ve ever had.”",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently spoke at Cambridge Union Debating Center.

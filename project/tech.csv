Succession planning goes beyond CEO’s role



Tim Cook , who’s been leading Apple for over the past decade, addressed the burning question about his future at the company in a candid interview with Wired, echoing the introspective words of his predecessor, Steve Jobs . ""I'll do it until the voice in my head says, 'It's time,'"" Cook said.Cook, who has led Apple since August 2011, sees his current role as more than just a job. ""It's hard to imagine life without Apple, because my life has been wrapped up in this company since 1998,"" he shared, underlining the emotional connection to the tech giant he's helped shape for over a decade.While Cook remains committed to his position, he's acutely aware of the need for a carefully planned succession. The CEO has been quietly grooming potential internal candidates, emphasizing his belief that the next leader should come from within Apple's ranks. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, points to John Ternus , Apple's hardware engineering chief, as a leading contender.At 49, Ternus has been with the company since 2011 and has increasingly been thrust into the spotlight, leading product announcements and earning respect from top executives. His leadership style reportedly mirrors Cook's, making him a strong potential successor.The succession plan extends beyond the CEO role. Apple is strategically preparing for a potential leadership transition across critical divisions, including engineering, marketing, services, and finance. With the current executive team approaching retirement age, the company faces the complex challenge of maintaining its innovative edge and corporate culture.Cook remains pragmatic about the future, noting the importance of preparedness. ""We're a company that believes in succession plans,"" he explained in a podcast with Dua Lipa , candidly admitting that ""something unpredictable can always happen.""","Tim Cook has led Apple since August 2011.

"Reliance and Airtel fighting again, this time with Tata Play joining from Airtel's side",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/reliance-and-airtel-fighting-again-this-time-with-tata-play-joining-from-airtels-side/articleshow/115983968.cms,"Airtel has Tata Play on its side

What Airtel wants

What Reliance Jio wants

TRAI recommendations

Telecom giants Reliance Jio Infocomm and Bharti Airtel are reportedly at fighting again. According to a report in Economic Times, telecom operators Reliance Jio Infocomm and Bharti Airtel are once again at odds over waiving the licence fee for direct-to-home (DTH) operators, with the former advocating for retaining the fee and the latter calling for its eventual phase-out.Both companies presented their arguments to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) during its consultation on the ""Framework for Service Authorisations for the Provision of Broadcasting Services under the Telecommunications Act, 2023.""Airtel has called for the complete removal of the licence fee, arguing that DTH should be treated on par with other TV distribution platforms, which are exempt from such charges. Tata Play, also urged TRAI to implement this change promptly, and further called for the removal of cross-media restrictions that limit broadcasters to owning no more than 20% of a distribution company. There have been speculations that Airtel and Tata Play are in merger talks.Airtel has proposed that the licence fee—currently levied on content revenue from DTH operators—be shifted to broadcasters, who ultimately benefit from the revenue. Additionally, Airtel suggested that the definitions of Gross Revenue (GR), Applicable Gross Revenue (ApGR), and Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR), as set by the Cabinet for the telecom sector, should also apply to DTH operators.On the other hand, Jio has strongly opposed the waiver, arguing that DTH services already benefit fromfree spectrum allocation , which is provided at significantly lower-than-market rates. Jio contends that this creates a competitive imbalance, disadvantaging cable TV and IPTV providers, and results in revenue losses for the national exchequer. Jio further argued that waiving the licence fee for DTH services, based solely on comparisons with other platforms, would be unconstitutional, as it would fail to consider the unique advantages DTH receives through free spectrum. Jio reportedly referred to the Indian Constitution, which mandates equal treatment only where distinctions are irrelevant.Jio emphasized that DTH operators, which avoid significant investments in terrestrial fibre or cable networks by relying on free spectrum, should not receive fee waivers, while fixed-line and mobile service providers—who invest heavily in infrastructure—continue to pay licence fees.In August 2023, TRAI recommended that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) reduce the DTH licence fee to 3% of AGR from the current 8%, with a plan to phase it out entirely by FY27. This recommendation aims to bring DTH into parity with other TV distribution platforms such as cable TV, HITS, and IPTV.Jio also urged TRAI to conduct an independent analysis of the competitive advantages DTH operators gain from free spectrum allocation, without relying solely on past recommendations.Airtel owns the DTH operator Bharti Telemedia, which operates under the Airtel Digital TV brand, while Jio owns cable networks like DEN Networks and Hathway Cable & Datacom, and holds a significant stake in GTPL Hathway.TRAI's consultation is part of its efforts to develop a unified authorisation framework for broadcasting services under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, which replaced the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. This framework aims to streamline regulations for DTH, IPTV, and radio broadcasting.Meanwhile, the MIB has previously sought dues from DTH operators based on 10% of their gross revenue, without deductions. DTH operators, however, have disputed these demands, making various deductions under different income categories. As a result, the four private DTH operators could face potential licence fee liabilities exceeding Rs 15,000 crore, and they have challenged the MIB’s demand notices. The case is currently pending before the Supreme Court.","Reliance Jio Infocomm and Bharti Airtel are reportedly at odds over waiving the licence fee for direct-to-home (DTH) operators.

When Bryan Johnson accepted 'defeat' with his anti-ageing therapy

Tech millionaire Bryan Johnson , famed for his age-reversing experiments, recently connected with Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal at an exclusive event titled “Don’t Die.” The gathering, inspired by Johnson’s movement advocating longer, healthier, and happier lives, was hosted by Goyal at Soho House for an intimate audience of 50 select attendees. Sharing the experience on X (formerly Twitter), Johnson wrote, “Last night at Soho House with @deepigoyal, who built @zomato into one of the most successful companies in India.”For those unaware, Soho is an international private members’ club in Mumbai. “There were over 1,100 applications for 50 seats. Sad to miss so many of you. Thank you @akshaybd and @thetanmay for hosting,” he added, sharing images from the event.The event was also attended by a Mumbai-based doctor Rickson Pereira who wrote on X: “Had an enlightening Sunday evening listening to @bryan_johnson talk about his project ‘Blueprint’. “Blueprint” is his personal project where he aims to “not die” by implementing a rigorous daily routine that includes diet, exercise, sleep, and supplements. He works closely with a team of doctors and researchers to monitor his body’s biomarkers and adjust his routine for optimal health. I subscribe to his ideology of prioritising your health first. I have been following his work for over a year and I think he is doing an amazing job of generating data about what works for human body and what is required to be in peak physical health. Thank you @thetanmay for the invite.”Bryan Johnson’s anti-aging journey, part of his ambitious Project Blueprint , has involved controversial methods such as receiving blood transfusions from his teenage son—a ""young blood"" procedure not approved by the FDA—alongside a strict diet with Blueprint-branded supplements and regular gene therapy injections.In November this year, Johnson accepted facing a setback when a recent procedure reportedly caused severe swelling to his face. Sharing a post on Instagram, Johnson wrote that he injected a fat-derived extracellular matrix into his face as part of first therapy under a procedure called “Project Baby Face”. He said that immediately following the injections, his face began to blow up. “And then it got worse, and worse, and worse until I couldn’t even see. It was a severe allergic reaction,” he added.","Tech millionaire Bryan Johnson is famed for his age-reversing experiments.

An Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die. Launched in July early this year, the app analyzes personal data such as age, height, weight, daily calorie intake, exercise levels, and more to predict the date. Developer Brent Franson says that the AI was trained on a dataset of more than 1,200 life expectancy studies with some 53 million participants. The results, he says, are a ‘pretty significant’ improvement on the standard life-table expectations.Despite its somewhat morbid concept—a ""fond farewell"" death-day card featuring the Grim Reaper—the app has gained traction in the Health and Fitness category. It is free to use, while you will need a subscription to show a clock counting down to my estimated death. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, the app has around 1,25,000 downloads till date.“Have you ever asked yourself 'when will I die?', our advanced life expectancy calculator will accurately* predict your death date for you depending on where you live, how much you smoke and your lifestyle to show your own death clock countdown.

If you don't know your BMI simply use the BMI calculator form,” the app reads.Death Clock predictions are based on extensive medical studies and health data, with AI providing personalized suggestions for a healthier lifestyle. The idea is to encourage individuals to take better care of their health, using the predictions as a framework for decision-making.As mentioned, the app offers personalised suggestions to users. Some of these include:Maintaining a healthy weight is vital to reduce the risk of developing diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.Get moving for at least 30 minutes a day. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.Avoid smoking and second-hand smoke. These can lead to various types of cancer, heart disease, and lung diseases.Eating a balanced diet full of nutrient-rich fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains is critical. Avoid consuming too much processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats.Limit alcohol intake. While occasional social drinking is usually okay, heavy or prolonged drinking can lead to a number of health issues including liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and cancer.Try to get a good night's sleep. Quality sleep is important for overall health and well-being. It affects mood, memory, and healing processes.Regular screenings and medical check-ups can help detect problems early. This is especially important for conditions that don't always show noticeable symptoms, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol.Long-term stress can lead to a number of health issues. Practice stress management techniques like mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or other relaxation exercises.Relationships and social interactions are vital for mental health. Loneliness and social isolation can lead to depression and cognitive decline.Keep your mind active. Lifelong learning, reading, solving puzzles, or other brain-engaging activities can help to keep your mind sharp and potentially delay the onset of cognitive decline.While it’s important to note that these AI-driven tools aren’t guaranteed to provide exact dates, there are concerns about privacy and data security, as users must input sensitive information, which could be exploited by companies or malicious actors.","Artificial intelligence-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die.

Revisiting the 6 productivity tips that Elon Musk shared with employees of Tesla and Twitter: Walk out of meetings and more ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/revisiting-the-6-productivity-tips-that-elon-musk-shared-with-employees-of-tesla-and-twitter-walk-out-of-meetings-and-more-/articleshow/115875599.cms,"Excessive meetings are biggest drain on productivity

Walk out of a meeting if ...

Technical jargon is a Big No

Forget the chain of command

Don't forget common sense

Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk , who is now one of the most influential people in the United States, post the election of Donald Trump , ""a few productivity recommendations"", which the employees need to follow to thrive in any of his firms. Known for his demanding work ethic, the billionaire has recently shared productivity tips with employees at both Tesla and Twitter.Just days after laying off 3,800 Twitter employees, Musk sent a company-wide email outlining his expectations for the remaining staff. Hardcore Work Ethic: Employees must be prepared to work long hours at high intensity. Exceptional Performance: Only exceptional performance will be tolerated.Those who don't agree to these terms by a specific deadline will receive three months of severance pay.Musk also shared an email giving suggestions on how to improve productivity . The same email is said to have been earlier shared with Tesla employees. Here are the tips:Excessive meetings are the blight of big companies and almost always get worse over time. Please get rid of all large meetings, unless you’re certain they are providing value to the whole audience, in which case keep them very short. Also get rid of frequent meetings, unless you are dealing with an extremely urgent matter. Meeting frequency should drop rapidly once the urgent matter is resolved.Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value. It is not rude to leave, it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.Don’t use acronyms or nonsense words for objects, software or processes at Tesla. In general, anything that requires an explanation inhibits communication. We don’t want people to have to memorize a glossary just to function at Tesla.Communication should travel via the shortest path necessary to get the job done, not through the “chain of command”. Any manager who attempts to enforce chain of command communication will soon find themselves working elsewhere. A major source of issues is poor communication between depts. The way to solve this is to allow free flow of information between all levels. If, in order to get something done between depts, an individual contributor has to talk to their manager, who talks to a director, who talks to a VP, who talks to another VP, who talks to a director, who talks to a manager, who talks to someone doing the actual work, then super dumb things will happen. It must be ok for people to talk directly and just make the right thing happen. A major source of issues is poor communication between depts.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has initiated an investigation into Google following allegations by online gaming company Winzo, marking a potential challenge to the tech giant's dominance in the app market. Winzo accuses Google of abusing its market power by restricting real-money gaming apps from being listed on the Play Store. According to the gaming company, this policy forces developers to resort to sideloading—direct app downloads from websites—which is considered less secure and limits consumer choice. Winzo argues that this restrictive practice hampers the accessibility of apps offering real-money games of skill, as these can only be downloaded through their website, creating unnecessary hurdles for developers and users alike.

PAN 2.0 features enhanced security, including a dynamic QR code designed to automatically detect duplicate PAN cards and identify incorrect information. This measure aims to simplify the detection of violations, such as individuals possessing multiple PAN cards or providing false PAN details, which can result in a penalty of Rs 10,000.Taxation experts highlight that the new system addresses fraud cases where fake PAN cards have been used for illegal activities like setting up fraudulent companies or committing GST and input tax credit fraud. Instances have emerged where original PAN holders were unaware of their credentials being misused. Taxpayers are advised to verify and deactivate any duplicate PAN cards issued under their name to prevent potential misuse. Click here to read the complete story.

How to participate in NASA’s lunar rescue challenge

Preparing for Artemis: The Moon's south pole as a key focus

In a groundbreaking initiative aimed at bolstering astronaut safety during its Artemis missions , NASA has launched a global competition to develop a Lunar Rescue System to help incapacitated astronauts on the Moon. With a substantial prize pool of $45,000, the challenge offers up to $20,000 for the best design. The competition is open to participants until January 23, 2025, through the HeroX platform. This project highlights NASA’s ongoing efforts to address the harsh realities of space exploration and ensure astronauts’ well-being while navigating the Moon's extreme environment.The Artemis missions, slated to begin in 2026, aim to return humans to the Moon, with a focus on exploring the lunar south pole. This region presents significant challenges due to its rugged terrain and extreme temperatures. The potential for astronauts to face medical emergencies, injuries, or accidents in such a harsh environment has made safety a top priority for NASA.Sarah Douglas, a NASA official, emphasised the importance of the Lunar Rescue System, stating, “In the unforgiving lunar environment, the possibility of an astronaut crewmember becoming incapacitated due to unforeseen circumstances (injury, medical emergency, or a mission-related accident) is a critical concern.” The challenge lies not only in the Moon’s low gravity, which reduces the weight of objects but also in the complexity of moving a fully suited astronaut across the difficult landscape of the lunar surface.The south pole of the Moon is characterized by steep slopes, rocky surfaces, and large craters, ranging from 1 to 30 meters in diameter. Some of the rocks in the area are up to 20 meters wide. These conditions make manual transport of an incapacitated astronaut impossible, as the spacesuit, while designed for protection, is too heavy for one person to carry. Therefore, NASA is seeking an innovative solution that can safely transport an astronaut over a distance of at least two kilometers, even over challenging terrain.One of the primary criteria for the Lunar Rescue System is that it must operate independently from lunar rovers, which will not always be available in every situation. The system must also be capable of handling the new Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Suit (AxEMU), an advanced spacesuit that will be worn by astronauts during the Artemis missions. This suit, though critical for astronaut mobility, adds additional weight and complexity to the rescue process.NASA has set clear guidelines for the design of the Lunar Rescue System. The winning solution must meet the following criteria:The competition is hosted on the HeroX platform, where innovators from around the world can submit their proposals. NASA will evaluate each submission based on the design’s feasibility, safety, and overall effectiveness in the harsh lunar environment. Submissions are open until January 23, 2025, and entries can be made through the HeroX portal.The challenge offers an opportunity for individuals, teams, or organizations to contribute to the future of space exploration. By crowd-sourcing ideas, NASA aims to leverage the creativity and expertise of innovators across the globe to solve one of the most pressing problems of lunar exploration: astronaut safety.The Artemis missions are poised to establish a long-term human presence on the Moon, with the south pole being a critical focus due to its potential to contain water-ice in shadowed craters. This ice could be used for essential resources like drinking water, oxygen, and even rocket fuel. However, the region's extreme conditions pose significant challenges in terms of astronaut mobility, equipment reliability, and safety.NASA’s Lunar Rescue System competition represents an essential step in overcoming these challenges. By offering a platform for global talent to contribute, NASA is ensuring that astronaut safety remains a priority as it works toward establishing a sustainable human presence on the Moon.","The Artemis missions, slated to begin in 2026, aim to return humans to the Moon, with a focus on exploring the lunar south pole.

Gaurav Gogoi criticises Narayana Murthy’s view on work-life balance

“After all, what is life but looking after your children, cooking for them, teaching them, taking care of your elderly parents, being there for your friends in their times of need, making sure that your house is in order. The above is just as much a man’s job as it is a woman’s.”

“Traditionally working women don’t even have the choice to cut away life from work. It is a luxury that traditionally men have and one that they have to forego in the modern world,”

Gender implications of Narayana Murthy’s view

Growing debate around work-life balance

In a recent exchange that has sparked widespread discussion, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi voiced his disagreement with Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy ’s perspective on work-life balance. Murthy, known for his contributions to India’s tech industry, made headlines during the CNBC Global Leadership Summit, where he advocated for a 70-hour workweek , claiming that such dedication is crucial for India's economic progress. However, Gogoi has criticized Murthy’s stance, arguing that work-life balance is a privilege that has historically been afforded to men, and is no longer viable in today’s modern world. His remarks have brought attention to the evolving conversation about gender roles, work expectations, and personal well-being in the workplace.During the CNBC Global Leadership Summit, Narayana Murthy made a controversial statement regarding work-life balance, which has since drawn significant attention. Murthy expressed that he does not believe in a work-life balance, suggesting instead that a rigorous 70-hour workweek is essential for individual success and the broader economic advancement of India. He argued that such dedication to work is integral to achieving national growth and prosperity, particularly in a rapidly evolving economy.Murthy’s viewpoint, which reflects a traditional belief in the primacy of professional commitment, resonates with a certain segment of the corporate world. However, his statement has also been met with significant criticism, especially in light of growing calls for healthier work environments that prioritize personal well-being and work-life harmony.In response to Murthy’s comments, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to express his disagreement. Gogoi argued that Murthy’s perspective on work-life balance represents a privilege traditionally reserved for men, who, according to him, have historically been able to compartmentalize work and personal life.Gogoi’s critique centered around the idea that the tasks associated with maintaining a household—such as caring for children, cooking, teaching, and caring for elderly parents—should be shared equally by men and women. He emphasized that these responsibilities should not solely be considered the domain of women, as they have often been in traditional societal structures.Gogoi stated:He also pointed out that, for many women, the notion of work-life balance is not even a consideration. He noted that women, especially working mothers, often do not have the luxury of separating their work from their personal life because of societal expectations. According to Gogoi, men have historically had the privilege of focusing primarily on their careers, but in the modern world, this dynamic must change.Gogoi added.Gogoi’s comments touch upon broader issues of gender inequality, particularly in the workplace and at home. In traditional societies, men have often been seen as the primary breadwinners, with women shouldering the majority of domestic responsibilities. This division has led to unequal expectations when it comes to balancing career and personal life.Gogoi’s response suggests that in the modern world, these outdated norms must be challenged. With more women joining the workforce, particularly in high-stakes industries like technology and finance, the notion of work-life balance needs to be redefined. Work-life balance should not be an ideal only available to men, but a principle that applies equally to both genders, allowing everyone to thrive both personally and professionally.Murthy’s comments come at a time when discussions around work-life balance are becoming increasingly relevant. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many workers have reevaluated their priorities, with mental health and personal time gaining significance in the professional sphere. Flexible work hours, remote work opportunities, and a focus on well-being have become key demands in modern workplaces.At the same time, some leaders, like Murthy, continue to advocate for long work hours, viewing them as necessary for business success. This debate raises important questions about productivity, employee satisfaction, and the true cost of success.","Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi voiced his disagreement with Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy ’s perspective on work-life balance.

This Brazilian company is fighting Apple over “iPhone” trademark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-brazilian-company-is-fighting-apple-over-iphone-trademark/articleshow/115978110.cms,"What the company said about the trademark dispute



“People look at this story and say ‘Gradiente is a Brazilian company, so it must be a scam, right?”

“We sold 30,000 [units] in a few months,”

Apple’s dispute with Gradiente



“He [Steve Jobs] launched a sensational product. He’s a genius of our generation and of several generations. But that doesn’t take away from the fact that we launched a similar product before with the same name. The country [Brazil] doesn’t recognize many of its own innovations.”

A Brazilian company named Gradiente is asserting its claim to the ""iPhone"" trademark. The phone-making company is arguing that it registered the “iPhone” name years before Apple. This ongoing legal dispute in Brazil challenges Apple's ownership of the iconic brand. Despite the case awaiting a final judgment, Gradiente maintains its stance as the original creator of the iPhone.Gradiente CEO Eugênio Staub has opened up about the frustration with the public perception of his company's legal battle with Apple over the ""iPhone"" trademark in Brazil. In an interview with Folha de S. Paulo, Staub noted that even Brazilians accuse Gradiente of opportunistically trying to profit from Apple, which he insists is not the case.He highlighted the challenge of being a Brazilian company facing a global giant like Apple, emphasising that Gradiente genuinely believes it created the first iPhone.Staub said.To further emphasise Gradiente's claim, Staub presented evidence of an old "" Gradiente iPhone "" unit launched in Brazil in 2000, seven years before Apple's iPhone. He also showed promotional leaflets from that time, reinforcing their assertion of being the first to market with the ""iPhone"" name.he added.Despite launching a phone called ""Gradiente Iphone"" in 2000, a trademark dispute delayed Gradiente's official ownership of the ""iPhone"" trademark in Brazil until 2008, a year after Apple's iPhone debuted. This legal complication arose from a conflict with another Brazilian company. Although Gradiente had stopped producing phones at that time, they re-entered the market in 2012 with an Android smartphone named ""Gradiente iPhone."" This move reignited the trademark dispute with Apple, which continues to this day.Apple has also challenged Gradiente's ""iPhone"" trademark in Brazil, leading to a protracted legal battle that continues to this day. In 2013, Gradiente lost exclusive rights to the trademark, but the dispute remains unresolved, pending a final judgment from the Supreme Court.Despite the ongoing legal conflict, Gradiente's CEO maintains that he has no personal animosity towards Apple or its iPhone. A final court date has not yet been set to resolve the ongoing trademark dispute between Apple and Gradiente over the ""iPhone"" name in Brazil.Staub also highlighted:","A Brazilian company named Gradiente is asserting its claim to the ""iPhone"" trademark.

While the negotiations have been on, with investment banks involved from both the sides, the key to the deal going through is to bring the Maheshwari brothers on board for merging Unacademy with Allen.”

“The valuation of both companies will be used to fix the share swap ratio and that process is yet not completed,”

“While Unacademy has controlled its losses, its revenue has been flat. As for Allen, the business, while being profitable, has seen a significant dip due to the stress in the Kota coaching ecosystem. The valuation being ascribed to Unacademy includes the cash balance of around $160 million that the edtech firm currently holds in the bank.”

What will happen to Unacademy if the deal goes through



“Allen’s interested in Unacademy to spruce up its digital presence and potentially go public as a merged entity. The Unacademy shareholders want to be a part of a profitable venture like Allen so they have been pushing for it to go through,”

Unacademy is reportedly in talks to be acquired. Allen Career Institute , an offline test preparation centre, is likely to offer a deal that could value the edtech firm at $800 million. This represents a significant drop from its peak valuation of $3.4 billion. According to a report by the Economic Times, three unnamed sources in the know of this deal said that it has been under discussion for several months and is now awaiting final approval from Allen's promoters, the Maheshwari family. If successful, this acquisition would mark a major consolidation in the edtech sector, which has been struggling with a post-Covid slowdown and the fallout from Byju's bankruptcy and financial irregularities. Unacademy, which started as a YouTube channel ten years ago, has also shifted to an offline model after facing challenges in the online-only market.One person close to the talks said to ET:a second person said to ET. He also added that the potential cash payouts to the founders and early investors of Unacademy are yet to be finalised.Meanwhile, a third person who was also familiar with the matter said to ET:He also highlighted that this has become a key point of contention between the two parties in determining Unacademy's enterprise valuation, excluding its cash holdings.If the acquisition goes through, Unacademy co-founders Gaurav Munjal, Roman Saini, and Sumit Jain are expected to depart from the company. Another co-founder, Hemesh Singh, who resigned from the chief technology officer role transitioned to an advisory role in June.The merger discussions are reportedly being led by Munjal and Bodhi Tree, an investor in Allen Career Institute. Bodhi Tree, a joint venture between James Murdoch and Uday Shankar, invested $600 million in Allen in 2022.Unacademy has raised a total of $880 million from notable investors like Temasek, General Atlantic, and Tiger Global. However, the potential payout structure for founders and early investors in the event of an acquisition remains a key point of negotiation.one of the sources added.","Unacademy is reportedly in talks to be acquired.

Matt Murphy, CEO of Marvell Technology, and Lip-Bu Tan, a former Intel board member, are reportedly at the top of the shortlist.Murphy leads Marvell, semiconductor company that has seen significant growth, with its stock up 59% this year, while Tan brings extensive board experience from technology firms including SoftBank Group and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.2024 has been a hard year for Intel, which has seen its stock price drop nearly 50% this year amid significant market challenges.

China has announced a ban on exports of key minerals to the US, which may hit the manufacturing in the country’s tech sector. The ban comes a day after the US announced export restrictions on 140 Chinese companies and stricter controls on chipmaking equipment.According to a report by news agency Reuters, China is banning export of minerals like gallium, germanium, and others.“In principle, the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials to the United States shall not be permitted,” the ministry said.These minerals are critical components in various technologies, including semiconductors, infrared technology, fiber optic cables, solar cells, and even military applications like ammunition and nuclear weapons. Gallium and germanium are used in semiconductors, while germanium is also used in infrared technology, fibre optic cables and solar cells.The ban, effective immediately, targets “dual-use” items that have both military and civilian applications. It also requires stricter scrutiny of end-use for graphite exports to the US.While China had already begun limiting exports of these minerals last year, this new ban specifically targets the US, essentially marking a significant escalation in trade tensions between the two economic giants.Reuters report says that despite being a major consumer of these minerals in the past, the US has not imported any wrought or unwrought germanium or gallium from China this year.Meanwhile, the incoming US administration has also signaled its intention to maintain a tough stance on China, with plans to implement additional tariffs on Chinese goods.","China has announced a ban on exports of key minerals to the US.

Palicha stated that he holds no objections to work-life balance and even humorously encouraged his competitors to adopt it.The comments come after an anonymous Reddit user, claiming to be a Zepto employee, posted a scathing critique of the company's work environment. The Redditor alleged that Zepto has long working hours, with meetings starting as early as 2 AM because the CEO ""cannot wake up early.""The post also claimed that young workers are ""exploited"" by being forced to work 14-hour days, and that massive layoffs are imminent.In a series of social media posts, Palicha appeared to acknowledge the concerns, noting that the 2 AM meeting start time and 10 AM work start are due to the CEO's schedule. He also said Zepto hires many young workers because ""senior people do not want to work in such a culture.""Additionally, Palicha referenced an interview with another Indian-origin CEO who defended 84-hour workweeks, saying ""I have nothing against work-life balance. In fact, I recommend it to all our competitors."" He said, in another post, ""FYI, not my quote - read it from an interview of Daksh Gupta.""However, the 22-year-old billionaire did not directly address the other allegations, such as the claims of customer data misuse and delayed meetings.Zepto, founded in 2021, has faced scrutiny over its rapid growth and business practices.

What is Elon Musk's compensation structure

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again faced a setback as a Delaware judge has denied $56 billion pay package reinstatement. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery has upheld her previous decision to block Elon Musk's controversial $56 billion Tesla compensation package despite Tesla shareholders voting in June to reinstate it. The chancellor cited the package as excessive and criticized the ratification vote, stating it came too late and involved conflicts of interest, particularly with Musk overseeing pay negotiations.It's worth noting that Musk's compensation package, initially valued at $56 billion, has significantly increased due to Tesla's stock surge. Shares of the company jumped 42% after November 5, when Donald Trump, supported by Musk, won the U.S. presidential election. As a result, the pay package is now estimated to be worth around $101 billion, reflecting Tesla's robust performance in the stock market.In a statement on X (formerly Twitter), Elon Musk responded saying, “Shareholders should control company votes, not judges.”Tesla also announced plans to appeal the ruling, calling it flawed and undermining the will of shareholders. The company will approach the Delaware Supreme Court after McCormick finalizes the order.Elon Musk's 2018 pay package was based on the idea that he would get all the options only if Tesla’s stock price soared and its sales and earnings grew strongly. His compensation package created 12 tranches of options - each equivalent at the time to 1% of Tesla's outstanding shares - potentially giving him a 12% stake in the automaker. Musk would receive no salary. Under the 10-year deal, Musk was eligible to win an options tranche every time Tesla hit a series of up to 12 targets. Those targets were tied to increases in Tesla's market capitalization in $50 billion increments, and to aggressive hurdles for revenue and EBITDA growth. Musk went on to hit all 12 targets when few had expected him to, given the various struggles of Tesla at that time. He still owns the options.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again faced a setback as a Delaware judge has denied $56 billion pay package reinstatement.

Here’s what Swiggy CFO told analyst

Bengaluru-based Swiggy is planning to increase delivery fees on Instamart orders, reports Money Control. The report quotes chief financial officer (CFO) Rahul Bothra who told analysts about the delivery price hike in the likely future on December 3. This comes two months after Swiggy increased platform fees. Both Swiggy and Zomato increased the platform fee they charge users for food delivery during the festive season. Zomato increased it to Rs 10 per order from the previous Rs 6, while Swiggy raised it by Rs 3 – from Rs 7 to Rs 10.Readers must note that Swiggy offers free delivery to its One members, while other members have to pay a delivery fee. This is similar to what Zepto does. It offers free delivery for Zepto Pass holders, but charges non-Pass members. Zomato-owned Blinkit, on the other hand, does not have any loyalty programme and charges a delivery fee on every order and.The MC report quotes Bothra saying “In the overall delivery fee construct, today there is a certain amount of subsidy that goes into the business, both through the subscription programme (Swiggy One) as well as getting users acquainted (with) this new service. Over time there is expectation to increase the delivery fee”. He did not reveal any other details.Announcing the company’s quarterly results, Bothra also addressed questions on how the company plans to boost its take rates from 15% to 20-22% in the future for its Instamart business. He mentioned that monetization through ads on the platform will be another key strategy for improving margins over time.",Bengaluru-based Swiggy is planning to increase delivery fees on Instamart orders.

Microsoft faces $1.2 billion lawsuit in UK; here’s why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-faces-1-2-billion-lawsuit-in-uk-heres-why/articleshow/115955411.cms,"Microsoft is reportedly facing a $1.27 billion lawsuit in the UK. According to a Reuters report, the software giant has been accused of unfairly overcharging customers of rival cloud companies.Microsoft offers discounted pricing for companies using Windows Server on Azure compared to competitors like AWS , Google Cloud , or Alibaba Cloud. This pricing strategy, the lawsuit claims, effectively penalizes firms, forcing them to pay higher costs for non-Microsoft services. It further claims Microsoft exploits its dominant position in cloud-based server operating systems to charge higher prices for using its software on rival platforms. It alleges that this pricing strategy pressures customers to migrate to Azure instead.The lawsuit was filed by competition lawyer Maria Luisa Stasi at the Competition Appeal Tribunal on Tuesday, December 3. “Put simply, Microsoft is punishing UK businesses and organisations for using Google, Amazon and Alibaba for cloud computing by forcing them to pay more money for Windows Server,” Stasi said in a statement shared with CNBC.“By doing so, Microsoft is trying to force customers into using its cloud computing service Azure and restricting competition in the sector.”She added the lawsuit “aims to challenge Microsoft’s anti-competitive behavior, push them to reveal exactly how much businesses in the UK have been illegally penalized, and return the money to organizations that have been unfairly overcharged.”The lawsuit represents thousands of British businesses and organizations in an “opt-out” collective action. This means all potentially affected companies are automatically included in the case and stand to receive compensation if the lawsuit against Microsoft is successful.",Microsoft is reportedly facing a $1.27 billion lawsuit in the UK.

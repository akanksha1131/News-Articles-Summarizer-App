Big Win For Trump Amid Trade Faceoff With China, TikTok Algorithm Now Under American Oversight

Trump: “American operated all the way”



What’s Next







US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order approving the proposal sale of TikTok’s US operations to an American investor group. With this move, the Trump administration aims to resolve the long‑standing national security concerns while keeping the popular video app available to millions of U.S. users. As reported by Reuters, Vice President JD Vance revealed that the agreement values TikTok’s US business at $14 billion. The executive order signed by Trump temporarily bars the Department of Justice from enforcing a law that would have forced TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance face a nationwide ban.Under the deal, TikTok US will now form a new board of directors. Also, the recommendations algorithm, source code and content moderation systems of TikTok will be transferred to the new owners. As per the executive order signed by Trump, Oracle will now oversee TikTok’s US security operations and also offer cloud services.Also, investors including Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX are said to take around 45% stake in the new entity. ""There was some resistance on the Chinese side, but the fundamental thing that we wanted to accomplish is that we wanted to keep TikTok operating, but we also wanted to make sure that we protected Americans' data privacy as required by law,"" Vance told Reuters.As reported by Reuters, Trump has told the reporters that he had a word with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who gave his approval for the arrangement. “I told him what we were doing, and he said, ‘Go ahead with it,’” Trump said, adding that TikTok U.S. would be “American operated all the way.”The President also said that the new ownership structure will make sure that the social media platform is not being used as a ‘propaganda tool’.ByteDance has not yet publicly commented on the executive order but previously said it would comply with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order approving the proposal sale of TikTok’s US operations to an American investor group.

EU rejects Apple's call to scrap digital markets act,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/eu-rejects-apples-call-to-scrap-digital-markets-act/articleshow/124126973.cms,"European Union flags (Pic credit: AP)

Apple cites security concerns

EU Stands firm on competition goals





The European Union firmly rejected Apple 's demand to repeal its landmark Digital Markets Act on Thursday, dismissing the tech giant's claims that the regulations compromise user security and calling for wholesale changes to enforcement.The European Commission said it had ""absolutely no intention"" to abandon the law after Apple submitted a formal request for the DMA to be ""repealed while a more appropriate fit for purpose legislative instrument is put in place."" EU digital affairs spokesman Thomas Regnier said the commission was ""not surprised"" by Apple's move, noting the company ""has simply contested every little bit of the DMA since its entry into application. ""Apple argued in its 25-page submission that the DMA has forced delays of new features in the EU, including live translation with AirPods and iPhone mirroring capabilities. The company claims it cannot implement these features without exposing user data to third parties, something it refuses to do for privacy reasons.The tech giant also raised concerns about increased security risks from mandatory app sideloading and alternative marketplaces, pointing to the availability of pornography and gambling apps that previously weren't allowed on iPhones.Apple says these changes expose EU users to ""scams spread through fake banking apps, malware disguised as games, and third-party payment systems that overcharge them.""The commission dismissed Apple's security arguments, with Regnier stating that ""nothing in the DMA requires companies to lower their privacy standards, their security standards."" Brussels maintains the law is necessary to prevent unfair market domination and level the playing field for Apple's competitors.The standoff intensifies as President Donald Trump seeks to pressure the EU over decisions affecting US Big Tech companies. Apple previously appealed a €500 million DMA fine imposed in April and faces an additional €1.8 billion penalty under separate EU competition rules.","EU rejects Apple's request to repeal its landmark Digital Markets Act.

"Microsoft moves 'further away' from OpenAI, adds Anthropic AI model to Copilot assistant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-moves-further-away-from-openai-adds-anthropic-ai-model-to-copilot-assistant/articleshow/124124338.cms,"How can Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant users access Anthropic’s models



“And stay tuned: Anthropic models will bring even more powerful experiences to Microsoft 365 Copilot.”

How Microsoft and OpenAI are reducing dependency on each other



Google hits $3 trillion: How Alphabet became the fastest to reach the milestone





Microsoft has begun diversifying its AI technology by integrating a model from Anthropic into its 365 Copilot assistant. The Amazon and Google-backed AI startup is a key rival to Microsoft’s principal partner, OpenAI . The software giant recently announced that it will start using the Anthropic model to answer some queries for its commercial clients. This move signals a shift in Microsoft's generative AI strategy, which has historically relied almost exclusively on OpenAI models for features across products like Bing and Windows. Microsoft is the lead investor in OpenAI, having committed more than $13 billion as part of its strategic partnership.Anthropic’s model is set to debut in Researcher, a Microsoft 365 Copilot agent that helps collect information, analyse it, and create reports.Employees in organisations that are part of Microsoft’s Frontier program, which gives early access to AI tools, can now opt to use Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.1 reasoning model.This model is built to handle complex tasks and serves as an alternative to OpenAI’s offering within Researcher.In a blog post, Charles Lamanna, Microsoft’s president of business and industry Copilot, wrote:Corporate customers can now choose Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4.1 when creating custom AI agents using Microsoft’s Copilot Studio.However, administrators will need to enable Anthropic models before employees can access them. These models operate on Amazon and Google cloud platforms and are governed by Anthropic’s terms and conditions, Lamanna noted.Alongside adding models from outside partners, Microsoft has also begun testing MAI-1-preview, its own in-house large language model.OpenAI has been actively building partnerships with major players. In recent weeks, it announced plans to spend $300 billion with Oracle and signed a $10 billion deal with chip designer Broadcom. This week, Nvidia revealed it will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a joint push to develop massive new data centres.While Microsoft and OpenAI continue to work closely, their relationship is shifting. Last year, Microsoft announced that GitHub Copilot Chat would also utilise models from Anthropic and Google, in addition to those from OpenAI.Founded in 2021 by former OpenAI executives, Anthropic was recently valued at $183 billion. Still, Microsoft remains the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI’s programming interface that third-party apps depend on.","Anthropic’s model is set to debut in Researcher, a Microsoft 365 Copilot agent that helps collect information, analyse it, and create reports.

What US lawmakers asked Amazon, Apple and others about job cuts



“With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that Amazon cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions.”

Festive Sale Scams Alert: Amazon warns shoppers; how to spot fake offers





US lawmakers have reportedly sent letters to major companies, including Apple Amazon , and JPMorgan, demanding an explanation for hiring thousands of foreign workers on H-1B visas while simultaneously reducing other job openings. The inquiries, led by Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, request detailed information from the companies on the number of H-1B workers they employ, their wages, and whether American workers have been displaced, according to a report. The lawmakers' action follows the Trump administration's recent announcement that it will impose a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa petitions. The administration has also proposed changes to the visa selection process to favour higher-skilled and better-paid foreign workers.In a letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy (seen by the Wall Street Journal), the senators said:According to the report, Deloitte, Google ’s parent Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Walmart, Cognizant Technology Solutions and Tata Consultancy Services also received the letter.Despite making huge investments in artificial intelligence, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft have all announced job cuts this year.The US government’s data shows India was the largest recipient of H-1B visas last year with 71% of approvals, while China followed with 11.7%.In the first half of 2025, Amazon and its cloud arm AWS secured more than 12,000 H-1B visa approvals, while Microsoft and Meta each received over 5,000 approvals.Meanwhile, the US Chamber of Commerce is considering a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the new $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visas, raising concerns among foreign workers, particularly Indians, who make up a significant share of the program.The Chamber has reportedly been in contact with member companies through calls and meetings to gauge their support for legal action.If filed, this would be the second time the Chamber has opposed Trump in court. The first was in 2020, when it successfully challenged the suspension of new non-immigrant visas.The Chamber, which counts major firms like Amazon, Alphabet and Google among its members, has otherwise avoided direct conflict with Trump in his second term untill now.","US lawmakers have reportedly sent letters to major companies, including Apple Amazon, and JPMorgan.

The company cautioned against international travel for those in the U.S. on H-1B visas, citing potential re-entry complications under the new policy, and offered support for those unable to return before the deadline.

Read Google’s full ‘urgent’ memo to H-1B visa holders

We are reaching out with an urgent update regarding international travel for individuals on H-1B visas.

A Proclamation is scheduled to take effect this Sunday at 12:01 AM ET. It introduces significant changes to re-entry procedures for H-1B visa holders currently outside the United States. We continue to review the Proclamation, but the initial advice we have received is that re-entry will require a mandatory payment of $100,000 per petition, which may cause substantial delays or prevent re-entry to the US

What You Need to Know:

If you are currently outside the US:

If you are currently outside the US with a valid H-1B visa, make plans to return and enter the US before the Proclamation takes effect on Sunday, September 21 at 12:01 am ET (i.e. by this Saturday night).

If you are currently in the US:

We strongly advise against any international travel if you are in valid H-1B status or need to travel to activate your H-1B visa. You should remain in the US

Departing the US may result in complications or denial of re-entry under the new policy.

If you are unable to return prior to the deadline in H-1B status: please reach out to go/immigration-help.

We understand this may create challenges, and we are here to support you. We are actively monitoring the situation and will keep you updated as we learn more.

Should you do an MBA? My views👇🏼

Most MBAs are outdated 🤷🏼

Better to learn how to build Products,

Best training ground if you want to accelerate your career or run a company one day.

That’s how I started. As a Product Manager.

Case studies and frameworks are nice, but they don’t teach you how to,

- Question the status quo

- Build deep empathy for customers

- Pursue global optima, not local wins

- Influence without authority

- Work backwards from the end state

That’s a Builder’s life.

It’s messy, political, creative, analytical — all at once.

A microcosm of real life, not classroom fluff.

That’s what helped me build companies, not the three-letter degree, although I do have one 🙈

So I tell young students & professionals to do an MBA, but a different kind. Do a Masters in Building Awesome things and you will graduate, not in 2 yrs, but every day 👨🏼‍🎓😎

Be a PM, Product Engineer, Product Designer, AI Builder, Hardware Designer, Robotics Engineer ….. heck, even a Toy Designer!

Because the 21st century will be led by builders who can also tell great stories 💪🏼

P:S - If you MUST do a top-tier MBA. Or hide for a few months & learn how to build, esp with AI 🤷🏼

Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus is facing mounting pressure after a 13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and caused 600 triple-zero calls to fail across multiple states. The September 19 network failure has prompted government investigations and renewed calls for accountability from the embattled telco.The outage primarily affected South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, with some impact also recorded in far western New South Wales near the SA border, according to Reuters reporting. CEO Stephen Rue confirmed that established processes were not followed during a network firewall upgrade that began at 12:30 AM Thursday and lasted until approximately 1:30 PM (local time).Four deaths have been linked to the incident, though South Australian police later clarified that an eight-week-old boy's death in Gawler West was ""unlikely"" to have been caused by the outage delay. A 68-year-old Adelaide woman and two men aged 74 and 49 in Perth remain connected to the emergency services failure.The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) reported that Optus received multiple customer complaints about the triple-zero failure as early as 9 AM Thursday, with five customers contacting the call center about the outage.However, these concerns were not properly escalated, and government authorities weren't informed until after the issue was resolved.Communications Minister Anika Wells expressed ""unbelievable disappointment"" that Australia was ""here again so quickly,"" referencing a similar 2023 incident. The Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA) chair Nerida O'Loughlin revealed her agency wasn't notified until more than 10 hours after the outage began, contrary to standard protocols.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years. The company was fined A$12 million in 2023 for failing to provide emergency call services to thousands during a nationwide outage and subsequently failing to conduct required welfare checks.The telecommunications giant, owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has faced a series of crises including a 2022 cyberattack affecting 9.5 million Australians and the 2023 outage that led to former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin's resignation. Current CEO Stephen Rue took over in November 2024.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking from New York, declined to say whether Rue should resign but indicated the government has ""action at its disposal"" pending investigation results. ACMA has launched a formal investigation, with Optus potentially facing fines exceeding $10 million and additional penalties.The company has promised full cooperation with all investigations while conducting its own internal review, with results to be made public.",13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and 600 triple-zero calls to fail.

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

A side door for skilled professionals



Pros and cons of O-1B visa



The advantages of O-1B visa include:

No lottery or annual cap

Faster processing available

Renewable indefinitely

The drawbacks of O-1B visa are:

More subjective than H-1B, requiring proof of “extraordinary ability”

Some employers hesitate due to uncertainty in approval

Application costs can be higher than pre-hike H-1B fees

Some real world examples of O-1B visa



Entrepreneurs like Soundarya Balasubramani, who launched an educational venture in the U.S., are among the new wave of Indian applicants using the O-1 to bypass the H-1B bottleneck. “I got my O-1A approved as the solo founder and 100% owner of an educational venture,” she told ET.

Karan Vaidya, cofounder of AI startup Composio, said his O-1 visa cost less than $10,000 including legal fees, and praised its flexibility: “It’s a three-year visa that can be renewed indefinitely. I’m on my fifth O-1 now.”





US President Donald Trump’s executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee from $10,000 to $1,00,000 sent shockwaves in the tech industry. Due to the announcement last week many tech giants called back their professionals with H-1B visa back to the US. As the scrutiny around the traditional H-1B visa pathway making the process unpredictable, the skilled professionals are now planing to turn towards O-1 visa a lesser known route. The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.For those unaware, the O-1 Visa is introduced under the Immigration Act of 1990. The O-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields of education, science, athletics or arts. It enable the recipients to work in the US for up to three years and comes with unlimited renewals. The applicants of the O-1 visa much demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and meet atleast three out of the eight criteria:After the unpredictable nature of popular H-1B visa, the O-1 visa is gaining a lot of traction among Indians who wish to go and work in the US. As per the report by Economic Times, Indian were granted 487 O-1A visas in FY 2020, this number was increased to 1,418 in FY 2023. With this increase, India became the third largest recipient of O-1 visa after UK and Brazil.Unlike the popularly H-1B visa which is capped at 85,000 visas annually and allocated via a lottery, the O-1 visa has no cap and the applications for it are accepted around the year. The applicants can also expedite the application process by submitting additional fees.Immigration consultant and O-1 holder Logan Ullyott told Business Insider: “The O-1 is an occupation-agnostic visa. You could get it if you’re an engineer, a researcher, an influencer, or even a cook — as long as you can prove you’re at the top of your field.”","The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.

I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger.

Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk responds



Political leaders weigh in







An ABC spokesperson recently confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely. The company decided to take the decision after the host of the show Jimmy Kimmel made some controversial comments on Charlie Kirk, linking his alleged killer to President Trump’s MAGA movement. MAGA – short for Make America Great Again is a political slogan, popularized by President Donald Trump during his election campaigns. During the late-night show, Kimmel made sharp comments stating that the MAGA gang is “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.Actor and filmmaker Ben Stiller was among the celebrities who has publicly defended Kimmel and has criticised the decision of ABC. In s post shared on social media platform X, Stiller wrote, “This isn’t right”.His brief but pointed reaction quickly went viral, with many fans and fellow entertainers echoing his sentiment that the suspension undermines free expression in comedy.Commenting on Ben Stiller’s post, Elon Musk supported the decision made by ABC and wrote, “He went full retard. Never go full retard.”This is not the first time that Musk has reacted to the controversy.Earlier this week after the Kimmel’s video clip from the show went viral, Musk said, “Jimmy Kimmel is disgusting”.The California Governor Gavin Newsom has also blasted the decision and has accused Republicans of orchestrating censorship. “They are censoring you in real time. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous,” wrote Newsom on X.On the other hand, commentator Davis Sirota suggested corporate politics were at play, noting that Nexstar, which has ties to ABC, is seeking regulatory approvals from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the suspension on Truth Social, calling it “Great News for America” and labeling Kimmel “ratings challenged” with “zero talent.”","ABC confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely.

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

Read Kevin O’Leary Twitter post here

Trump administration’s defense





Investor and Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary has sharply criticised US President Donald Trump’s increased H-1B visa fee hike. Last week, the Trump administration announced a massive increase in the H-1B visa fee. After the revised regulation, the H-1B visa fee for fresh application has increased from $10,000 to $1,00,000. Now, Kevin has warned that this policy change will hurt the US more as compared to other countries such as India and China. Kevin also feels that this move of the Trump administration may also drive away top global talent and can lead to shift the creation of future tech giants.In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Kevin argued that the iconic tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle famously began in garages might have never taken off under today’s restrictive immigration rules. “I think what this does is hurt innovation long‑term,” O’Leary wrote, adding that the U.S. should not spend resources training top foreign students at institutions like MIT and Harvard only to “kick them out.” He suggested such graduates should automatically be allowed to stay, marry, and build companies in America.“Apple, Oracle, Google, all started in a garage. They could've not have afforded to do this, and all of those companies took advantage of talent they couldn't find in the United States as they grew. I think what this does is hurt innovation long-term. I agree that it's going to push these really talented people into other countries. My attitude about this is if we educate you at MIT or at Harvard any school, we should give you a free ticket to stay here, get married, form a company, and build American businesses here.Why train them and kick them out?” wrote Kevin.As mentioned above, the Trump administration recently announced that the companies will now be charged $100,000 for each new H‑1B visa petition. Now, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has clarified the move of the US government and said that it is one-time fee and is applicable only on new applications.The officials also said this move is designed to prioritise American workers and reduce reliance on immigrant labour. Along with this, the US government has also rolled out a $1 million “gold card” residency program for wealthy investors.","Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary has sharply criticised US President Donald Trump’s increased H-1B visa fee hike.

To, Shri Siddaramaiah,

Hon'ble Chief Minister of Karnataka,

Vidhana Soudha,

Bangalore - 560 001

Hon'ble Chief Minister,

Sub: Re: Your Letter Regarding Traffic Congestion on Outer Ring Road (ORR)

Thank you for your letter dated September 19, 2025 and your kind recognition of Wipro's contributions to Karnataka. We sincerely appreciate your leadership for initiatives concerning critical issue of traffic congestion in Bengaluru. As stated in your letter, urgent and effective measures are indeed required for the traffic situation, particularly along the Outer Ring Road, being an export oriented economic hub.

The problem's complexity, stemming from multiple factors, suggests that there is unlikely to be a single point solution or a silver bullet to resolve it. To this end, we believe the most effective path forward is to commission a comprehensive, scientific study led by an entity with world-class expertise in urban transport management. Such an exercise would allow us to develop a holistic roadmap of effective solutions that are implementable in the short, medium, and long term. To demonstrate our commitment to being a part of the solution, Wipro will be pleased to engage in this process and underwrite a significant portion of the cost for this expert study.

With respect to the specific suggestion of allowing public vehicular movement through our Sarjapur campus, we apprehend significant legal, governance, and statutory challenges since it is an exclusive private property owned by a listed company not intended for public thoroughfare. That apart it will also be appreciated that our Sarjapur campus is a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) providing services to global customers, our contractual conditions mandate stringent, non-negotiable access control norms for governance and compliance.

Moreover, public vehicular movement through a private property would not be effective as a sustainable, long-term solution. Wipro nevertheless stands committed to partner with the Government of Karnataka to find a lasting solution for Bengaluru's mobility challenges. We believe a collaborative, data-driven approach will yield the most impactful results for our city.

Our team, led by Reshmi Shankar (email: reshmi.shankar@wipro.com), would be happy to engage with your officials to discuss the way forward at your earliest convenience.

Warm regards,

Yours sincerely,

AZIM PREMJI





Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has written to Wipro founder Azim Premji requesting the IT giant to allow limited vehicular movement through its campus to help ease Bengaluru's notorious traffic congestion on the Outer Ring Road. In a letter dated September 19, Siddaramaiah specifically targeted the severe traffic bottleneck at Iblur junction along the ORR corridor, writing: ""I wish to explore the possibility of allowing limited vehicular movement through the Wipro campus, subject to mutually agreed terms and necessary security considerations.""Now, Wipro founder Azim Premji has responded to Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah letter. Permji has declined the request from the Karnataka government to part with a portion of the company’s Bengaluru campus land to ease traffic congestion in the city’s IT corridor. Premji said the decision was made in the best interests of the company and its employees, citing operational and security concerns.The Chief Minister cited preliminary assessments by traffic and urban mobility experts indicating that such a measure ""could reduce congestion on adjoining stretches of the ORR by nearly 30 per cent, particularly during peak office hours."" A detailed traffic simulation study by Bengaluru Traffic Police has projected even more promising results, suggesting that opening the Wipro–Ecoworld campus link road to the public could reduce travel time along the Sarjapur Road–Outer Ring Road corridor by nearly 38%.Responding to the letter Premji said that while he understood the traffic challenges of the city, but Wipro could not compromise on its campus integrity and long‑term business needs.",Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has written to Wipro founder Azim Premji.

Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt recently warned that the US could lose AI race to China. In an All In Podcast interview with venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya and David Sacks, Eric Schmidt said that he believed both countries were competing on equal footing, but China is “really doing something more different” than US. ""They're very focused on taking AI and applying it to everything…consumer apps, robots, and so forth,"" Schmidt said, adding US restrictions on semiconductor exports and China's limited access to capital have slowed the country’s pursuit of AGI – Artificial General Intelligence.Artificial General Intelligence refers to a type of artificial intelligence that can perform a wide range of tasks at a human level of understanding. Unlike today’s AI systems, which are designed for specific tasks such as translation, image recognition, or playing games, AGI would have the ability to learn, reason, adapt, and apply knowledge across different domains — much like humans do.During the conversation, Eric Schmidt drew parallel to China’s success in the EV sector, warning that companies are excelling in practical applications. He further warned that countries around the world are more likely to adopt Chinese models due to their open-source nature.""China is competing with open weights and open training data. The U.S. is largely focused on closed weights, closed data,"" Schmidt said.When Chamath Palihapitiya asked Meta's open-source AI efforts, Schmidt responded saying smaller, more accessible models are being released, allowing AI to proliferate in controlled, Western-aligned ways.Previously, Eric Schmidt warns that the United States faces a critical energy shortage that could derail the artificial intelligence revolution, calling electricity, not semiconductors or funding, the primary constraint limiting AI development.""AI's natural limit is electricity, not chips,"" Schmidt said in a LinkedIn post earlier this year, highlighting the infrastructure crisis facing Silicon Valley's race toward superintelligence.","Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt recently warned that the US could lose AI race to China.

Trump administration increases H-1B visa application fee to $100,000





The US Chamber of Commerce is reportedly considering to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration after announcing a $100,000 annual fee on H-1B visa. The move has sparked concerns among Indian and other foreign nationals working in the US economy that relies heavily on H-1B visa. According to a Bloomberg report, officials with the country’s largest business lobby polled member companies to test support for a lawsuit. The report cites people familiar with the conversations who, on the condition of anonymity, said that the group sought feedback from corporations on potential litigation during a series of phone calls and Zoom meetings.If filed, the case would mark only the second time the US Chamber of Commerce clashes with Donald Trump. The Chamber, the nation’s largest business group and one of Washington’s most influential lobbying organizations, has members like Amazon , Alphabet, Google , among others. It has so far avoided direct conflict with Trump in his second term. It even stayed out of recent legal battles over his tariffs.The group last went to court against Trump in 2020, when his administration suspended new nonimmigrant visas. Calling the policy “bad for business,” the Chamber sued and won, with a federal court striking down the rules.Chamber spokesperson Matt Letourneau said in a statement that the group is “examining the legal basis for the proclamation.”“We continue to be inundated with member concerns and are communicating those concerns and questions directly to the administration,” Letourneau said.“There was tremendous concern about the prospect that the proclamation could be applied to current visa holders. We are appreciative of the administration’s ongoing clarifications about the scope of this action.”Last week, Donald Trump signed an order introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications. Explaining the move, Trump said “The H-1B nonimmigrant visa program was created to bring temporary workers into the United States to perform additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labour”.Anticipating the tech industry’s response to the changes, Trump said “I think they're going to be very happy”.","The US Chamber of Commerce is reportedly considering to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration.

Vivian Wilson, daughter of Tesla CEO Elon Musk , said she shares an apartment with three roommates in Los Angeles because it is “cheaper,” and she often worries about money. In an interview with New York magazine recently, Wilson said “People assume I have a lot of money. I don’t have hundreds of thousands of dollars at my disposal”. She added that, despite being the eldest of Elon Musk’s 14 children, she does not benefit financially from his fortune and is trying to build her own path.Vivian Wilson was born to Elon Musk and novelist Justine Wilson. Their marriage ended in divorce in September 2008. After her parents divorce, Wilson studied at several schools, including Crossroads in Santa Monica.

Optimism on India’s growth story



From cramped offices to a 55,000-strong workforce



A simple but striking change







America’s largest bank JPMorgan and Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently shared his views on India’s transformation over the past 20 years. Speaking to The Times of India, Dimon revealed that how he is impressed with India’s economic growth and improved infrastructure. He also highlighted that he was particularly impressed with new Expressway which connected Mumbai city to the airport.Apart from praising India’s developed infrastructure, Dimon also expressed his confidence in the country’s long-term growth trajectory. Dimon mentioned that the Indian economy has been expanding at around 6% annually and can maintain the same pace for next two decades.He also praised reforms like Aadhaar and the Goods and Services Tax (GST), calling them “excellent” and evidence of strong leadership under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Aadhaar is an unbelievable achievement,” Dimon said, adding that reforms have positioned India as a natural partner for global investment.“Since I've been coming here, you've accomplished Aadhaar, which I think is an unbelievable achievement. You also carried out a second round of GST reforms, which I think are excellent. Those kinds of changes matter because outdated systems can cripple commerce. You launched a national infrastructure program under Prime Minister Modi.That's important, because you need sustained investment in infrastructure,” Dimon told TOI.Speaking to TOI, Dimon recalled his first visit to India in 2005. Dimon said that the initially JPMorgan operated from a small downtown office with limited resources. “When I first came to India, around 2005 our office was an old building in downtown Mumbai. The elevator barely held three people. Back then, we did research on about 20 companies with 10 investment bankers,” said Dimon.Fast-forward to 2025, JPMorgan now employs more than 55,000 people in India. The company has multiple teams which cover different areas such as engineering, cybersecurity and global services. “Today we have over 55,000 people in India critically involved in engineering, cyber, AI, and a full range of services that support the US and global operations. Investment banking has grown too. We now research almost 200 companies globally and serve Indian companies here and abroad,” added Dimon.When asked about the most noticeable improvements he has seen in India, Dimon pointed to something many Mumbai residents and visitors can relate to: the highway from the airport to the city. “The nicest thing is the highway from the airport to Mumbai — it really makes a difference,” he told The Times of India.",JPMorgan and Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently shared his views on India’s transformation over the past 20 years.

Intel’s desperate attempts to make a comeback





Struggling chipmaker Intel has reportedly held talks with Apple about a potential investment to improve its financial position, reports Bloomberg. Citing people familiar with the matter, the report said Apple and Intel also have discussed how to work more closely together. However, the talks are in an early stage and may not lead to an agreement, the report added. The news comes days after Nvidia announced plans to invest $5 billion in Intel, purchasing stock at $23.28 per share—a 6.5% discount. Weeks earlier, the chip company received a $2 billion investment from SoftBank – a majority owner of British chip design company Arm.Notably, Apple has been a longtime customer of Intel. The iPhone maker switched to its in-house chips in the past five years which are now produced by partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC). The Bloomberg report adds that it is unlikely that Apple would switch back to Intel processors in its devices.Once a leading chip manufacturer, Intel now faces strong competition from Nvidia. It owns only a fraction of Nvidia’s sales and market capitalization. Intel has been trying to make a comeback with multiple partnerships, including 10% stake sale to the US government. Last week, Nvidia announced to invest $5 billion in Intel, 20 years after the company rejected to buy Nvidia for $20 billion.Intel has also struggled to capitalize on booming sales of artificial intelligence (AI) chips. The chipmaker has also desperately chased the AI wave through acquisitions like Nervana Systems ($400 million) and Habana Labs ($2 billion), but gained little ground against Nvidia's dominance.Earlier this year, the company appointed Lip-Bu Tan as the new CEO replacing the ousted Pat Gelsinger. Tan has admitted that Intel won't compete with Nvidia's high-end systems ""anytime soon.""Intel shares rose 6.4% to $31.22 on Wednesday in New York after the Bloomberg report.","Apple has been a longtime customer of Intel.

‘Would that be enough to convince you’: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and father of quantum computing debate AI’s true test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/would-that-be-enough-to-convince-you-openai-ceo-sam-altman-and-father-of-quantum-computing-debate-ais-true-test/articleshow/124103662.cms,"A new test for AGI





OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and British physicist David Deutsch have agreed on a striking new test for artificial intelligence (AI) – if an AI model could solve the mystery of quantum gravity — and explain its reasoning — it could be considered human-level smart. According to a Business Insider report, the exchange happened on Wednesday (September 24) in Berlin, where Altman visited Axel Springer’s headquarters to meet tech leaders and collect an award. During a fireside chat, publisher Mathias Döpfner asked Sam Altman about his favorite book — Deutsch’s The Beginning of Infinity — and then surprised him by patching the author in live from Oxford.Deutsch, often called the father of quantum computing, has long argued that brute-force training alone cannot produce true minds. He said real intelligence means creating knowledge, not just repeating or remixing it. “Large language models can talk endlessly because they are trained on huge bodies of knowledge,” he explained. “In my mind, genuine intelligence is the ability to create knowledge — spot a problem, invent a solution, test it, and improve it as humans do. ”Sam Altman, smiling as Deutsch appeared on screen, asked a direct question: what would it take to convince him that an AI had reached real intelligence? Deutsch pointed to Einstein’s theory of relativity as an example of knowledge creation.“We know he created it because we know his story, what problems he was addressing, and why,” he said.Then Sam Altman offered a hypothetical: “If a future model figured out quantum gravity and could tell you its story — the problems it chose, the reasons it pursued them — would that be enough to convince you?”“I think it would, yes,” Deutsch replied.Altman agreed: “I agree to that as the test.”",OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and British physicist David Deutsch have agreed on a striking new test for artificial intelligence.

Given the US H-1B overhaul, do you think this might be an opportunity for Germany to attract more

skilled professionals

from India?

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

What about further simplifying immigration processes, language restrictions and recognition of academic qualifications?

Do you think Germany needs more focused campaigns to attract talent, like maybepublicizing initiatives like the Opportunity Card?

Indians in Germany have a problem with cultural and social integration. How are you addressing it?

So, you are expecting an increase in the number of Indian students too?





Europe’s economic powerhouse Germany is ready to welcome more Indian IT professionals and students following the US torpedoing of its H-1B visa programme, says German ambassador to Indiain an exclusive interview toThis is a chance for many to consider what Germany has to offer. I think we have one of the most liberal immigration laws in Europe and what is remarkable is that even though we had a change of government recently where the Conservatives took over the Chancery, nobody is thinking of changing this immigration law. So, there is a very liberal atmosphere and it’s veryeasy to get into Germany for skilled and highly skilled labor from India. I’d recommend to everyone who is thinking of going elsewhere to consider the many opportunities that Germany has to offer.You’d be surprised to see how quickly your visa is issued once there is a case for it. We don’thave a big problem with waiting times when it comes to skilled workforce visas. What’s perhaps more demanding is how to get your degree recognized in Germany and that’s something the government is working on.There’s a certain disadvantage because Germany has a differentlanguage. I’d say in the upper echelons of industries, German is not necessary and you see many Indian students studying in universities that have English-taught courses. I’d recommend that if you live in Germany, learn German at least to alevel you can converse in the streets or do your shopping.That’s one way into Germany if you have the means to sustain yourself for a certain period, fulfil certain criteria and have relevant degrees.You can see that on the embassy website. If you fulfil these criteria, you can go to Germany without even having a job and look for work there. So, that’s a very liberal approach. At thesame time, we have many other possibilities for people who do have a contract with a German company to come to Germany. We also have 60,000 Indian students in Germany, a growth of 20% from last year. This year the growth will beeven bigger because we have so many students who were thinking of going to the Americas but are now reconsidering. Once you have your degree in Germany, you can stay 18 months in Germany and look for a job. That’s a long period of time.This is important. I’d say you should not underestimate the fact that if you are going to Germany, your life will change in many ways. But what we are seeing is a growing Indian community with a very interesting network of assistance. When you go on Instagram or X or LinkedIn, you’d find a group of Indian influencersaddressing issues of German life for Indians in Germany. We do talk to these people and see them once in a while. They do an incredible job in preparing people to join the German life and learn German language. Indians in Germany have been tremendously successful in an admirable way. An average Indian in Germany’s workforce earns more than an average German. We have about 300,000 Indians in Germany. High salary means a valuable contribution to society and welfare. There’s a very positive mood towards Indians in Germany. Migration is an issue that’s discussed in Germany. It’s a problem when it comes to refugees and, asylum seekers, but skilled labor from India is excluded from this discussion.I think so. The applications from Indian students went up by 35 percent in the first month of 2025. We expect more Indians to come to Germany now. We have had a very good experience with Indian students in areas like engineering, IT and AI. However, there are non-German universitiesthat are geographically based in Germany and aggressively recruit in India. We have question marks when it comes to their quality and therefore my message to everybody is don’t trust your agent. Most Indians go through an agent. It’s always good to check on your own if that school is really up to the standards you want to achieve in your academic life. I can only say that in Germany education is a public good. You have basically little to no fee in our public universities, no tuition fee. I’d always strongly recommend joining state-funded and state-run universities, our most prestigious institutions.","Germany is ready to welcome more Indian IT professionals and students following the US torpedoing of its H-1B visa programme, says German ambassador to Indiain.

Billionaire Silicon Valley investor says US' H-1B visa policy could backfire: ‘Engineers from Indian universities are…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/billionaire-silicon-valley-investor-says-us-h-1b-visa-policy-could-backfire-engineers-from-indian-universities-are/articleshow/124094780.cms,"Tech companies hire for skills, not cost savings

Policy could drive innovation overseas





Billionaire Silicon Valley investor Michael Moritz, whose investments in Google PayPal , and other tech giants helped shape the modern internet, has sharply criticised President Donald Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, warning that the policy will backfire and demonstrates the administration's fundamental misunderstanding of what drives American tech success.The policy, announced Friday through a presidential proclamation, imposes the steep fee on new H-1B visa applications starting September 21, representing a dramatic increase from current fees of $2,000 to $5,000. The administration also proposed overhauling the lottery system to prioritise higher-paid workers, with the Trump administration claiming the program has been ""deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers. ""The announcement triggered panic across Silicon Valley over the weekend, with companies including Amazon , Microsoft, and Google advising H-1B employees to return to the US before the Sunday deadline.Writing in the Financial Times, Moritz argued that Trump's ""H-1B caper will backfire"" because advances in technology make it easier for companies to move work overseas rather than bring foreign workers to America. The former Sequoia Capital partner warned that the policy shows ""the fragile grasp the president and his acolytes have about why the US — especially its technology sector—has worked so well.""The H-1B program currently allows 85,000 skilled foreign workers annually to work in the US for up to six years. Indian nationals account for 71% of approved visas, with the program heavily used by tech companies and IT consulting firms. Moritz noted that ""engineers with undergraduate degrees from the better eastern Europe, Turkish and Indian universities are every bit as well qualified as their American counterparts,"" underlining the caliber of talent that could be affected by the policy changes.Moritz, who built his reputation investing in companies like Google, PayPal, LinkedIn, and YouTube during their early stages, dismissed Trump's claims that companies abuse the H-1B program to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. In his FT column, he emphasised that ""large tech companies hire foreign nationals because they possess particular skills"" and retain them ""to perform tasks in areas where the US has labour shortages. ""The investor argued that companies don't hire H-1B workers ""to deprive Americans of jobs or for cost reasons,"" contradicting the administration's core justification for the fee increase. He noted that US companies are already ""forbidden to discriminate against foreign workers doing the same jobs as American citizens"" and must notify employees before hiring foreign workers.Trump's proclamation cited multiple examples of tech companies laying off American workers while simultaneously hiring thousands of H-1B visa holders. One unnamed software company was approved for over 5,000 H-1B workers in fiscal year 2025 while announcing layoffs totalling more than 15,000 employees, according to the White House. The administration argued this demonstrates the program is being used to replace rather than supplement American workers.Rather than protecting American jobs, Moritz warned the policy could push tech innovation abroad. He noted that skilled engineers from ""better eastern Europe, Turkish and Indian universities are every bit as well qualified as their American counterparts,"" and much of their work ""can be done as easily in Istanbul, Tallinn, Warsaw, Prague or Bengaluru as in San Francisco.""The investor predicted that companies fearful of Trump's next move might change their policies, meaning ""these foreign economies rather than the US will receive a shot in the arm."" This would also ""deprive America of a fresh generation of entrepreneurs since the most able of the H-1B visa holders often go on to start companies of their own.""Moritz's warnings contrast sharply with support from some tech leaders, including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, who called the $100,000 fee ""a great solution"" that would ensure H-1B visas are ""used just for very high-value jobs."" However, most Silicon Valley executives have criticised the changes as harmful to innovation and startup growth.The policy has already created international ripple effects. India, which supplies 71% of H-1B visa holders, responded through its external affairs ministry that the fee would have ""humanitarian consequences"" and cause family disruptions. Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal suggested Americans are ""afraid of our talent.""Moritz suggested the administration should instead expand the H-1B program, proposing to ""double or triple the number of H-1B visas"" and automatically offer citizenship to foreign nationals earning STEM PhDs from top American universities.He highlighted successful immigrant CEOs including Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Sundar Pichai of Google as examples of the program's benefits, noting in his FT piece: ""Two of the finest chief executives in the US, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Sundar Pichai of Google, are here because of the attitudes of prior administrations.""","Billionaire investor Michael Moritz has sharply criticised President Donald Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee.

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

Impact on Indian IT professionals



Next steps and legal challenges







US President Donald Trump recently announced the fee hike for H-1B visa program. Last week, the US government increased the H-1B visa fee to $1,00,000 from $10,000. This annual fee applies to all the fresh H-1B visa applications. Now, days after imposing the new fee, the Trump administration has introduced a new proposal which is aimed at revamping the H-1B visa program. As reported by Reuters, the new proposal of the Trump administration aims to scrap the the long‑standing lottery system and replace it with a weighted selection process that favours higher‑skilled and higher‑paid applicants.Presently, the H-1B program is capped at 85,000 visas annually and it uses a random lottery when the application exceed demand. Under the new rules, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes a wage‑based ranking system, giving preference to applicants with advanced degrees, specialized skills, and higher salary offers.As per the Reuters report, the official suggests that this change will make sure that the visas go to the “the best and brightest” while still allowing employers to hire foreign workers at all wage levels. The administration claims that it has framed the reform in order to curb the ‘abuse’ of the system done by outsourcing firms.The changes made to the H-1B visa system could have a critical impact on the Indian technology workers, who make up the largest share of H-1B recipients. While highly paid engineers and specialists may benefit, entry‑level workers and outsourcing companies that rely on bulk visa applications could face reduced opportunities.Experts suggest that this new rule could reshape the global IT services market and will push the companies to expand operations in India or other regions of access to US visa becomes restricted.This new proposed rule of the Trump administration will now undergo a public comment period before it is finalised. The legal challenges are expected as the earlier attempt to reform the H-1B visa system have faced pushback in the US courts. If implemented, the reforms — combined with the new $100,000 annual fee — would mark one of the most dramatic shifts in U.S. skilled immigration policy in decades, with ripple effects across the global technology and outsourcing industries.","Last week, the US government increased the H-1B visa fee to $1,00,000 from $10,000.

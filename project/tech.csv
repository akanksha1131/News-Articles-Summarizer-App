AI browser targets administrative work beyond recruiting

AI leaders split on AI's impact on white-collar employment

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas believes his company's new AI browser , Comet, will soon automate two crucial white-collar roles that every modern workplace depends on: recruiters and administrative assistants.Speaking on The Verge's Decoder podcast, Srinivas outlined how Comet's built-in AI agent can access applications like Gmail, LinkedIn, and Google Calendar to completely transform knowledge work . ""A recruiter's work worth one week is just one prompt: sourcing and reach outs,"" he said during the Thursday episode.The AI-native browser, currently in invite-only beta for premium users, can generate candidate lists, extract contact information, and send personalised outreach emails, tasks traditionally handled by recruiting coordinators and sourcers. Srinivas demonstrated scenarios where the AI could identify Stanford alumni who previously worked at Anthropic, compile their information in Google Sheets, and draft personalised cold outreach messages.Comet's capabilities extend far beyond recruiting functions. Srinivas explained how the browser can assume many executive assistant responsibilities, including email management, calendar coordination, and meeting preparation. The AI can ""keep following up, keep track of responses, update Google Sheets, mark status as responded or in progress, sync with Google Calendar, and resolve conflicts to schedule meetings,"" he said.The Perplexity CEO envisions the browser evolving into an AI operating system that continuously runs background tasks and executes commands through natural language prompts. He believes users will pay premium prices for meaningful automation, suggesting people might spend ""$2,000 for a prompt"" if it helps generate significant business value.Srinivas joins other tech executives predicting widespread disruption to office jobs. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has suggested AI could eliminate 50% of entry-level positions within five years, while Ford CEO Jim Farley warned that artificial intelligence will ""replace literally half of all white-collar workers.""However, not all industry leaders share this apocalyptic view. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang frame AI as an augmentation tool rather than wholesale replacement technology.Despite differing perspectives on AI's ultimate impact, Srinivas issued a clear warning: ""People who are at the frontier of using AI are going to be way more employable than people who are not.""","Comet's built-in AI agent can access applications like Gmail, LinkedIn, and Google Calendar.

"Submarines fitted with lasers, custom-built attack satellites and ...: Strategies Chinese government, military scientists are developing to counter Elon Musk’ Starlink",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/submarines-fitted-with-lasers-custom-built-attack-satellites-and-strategies-chinese-government-military-scientists-are-developing-to-counter-elon-musk-starlink/articleshow/123067538.cms,"How China is responding to Starlink

Chinese researchers are actively working on strategies to neutralize Elon Musk's Starlink satellite network, which they perceive as a significant threat to the country's national security. According to a report by Associated Press (AP), Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink’s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk’s satellites, an Associated Press review found. This reportedly includes Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters.The satellite constellation’s ability to provide fast, affordable internet access globally, even in remote areas, is seen as a risk due to SpaceX’s ties to U.S. intelligence and defense agencies. “As the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,” stated professors from China’s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.Proposed countermeasures include stealth submarines equipped with lasers capable of targeting satellites, supply-chain sabotage, and custom attack satellites with ion thrusters. Researchers have also suggested deploying small optical telescopes to monitor Starlink, using deep fakes to create false targets, and firing powerful lasers to damage the satellites. Starlink’s dominance, with over 8,000 active satellites accounting for roughly two-thirds of all active satellites, has raised concerns globally, not just in China. According to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, SpaceX aims to deploy tens of thousands more satellites. The network’s critical role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, where it supported Ukrainian battlefield communications, highlighted its strategic importance and the risks of relying on a single private company led by Musk, whose political engagements, including support for controversial figures, have sparked unease.China is responding by developing its own satellite networks, such as Guowang, with 60 of a planned 13,000 satellites launched, and Qianfan, backed by the Shanghai government, with 90 of 15,000 planned satellites in orbit. These efforts aim to compete with Starlink both domestically and in markets like Africa and Asia. The AP review noted that Chinese researchers have analyzed Starlink’s coverage over key areas like Beijing and Taiwan, concluding in a 2023 National Defense University paper that “the Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed.” Another study by the China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team pointed to vulnerabilities in Starlink’s supply chain, noting “the company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,” with limited cybersecurity oversight.","Chinese researchers are actively working on strategies to neutralize Elon Musk's Starlink satellite network.

"Tim Cook breaks Steve Jobs’ this record at Apple, what it says about Apple’s evolution",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tim-cook-breaks-steve-jobs-this-record-at-apple-what-it-says-about-apples-evolution/articleshow/123060520.cms,"Tim Cook surpasses Jobs’ CEO tenure: a historic leadership milestone

Apple's evolution under Tim Cook: Beyond the iPhone

Financial transformation: From billions to trillions

The legacy debate: innovation vs. sustainability

What lies ahead for Tim Cook and Apple?

Tim Cook has officially become the longest-serving CEO in Apple’s history, surpassing the legendary Steve Jobs . As of August 1, 2025, Cook has led the tech giant for 5,091 days—one day longer than Jobs’ combined tenure as CEO. This milestone marks not just a shift in leadership duration but reflects Apple’s evolution from a design-centric innovator under Jobs to a global services and hardware powerhouse under Cook. The transition tells a larger story about how Apple has matured, diversified, and continued to thrive even in a post-Jobs era.Steve Jobs served as Apple’s CEO in two phases: first as interim CEO (1997–2000) and then officially until his resignation in 2011, totaling 5,090 days. Tim Cook, who took over immediately after Jobs stepped down, has now served for 5,091 days and counting. Though Jobs is credited with Apple’s dramatic resurgence and visionary product launches, Cook’s long-lasting leadership has brought financial stability, record-breaking market caps, and expansive global growth.Steve Jobs was known for his intense, hands-on, visionary leadership style. He spearheaded revolutionary products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Tim Cook, in contrast, is a calm and strategic operator who optimized Apple’s supply chains, expanded into services, and championed sustainability and accessibility. Cook’s approach relies more on empowering teams and long-term planning, reflecting a matured corporate culture.While Jobs reshaped consumer tech with breakthrough devices, Cook diversified Apple’s ecosystem. Under his leadership, the company launched the Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, AirTag, Vision Pro, and its own Apple silicon chips. On the software and services front, he led the growth of Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, News+, and Fitness+, turning Apple into a recurring revenue machine beyond just hardware sales.In Jobs’ final year (2011), Apple earned around $108 billion in revenue. Under Cook, Apple crossed a staggering $394 billion in annual revenue by 2022. More impressively, Apple became the world’s first $3 trillion company in market capitalization, reinforcing Cook’s reputation as a financial powerhouse who brought unprecedented shareholder value and stability.While Jobs’ era is remembered for disruptive innovation and iconic product moments, Cook’s tenure is defined by sustainability, inclusivity, and long-term growth. Cook built on Jobs' foundation, but his success sparks debate: has Apple lost its spark of innovation, or has it simply evolved into a mature, diversified tech empire? Either way, Cook’s milestone highlights the company’s transformation from a volatile innovator into a global economic titan.As Apple continues to explore AI, spatial computing, and health tech, Cook remains at the helm with no official successor in sight. Speculation is growing that he may also assume the role of chairman, consolidating his leadership. Whether or not Cook eventually steps aside, his tenure has redefined what it means to lead Apple—and shaped the company’s trajectory for the next generation.","Tim Cook has officially become the longest-serving CEO in Apple’s history, surpassing the legendary Steve Jobs.

‘Gambling runs deep in American culture’: Nithin Kamath slams misleading India–US trading comparisons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/gambling-runs-deep-in-american-culture-nithin-kamath-slams-misleading-indiaus-trading-comparisons/articleshow/123058656.cms,"Nithin Kamath says Indian markets are less leveraged than US counterparts



India’s financial markets are still maturing

US culture encourages speculation across sectors

Simple volume comparisons are misleading



Support from investor community





A call for nuanced understanding

Zerodha co-founder Nithin Kamath has pushed back against recent comparisons between India and the United States over options trading volumes , calling such parallels both flawed and misleading. In a detailed social media post, Kamath emphasised that India’s markets are far less leveraged and significantly less mature than those in the US. He went further, describing America as a “gambling society,” stating, “Gambling runs deep in American culture. From the stock market to sports, casinos, events, lotteries, prediction markets, and crypto, you can bet on anything.” His comments have sparked debate among investors and market analysts, many of whom agree that comparing raw trading volumes alone fails to capture deeper structural and cultural differences.Kamath’s core argument centres on leverage, a key metric that determines how much capital is actually at risk. While India may now be the largest market in the world in terms of options contracts traded, he explained that these trades are often low in premium value, meaning less money is involved per contract.In contrast, US markets operate with far greater sums of capital per trade. Kamath pointed out that India's margin funding market is still under 10 billion dollars, whereas the United States recently surpassed one trillion dollars. This stark difference, he noted, highlights the risk of making surface-level comparisons without looking at the underlying leverage or capital exposure.According to Kamath, India’s financial markets are roughly 15 to 20 years behind the United States in terms of market maturity and structural development. He pointed to the limited penetration of mechanisms such as margin trading, stock lending, and short selling in India, compared to their extensive use in the US.He further argued that India’s options trading ecosystem is still predominantly retail-driven, meaning individual investors are placing smaller, more frequent bets with relatively lower capital exposure. On the other hand, US options markets are largely institutional, where trades are fewer in number but far more substantial in terms of value and leverage.Kamath didn’t stop at structural financial differences. He also criticised the broader culture of speculation embedded in American society. Calling the US a “gambling society,” he cited a recent $210 million wager on whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would wear a suit at the NATO summit as an example of extreme speculative behaviour.He argued that gambling in the US goes far beyond casinos. It spans across the stock market, sports betting, prediction markets, lotteries, and cryptocurrency platforms. “You can bet on anything,” he remarked, suggesting that this widespread acceptance of speculative behaviour shapes the American approach to investing and risk in general.Kamath strongly criticised what he described as a misleading narrative that India is dangerously overleveraged simply because of the sheer volume of options contracts being traded. He argued that this view fails to consider the nuances of how leverage works and ignores the capital involved in each transaction.“Just counting contracts without understanding the structure is misleading,” he wrote. According to him, metrics like total market exposure, margin usage, and premium values offer a much clearer picture of actual risk levels than raw trading volume ever could.Kamath’s statements found resonance within the investor and trader community. Many users echoed his views online, pointing out that structural and cultural factors are crucial in understanding any market’s behaviour.One user remarked, “Comparing India to the US in leverage is like bringing a water pistol to a wildfire,” highlighting the vast difference in scale. Another added, “India’s market is retail-led, and the US is dominated by institutions. Their leverage capacities aren’t even in the same ballpark.” Others praised Kamath for calling out misleading narratives and presenting a more balanced view of India’s evolving financial landscape.In conclusion, Kamath urged analysts, commentators, and financial media to exercise greater nuance when comparing India’s financial markets to those in the US. He argued that surface-level metrics like contract volume do not adequately reflect real risk exposure, especially in a country where financial infrastructure is still developing.By drawing attention to the differences in leverage, market maturity, investor profile, and cultural attitudes toward speculation, Kamath’s intervention has sparked an important conversation. His critique not only challenges oversimplified narratives but also offers a clearer, more contextual understanding of how emerging markets like India should be evaluated. Kamath has consistently urged retail investors to prioritize long-term wealth creation over short-term speculation. He often emphasizes the importance of financial education and risk awareness in navigating India’s evolving markets.",Zerodha co-founder Nithin Kamath has pushed back against recent comparisons between India and the United States over options trading volumes. Kamath emphasised that India’s markets are far less leveraged and significantly less mature than those in the US.

"Elon Musk says valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible, but….",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/elon-musk-says-valuation-of-20-trillion-for-tesla-is-possible-but-/articleshow/122907384.cms,"Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation. He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company. I’ve got my methods of doing that, and I use machine learning. I sort through all 42,000 employees.”“100% of the time, I increased the company’s spend on OpEx [operating expenses]. And the reason for that is because you take care of people, everything else takes care [of itself],” Jensen Huang concluded.",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world.

AI transformation drives Microsoft’s workforce restructuring strategy

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed the company's massive job cuts in a candid memo to employees, acknowledging that recent layoffs affecting over 15,000 workers this year, have been ""weighing heavily"" on him while defending the cuts as necessary for the Redmond giant’s AI transformation.""Before anything else, I want to speak to what's been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations,"" Nadella wrote to Microsoft's more than 200,000 employees. ""These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we've worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with – our colleagues, teammates, and friends.""The layoffs represent approximately 7% of Microsoft's global workforce, making it the company's largest personnel reduction since 2014. Despite the cuts, Microsoft's stock has soared 21% this year, hitting record highs above $500 per share, while the company reported $75 billion in net income over three fiscal quarters.Nadella directly addressed what he called the ""uncertainty and seeming incongruence"" of cutting jobs while the company thrives financially. ""By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving – our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right,"" he wrote. ""We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.""The CEO described this contradiction as ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value,"" explaining that ""progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.""Nadella emphasised that achieving future success ""will be defined by our ability to go through this difficult process of 'unlearning' and 'learning.'"" He argued this transformation requires Microsoft to ""meet changing customer needs, by continuing to maintain and scale our current business, while also creating new categories with new business models and a new production function.""The memo outlined Microsoft's strategic pivot from a ""software factory to an intelligence engine"" as the company invests $80 billion in AI infrastructure. Nadella envisions a future where ""all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips.""""As we begin a new fiscal year, I've been reflecting on the road we've traveled together and the path ahead,"" Nadella wrote, positioning the layoffs within broader industry shifts toward AI-driven automation that have eliminated over 80,000 tech jobs in 2025.The CEO expressed ""sincere gratitude to those who have left,"" acknowledging that ""their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today."" However, he offered no guarantees against future layoffs, instead urging remaining employees to maintain a ""growth mindset"" during what he called the ""messiness"" of transformation.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed the company's massive job cuts in a candid memo to employees.

Read Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

💻Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Bill Gates daughter shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother



Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among tech CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April this year, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment. ""In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Phoebe Gates recently shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni, Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was: ""Get up or get out of the game, sis.""According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Melinda Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced. Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking: ""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""""He's like, ‘Why would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‘You answered your own question,'” she added.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates worked a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup, Phia.

Sundar Pichai joins the ‘billionaire club’ after leading Google for over a decade; his net worth is…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sundar-pichai-joins-the-billionaire-club-after-leading-google-for-over-a-decade-his-net-worth-is/articleshow/122897734.cms,"Sundar Pichai achieves rare feat as a non-founder CEO

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race. Pichai's rise reflects a new era where operational excellence, not just founding status, can build tech empires.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes. His rise underscores a shift in Silicon Valley’s power dynamics—where disciplined execution rivals disruptive invention. As Alphabet charts its future, Pichai’s story stands as a model for aspiring global leaders in tech and beyond.","Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO.

What happens during a total solar eclipse

Next Solar eclipse on September 21, 2025

A false claim has been circulating online stating that the entire world will go dark for 6 minutes on August 2, i.e. today due to a solar eclipse. Some posts on social media further claim that the phenomenon is one of the rare ones and will not occur for a century, generating curiosity and public fear. But experts have confirmed that it is a hoax. There is no global blackout coming in 2025. In fact, NASA’s astronomical records show the next total solar eclipse of such magnitude is scheduled for August 2, 2027, not 2025. Here’s what you need to know about the buzz around the celestial phenomenonAccording to NASA’s astronomical data, the next total solar eclipse of this magnitude will occur on August 2, 2027, not in 2025 as suggested by viral claims and rumours spreading online. Further, this event will be a significant celestial occurrence, but it will not darken the entire world.The eclipse will cast the Moon’s shadow over parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, creating a spectacular but localized event. The rest of the world, including North America and large parts of Asia, will not witness this eclipse at all.The August 2, 2027, total solar eclipse is being called the “Eclipse of the Century” because it will offer the longest duration of totality on land in the 21st century — lasting up to 6 minutes and 22 seconds, the longest since 1991.The path of totality—the area where the Sun will be completely blocked—will be about 160 miles (258 km) wide, stretching over 9,462 miles (15,227 km) and covering parts of 11 countries, including:For those within this path, the sky will briefly turn dark in broad daylight, creating a dramatic twilight effect. Areas outside this path may see a partial eclipse, but no blackout.A total solar eclipse happens when the Moon comes directly between the Earth and the Sun. As a result of this celestial movement, the Sun's light is blocked, casting a shadow on parts of Earth. During totality, viewers see the Sun’s corona—its outer atmosphere—which is usually hidden by the Sun’s glare.Total solar eclipses are visible only from a narrow strip of land, and their duration is typically just a few minutes.While no total eclipse will occur in 2025, a partial solar eclipse is expected on September 21, 2025. During this event, the Moon will partially obscure the Sun, making it appear as though a “bite” has been taken out of it.This partial eclipse will not cause darkness, nor will it be visible worldwide.","A false claim has been circulating online stating that the entire world will go dark for 6 minutes on August 2, i.e. today due to a solar eclipse. Some posts on social media further claim that the phenomenon is one of the rare ones and will not occur for a century. But experts have confirmed that it is a hoax. There is no global blackout coming in 2025.

How Atlassian CEO informed its employees about the layoffs



If we make call centre staff more productive, people aren’t going to call more [and] we’ll probably need less call centre staff. Some parts of our economy will grow significantly as AI makes them more productive, and some parts of our economy will shrink as we do that.”

“There are a couple of reasons I’ve purchased a plane. Personal security is the primary reason (an unfortunate reality of my world), but also so I can run a global business from Australia, and still be a constantly present dad.”

Jira software maker Atlassian has laid off 150 employees, a report claims. The affected roles in the Australian tech company are reportedly being replaced by new artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The latest round of job cuts comes months after Atlassian’s billionaire CEO and co-founder, Mike Cannon-Brookes, defended his purchase of a private jet. In March, Cannon-Brookes took to professional networking site LinkedIn to defend his decision to acquire a Bombardier 7500, an aircraft which is believed to cost over US$75 million, stating that this purchase would allow him to be a ""present dad."" The latest layoffs were also reportedly defended by Atlassian’s other co-founder and former CEO Scott Farquhar.According to a report by SkyNews Australia, Atlassian employees who were impacted in this round of job cuts were informed of the job cuts via a pre-recorded video message from Cannon-Brookes. In the video, seen by the publication, the CEO spoke from a home office in a faded green hoodie.However, the Cannon-Brookes did not name the affected individuals, who reportedly had to wait 15 minutes for an email confirming their status. Impacted staff had their laptops blocked, but are expected to receive payment for the next six months, the report noted.Meanwhile, Farquhar, Atlassian's other cofounder, has also reportedly defended the layoffs, saying that Australia’s copyright laws should be updated to allow AI companies unrestricted access to mine data.In a statement to the Sydney Morning Herald, Farquhar said: “Earlier this year, Atlassian faced criticism for Cannon-Brookes buying a personal jet for upwards of $75 million despite his support for climate action and promotion of solar power. He has reportedly been investing heavily in eco-friendly projects, including a solar power cable from Darwin to Singapore.In a post shared on LinkedIn, Cannon-Brookes wrote:","Jira software maker Atlassian has laid off 150 employees, a report claims.

WinZO disputes Google’s CCI proposal on Play Store rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/winzo-disputes-googles-cci-proposal-on-play-store-rules/articleshow/123051104.cms,"Bengaluru: Real‑money gaming platform WinZO has raised concerns over Google’s latest proposal to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), arguing that it does not adequately address the anti‑competitive issues flagged in an ongoing investigation.The case originates from WinZO’s December 2022 complaint alleging that Google abused its dominant position by restricting Play Store access to only fantasy sports and rummy apps while excluding other real‑money gaming categories. With Google controlling 96% of India’s app distribution market, WinZO said this policy inflated user acquisition costs by “at least 10x” for apps distributed outside the Play Store.Acting on the complaint, the CCI in November 2024 ordered a formal investigation, citing prima facie violations of competition law, including the imposition of unfair conditions, denial of market access and limiting of market development. The Commission had noted Google’s lack of clear criteria for its pilot programme, inconsistent enforcement of its ads policy and “misleading payment warnings” shown to users sideloading apps, which it said artificially deterred usage.In a public notice issued recently the CCI invited comments on Google’s commitment offer. Google’s proposal includes allowing all real‑money games that are certified by recognised third‑party bodies, replacing its pilot programme for fantasy sports and rummy apps and permitting certified skill‑based games to advertise on Google Ads. If approved, Google has committed to implement the Play Store changes within 120 days and its advertising changes within 150 days of the CCI’s order. The deadline for public comments is August 20, 2025.Responding to WinZO’s objections, a Google spokesperson said the company welcomed the CCI’s market testing of its proposed framework, describing it as the result of “constructive discussions” with the regulator and Indian developers. Google added that it is confident the proposal will create “a more open and safe ecosystem” for real‑money gaming apps, empower local developers and prioritise user safety.In its statement, WinZO said Google’s commitments “must be robust and genuinely eliminate the discriminatory practices identified,” adding that the proposed framework’s reference to “developing” a commercial model for real‑money gaming lacked clear timelines or objective criteria.WinZO, which reported a 70% rise in revenue to Rs 1,055 crore and a 151% increase in profit to Rs 315 crore in FY24, said it will continue to participate in the consultation process “to ensure fairness, transparency and a level playing field in India’s digital economy.”","WinZO has raised concerns over Google’s latest proposal to the Competition Commission of India.

Legal battle continues despite Epic's courtroom success

The US’ Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has rejected Google's appeal in the Epic Games lawsuit, affirming that Google's Play Store and payment systems constitute illegal monopolies. The decision forces Google to implement sweeping changes to Android's app ecosystem within three years, including allowing rival app stores on Google Play and ending exclusive payment requirements.The appeals court lifted a stay that had temporarily paused most injunction requirements while Google pursued its appeal, clearing the path for immediate implementation of the court-ordered remedies.Under the permanent injunction, Google faces unprecedented restrictions on its Android business model. The company must distribute competing app stores through Google Play and provide rivals with access to its complete app catalog.Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney , who called this a ""total victory,"" announced that the Epic Games Store for Android will launch directly within Google Play Store Google is also banned from requiring developers to use Google Play Billing and from striking revenue-sharing deals with device manufacturers to preinstall its store.Google plans to escalate its appeal to the Supreme Court, with the company warning that the decision ""will significantly harm user safety, limit choice, and undermine innovation."" The tech giant had argued that the injunction imposed ""burdensome contractual restrictions"" without justification.The case originated in 2020 when Epic embedded secret code in Fortnite to bypass Google's payment system, prompting Google to remove the popular game from its store. A 2023 jury unanimously found Google guilty of operating illegal monopolies in Android app distribution and in-app billing markets.Unlike Epic's largely unsuccessful lawsuit against Apple, the Google case revealed internal documents showing revenue-sharing agreements and concerns about competitive threats, helping Epic secure its landmark victory in the ongoing battle over mobile app store dominance.",Google must open Android to third-party app stores within three years.

Intel's manufacturing unit faces more ""bad news"" as three senior executives in its operations are set to retire. This declaration from the company follows CEO Lip-Bu Tan 's announcement of major restructuring plans in its manufacturing unit. The latest announcement marks further change as Tan works to revitalise the struggling US-based chipmaker. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Intel has confirmed that Kaizad Mistry and Ryan Russell, both corporate vice presidents in the technology development group, will retire. Additionally, Gary Patton, a corporate vice president at its Design Technology Platform organisation and a former IBM executive, is also retiring. The latest departures underscore the significant shifts occurring within Intel's manufacturing operations.Intel has also discussed internal changes to its technology development group, which oversees the creation of manufacturing processes. The Reuters report also cited two individuals familiar with the matter to claim. The company is also reportedly planning to scale down its manufacturing capacity planning team and reduce part of its engineering workforce, the sources told Reuters.Manufacturing operations are currently led by Naga Chandrasekaran , a former Micron Technology executive, who joined Intel about a year ago under previous CEO Pat Gelsinger. In March, Chandrasekaran’s role expanded to include both technology development and manufacturing. Since then, he has reorganised the teams under him, which provides for layoffs as part of broader global workforce reductions.Last week, during its quarterly earnings announcement, Intel’s new CEO announced several significant changes for the company. Tan, who stepped into the role in March, outlined a plan to reduce the company’s workforce to 75,000 by year-end, a cut of roughly 22%. The chipmaker also said it would adopt a more cautious approach to manufacturing investments.Intel added that the continuation of its next-generation 14A manufacturing process depends on landing a significant customer. Without one, the company may halt or abandon development.In a memo, Tan noted:Tan also informed investors that Intel’s 18A process would likely deliver a reasonable return only if applied to the company’s products.According to a previous report from Reuters, he has also considered discontinuing the offering of 18A technology to external clients to concentrate resources on the 14A process. Intel is reportedly planning to begin high-volume production of its Panther Lake PC chips later this year using the 18A process.","Intel's manufacturing unit faces more ""bad news"" as three senior executives in its operations are set to retire.

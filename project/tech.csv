Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos says company is ‘saving Hollywood’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-ceo-ted-sarandos-says-company-is-saving-hollywood/articleshow/120625779.cms,"What Netflix CEO said about the movie theatre experience



“What does that say? What is the consumer trying to tell us? That they’d like to watch movies at home, thank you. The studios and the theatres are duking it out over trying to preserve this 45-day window that is completely out of step with the consumer experience of just loving a movie.”

“I believe it is an outmoded idea, for most people, not for everybody.”

“We didn’t save it to save the theatre business. We saved it to save the theatre experience,”

“We have these bespoke releases … we have to do some qualification for the Oscars. They have to run for a little bit, it helps with the press cycle a little bit. But I’ve tried to encourage every director we work with to focus on the consumer, focus on the fans. Make a movie that they love, and they will reward you,”

“Folks grew up thinking, ‘I want to make movies on a gigantic screen and have strangers watch them [and to have them] play in the theatre for two months and people cry and sold-out shows … It’s an outdated concept,”

Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos has claimed that the streaming giant is ""saving Hollywood."" Talking at the TIME100 Summit, Sarandos said that he was asked if his company is destroying Hollywood amid issues like shrinking theatrical windows and sagging box office receipts, he said, “No, we’re saving Hollywood .” Sarandos countered these accusations by saying Netflix is “a very consumer-focused company. We deliver the program to you in a way you want to watch it.”Referring to the declining box office sales, he said:While admitting his love for theatres and their communal atmosphere, the Netflix boss noted,However, Netflix hasn’t entirely removed itself from the movie theatre business. The company owns Los Angeles’ Bay Theatre and New York’s Paris Theatre, which Sarandos says Netflix “saved” from becoming a Walgreens.he added.The company also gives certain films limited theatrical releases to qualify for awards, as with 2022’s “Glass Onion” and 2024’s “Emilia Pérez.”Sarandos noted.Sarandos said this while highlighting that Netflix is “in a period of transition.”When asked if creating films “for the communal experience” is “an outmoded idea,” he replied, “I think it is — for most people, not for everybody. If you’re fortunate to live enough in Manhattan, and you can walk to a multiplex and see a movie, that’s fantastic. Most of the country cannot.”Although he insisted he still loves movie theatres and their decline doesn’t “bother” him, Sarandos warned Hollywood not to get “trapped” behind traditional theatrical windows. Instead, he argued, studios should adapt to how audiences want to watch movies or risk losing relevance.","Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos has claimed that the streaming giant is ""saving Hollywood"" While admitting his love for theatres and their communal atmosphere, the Netflix boss noted, “I believe it is an outmoded idea, for most people, not for everybody”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120625756,imgsize-22158,width-400,resizemode-4/Netflix-CEO-Ted-Sarandos-says-company-is-saving-Hollywood.jpg"

Intel Chief Financial Officer (CFO) David Zinsner has expressed concerns that President Donald Trump's tariffs and retaliatory measures from other nations have significantly increased the likelihood of an economic recession.“The very fluid trade policies in the US and beyond, as well as regulatory risks, have increased the chance of an economic slowdown, with the probability of a recession growing,” Zinsner said during the company's quarterly earnings call on Thursday (April 24).He further elaborated on the potential economic impact, saying, “The biggest risk we see is the impact of a potential pullback in investment and spending, as businesses and consumers react to higher costs and the uncertain economic backdrop.”While Intel's geographically diverse production facilities mitigate some of the direct effects of the tariffs, Zinsner acknowledged that the company “will certainly see costs increase.”Earlier this month, JP Morgan projected that the US will slip into a recession by the end of 2025, followed by Trump's reciprocal tariffs. CEO Jamie Dimon also warned that sweeping tariffs may unleash financial instability.“I think probably a recession is a likely outcome,” said Dimon, adding that recent steep market declines are deepening fears.“When you see a 2,000-point decline in the Dow, it sort of feeds on itself... it makes you feel like you're losing money in your 401(k), you're losing money in your pension. You've got to cut back,” he noted.Meanwhile, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, CEO of Intel Products, suggested that rising costs could lead consumers to favour laptops and computers utilising older, less expensive chip generations.“The macroeconomic concerns and tariffs have everybody kind of hedging their bets in what they need to have from an inventory perspective,” Holthaus said during the earnings call.In addition to tariff-related challenges, Intel is navigating US government efforts to impose licensing requirements on the shipment of advanced artificial intelligence chips to countries like China.",Intel CFO David Zinsner expressed concerns that President Donald Trump's tariffs and retaliatory measures from other nations have significantly increased the likelihood of an economic recession.

Elon Musk criticism of OpenAI’s for-profit status

Podcaster Rob Wiblin recently shared a post highlighting a legal letter titled 'Not For Private Gain', signed by 3 Nobel Prize winners and dozens of AI researchers, accusing OpenAI of illegally restructuring from a non-profit to a for-profit entity. Sent to California and Delaware Attorneys General, the letter allegedly demands halting the restructuring of the company. X owner and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk replied to the post, calling it “scam of the century”.The post also has screenshots of the letter with the following text highlighted in colour: All of the governance safeguards that Mr. Altman claimed “ensure (OpenAI) remains focused on its long-term mission would be in jeopardy”. It also has a table comparing the current governance safeguards of OpenAI (under its nonprofit structure) with the proposed changes under the for-profit restructuring.Founded in 2015 as a non-profit organization, OpenAI is reportedly looking to turn the status to for-profit. The company, as per reports plans to restructure as a public benefit corporation, a shift that has raised concerns among AI experts, legal scholars and former OpenAI employees. They argue that the move could compromise OpenAI’s original mission to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of all humanity.Elon Musk, one of the co-founders of OpenAI has been a vocal critic of this transition. He has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI that will go to a jury trial in spring 2026. The lawsuit, initially dismissed, accuses OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman of deviating from its founding agreement by emphasizing profits over AI safety .","OpenAI is reportedly looking to turn the status to for-profit.

While it does not support third-party music apps yet, Perplexity is reportedly working on integrating support for Gmail and Google Calendar in future updates.

Email and communication

Email management: With Perplexity Assistant, iPhone users can send emails via Apple Mail using voice commands. The assistant will also allow users to compose emails, check their inboxes, and send replies, making it a useful tool for managing communications without needing to manually type messages.

Limited app integrations:

Therefore, users of such apps may find the assistant's capabilities limited for some tasks.

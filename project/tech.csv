Other tech leaders that may attend Trump’s inauguration

Several prominent tech leaders have already met President-elect Donald Trump and now a number of them are set to attend Donald Trump’s inauguration this month, a report has said. This may signal the industry's efforts to strengthen ties with Trump as he returns to the White House.According to a report by Bloomberg, Mark Zuckerberg , the CEO of Facebook-parent company Meta , intends to be present, as confirmed by a source familiar with the matter. Zuckerberg has reportedly met with Trump two times ahead of him assuming office as the President of the US. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also plans to attend the swearing-in ceremony on January 20, according to a company spokesperson. Previous reports have said that Altman is finding it difficult to meet the President-elect because of Elon Musk , who is purportedly stationed as a gatekeeper. Anyone who wants to meet Trump has to go through Musk, reports claimed. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will participate in some of the surrounding festivities, according to the company. Uber also plans to co-host an inauguration party in Washington with Elon Musk’s X social media firm and The Free Press, a media company, Bloomberg said.In addition to Altman, OpenAI president Greg Brockman and chief product officer Kevin Weil also plan to attend the inauguration, as told by a company spokesperson to the publication. Musk is also likely to attend, given his close relationship with Trump.Various tech leaders, such as Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple chief executive Tim Cook and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have reportedly met with Trump after his win in the US Presidential elections.Meta and Amazon have pledged to donate $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, meanwhile, Altman has personally donated $1 million to the fund.","Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook-parent company Meta, intends to be present, as confirmed by a source familiar with the matter.

Elon Musk gets US government support in what he called “illegal” conversion from Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-gets-us-government-support-in-what-he-called-illegal-conversion-from-microsoft-and-chatgpt-maker-openai/articleshow/117156759.cms,"The agencies stated reportedly that a company that ceases potentially illegal behavior still bears a ""heavy burden"" to prove the behavior won't recur.

The filing comes in response to Musk’s recent request that a federal court stop the company from pursuing what he called an “illegal” conversion to a for-profit company.

Elon Musk vs Sam Altman

US antitrust regulators have reportedly backed part of Elon Musk 's argument in his legal battle to prevent OpenAI from restructuring as a for-profit company. According to a report by Bloomberg, in a court filing, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) argued that overlapping board memberships can negatively impact competition, even after a director resigns. This aligns with Musk's lawsuit, which alleges antitrust violations by OpenAI and Microsoft due to LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman simultaneously serving on both companies' boards from 2017 to 2023, and Deannah Templeton's brief stint as a Microsoft executive and non-voting OpenAI board member.While the agencies didn't take a stance on the legality of OpenAI's restructuring itself, their filing supports Musk's argument about the potential harm of overlapping directorships.A hearing on this request is scheduled for January 14.This legal action is part of Musk's ongoing tussle with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman , years after they co-founded OpenAI as a non-profit focused on developing AI for societal benefit.The FTC has been investigating OpenAI on multiple fronts, including a soon-to-be-released study on AI investments by Microsoft and other tech companies, potential misleading consumer practices by OpenAI, and the board overlaps involving Hoffman. Hoffman has publicly criticized FTC Chair Lina Khan, calling for her removal.Musk initially sued OpenAI in state court, then dropped and refiled the case in federal court. He claims OpenAI breached its original non-profit mission by accepting billions in funding from Microsoft starting in 2019 and argues that immediate court intervention is necessary to prevent OpenAI from dominating the AI market.OpenAI, which declined to comment on the latest filing, has previously defended the legality of Hoffman and Templeton's board positions and dismissed Musk's lawsuit as baseless, claiming he initially supported a more traditional corporate structure for the company.","The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission argued that overlapping board memberships can negatively impact competition.

Elon Musk gives an update on Neuralink’s third human brain implant: ‘We upgraded…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-gives-an-update-on-neuralinks-third-human-brain-implant-we-upgraded/articleshow/117155968.cms,"Take a look at the video here



What Musk said about Neuralink's third human implant



“We’ve got now three humans with Neuralinks implanted and they’re working well. We upgraded the devices, they’ll have more electrodes, basically higher bandwidth, longer battery life and everything. So, expect 20 or 30 patients this year with the upgraded Neuralink devices.""

What Musk said about Neuralink’s roadmap



“With our first product, we’re trying to enable people who have lost their brain-body connection. So, if they are tetraplegic, paraplegic or, as you can imagine say Stephen Hawking. If

could communicate as fast or even faster than a normal human, that would be transformational. Being able to read the motor cortex of the brain. If you think about moving your hand, it will move the cursor on the screen. And it enables people to control their computer or their phone just by thinking. Then our next part will be

Blindsight devices

where even if somebody has lost both eyes or has lost the optic nerve, we can interface directly with the visual cortex in the brain and enable them to see. We already have that working in monkeys,”

“We think if you have a second Neuralink device, that is past the point where the spinal damage occurred. We can transmit the signals from the brain past where essentially the wires are broken and enable someone to walk again. I'm confident that that is physically possible. In the long term goal for Neuralink is to be able to improve the bandwidth. So, right now, when we're speaking our bandwidth and this per second is quite low and the sustained bandwidth of a human is less than one bit per second over 24 hours,”","Musk: ""We’ve got now three humans with Neuralinks implanted and they’re working well"" ""We think if you have a second Neuralink device, that is past the point where the spinal damage occurred,"" he says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117156121,imgsize-707642,width-400,resizemode-4/117156121.jpg"

Represented by Noel Francisco, TikTok argued the law violates First Amendment free speech. Defending the law, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar emphasized the urgency of national security concerns with a January 19 deadline.

Upset Tiktok content creators

TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance reportedly offered a warning during Supreme Court arguments over a law that would compel the sale of the short-video app or ban it in the United States. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the lawyer representing TikTok warned of broader implications for other companies. Noel Francisco, representing TikTok and ByteDance, argued that: ""If Congress could do this to TikTok, it could come after other companies, too.""The law, debated by the justices, sets a January 19 deadline for ByteDance to sell the platform or face a ban due to national security concerns. The companies argue that the law violates First Amendment free speech protections and seek at least a delay. Francisco argued that upholding this law could justify similar actions against other companies. He cited the example of AMC theaters, previously Chinese-owned, suggesting Congress could use this precedent to censor or promote specific films.While some justices expressed First Amendment concerns, their questions suggested an inclination to uphold the law. TikTok boasts roughly 170 million U.S. users. Congress passed the measure with bipartisan support in 2024, citing fears of Chinese government espionage and influence operations.Jeffrey Fisher, representing TikTok content creators, reportedly questioned why the law targeted only TikTok and not other Chinese online retailers like Temu, which has 70 million U.S. users. He questioned the logic of singling out TikTok while ignoring other platforms potentially subject to Chinese control.As per the Reuters report, solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, defending the law for the Biden administration, emphasized the urgency of the January 19 deadline to force ByteDance's action. She argued that ""foreign adversaries"" wouldn't willingly relinquish control over a major U.S. communication channel and that the deadline might be the necessary ""jolt"" for divestiture.A January 19 ban would prevent new TikTok downloads on Apple and Google platforms, though existing users could initially still access the app. However, the app's functionality would degrade over time without ongoing support.The Court also debated whether potential Chinese propaganda or influence campaigns justified the ban. Francisco countered that content manipulation is widespread, citing various U.S. news outlets.There was mention of the possibility of a change in administration affecting the law's enforcement, with the suggestion that a new administration might pursue a different approach. A justice questioned whether the president could simply choose not to enforce the law, to which the Solicitor General acknowledged presidential enforcement discretion. The argument was made that a preliminary injunction could provide ""breathing space.""","TikTok warned that a law forcing its sale or ban in the U.S. could set a precedent impacting other companies.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Meloni in the US

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni defended Elon Musk against criticism in a recent interview with Corriere Della Sera. Meloni questioned the labeling of Musk as a ""Monster."" She linked this criticism to his political associations, specifically mentioning his close relationship with then President-elect Donald Trump . Musk served on Trump's transition team and was expected to take on an advisory role. Meloni stated that Musk is often seen negatively for supporting what some consider the ""wrong"" side. ""Musk is labeled a 'Monster' simply for supporting what some consider as the 'wrong' side,"" she said.When asked if she is friends with Musk, Meloni replied,She added, “Musk is a great personality of our time, an extraordinary innovator who always looks to the future.”,” she told the publication.Elon Musk presented Italy's PM, 47, with the Global Citizen's Award at the Atlantic Council think tank’s Global Citizen Awards. ""I thank Elon Musk, for the beautiful words that he had for me and for his precious genius for the era in which we live,"" said Meloni in her thanks address at the event. The video of the same was shared recently by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley Association on Twitter and reposted by Elon Musk.Italy PM Meloni was in the US recently to meet Trump. The US President-elect hailed Italian Prime Minister Meloni as a “fantastic woman” who has ""really taken Europe by storm,"" as per a report in CNN. A member of the right-wing Brothers of Italy party, Meloni took office in October 2022. She has been recognised as the most powerful person in Europe for 2024 by Politico.According to CNN reports, the details of the meeting have not been disclosed, although the Italian leader, like others, has been seeking to strengthen ties with the President-elect ahead of his inauguration on January 20.One possible topic on the agenda was the detention of Italian journalist Cecilia Sala, who was arrested in Iran last month, it said.

iPhone SE 4 may have a new name

Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. A report previously suggested that these devices would launch alongside iOS 18 .3 and iPadOS 18.3, but Gurman clarified that while the products are being developed on the same software ""train,"" their release may not coincide with the updates. Instead, Gurman stated that Apple is targeting a release “before iOS 18.4,” offering a more specific timeframe for the highly anticipated devices.Taking to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Gurma wrote “Yes, the new iPads and iPhone SE replacement are being developed on the iOS 18.3 train - but that doesn’t mean they launch together this month”. Adding further, he said “It means they’ll launch before iOS 18.4, by April if all goes to plan.”According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, iPhone SE 4 may be rebranded as the iPhone 16E . The naming speculation originated from Chinese social media platform Weibo user Fixed Focus Digital and was later corroborated by leaker Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter). While neither source has an established track record with Apple rumors, the potential rebranding would align the budget model more closely with Apple's flagship iPhone 16 lineup. The potential name change would mark a significant shift from Apple's previous ""SE"" branding for its budget iPhone line.The device is rumored to receive a major redesign, adopting the modern aesthetics of the iPhone 14 and moving away from the dated iPhone 8-style design of the current SE model. Key upgrades include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID authentication, and a USB-C port, replacing the Touch ID button and Lightning connector found on the current model.Sources indicate the device will feature a single 48-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of RAM, and Apple's latest A-series chip to support new AI features. The company is also expected to implement its first in-house designed 5G modem in the device.","Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

What Assam police said about the incident



“It was a tea garden area, which was shown in Assam on Google Maps. However, it was actually inside Nagaland. The team went inside Nagaland in pursuit of the criminal due to confusion and misleading guidance on GPS. Of the 16 personnel, only three were in uniform and the rest were in civil dress. This also led to confusion among the locals. They also attacked the team and one of our personnel was injured. The locals then realised that it was a genuine police team from Assam and released five members, including the injured person. They, however, held the remaining 11 persons as captives overnight. They were released in the morning and reached Jorhat later.”

Past incidents involving Google Maps



Google Maps misled a 16-member team of Assam Police resulting in their detention by locals in Nagaland, a report said. According to news agency PTI, Assam Police said that a team from Jorhat district was following Google Maps directions during a raid to arrest a suspect when they mistakenly crossed into the Mokokchung district in Nagaland.Locals, believing the officers to be criminals, held them captive overnight. The Jorhat police contacted authorities in Mokokchung, who then rescued the Assam police team.In a statement to PTI, a senior official of Assam Police said:Last year, multiple incidents were reported, claiming that Google Maps led some users into accidents.In December 2023, a family from Bihar travelling to Goa ended up in a forest area in Khanapur taluk of Karnataka's Belagavi district reportedly after relying on Google Maps for directions.In another incident in November 2023, three people lost their lives in Uttar Pradesh's Bareilly after their car, allegedly misled by Google Maps, drove off an under-construction bridge into the Ramganga River. The victims, unaware of the incomplete flyover ahead, continued driving until their vehicle plunged into the river.","Google Maps misled a 16-member team of Assam Police resulting in their detention by locals in Nagaland.

The documents also allege that CEO Mark Zuckerberg was aware of and approved the use of the pirated materials for AI training .The revelations emerge from the ongoing Kadrey et al. v.

According to Ford, Trump’s understanding of the industry has evolved since his initial years in office, noting that it took some “education” to help Trump grasp the complexities of the sector during his first term.Despite the close ties between Trump and Musk, CEO of electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc., Ford is not concerned that this alliance will harm legacy automakers.

The Walt Disney Co., Fox Corp. , and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. have abandoned their plans to launch a joint sports streaming service, Venu Sports , just days after reaching a settlement in a lawsuit that challenged the venture's potential anti-competitive impact.The companies announced the discontinuation of Venu Sports in a joint statement, citing the ""ever-changing marketplace"" and a desire to ""meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels."" They also expressed gratitude to the Venu staff and pledged support during the transition.“After careful consideration, we have collectively agreed to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch the streaming service,” the companies said in a statement. “In an ever-changing marketplace, we determined that it was best to meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels. We are proud of the work that has been done on Venu to date and grateful to the Venu staff, whom we will support through this transition period,” the statement added.The decision follows a legal challenge initiated by FuboTV Inc. , a sports-focused streaming service, which argued that Venu Sports would stifle competition and harm consumers. FuboTV contended that the joint venture would exclude them from carrying certain key sports channels, potentially forcing them out of business, and would ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also signaled its intention to scrutinize the project for potential antitrust violations.The concept for Venu Sports emerged last year as the three media giants sought to combine their valuable sports content into a single streaming package, targeting viewers who desired access to live sports without traditional cable subscriptions. The proposed service immediately drew opposition, culminating in FuboTV's lawsuit.Despite this settlement, other industry players continued to express concerns. EchoStar Corp. and pay-TV provider DirecTV Inc. submitted a letter to Judge Garnett, arguing that Disney's agreement with FuboTV did not fully address the underlying anti-competitive issues posed by the Venu Sports concept.The abandonment of Venu Sports comes as live sports remains a highly lucrative sector of the television industry. With the ongoing trend of cord-cutting, media companies are actively reassessing how to package and distribute sports content to reach audiences.","Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. announced the discontinuation of Venu Sports in a joint statement.

How social media users reacted to the issue



“We have lot of patience. Don't worry. We have seen tons of glitches like this from day 1 of portal and paid penalties. Of Course!! Even if anyone lost patience, no one is there to hear. Whatever you people do, that has to be followed. That's it know.”

“Announce extension on time. Let business owners relax. Whenever a portal is down so near to due date, extension announcement should be immediate to clear uncertainity,”

“And what about late fees, does the GST registered taxpayer will get 200/- late fee in their Cash Ledger, as delay is from your end ?”

“We have patience, but department will send notice to us if it is not filed within due date and if due date is extend for one day why we have to work on Sunday!!!”

“GST portal is not working since few days and lot of professional time is wasted and still no solution..levy penalty on @Infosys_GSTN and provide relief to taxpayers and give proper timeline for smooth working of portal.”

Meta now allows users to compare these groups to inanimate objects, filth, and diseases like cancer. Additionally, individuals can claim that certain protected characteristics should not exist or are inferior.Protected characteristics, as defined by Meta, include race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religion, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, and serious disease.The revised policy also eliminates Meta’s previous stance on hateful conduct creating an ""environment of intimidation and exclusion"" and acknowledges the potential for offline violence."," Meta recently made controversial changes to its Hateful Conduct policy.

Telecom operators are reportedly lobbying the Department of Telecommunications DoT ) to adopt the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India 's (TRAI) definition of international traffic, a change that could boost their SMS revenues by over Rs 400 crore annually.According to a report in Economic Times, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), whose members include Reliance Jio Airtel and Vodafone-Idea , have sent a letter to the telecom secretary Neeraj Mittal. The letter has urged the DoT to incorporate Trai's recommendations into existing unified license agreements and upcoming authorizations. Trai recently defined international traffic as SMS messages that originate or terminate from devices, servers, or applications located outside India. COAI believes this definition will provide much-needed clarity to the industry.Experts predict that adopting this definition could generate over Rs 400 crore in additional annual SMS revenue for telcos by preventing the misclassification of international messages as domestic ones.This push follows years of dispute between telecom operators and multinational companies (MNCs), including e-commerce giants, regarding message classification. These MNCs include Amazon, Flipkart, Netflix and others.Telcos have alleged that some MNCs process international transactions from foreign servers but send SMS messages from domestic systems to avoid higher international SMS charges. While Trai has set domestic SMS rates between 0.2 and 0.5 paisa, international SMS rates are significantly higher, ranging from ₹2 to ₹5 depending on the origin country.Trai's recent recommendation clarifies that any incoming application-to-person (A2P) SMS message should be considered international if it requires the use or intervention of any device, system, or application located outside India. This move addresses the issue of various entities, including financial institutions, e-commerce firms, enterprises, cloud providers, and OTTs, using A2P messaging without revealing the SMS origin. Telcos argue that this clarity is crucial.","Telecom operators are reportedly lobbying the Department of Telecommunications DoT to adopt Trai's definition of international traffic.

Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has issued a strong warning to tech companies, emphasizing that compliance with Brazilian laws is mandatory for operating in the country. Moraes, who recently ordered the temporary suspension of X (formerly Twitter), owned by Elon Musk, stated that the court will not permit the monetization of hate speech.“In Brazil, (the companies) will only continue to operate if they respect Brazilian legislation, regardless of the rant of Big Tech managers,” Moraes said, as per news agency Reuters.While Moraes did not name any specific company, his remarks came shortly after Meta announced plans to discontinue its US fact-checking program and loosen restrictions on discussions surrounding controversial topics.Moraes, speaking at an event commemorating the second anniversary of the January 8 riots in Brazil, underscored the importance of respecting Brazilian legislation, regardless of the opinions of Big Tech executives.Meanwhile, Brazilian prosecutors have requested clarification from Meta regarding whether the changes to its fact-checking program in the US will also apply to Brazil. Meta has been given 30 days to respond as part of an ongoing investigation into online misinformation and violence.On August 30, 2024, Moraes ordered the suspension of X (formerly Twitter) in Brazil, accusing the platform of failing to comply with local laws requiring the appointment of a legal representative in the country.This decision resulted in a complete shutdown of X's operations in Brazil. Major tech companies like Apple and Google, along with Brazilian internet service providers (ISPs), blocked access to the platform for their users, effectively cutting off millions of Brazilians from the social media service.The suspension, initially ordered by Moraes and later unanimously upheld by a Supreme Court panel, led to a clash between Moraes and X owner Elon Musk, who criticised the judge's actions as censorship.","Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has issued a strong warning to tech companies.

US giants challenging local rivals with quick commerce expansion



Blinkit will now deliver laptops, monitors, and printers in 10 minutes. This expansion into electronics makes the Zomato-owned quick commerce platform the third quick commerce platform to offer rapid delivery of such high-value items, following Flipkart Minutes and Bigbasket's BB Now. Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa took to social media platform X (earlier Twitter) to announce the new offering. Currently, this service is live in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and more. The company has also promised to add more brands and their products to the service in the coming days.In the X post, Dhindsa wrote:Earlier this month, Blinkit also introduced a 10-minute ambulance service in Gurugram. The company plans to expand this service to other major cities within the next two years.The Indian quick commerce market is heating up with the entry of US giants Amazon and Flipkart, challenging local players like Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Zepto. Amazon is piloting its ""Tez"" service in Bengaluru, offering fast delivery of essentials. Meanwhile, Flipkart is also expanding its ""Minutes"" service with an extensive network of dark stores and a wider product range, including electronics and even medicine.This intensified competition is putting pressure on existing players' profitability, forcing them to innovate and adapt.

Elon Musk has joined the chorus of AI experts declaring that we've hit “peak data.” In a recent livestream, the xAI founder stated that AI models have essentially consumed all of humanity's accumulated knowledge and there’s very little real-world data left to train AI models on.""We've exhausted basically the cumulative sum of human knowledge...in AI training,"" Musk said, adding, “That happened basically last year.”Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind , recently cautioned that the rapid advancements in AI chatbots may be slowing down. He attributed this potential slowdown to a growing scarcity of high-quality data for training AI models. Hassabis said that tech companies have essentially ‘exhausted’ the readily available data on the internet, having already used it to train existing large language models.In fact, about a month ago, Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman talked about the use of synthetic data to train AI models because the available data is exhausted – something that OpenAI's former chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, warned about.Musk believes the solution lies in synthetic data – data generated by AI itself. He envisions AI models creating their own training data and engaging in a “process of self-learning.”“The only way to supplement [real-world data] is with synthetic data, where the AI creates [training data],” he said.“With synthetic data … [AI] will sort of grade itself and go through this process of self-learning,” he added.This approach is already being adopted by major players like Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic, who are using synthetic data to train their most advanced AI models.Google DeepMind has reportedly been using synthetic data to train AL models and it relied on this method to help train a model that can solve Olympiad-level geometry problems.In fact, the AI arm of Google recently pointed to inference-time compute – a solution to tackle the lack of data to train AI models. This technique allows AI models to tackle complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, manageable prompts, essentially learning along the way.""We’re generating vast amounts of synthetic data. That synthetic data is increasingly high quality,"" Suleyman told The Verge in an interview last month.","Elon Musk has joined the chorus of AI experts declaring that we've hit “peak data.” In a recent livestream, the xAI founder stated that AI models have essentially consumed all of humanity's accumulated knowledge.

"Why restaurants across the country are up in arms against Swiggy, Zomato over 10-minute food delivery",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-restaurants-across-the-country-are-up-in-arms-against-swiggy-zomato-over-10-minute-food-delivery/articleshow/117088263.cms,"



What NRAI said against Swiggy and Zomato



“We are absolutely not okay with Zomato and Swiggy engaging in private labelling and selling food directly via Blinkit’s Bistro app and Swiggy’s Snacc app for quick food delivery. They have access to all our data, which they do not share with us. For us, there is complete consumer masking. We have no reason to believe they are not migrating our customers to the products they sell as private labels on their apps, whether it’s data from a tea brand, biryani, or momo. We are seriously considering taking legal action.”

“Quick commerce in food is here to stay, grow, and add more zing to the food delivery space. People want more convenience, and this will give an edge to restaurants that can adapt to it. We fully support it. However, as long as these aggregators work with restaurants and enable them to go quick, we’re fine with it. But we cannot support a model where they sell similar products themselves, effectively competing with us. This has not been allowed for even larger e-commerce players operating under the marketplace model,”

Restaurants across India are protesting against Zomato and Swiggy 's launch of standalone apps for 10-minute food delivery . The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) is also planning to take the issue to the Competition Commission of India (CCI). The NRAI alleges that these new apps, Bistro by Zomato-owned Blinkit and Snacc by Swiggy, amount to the companies operating private labels , which could harm existing restaurant partners. This move escalates an ongoing case the NRAI has with the CCI against the two food delivery giants, accusing them of anti-competitive practices.In a statement to the Economic Times, Sagar Daryani , NRAI president and co-founder and CEO of Wow Momo said:Food delivery platforms like Zomato and Swiggy use services like Bistro and Snacc, respectively to source food and beverages from third-party vendors and deliver them through quick-commerce dark stores. Apart from this, the companies also provide a 15-minute food delivery service by aggregating restaurants. Swiggy’s rapid food delivery service, offered under its Bolt model, now contributes to over 5% of its total food delivery orders, ET reports.Daryani added.NRAI has also urged the government to grant industry status to the food services sector, news agency PTI reports. The restaurant body cited the food services sector’s economic contributions and potential to grow into a Rs 7.76 lakh crore industry by 2028.","Restaurants across India are protesting against Zomato and Swiggy's launch of standalone apps for 10-minute food delivery.

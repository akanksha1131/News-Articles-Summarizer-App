How Donald Trump’s re-election as US President may be ‘good news’ for Google,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-donald-trumps-re-election-as-us-president-may-be-good-news-for-google/articleshow/115029980.cms,"Trump does not back breaking up Google

Why DOJ is considering breaking up Google

Donald Trump's return to the White House may help Google which has faced scrutiny over its dominance in online search. According to a report, the 47th President-elect of the US may significantly alter the current administration's approach to antitrust enforcement, including scaling back efforts to break up Alphabet's Google.Citing experts, news agency Reuters said that Trump is expected to continue cases against Big Tech, several of which began in his first term, however, they may move forward in a new way.During President Joe Biden's term, antitrust policies against Big Tech are said to have taken a more aggressive stance with the justice department pursuing cases against Google and Apple, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) going after Meta and Amazon.Trump has been sceptical about benefits of potential Google breakup. In an event in Chicago, Trump questioned the proposed decision of breaking up a company like Google, adding that other approaches can also be more effective in getting things done right.“If you do that, are you going to destroy the company? What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,” he said.The DOJ is considering breaking up Google due to the company's alleged monopoly of the online search market. Recently, a federal court ruled that Google illegally monopolised the online search market by paying billions of dollars to make its search engine the default on devices like Apple's iPhones.Google has been accused of preventing competitors from entering the market, allowing Google to charge high prices for ads and degrade the quality of those ads. As a punishment, the department proposed some remedies, which includes breaking up the company, divesting Google's Android operating system and Chrome browser, and prohibiting Google from making default search agreements with third-party platforms.Google has criticised the DOJ's proposals, calling them “radical” and saying they could lead to higher prices for consumers.",Donald Trump's return to the White House may help Google which has faced scrutiny over its dominance in online search.

PhonePe complains to High Court: Telegram is causing us financial loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/phonepe-complains-to-high-court-telegram-is-causing-us-financial-loss/articleshow/115029970.cms,"What Madras High Court ordered



“Mr Thriyambak J Kannan, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondents/defendants would submit that it would be difficult for them to block the posting even at the initial stage and would submit that as and when such postings are made and it is brought to the notice of the second respondent, the same would be blocked immediately.

2. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant/ plaintiff also submits that as and when it comes to their notice they would immediately inform the first respondent through E-mail and the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent also undertakes that as and when the E-mail is received, such posting will be removed/ blocked forthwith.

3. Considering the fact that the application is filed to grant interim injunction in respect of the second respondent, the first respondent shall also furnish the I.P. address of the Url., & channel for which the request for blocking had arisen.

4. At the request of the learned counsel for the applicant, list the case after two weeks.""

The Madras High Court has directed Telegram to block and delete channels that impersonate PhonePe and redirect payments to scammers. This order came in response to a lawsuit filed by the Walmart-owned digital payments platform PhonePe alleging that these channels on the messaging platform were causing financial losses to the company and its users. Responding to this, Telegram's counsel said that the platform cannot proactively identify and block such impersonations. However, they assured the court that Telegram would block and delete these channels upon receiving complaints from users and PhonePe. The court accepted this submission and ordered Telegram to promptly address any complaints raised by PhonePe regarding impersonating channels.In a recent order passed by Justice K Kumaresh Babu instructed PhonePe to notify Telegram of any spoofed content or copyright infringements and to provide the URLs for those posts so that Telegram can block them.The court order read:",The Madras High Court has directed Telegram to block and delete channels that impersonate PhonePe and redirect payments to scammers.

Three things that Donald Trump and Elon Musk may not agree on,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/three-things-that-donald-trump-and-elon-musk-may-not-agree-on/articleshow/115029655.cms,"Tax credits to electric vehicle buyers and subsidies to car makers

Rule that makes it must for carmakers to buy clean air credits

Trade war with China

No corporate honcho did more to help Donald Trump win the US presidential election than Elon Musk. The Tesla and SpaceX boss went all out to support Donald Trump's election as the US President. In return, Trump has vowed to give Musk an official role — and with it, as a report in Bloomberg says, ""...the power to influence policy and the federal agencies that oversee his vast empire of companies.""During the campaign, Musk pitched a job for himself to cut government bureaucracy and waste. Trump embraced the idea and didn't forget to regularly mention it during his campaign. “I’m going to get Elon. And he’s great at this. He’s going to be our cost cutter,” said Trump at campaign rallies.Trump also applauded Musk’s ambitions of reaching Mars using SpaceX rockets by 2028. “We will land an American astronaut on Mars. Thank you, Elon. Thank you. Get going, Elon,” Trump said at an October rally.However, there are some policy issues that may impact the bonhomie between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. They certainly are not big enough that they can't be resolved, but yes it remains to be seen how it goes between the two on these important issues.Trump has vowed to end Biden administration policies that award tax credits to electric vehicle buyers and subsidies for carmakers that build cars and batteries in the United States. Removal of the subsidies is likely to hurt other carmakers more than Tesla, however, Tesla too would suffer.Another Republican promise that may worry Musk is the promise to eliminate the rule that requires carmakers to buy clean air credits if they fall short of pollution standards. Tesla reportedly generates a surplus of credits because it makes only electric cars. Selling the credits brought in $739 million in the third quarter, or one-third of the company’s profit.Donald Trump's presidency has created fears of the ongoing US-China trade war intensifying. Reason: Trump has promised to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese goods. Any flare up in trade war with China would also be bad for Tesla. China is one of Tesla’s largest markets, and the company operates a factory in Shanghai that exports cars around the world.","Tesla and SpaceX boss went all out to support Donald Trump's election as the US President.

Republican Party's leader Donald Trump has been elected the 47th president of the United States . The biggest one-man army that made a crucial impact in Donald Trump's election campaign is Elon Musk. Tesla CEO not only openly endorsed Elon Musk , but was also an integral part of his campaign.The US President Donald Trump too openly acknowledged the role that Elon Musk played in his win during his first victory address to his supporters. Trump expressed gratitude as well as appreciation for Tesla CEO.Trump also usedfor his biggest corporate supporter Elon Musk.. He added, “We have to protect our geniuses. We don’t have that many of them.”Characterizing his win as both a political victory and a historic movement, Trump expressed gratitude towards the American people. “I want to thank American people for electing me as the 47th President.""Elon Musk stood shoulder to shoulder with Donald Trump at election ralliesIn the last few months, Musk has been Trump’s most aggressive and vocal supporter. The billionaire propped up Trump on X, formerly Twitter, the social media platform he bought for $44 billion in 2022. Musk hosted town halls in the critical state of Pennsylvania, and appeared at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally.Musk also reportedly spent more than $130 million on Trump and down-ballot Republicans in competitive House races. On Election Day, Musk voted in Texas and then is said to have flown on his private jet to Florida to watch returns with Trump and his family at Mar-a-Lago. His PAC posted a photo of him sitting shoulder to shoulder with Trump and Dana White, the chief executive officer of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.Wall Street rallied into record territory after Trump's win. City Index and FOREX.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada, told news agency AFP, ""The rationale behind the US stock market rally is that Trump is seen as business-friendly and will be able to pass his tax cuts through easily without much resistance from the Democrats who have lost control of the Senate."" Markets are also said to be happy about the clarity of election results.The stock market has paid off Elon Musk's bet that as many say went against conventional corporate wisdom. Tesla share price jumped about 14% early morning. ""A swift and decisive outcome reduces the risks of protracted uncertainty, political violence, recession risks, and even geopolitical spillover that could have accompanied presidential election outcome uncertainty,"" Jason Schenker of Prestige Economics told AFP.","Donald Trump has been elected the 47th president of the United States.

Google is developing a new feature for the Play Store that will help Android users easily track and access their installed games. The ""Continue Playing"" section, set to appear in the Games tab, aims to streamline game access by eliminating the need to search through device launchers.The feature, discovered in version 43.4.23-31 of the Play Store app, will display installed games in a carousel format with direct launch capabilities, as reported by Android Authority. Each game listing will show either the last played timestamp for active games or the installation date for unused titles.This feature would address a common challenge on Android devices, where games often get lost among numerous installed apps without a dedicated games section in most launchers. The carousel interface prioritises recently played games, placing them at the front for quick access.While the feature appears ready for deployment, it's currently not available in the stable version of the Play Store. The timing of the public release remains unconfirmed, but the feature's apparent completion suggests it could roll out to users in an upcoming Play Store update .","Google is developing a new feature for the Play Store that will help Android users easily track and access their installed games.

For the first time in Indian television history, two influential power couples from the worlds of technology, business, and philanthropy will grace The Great Indian Kapil Show . This weekend’s much-anticipated episode will feature NR Narayana Murthy and Sudha Murty, the celebrated founders of Infosys and well-known philanthropists, alongside Zomato co-founder Deepinder Goyal and his wife, Mexican model Grecia Munoz (Gia Goyal). A recent teaser released by Netflix has already generated significant excitement, providing a glimpse into the candid, humorous, and heartwarming moments that await viewers. Hosted by comedian Kapil Sharma, the episode is set to showcase personal stories, cultural exchanges, and anecdotes from the lives of these remarkable personalities.In the teaser, NR Narayana Murthy, 78, reflects on his initial meeting with a young Sudha Murty, recalling the profound impact she had on him. Describing her as “a breath of fresh air,” Murthy shared his admiration for her intelligence, kindness, and dedication to social causes. Now married for 47 years, the couple has become one of India’s most respected duos, with Sudha Murty achieving acclaim as an author, Rajya Sabha member, and philanthropist.When Kapil Sharma humorously questioned whether their habits have grown similar over the years, Sudha Murty responded with her characteristic humor and honesty. “I became a workaholic like him and a stickler for time,” she shared, adding, “I cook so badly, but he never complains. Look at Murthy saab's weight — that's thanks to my cooking!” The playful exchange between the Murthys highlighted their mutual respect and understanding, as well as Sudha’s humility and humor about her culinary skills.The episode also introduces Deepinder Goyal, co-founder of Zomato, and his wife, Grecia Munoz, who he married earlier this year. Known for her vibrant personality and background in modeling, Grecia has embraced her role alongside Deepinder, even immersing herself in Zomato’s operations. During the show, Goyal shared an amusing story about how he and Grecia surprised Zomato customers by delivering orders themselves in Gurgaon. The reaction of customers, who were surprised and delighted by Grecia’s appearance at their doorsteps, quickly became the highlight of the conversation.“When Gia delivers the order, the customers can’t help but keep staring,” Goyal laughed, prompting a burst of laughter from the audience and Kapil Sharma. The couple’s chemistry and lighthearted attitude have made them popular among Zomato’s users and the public, with fans appreciating Grecia’s willingness to engage directly with Goyal’s business and her adaptation to Indian culture.This is not the first time Sudha Murty has appeared on Kapil Sharma’s platform. Last year, she joined The Kapil Sharma Show alongside filmmaker Guneet Monga and actress Raveena Tandon, where she shared personal anecdotes about her life and experiences. The audience was captivated by her wisdom and humility, as she recounted stories from her travels, including a memorable instance at an airport where she was labeled “cattle class” for wearing traditional attire. Sudha used humor to narrate her response, underscoring her pride in her cultural roots and her unshakeable confidence.In addition to her philanthropic and literary contributions, Sudha Murty’s previous appearance also revealed her admiration for Bollywood legends such as Shah Rukh Khan and Dilip Kumar, bridging the worlds of Indian cinema and literature.The teaser release has already stirred excitement among fans, who are eager to see the contrasting yet complementary dynamics of these two couples. While the Murthys are admired for their contributions to India’s technology and education sectors, Deepinder and Grecia have gained popularity as a young, modern couple who represent the global, interconnected nature of today’s India.Social media platforms have been abuzz with comments from viewers looking forward to the episode, with many expressing admiration for Sudha Murty’s humility and wit, and curiosity about Grecia’s adaptation to life in India. Fans also anticipate candid moments and stories from the lives of the Murthys and the Goyals, hoping for inspiring takeaways from both the established and next-generation leaders in India’s entrepreneurial landscape.","This weekend’s episode will feature NR Narayana Murthy and Sudha Murty, the celebrated founders of Infosys and well-known philanthropists.

Kunal Kamra’s appeal to Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari

“Minister @nitin_gadkari, please look at the plight of Indian customers. Their voices aren’t heard. They can’t get to work. They are taking bad loans to solve an issue that is primarily Ola’s responsibility. When will government agencies intervene?”

Kamra’s continued campaign for accountability

Ola’s defence and plans for improvement

In an escalating public dispute, comedian Kunal Kamra has openly criticised Ola Electric and its CEO, Bhavish Aggarwal , over service and maintenance issues concerning Ola’s electric scooters. Kamra, known for his outspoken style, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to highlight what he describes as subpar conditions at Ola service centres, urging Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari to intervene. Citing customer complaints about inadequate repairs and a lack of qualified technicians, Kamra raised concerns about the challenges faced by Ola electric scooter owners, particularly those who rely on these scooters for daily commutes. His campaign has brought attention to wider concerns in India's rapidly growing electric vehicle (EV) sector.Kamra’s concerns began surfacing online on October 6, when he posted an image showing rows of Ola scooters awaiting repair at an Ola service centre. The comedian questioned the state of Ola’s customer service, implying that Indian consumers’ grievances were not being adequately addressed. He called on other Ola scooter owners to share their experiences, aiming to highlight issues that he believes are being ignored by the company.One post by Kamra featured a retweet of a video from an Ola customer at a Solapur service centre, where Ola electric scooters were reportedly left unattended. The video depicted a backlog of scooters in need of repairs, and Kamra commented on the absence of skilled technicians to handle the volume of work, a claim echoed by multiple Ola customers. Kamra’s tweets have generated a wave of responses from users describing issues like delayed repairs, poor customer support, and malfunctioning vehicles, reflecting broader dissatisfaction among Ola’s user base.In a notable escalation, Kamra appealed directly to Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari to address the situation, calling for government oversight. His post read:Kamra’s request for intervention highlights the potential impact on Ola’s customers, many of whom depend on their scooters for work and daily life. By appealing to Gadkari, Kamra has aimed to elevate the discussion from a customer service issue to a matter of public interest, emphasising the need for accountability from Ola Electric as it expands in India’s EV market.In response to Kamra’s criticism, Bhavish Aggarwal dismissed Kamra’s post, suggesting it was a “paid tweet.” Taking a jab at the comedian, Aggarwal sarcastically invited Kamra to “come and help us out” at Ola, claiming that Kamra would be paid a higher salary than his earnings from comedy. The comment added a personal dimension to the dispute, with Aggarwal insinuating that Kamra’s complaints were financially motivated.Kamra responded to Aggarwal’s offer by humorously accepting the ""job"" at Ola and listing proposed action points for the company to address. Kamra’s “acceptance” of the role highlighted his call for customer-focused improvements, including full refunds for dissatisfied customers who had purchased an Ola scooter within the last four months.Kamra has continued his online campaign, demanding transparency and tangible action from Ola Electric. He posted a video that mocked Aggarwal’s response, suggesting that the CEO’s tone was dismissive and “arrogant.” Kamra’s posts included requests for the company to address unresolved customer complaints and improve its service infrastructure, which, according to him and other users, currently struggles to meet the demands of Ola’s expanding customer base.The comedian also nicknamed Aggarwal as “Olan Musk,” drawing a comparison to Elon Musk, the high-profile CEO known for his sometimes provocative social media presence. This comparison underscored Kamra’s view that Aggarwal’s responses were more focused on maintaining a public image than addressing customer issues. Kamra’s comments about “Olan Musk” have further fueled public interest, sparking discussions online about the responsibility of corporate leaders in emerging industries such as EVs.In the face of growing criticism, Bhavish Aggarwal has maintained that Ola is actively working to resolve customer service issues. Ola CFO Harish Abhichandani previously stated that “99% of customer complaints” have been addressed, though Kamra and others have questioned the accuracy of this claim. According to Aggarwal, Ola is expanding its service network and hiring additional technicians to clear the backlog and improve the availability of service resources.Ola also announced plans to increase its service centres nationwide, aiming to make repairs more accessible and reduce wait times. Aggarwal’s team asserts that Ola is committed to enhancing the customer experience, though complaints from users continue to surface online, challenging these statements.","Comedian Kunal Kamra has openly criticised Ola Electric and its CEO, Bhavish Aggarwal.

However, the company now has the opportunity to offer commitments to address the Commission's concerns before the investigation concludes.Corning's Alkali-aluminosilicate glass, marketed under the Gorilla Glass brand, is used to protect displays on most major smartphone brands. The material has become a standard feature in modern mobile devices due to its scratch and damage resistance properties.The Commission said it will carry out the investigation ""as a matter of priority,"" though no deadline has been set for its completion.","EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said the investigation aims to determine if Corning's practices have ""deprived consumers from cheaper and more break- resistant glass"" If found to have violated EU competition rules, Corning could face fines of up to 10% of its global annual revenue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115022207,imgsize-710285,width-400,resizemode-4/115022207.jpg"

Google reverse image search on WhatsApp: What to expect



WhatsApp is testing a new feature with its latest beta update that allows users to perform a reverse image search on Google for any image they receive. This feature, currently available in the beta version, aims to help users verify the authenticity and origin of images shared on the platform. Google's reverse image search functionality has been available for some time, enabling users to search the web for visually similar images. This can be helpful in determining if an image is original or has been previously shared online. By integrating this capability into WhatsApp, users can now easily check the source and context of images they receive, potentially combating misinformation and enhancing the overall security of the platform.According to a report by WABetaInfo, this feature is now available in build 2.24.23.13 on the Google Play Store for beta testers. This feature integrates with Google Search to help users verify the authenticity and origin of images.To use this new feature, users can tap the three-dot menu when viewing an image and select ""search on web” once it becomes available for them. This will send the image to Google Search for reverse image lookup, which can identify similar images and provide context.WhatsApp assures users that these images will remain confidential and is not shared with Meta or any other platform besides Google.While Google's Circle to Search already offers reverse image search functionality, WhatsApp's new in-app option provides a more direct and convenient way to verify images within the app. This feature, currently rolling out to beta users, is gradually becoming available to more users on the latest version.While the reverse image search feature is included in the latest WhatsApp beta build, its availability seems to be controlled by a server-side rollout. This means that even users on the latest version may not see the feature immediately. However, access is gradually expanding as more users gain the ""search on web"" functionality.","WhatsApp is testing a new feature with its latest beta update that allows users to perform a reverse image search on Google for any image they receive.

French and Dutch authorities raided Netflix offices in Paris and Amsterdam on Tuesday, November 5, as part of an investigation into alleged tax fraud and concealed employment, according to French judicial sources.The searches, conducted by France's National Financial Prosecutor's Office (PNF) and corruption investigators, stem from a preliminary investigation opened in November 2022 into suspected "" laundering of aggravated tax fraud "" and ""concealed work in an organised gang.""The raids follow scrutiny of Netflix's tax declarations between 2019 and 2020, when the company's reported French revenue appeared inconsistent with its subscriber base of approximately 7 million users. According to French media outlet La Lettre, Netflix Services France paid just €981,000 ($1.06 million) in corporate taxes for 2019-2020.Netflix's declared turnover in France increased dramatically after 2020, rising from €47.1 million ($51.3 million) to €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) in 2022, suggesting the company may have previously used tax optimization strategies through its Dutch (Netherlands) subsidiary.The simultaneous searches at Netflix's European headquarters in Amsterdam were conducted through cooperation between French and Dutch authorities that has been ongoing for several months, officials said.This is not Netflix's first tax-related issue in Europe. In 2022, the streaming giant paid €55.8 million ($59.1 million) to settle a tax dispute with Italian authorities.Netflix, which opened its Paris office in 2020 and employs around 40 staff there, has not responded to requests for comment on the raids.

Donald Trump on H-1B visas and Green Card

US Election Results 2024: The day of reckoning has come. The counting is live in a historic presidential contest between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Electoral surveys across seven crucial states, also called Swing states, -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin -- suggest a close fight between Harris and Trump. There are various ways and things that the election of Donald Trump or Kamala Harris to US President may impact India and Indians. This includes areas like trade, immigration and more. One of the biggest things that may affect Indians is the stance of the duo on H-1B visa. For those unaware, an H-1B visa is a nonimmigrant visa that allows employers to temporarily hire foreign professionals in specialty occupations in the United States. So, here's who said what on H-1B visa:Harris has consistently advocated for more inclusive immigration policies. So it is likely that she would likely implement reforms aimed at expanding opportunities for immigrants and international students. Harris also supports expanded work authorisation for H-1B visa holders’ spouses. However, what she remains mum on are the matter of country-specific caps on green cards.During her 2019 campaign, Harris endorsed lifting these caps, acknowledging that over 95% of green card applicants are from India, China, the Philippines, and Vietnam. There has been no change in this policy during Joe Biden's tenure.Donald Trump's first term saw attempts to restrict the H-1B visa programme by narrowing eligibility criteria and increasing scrutiny of applications. His re-election means more regulations, such as higher wage requirements for H-1B holders to ensure that these positions do not displace American workers. At the same time, in a surprising shift from his usual hardline stance on immigration, Trump expressed his desire to grant automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from US colleges. During an interview on the ""All-In"" podcast, in July, Trump said, ""What I want to do and what I will do is, you graduate from a college, I think you should get a green card automatically as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country."" He extended this proposal to include graduates from two-year junior colleges and doctoral programs.Trump's changed stance is a boost for Indian students studying in US colleges. Trump further highlighted the loss of talent due to current visa policies, saying, ""I know of stories where people graduated from a top college, or from a college, and they desperately want to stay here... and they can't. They go back to India, they go back to China. They do the same basic company in those places and they become multibillionaires employing thousands and thousands of people.""","The election of Donald Trump or Kamala Harris to US President may impact India and Indians.

Trump presidency may ease regulatory pressure on Musk’s empire

Tesla CEO Elon Musk could gain significant advantages if former President Donald Trump returns to the White House, reports NBC News. Musk, who is openly supporting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, the report says, could also play an influential role in a second Trump administration.Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign senior adviser, told NBC News that Trump wants Musk to lead a “commission” that will “ensure our government works more efficiently and uses America’s taxpayer dollars effectively.” “As President Trump has said, Elon Musk is a genius, an innovator, and has literally made history by building creative, modern, and efficient systems,” he added.Trump has been open about his intent to maintain low tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals like Musk. During his previous tenure, he lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% in 2017. In April, he told wealthy donors in Palm Beach, Florida, that he hopes to extend the tax cuts from his prior administration.While tax burdens for individual corporations and high earners vary depending on deductions and tax strategies, Trump’s plan would keep a reduced rate for the highest-income earners, with his 2017 law having lowered the top income tax rate from 39.6% to 37%. According to a September report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, extending Trump’s tax cuts for another 10 years would direct 41% of the benefits toward high-income households through rate cuts, special deductions, and inheritance tax reductions. (The Trump campaign has not yet responded to the report.)With Trump being elected as US president for the second term, Elon Musk’s SpaceX is projected to keep securing billions annually in government contracts, including deals with the Defense Department and NASA. SpaceX remains NASA's sole option for transporting astronauts to and from the International Space Station, as Boeing's Starliner spacecraft faces ongoing issues.Elon Musk has engaged in at least 19 regulatory and legal disputes with the Biden administration and federal agencies over recent years, NBC News reports. These 19 cases involve 12 different government entities and cover a range of issues—from environmental concerns at a SpaceX launch site near a Texas wildlife refuge to alleged racial harassment at a California Tesla factory and Tesla’s marketing of its driver-assistance software as “full self-driving” despite needing human oversight.Beyond his business empire, Musk’s America PAC is also facing legal challenges, including one with Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner over $1 million daily prize giveaways by the PAC. On Monday, a judge refused to block the cash prizes.Angela Aneiros, a law professor at Gonzaga University and co-director of its Center for Law, Ethics & Commerce said “A second Trump term could reshape the regulatory landscape in ways that benefit Musk’s companies,”. If Trump returns, she added, federal agencies may shift away from investigating regulatory compliance and prioritize issues like immigration enforcement instead.",Tesla CEO Elon Musk could gain significant advantages if former President Donald Trump returns to the White House.

Hi Googlers,

Tomorrow is election day here and many in the U.S. will be heading to the polls to vote for everything from school board to judges to the Congress and President.

Teams across Google and YouTube have been working hard to make sure our platforms provide voters with high-quality and reliable information, just as we’ve done for so many other elections around the world — in fact, dozens of countries have held major, hotly contested elections this year, from France to India to the UK to Mexico and many more, with well over a billion people casting votes in 2024.

We should be proud of our work, and also of our teams’ efforts to keep campaigns secure, to deliver accurate information on where and how to vote, and to provide digital advertising solutions to campaigns. Thanks to everyone working around the clock on these efforts throughout the campaign season and as votes are tallied.

As with other elections, the outcome will be a major topic of conversation in living rooms and other places around the world. And of course, the outcome will have important consequences.

Whomever the voters entrust, let’s remember the role we play at work, through the products we build and as a business: to be a trusted source of information to people of every background and belief. We will and must maintain that. In that spirit, it’s important that everyone continue to follow our Community Guidelines and Personal Political Activity Policy.

Beyond election day, our work to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful will continue. Al has given us a profound opportunity to make progress on that mission, build great products and partnerships, drive innovation, and make significant contributions to national and local economies. Our company is at its best when we’re focused on that.

Thanks, Sundar

Google has won a lawsuit over Google Play gift card scams with a judge ruling that the tech company is not liable for losses incurred by such fraud. A lawsuit claimed that the search giant illegally profited from gift card scams by refusing to refund victims.Citing a decision by US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman, news agency Reuters reported that the plaintiff, Judy May, has failed to demonstrate that Google caused her losses or knowingly received stolen funds. May lost $1,000 in a scam where she was tricked into buying Google Play gift cards.The judge also determined that Google was not liable for retaining its standard commissions –15% to 30% – on purchases made with the gift cards, as this practice was unrelated to the initial fraud.While Freeman dismissed the lawsuit, she granted May the option to refile her case. However, a claim for triple damages was permanently dismissed, the report said.A class action lawsuit against Google was filed earlier this year, alleging that the tech giant illegally profited from gift card scams by refusing to refund victims.The lawsuit stemmed from a $1,000 loss suffered by Indiana resident Judy May, who fell victim to a scammer posing as a relative. The scammer convinced May to purchase Google Play gift cards under the pretence of securing federal grant money. May provided the gift card codes to the scammer, who then used them to make purchases.A class action complaint claimed that “over nearly a decade, Google has knowingly kept millions of dollars in stolen money from victims of gift card scams who purchased Google Play gift cards.”The lawsuit argued that Google should have warned consumers about scams on gift card packaging andthat anyone demanding payment with the cards was a scammer. She also accused the company of profiting from the fraudulent activity by keeping commissions on purchases made with stolen gift cards.","Judy May lost $1,000 in a scam where she was tricked into buying Google Play gift cards.

In the lead-up to the election, Lina Khan , chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), has faced criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. Prominent Democratic donors, including billionaires Reid Hoffman, Barry Diller, and Mark Cuban, have called for her removal from the agency. More recently, a report from the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee accused her of pursuing a far-left agenda and weaponizing the FTC. Elon Musk, the biggest supporter of Donald Trump 's in Silicon Valley, wrote on Twitter that Khan ""will be fired soon.""A report in the New York Times talks about how Khan, nominated in 2021 by President Joe Biden , became one of the hottest topics of the US Elections 2024. At 35, she is the youngest-ever chairman of FTC.She reportedly has become a focal point of bipartisan attention. This level of scrutiny is said to be unusual for a leader of the FTC, which typically operates under the radar while regulating companies that undermine competition. The NYT report said that the intense focus on Khan reflects the high stakes of the Biden administration's efforts to curb the power of America's largest corporations, a programme that could be reversed by the next president.Dwelling further the report adds that FTC and Justice Department scrutiny has led to the collapse of several major corporate deals, with lawsuits potentially breaking up big brands like Google, Amazon, and Ticketmaster's parent company. Khan has advocated for regulating artificial intelligence, ordered companies to simplify online subscription cancellations, and banned noncompete agreements that prevent workers from joining rival employers.The business community and its Washington allies have fiercely opposed Khan's actions. Representative James Comer, R-Ky., reportedly criticized her leadership, claiming she would stop at nothing to achieve the radical left's goals. Amazon and Meta have called for her recusal from investigations and lawsuits due to her previous criticisms. Lobbying groups have complained that her actions are chilling the economy.In a September interview with The New York Times, Khan acknowledged the criticism but dismissed much of it, emphasizing the importance of considering diverse voices and keeping the entire country in mind. She expressed uncertainty about her future in a ""60 Minutes"" interview, stating it would be an honor to continue in her role.Many observers expect Trump to replace Khan if he wins the election, as presidents typically appoint leaders from their own party to agencies like the FTC. Former FTC chair Bill Kovacic believes Khan's tenure would be short-lived under a Trump administration. Khan's fate under Vice President Kamala Harris is less certain, as her term expired in September. The next president could replace her by appointing a new chair or designating one of the other commissioners.Khan, who gained prominence as a scholar advocating for stricter antitrust laws against companies like Amazon, became the youngest leader of the FTC in its history. She revived an FTC lawsuit to break up Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, and sued Amazon for allegedly monopolizing online retail. The FTC also unsuccessfully attempted to block Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard and is fighting to block Kroger's $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons.","Lina Khan, 35, is the youngest-ever chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.

Tech CEOs who have not openly announced their support

The United States is witnessing one of the most tightly contested elections in recent history. Analysts suggest a near photo finish between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Some have even hinted that national polls may see a near tie, with slight variations between states. The US election 2024 is widely regarded as one of the most divisive in American history. Both Harris and Trump have repeatedly warned against potentially catastrophic consequences if the other is elected. Voters too are said to hold vastly different views on key issues such as the economy, immigration, and abortion rights. As the elections reach the finishing line, here's a look at the biggest supporters of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in Silicon Valley, as well as those who didn't openly share their allegiance with either of them.Tech entrepreneur Mark Cuban, widely known for his role as a judge on the reality show Shark Tank, has publicly endorsed Kamala Harris, citing her non-ideological stance. Cuban, who supported Trump in 2015, believes a second Trump administration would be detrimental to small businesses.Another staunch supporter of Kamala Harris is Vinod Khosla. The prominent Silicon Valley investor with stakes in startups like DoorDash, Stripe, and Instacart has openly declared his support for Harris.Facebook's former COO Sheryl Sandberg endorsed Harris shortly after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race.

No Diwali cheer in India's smartwatch market; Apple and Samsung the only exceptions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/no-diwali-cheer-in-indias-smartwatch-market-apple-and-samsung-the-only-exceptions/articleshow/114981753.cms,"A Sectoral Slowdown

Apple and Samsung seeing growth

India's wearable market, particularly mass-segment smartwatches, has faced a significant downturn over the past year, despite the festive season's traditional boost. This trend is reflected in the financial performance of two of the major players like Boat and Boult. According to a report in Economic Times, ""The festive season failed to arrest a downturn in India’s wearables market, particularly mass-segment smartwatches, over the last 12-15 months even as its impact has become visible in the financials of device makers.""Warburg Pincus-backed Boat, while reducing its losses by 48%, saw a decline in its FY24 revenue. Conversely, Boult witnessed a halving of its profits due to increased spending on growth initiatives.The broader wearables segment, encompassing wireless audio devices and smartwatches, experienced a 10% year-on-year decline in shipments during the April-June quarter. This downturn, attributed to cautious inventory management and fewer new product launches, has disproportionately affected the smartwatch category. The homegrown wearable and audio products firm recorded a 5% decline in revenue for the fiscal year ended March 2024 to Rs 3,122 crore.Anshika Jain, senior research analyst at data analytics firm Counterpoint, told Economic Times, “During this festive period, India’s smartwatch sales have remained sluggish, extending the downward trend from the previous quarter.” “We anticipate a double-digit year-over-year decline in sales, attributed to limited discounts and changing consumer behaviour,” she added.A 30% decline is anticipated in smartwatch shipments in the September quarter, she said. “Consumers are not replacing smartwatches as quickly as the industry had anticipated,” Jain said, adding that this led to inventory pile-up of these products. Industry analysts predict a continued decline in smartwatch shipments, particularly in the mass-market segment.The audio products category appears to be better. Here the mass market managed to sustain growth. The true wireless(TWS) audio segment, dominated by wireless earphones and headsets, remains a bright spot. Companies are focusing on introducing advanced features like active noise cancellation at more affordable price points to drive growth. Offline expansion and the emergence of quick commerce channels are playing a crucial role in shaping the wearable market. Companies like Boult are leveraging these channels to boost sales and reach a wider audience.While the mass market is seeing growth pains, the premium segment, driven by new releases from Samsung and Apple, is expected to witness substantial growth. ""The premium segment is projected to experience significant growth, fuelled by new releases from Samsung and Apple, along with discounts on older models,” Jain said.","Boat, while reducing its losses by 48%, saw a decline in its FY24 revenue.

Sony sues CBS; blames job cuts at Paramount Global for ‘dismal performance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sony-sues-cbs-blames-job-cuts-at-paramount-global-for-dismal-performance/articleshow/114981717.cms,"Sony Pictures Television has filed a lawsuit against CBS Studios, alleging the network has failed to maximise revenues and engaged in self-dealing in its distribution of popular game shows ""Jeopardy!"" and ""Wheel of Fortune.""The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims CBS has made over $1 billion in profit from a 35-year distribution agreement while undervaluing the shows' licensing fees and advertising potential. Sony argues that CBS's recent corporate restructuring and layoffs have severely impacted its ability to properly distribute the programs.According to the complaint, CBS entered unauthorised international distribution deals in Australia and New Zealand, pocketing $3.6 million in fees without proper compensation to Sony. The studio also alleges CBS has been licensing the shows domestically below market value and bundling them with less popular CBS-owned programs like ""The Hot Bench"" and ""The Drew Barrymore Show.""Sony claims that when it became directly involved in negotiations with ABC stations, licensing fees grew by 17%, compared to CBS' projected flat to 2% growth. The lawsuit cites recent layoffs at CBS parent Paramount Global , which eliminated 2,800 positions, as contributing to ""dismal performance"" in fulfilling distribution obligations.CBS strongly denied the allegations in a statement, saying it has been an ""accomplished distribution partner and thoughtful steward"" for both shows over 40 years. The network argues it holds perpetual distribution rights and claims Sony ""simply doesn't like the deal the parties agreed to decades ago.""","Sony Pictures Television has filed a lawsuit against CBS Studios.

China's Alibaba cuts more jobs as part of broader restructuring effort,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinas-alibaba-cuts-more-jobs-as-part-of-broader-restructuring-effort/articleshow/114981428.cms,"Not the First Job Cuts

Financial Pressures

Competition Heats Up

Chinese giant Alibaba Group has laid off a significant number of employees at Yuanjing, its division dedicated to the Metaverse. This move signals a scaling back of the company's ambitions in the virtual world, according to sources cited by the South China Morning Post.The layoffs are reported to be part of a broader restructuring effort focused on optimizing efficiency within Alibaba. Established in 2021, Yuanjing aimed to capitalize on the Metaverse's potential, joining other Chinese tech giants like Tencent, ByteDance, Kuaishou, and Li Auto in the race to explore this virtual space.Incidentally, Alibaba's scaling back of its metaverse ambitions isn't an isolated event. It reflects a trend within the global tech industry where companies are reevaluating their investments in the nascent metaverse space.The recent layoffs, first reported by Chinese media on November 1, affect operations in Shanghai and Hangzhou. This isn't Alibaba's first workforce reduction – in February 2023, the company let go of over 4,000 employees. The year before, a larger workforce reduction of approximately 19,000 employees took place as Alibaba adapted to a challenging global economic climate and prioritized cost-efficiency.Alibaba's recent financial performance has also played a role in the metaverse retreat. The company missed market expectations for its first-quarter revenue in August 2024. This shortfall reflects declining domestic e-commerce sales as Chinese consumers tighten their spending due to a faltering economy.Alibaba also faces intense competition from rivals like JD.com and discount-oriented retail platforms such as Pinduoduo (PDD Holdings) and Douyin (owned by ByteDance). The company's revenue of 243.24 billion yuan ($33.98 billion) for the quarter ending June 30th, 2024 fell short of analysts' expectations, highlighting the competitive landscape of the Chinese tech industry.","Alibaba Group has laid off a significant number of employees at Yuanjing, its division dedicated to the Metaverse.

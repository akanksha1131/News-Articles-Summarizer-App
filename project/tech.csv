How new EU e-commerce rules may bring ‘bad news’ for China's biggest online shopping platforms Shein and Temu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-new-eu-e-commerce-rules-may-bring-bad-news-for-chinas-biggest-online-shopping-platforms-shein-and-temu/articleshow/117956228.cms,"The European Commission is strengthening customs controls on parcels from China, targeting online retailers like Shein and Temu. They aim to curb dangerous products entering the EU and propose eliminating customs duty exemptions for items valued under 150 euros. Enhanced market surveillance and collaboration with national customs authorities will ensure compliance and address safety concerns.

Threefold increase in low-value parcels entering the EU

Action against Temu last year

The European Commission is tightening customs controls on parcels arriving from China from online retailers such as Shein and Temu . A European Union e-commerce action plan -- ‘A Comprehensive EU Toolbox for Safe and Sustainable E-commerce' -- has been proposed with an aim to curb the influx of “dangerous products” into the EU market.The Commission is also urging EU lawmakers to eliminate the current exemption on customs duties for parcels valued under 150 euros, which allows foreign companies to sell goods cheaply within the bloc without paying import taxes.The Commission highlighted concerns that many of the billions of low-value products entering the EU annually do not comply with its safety and regulatory standards. This puts European businesses that adhere to these rules at a disadvantage against competitors selling unsafe or counterfeit goods.“The rise in e-commerce imports to the EU market has brought with it many challenges,” said European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen.“The EU is ready to address these challenges, coming together as Team Europe to make sure citizens and businesses can continue to enjoy the many benefits of online shopping, while minimising the risks of dangerous products that threaten the health and safety of consumers,” she added.According to a report by Politico, in 2024, 4.6 billion low-value parcels entered the EU, a threefold increase from the previous year. Over 91% of parcels valued under 150 euros originated from China, where companies like Shein and Temu manufacture and ship most of their products.Apart from calling on the EU lawmakers to remove the duty exemption on imports under 150 euros and suggesting imposing handling fees on retailers to cover the costs of ensuring compliance with EU regulations, the Commission announced it will collaborate with national customs authorities across the EU's 27 member states to focus on unsafe products sold online, including increased market surveillance and product testing.The Commission also informed Shein about the launch of a coordinated action.The EU executives also expressed concerns about the environmental impact of the surge in cheap imports, citing pollution from production and transport, as well as the challenges posed to European recycling systems by low-quality, toxic, or difficult-to-recycle products.Last October, the Commission initiated legal action against Temu, a Chinese online marketplace, over concerns about the sale of illegal products on its platform. A consumer group BEUC raised alarms about dangerous products sold by Temu, including unsafe children's toys, hazardous electric heaters, mislabeled sunscreens and cosmetics, and inadequate motorcycle helmets.",The European Commission is tightening customs controls on parcels arriving from China from online retailers such as Shein and Temu.

India is gearing up to make a significant breakthrough in high-end computing by developing its own Graphics Processing Unit ( GPU ) within the next three to five years, while also working on an indigenous foundational Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform expected to be ready in just 10 months. Union Minister for Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw made these announcements during the Budget Roundtable 2025, organized by India Today and Business Today.In a major step towards AI development, the government will roll out 18,000 high-end GPU-based computing facilities in the coming days, making advanced computing power accessible to researchers, startups, and academic institutions. This move is crucial for reducing India's reliance on foreign chip manufacturers, particularly Nvidia, which currently dominates over 80% of the global GPU market.With AI becoming a critical driver of global innovation, India’s efforts to develop self-sufficient semiconductor and AI ecosystems mark a pivotal shift. This article explores India’s GPU development strategy, AI advancements, computing infrastructure expansion, and the broader impact of these initiatives on the country’s technological future.Developing an advanced, high-performance GPU requires cutting-edge research, skilled engineering, and robust semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. According to Vaishnaw, India is considering multiple approaches to achieve this goal, including leveraging open-source GPU architectures, acquiring licensed chip designs, and innovating its own GPU technology from the ground up.Instead of designing a GPU entirely from scratch, India plans to build upon existing architectures—an approach widely followed worldwide. This strategic pathway enables faster development while reducing the technical and financial barriers that come with semiconductor manufacturing. If executed successfully, India could significantly reduce its dependency on foreign semiconductor companies, strengthening its position in the global high-performance computing industry.GPUs were initially designed for graphics rendering and multimedia processing but have now become indispensable for AI and machine learning applications. Unlike traditional Central Processing Units (CPUs), which handle sequential processing tasks, GPUs excel in parallel processing, making them ideal for training AI models, deep learning algorithms, and big data analytics.With AI-driven industries growing at an unprecedented pace, having a domestic GPU manufacturing ecosystem will give India a competitive edge in areas such as autonomous systems, scientific simulations, cybersecurity, and advanced analytics. By investing in indigenous GPU technology, India is preparing itself for the next era of digital innovation.In addition to hardware advancements, India is also working on its first AI foundational model, which is expected to be ready within 10 months. This initiative aims to enhance India’s AI capabilities across various sectors, including healthcare, education, governance, and defense. Unlike proprietary AI models developed by global tech giants like OpenAI (ChatGPT) and Google (Gemini), India’s AI platform will be tailored to local needs, linguistic diversity, and regional data privacy requirements.Vaishnaw noted that India has already witnessed success in small-scale AI deployments. For instance, Indian Railways improved its ticket confirmation rate by 27% using AI-driven predictive models. By expanding such AI applications, the government aims to foster innovation, increase efficiency, and create new opportunities for economic growth.Indian startups, researchers, and universities are actively studying international AI research papers to refine their models. Vaishnaw highlighted that Chinese AI company DeepSeek optimized AI training by leveraging mathematical research from as early as 2003 and 2005. Similarly, Indian researchers are analyzing open-source AI frameworks to build a cost-effective and efficient AI model that aligns with India's technological and economic priorities.Recognizing the high computational demands of AI research, the Indian government is rolling out 18,000 high-end GPUs for AI development. These GPUs will be accessible to startups, academic institutions, and enterprises, allowing them to conduct AI model training and large-scale data analysis.Vaishnaw confirmed that 10,000 GPUs are already available, with the remaining 8,000 set to be deployed within days. This initiative is crucial for ensuring that Indian developers and researchers have the necessary computational power to compete with global tech leaders. By providing affordable access to AI infrastructure, the government aims to create a level playing field for innovation.The government’s Make in India program has played a key role in boosting domestic electronics manufacturing, particularly in smartphone production. Over the past few years, India has transformed into a global hub for mobile phone assembly and component production, reducing import dependency.According to Vaishnaw, the mobile manufacturing industry has created 12 lakh (1.2 million) jobs, with India now producing essential smartphone components, including:Despite progress in electronics manufacturing, semiconductor production remains a major challenge. Vaishnaw acknowledged that India lost four decades (1950–1990) due to the License Raj, which restricted manufacturing growth. However, recent initiatives like the Semiconductor Mission , global partnerships with chip manufacturers (such as TSMC and Intel), and government incentives for fabless semiconductor startups are laying the foundation for India’s long-term semiconductor ambitions.By focusing on indigenous chip design, manufacturing capabilities, and R&D investment, India aims to reduce dependence on imported semiconductor technology and become a key player in the global semiconductor supply chain.","India is gearing up to make a significant breakthrough in high-end computing by developing its own Graphics Processing Unit ( GPU ) within the next three to five years.

DeepSeek source code can send data to Chinese company that America banned in 2019; called more dangerous than Tiktok,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deepseek-source-code-can-send-data-to-chinese-company-that-america-banned-in-2019-called-more-dangerous-than-tiktok/articleshow/117958865.cms,"DeepSeek

Ban on China Mobile





""DeepSeek more dangerous than TikTok""

Security researchers have discovered computer code on the website of Chinese AI company DeepSeek, whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the US, that could potentially send user login information to China Mobile, a state-owned telecommunications company barred from operating in the United States. The code, found within the chatbot's web login page, connects to infrastructure owned by China Mobile and appears to be part of the account creation and login process. The code linking DeepSeek to one of China Mobile was first discovered by Feroot Security , a Canadian cybersecurity company, which shared its findings with news agency The Associated Press (AP).This discovery is said to raise significant national security concerns for US officials, particularly given the increasing use of sensitive data in generative AI systems. Experts warn that this connection could expose personal and proprietary information, representing a potential intelligence goldmine for China. The implications are reportedly considered even greater than those associated with TikTok , as the information shared with AI systems often includes highly personal and sensitive business data.The US Federal Communications Commission unanimously denied China Mobile authority to operate in the United States in 2019, citing “substantial” national security concerns about links between the company and the Chinese state. In 2021, the Biden administration also issued sanctions limiting the ability of Americans to invest in China Mobile after the Pentagon linked it to the Chinese military.Feroot Security's findings were reportedly verified by two academic cybersecurity experts who confirmed the presence of China Mobile code within DeepSeek's login system. While testing in North America did not reveal data transfer to China Mobile, researchers could not rule out the possibility of such transfers for some users or under certain conditions. The analysis focused solely on the web version of DeepSeek; the mobile app, a top download on both Apple and Google app stores, was not analyzed.Experts like Ivan Tsarynny, CEO of Feroot, expressed disbelief that such a connection could be accidental, highlighting the numerous unusual aspects of the code. Stewart Baker, a former Department of Homeland Security and NSA official, emphasized that DeepSeek raises even greater concerns than TikTok, given the potentially more sensitive nature of the information involved. The code analysis suggests DeepSeek's login process may capture detailed device information, a common practice for security and verification purposes. However, the link to China Mobile raises questions about how this information might be used.","Chinese AI company DeepSeek's chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the US.

Experts do not rule out data transfer

Why this is ‘dangerous’

Security researchers have discovered computer code on DeepSeek 's website that is linked to China Mobile , a state-owned telecommunications company banned from operating in the US. The code may potentially send user login information to the telecom giant.According to a report by Fortune, the web login page for DeepSeek's chatbot contains an ‘hidden’ computer script that, when deciphered, reveals connections to computer infrastructure owned by China Mobile.This code appears to be part of the account creation and user login process for DeepSeek, researchers highlight.While DeepSeek's privacy policy acknowledges data storage on servers within China, the direct link to China Mobile raises new concerns about the extent of Chinese state involvement.Security researchers at Feroot Security , a Canadian cybersecurity firm, first identified the code linking DeepSeek to China Mobile. The codes were later analysed by Independent analysis who confirmed the presence of China Mobile code.“It’s hard to believe that something like this was accidental. There are so many unusual things to this. You know that saying ‘Where there’s smoke, there’s fire’? In this instance, there’s a lot of smoke,” said Ivan Tsarynny, CEO of Feroot.While researchers did not observe data being transferred to China Mobile during login tests in North America, they could not definitively rule out the possibility that data for some users might be transferred to the Chinese telecom company.Furthermore, this code was seen in DeepSeek website and not on mobile apps as they were not analysed.Experts warn that users share sensitive information with generative AI systems, including confidential business details and personal information. The potential for a geopolitical adversary to access such data raises significant national security concerns.This revelation comes as DeepSeek's chatbot has surged in popularity, becoming the most downloaded app in the US.In 2019, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rejected China Mobile's request to operate in the US, citing “substantial” national security concerns over its ties to the Chinese government.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Akash Bobba , a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Bobba, along with five other young engineers, was hired by Musk to modernise government systems, raising concerns about their lack of government experience and the potential security risks involved.Bobba, a graduate of UC Berkeley's elite Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (MET) program, has quickly risen through the ranks of Silicon Valley , securing internships at Meta, Palantir, and Bridgewater Associates.Known for his problem-solving skills, Bobba once rewrote an entire project overnight after a teammate accidentally deleted it just before a deadline. His former classmate Charis Zhang recalled the incident.“Let me tell you something about Akash. During a project at Berkeley, I accidentally deleted our entire codebase 2 days before the deadline. I panicked. Akash just stared at the screen, shrugged, and rewrote everything from scratch in one night—better than before. We submitted early and got first in the class. Many such stories. I trust him with everything I own,” wrote Zhang in a social media post.Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that granting individuals with limited government experience access to sensitive government systems poses significant security risks. The hiring strategy has also raised questions about the competence and oversight within Musk's DOGE initiative. Reports suggest that at least four of the new DOGE hires, including Bobba, now have top-tier access to federal IT systems.Bobba isn't the only new face in Musk's government overhaul. The five other members of the DOGE team comprise a mix of recent graduates, college students, and former SpaceX interns, all of whom now have official government emails and top-level security clearances.","Akash Bobba, a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE) Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate.

Ban on China's DeepSeek has started in the US of A. Texas is the first state in the United States of America (USA) to ban Chinese AI app DeepSeek AI. The Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued an order banning the Chinese-owned artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from all State-issued devices. This makes Texas the first State in the US to take such an action.Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued an order banning the Chinese app DeepSeek. Abbott cited concerns about the Chinese Communist Party's potential access to sensitive data of Americans through the AI app. ""Texas will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to infiltrate our state’s critical infrastructure through data-harvesting AI and social media apps,"" Abbott stated. He emphasized the need to protect state agencies and employees handling critical infrastructure, intellectual property, and personal information from ""malicious espionage operations."" “To achieve that mission, I ordered Texas state agencies to ban Chinese government-based AI and social media apps from all state-issued devices. State agencies and employees responsible for handling critical infrastructure, intellectual property, and personal information must be protected from malicious espionage operations by the Chinese Communist Party. Texas will continue to protect and defend our state from hostile foreign actors,” his statement saidIncidentally, Texas is the state that the world's richest man Elon Musk has moved his company SpaceX's headquarters to. In July last year, Elon Musk announced that he would officially move the headquarters of SpaceX and his social media site X from California to Texas.An upset Musk had then said that the move was in response to a California law prohibiting rules requiring teachers to notify parents if a child changes their name, pronouns, or gender identity at school.SpaceX workers living in Cameron County filed an official petition in January 2025 to hold an election on incorporation later in the month. The document proposes the initial plans for the town and if they translate into reality, Musk will have created history again. The petition outlines a community of roughly 500 residents. These include 219 primary residents and over 100 children. The proposed location, covering about 1.5 square miles, is near Boca Chica Beach at the end of State Highway 4. If approved, Starbase will be able to establish its own police and fire departments and enact its own ordinances.The Chinese AI app DeepSeek gained attention recently for outperforming OpenAI at a much lower cost. However, it has also raised security concerns due to reports of user data being collected and stored in China. Chinese law mandates that companies share data with the government upon request, raising fears about potential access to American user data by the Chinese Communist Party. The US Navy has also blocked DeepSeek due to these concerns.In addition to DeepSeek, the order prohibits several other Chinese social media platforms, including RedNote and Lemon8. It also extends to apps associated with the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party, such as Webull, Tiger Brokers, and Moomoo.

PANIC in the Caribbean nation

Prime Minister Reuben Meade says should be thankful to Jeff Bezos

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and fiancee Lauren Sanchez 's recent visit to the Caribbean island of Montserrat aboard his $500 million superyacht, ""Koru,"" reportedly sparked alarm among locals who feared the billionaire was scouting land for purchase. According to a report in Daily Mail, Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's visit on January 6, part of a Caribbean tour that also included St.Kitts and Nevis and St. Barts, prompted a town hall meeting and forced the Prime Minister to address the community's concerns.Locals worried that the world's second-richest man, worth $250 billion, was in Montserrat for business. These concerns were amplified at a United Alliance town hall meeting where Bezos' presence was a key topic. One community member expressed apprehension about the mogul's intentions.Bezos's ""Koru,"" a 417-foot, three-masted sailing yacht built in the Netherlands in 2021, drew considerable attention, with residents sharing photos and videos of the vessel on social media. While some worried about land acquisition, others saw the visit as a potential opportunity for the island, suggesting Bezos could be asked for assistance with local projects like the port or hospital. Some residents also hoped the visit would boost tourism.Prime Minister Reuben Meade, 70, attempted to quell these fears, clarifying that Bezos was visiting as a tourist. ""He came here as a tourist,"" Meade stated, emphasizing the separation between Bezos's personal and business activities. He further explained that Bezos couldn't purchase land without government approval, requiring an ""alien land holding license,"" ensuring transparency in any potential business dealings. ""They can't do anything unless they register a business or seek a license to do business. We will know what is happening when the time is right,"" Meade reassured the public. He emphasized respecting Bezos's privacy during his visit.'We're not going to nosy in a person's business. He comes here. He comes here as a tourist. He spends money in Montserrat. Thank God he's spending some money in Montserrat,' Meade said.Montserrat is widely known as 'The Emerald Isle of the Caribbean 'Montserrat, known as ""The Emerald Isle of the Caribbean,"" boasts a population of approximately 4,386. Despite its beauty and growing tourism sector, parts of the island remain uninhabitable due to past volcanic activity, including the now-buried capital, Plymouth.

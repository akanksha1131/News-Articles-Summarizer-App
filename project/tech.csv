Dubai-based siblings who own JioHotstar domain have this ‘take it or leave it’ offer for Team Reliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dubai-based-siblings-who-own-jiohotstar-domain-have-this-take-it-or-leave-it-offer-for-team-reliance/articleshow/115159221.cms,"How JioHotstar domain went to Dubai siblings

Here’s what they wrote on website

Hello, everyone! We hope you are doing well. Today, we want to share an important update about jiohotstar.com, a domain we bought some time ago. For those who don’t know, we bought this domain from a young developer in Delhi to help him with his education. This was part of our efforts to support and uplift others.

Recently, we received many emails from people wanting to buy the domain. To check if these offers were real, we reached out to some of them. We found that while some offers were fake, a few were serious and offered a lot of money. But even with these genuine offers, we never wanted to sell the domain. We made this clear by replying to everyone that the domain was not for sale.

Over the last few weeks, there has been a lot of talk and even some videos about why we own the domain and if it connects to a possible business deal between Jio and Hotstar. We want to clear up any confusion: we never expected this attention and never meant to cause any controversy. Our only goal was to support the developer and share our seva (service) journey.

With all the discussions happening, we now think it might be best for Team Reliance to have this domain, if they want it. We are happy to give jiohotstar.com to them for free, with all the proper paperwork. To be clear, this is entirely our choice. No one from Reliance or any legal group has contacted us or pressured us in any way. We made this decision on our own, without any pressure from friends, family, or anyone else.

If Reliance is interested, they can contact us at jainam@1xl.com or jivika@1xl.com, and we will handle the transfer smoothly. If they are not interested, that’s okay too. We will continue to share updates about our journey and work.

To all influencers and media, we ask for your help in spreading the word about SevakArmy.com, our mission to bring together volunteers. Our goal is simple but powerful: we want 100,000 people to volunteer just 20 hours a year. This would add up to 2 million hours of service in the first year—like having 1,000 people working full-time for a year to help NGOs. Imagine the positive impact we could make together!

Thank you for reading. We look forward to continuing our journey with all of you. Jai Jinendra!

From Jainam & Jivika

The saga of owning the JioHotstar .com domain just took an unexpected twist. Dubai siblings – Jainam and Jivika, who purchased it from a Delhi-based app developer have now said that they are willing to ‘give’ the domain to ‘Team Reliance ’ for free.Sharing an update on the website, the two wrote “With all the discussions happening, we now think it might be best for Team Reliance to have this domain, if they want it. We are happy to give jiohotstar.com to them for free, with all the proper paperwork.”The drama around the Jiohotstar.com domain unfolded last month when a Delhi-based app developer posted a letter publicly – asking the company to fund his higher studies in exchange for him giving up the domain for Rs 1 crore. ""My intention of buying this domain was simple: if this merger happens, I might be able to fulfill my dream of studying at Cambridge,"" said the developer then.When Reliance declined his offer, the developer sold the domain to siblings from Dubai, UAE. The siblings say that their “only goal was to support the developer and share our seva (service) journey” and “that the domain was not for sale.”“Recently, we received many emails from people wanting to buy the domain. To check if these offers were real, we reached out to some of them. We found that while some offers were fake, a few were serious and offered a lot of money.

Elon Musk just added to his fan following in India with these 'comments' on Canada PM Justin Trudeau,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-just-added-to-his-fan-following-in-india-with-these-comments-on-canada-pm-justin-trudeau/articleshow/115152894.cms,"What Elon Musk wrote on Canada PM Justin Trudeau

Why many Indians will agree with his criticism of Canada PM Justin Trudeau

Tesla CEO Elon Musk may have just given a massive boost to his popularity in India. Reason is what can be termed as 'trolling' of Canada PM Justin Trudeau . In the past few days Elon Musk has replied to or quoted posts on X, formerly Twitter, that criticise Canada PM Trudeau.What makes his comments more important is the role he is likely to play in the US government after Donald Trump's return as the US President. Elon Musk played a very important part in US President-Elect Donald Trump's win. He campaigned extensively for him both online and offline, even participating in some road shows.A user going by the name 'Truthful' shared a graph on Twitter showing how Canada's GDP per capita has fallen under PM Trudeau with a ""LOL"" (laugh out loud) message on top. Elon Musk quoted the same message and wrote ""Wow"".Earlier this week, Tesla CEO had written that Justin Trudeau would lose his position as Canada's Prime Minister in the next election in response to a Twitter user's comment. Just a day after US elections results (November 7), a user on Twitter told Musk, “we need your help in Canada getting rid of Trudeau.” Responding to the post, Musk said, “He will be gone in the upcoming election.” TThe prediction comes as Trudeau prepares to face electoral challenges from Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party and Jagmeet Singh's New Democratic Party.These comments are not the first time that Elon Musk has criticised the Canadian government. Earlier too he had expressed dismay over the approach to free speech, particularly regarding new regulations requiring online streaming services to register for government oversight.The diplomatic relations between India and Canada have deteriorated significantly under PM Justin Trudeau's government. India has expressed serious concerns about extremism and anti-India activities in Canada, urging Canadian authorities to address these issues.The relationship recently nosedived after Canadian officials claimed Indian government's hand in the death of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. This diplomatic tension has resulted in India withdrawing its High Commissioner from Canada. ""The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone,"" said foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal in October after the Canadian PM alleged that he had ""credible allegations"" of India's involvement in Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing.Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently also condemned the ""deliberate attack"" on a Hindu temple in Canada, expressing concern about the ""cowardly attempts to intimidate"" Indian diplomats. He stated that New Delhi expects Canadian authorities to ensure justice and maintain law and order.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk may have just given a massive boost to his popularity in India.

The duo used fake identities and addresses to place orders, then swapped valuable items like cameras with fakes during delivery, exploiting loopholes in the system.

Here’s how they duped Amazon

How the two got arrested

Network spread across 8 states

Two men have been accused of scamming Amazon out of cameras, iPhones , and other expensive items worth lakhs of rupees. They allegedly tricked delivery partners to receive these valuable products without payment, reports Deccan Herald. Urwa police have reportedly arrested the duo, identified by Commissioner of Police Anupam Agrawal as Raj Kumar Meena (23) and Subhash Gurjar (27) from Rajasthan.As per the report, the duo ordered goods from Amazon worth Rs 11,45,000 using fake identities. These include two high-value Sony cameras and 10 other items.The scam started with the duo placing an order with Amazon under the false name ‘Amith’. They provided a fake address near KSRTC bus stand, Mangaluru and a fake contact number. Upon delivery of the items, one of them distracted the delivery executive, while the other discreetly swapped the labels on the boxes with those of other items in the order.Raj Kumar then provided an incorrect OTP, creating a delay in the delivery. Using the same tactic, he would tell the delivery executive that they would pick up the order the next day. The delivery executive, clueless of the switch, would unknowingly leave with incorrect items from the 12-item order.Next day, the duo would cancel the order, retaining the original items with them.Amazon’s delivery partner Mahindra Logistics got suspicious of the stickers and reported it to Amazon. Consequently, a probe was launched which found that the accused had replaced original Sony cameras with fake items.An investigation by Urwa Police then identified their pattern and were caught while trying to leave the city.One of the accused Raj Kumar Meena has previously been arrested in a similar fraud case that involved a camera order from Amazon on October 4. The Urwa police took him to custody on October 18.Police believe that the accused may be involved in defrauding e-commerce platforms of goods worth over Rs 1.29 crore, including fraud orders of cameras and iPhones. There are 11 cases against the duo that are registered in different states – Assam, Odisha, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Kerala.","Two men from Rajasthan, Raj Kumar Meena and Subhash Gurjar, were arrested in Mangaluru for allegedly defrauding Amazon of over ₹1 crore worth of electronics.

Why government is extra cautious on security

The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk 's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon before approving their satellite communication services in India. According to a report in Economic Times, both companies are expected to provide detailed compliance information regarding data security, coverage area, and other key parameters.While Bharti-backed OneWeb and Reliance Jio 's partnership with SES have already secured approval, Starlink and Amazon's applications are still pending due to the additional security checks.Officials aware of the details told ET that letters to both the US-based firms were sent recently and the department is awaiting their reply. ""Their applications can be processed only after they submit the compliance. The firms have so far not replied,"" said a person familiar with the details.Another official said that the government will wait for some more time for their reply, but the applications won't be processed till they agree to all the security conditions. ""There are various security-related compliances as well as those related to data, coverage area etc which satcom providers have to give to the government in order to offer services in India. All the boxes need to be ticked,"" said a third official.As per security requirements, the terminals have to stop communicating if there is a change in latitude and longitude position in order to prevent any misuse. In its replies to the government, Starlink had reportedly given a declaration that none of its investors were from countries sharing a land border with India -- primarily China and Pakistan. The government had accepted that declaration.The government's cautious approach is driven by concerns over potential security risks, especially given the strategic importance of satellite communications. The DoT is particularly interested in ensuring that satellite terminals near border areas are securely monitored and controlled to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is currently working on recommendations for pricing and other terms and conditions for allocating satellite spectrum. However, traditional telecom operators like Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea are advocating for a level playing field, arguing that satellite companies should be subject to the same regulations and liabilities as terrestrial operators.",The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon.

Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha Murthy, recently shared some insights from their lives. The couple were the star guests on the popular talk show The Great Indian Kapil Sharma Show where they delighted the audience with candid, humorous stories from their personal lives.One of the show’s highlights was Narayana Murthy’s funny confession about forgetting their 25th wedding anniversary. He recalled, “One morning, Sudha asked me, ‘Is there anything special today?’ I replied, ‘No, nothing,’ and went to the office. As I was getting in the car, she asked again, ‘Think of anything special today?’ I still didn’t realize.”Later that day, while heading to Mumbai, Murthy received a call from their daughter, Akshata Murty, who was studying at Stanford University at the time. This is how the conversation went:“She asked, ‘What are you doing?’ I told her I was catching a flight. She immediately said, ‘Cancel it, get the first flight back to Bangalore, and wish your wife a happy anniversary!’”Narayana Murthy shared that he told her about a speech at 3pm but Akshata insisted, “I don’t care if you have a speech at 3 pm. If you need to hire a private plane, hire it, but come back and wish her!” Their daughter, Akshata Murty, is now married to former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.Sudha Murthy also chimed in, laughing, “It was our 25th wedding anniversary so it doesn’t happen every year. So I thought, let me give him a cue but it did not work… For five-ten minutes I felt bad because I’m also human. But my daughter was very upset, she went ‘In America this never happens!’, but I went ‘India main it happens though’, who can remember these things??”","Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha, recently shared some insights from their lives.

Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency (ANIF), Baltasar Ebang Engonga , is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos allegedly involving him in intimate encounters with multiple individuals. Originally investigated for alleged fraud, Engonga now faces public backlash and intensified scrutiny over his professional conduct and personal life. This controversy has sparked widespread reaction on social media and raised questions regarding ethics, public responsibility, and potential health risks associated with his actions. As the scandal unfolds, government authorities have initiated an official investigation, underscoring the increasing call for accountability among public officials in Equatorial Guinea.The scandal began when investigators, initially looking into Engonga for suspected fraud, reportedly discovered over 400 videos on his computer depicting private interactions with various individuals. These encounters allegedly involved multiple partners, including his brother’s wife, a cousin, and a relative of the President. According to sources, the videos were filmed in locations such as Engonga’s office, hotels, and even restrooms, with all recorded interactions believed to be consensual.Once leaked, the videos rapidly circulated across social media, sparking outrage and debate among citizens. Public response to the videos has varied, with many questioning the ethical standards of a high-ranking public official engaging in such activities, while others raised concerns about the privacy breach that led to the leak. Posts across social platforms criticised the conduct of a figure responsible for financial investigations, with some users highlighting the discrepancy between his public role and personal actions.In response to the viral scandal, Equatorial Guinea’s Attorney General’s Office, led by Anatolio Nzang Nguema, launched an official investigation into the circumstances surrounding the video leak. According to a spokesperson, authorities are assessing whether Engonga’s actions may have posed health risks, which could result in additional charges if confirmed.“If proven, he could face charges for endangering public health,” the spokesperson commented, emphasising that the investigation will extend beyond the videos themselves to assess any potential impact on public health.This probe into health risks marks a significant expansion of the investigation, as the Attorney General’s office examines both the privacy concerns involved in the leak and the broader implications of Engonga’s behaviour on public welfare. The investigation is expected to review the conduct of government officials and enforce measures to maintain accountability.In a public statement, Vice President Teodoro Nguema took to X (formerly Twitter) to address the scandal, emphasising the need for accountability among public officials. Nguema noted that government offices must be strictly reserved for official duties, signalling disapproval of the misuse of government resources and office spaces for personal purposes.Nguema announced that the government would be implementing new, stricter policies to ensure that misconduct within the administration is met with serious disciplinary action. He further stated that officials found guilty of misusing their authority or resources could face termination or other consequences as deemed appropriate. This stance reflects a broader governmental shift towards enforcing ethical standards and reinforces the message that public officials will be held responsible for their actions, especially when it comes to misuse of office privileges.Engonga, a married man and father of six, holds a prominent position at ANIF, leading financial investigations and initiatives against corruption. However, his involvement in the leaked videos has placed his career and reputation under intense public scrutiny. The scandal has opened a wider debate on the expectations placed on public officials, with many citizens questioning whether private conduct should impact public responsibility and ethical standards.As public opinion continues to weigh in, some have called for Engonga’s resignation, while others argue that privacy should protect personal matters unless they directly impact professional duties. The case has ignited a conversation on the balance between privacy and public accountability, particularly when it comes to those in leadership roles within the government.","Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency, Baltasar Ebang Engonga, is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos.

Timeline of the sentencing

What is H-1B visa programme

Kishore Dattapuram pleaded guilty in federal court this week to H-1B visa fraud and conspiracy to commit visa fraud. According to a press release US Attorney's Office, Northern District of California, Dattapuram, 55, of Santa Clara, and two other defendants, Kumar Aswapathi , 55, of Austin, Tex., and Santosh Giri , 48, of San Jose, were each charged in an indictment filed February 28, 2019, with one count of conspiracy to commit H-1B visa fraud and 10 counts of substantive visa fraud. Aswapathi pleaded guilty to all counts on October 19, 2020. Giri pleaded guilty to all counts on October 28, 2024.Dattapuram and Aswapathi owned Nanosemantics Inc , a staffing company headquartered in San Jose that provided skilled employees to technology companies in the Bay Area. Under its agreements with the companies and the employees it placed, Nanosemantics received a commission for workers placed at client companies. Giri worked closely with Nanosemantics and was also the owner of a separate business, LexGiri, a legal process outsourcing firm that served as a “remote-virtual corporate immigration specialist” for companies.In connection with its staffing work, Nanosemantics regularly submitted H-1B petitions for foreign workers.In pleading guilty, Dattapuram admitted to working with Aswapathi and Giri to submit fraudulent H-1B applications that falsely represented that foreign workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated end-client companies when in fact the jobs did not exist. On multiple occasions, Dattapuram paid companies to be listed as end-clients for the foreign workers, even though he knew the workers would never work for those employers. As defendants admitted, the goal of the scheme was to allow Nanosemantics to obtain visas for job candidates before securing jobs for them, thereby allowing Nanosemantics to place those workers with employers as soon as those jobs were available, rather than waiting for the visa application process to conclude, and giving Nanosemantics an unfair advantage over its competitors.Dattapuram’s sentencing hearing is scheduled for February 24, 2025. Giri’s sentencing hearing is also scheduled for the same day. Aswapathi has a status regarding sentencing on November 25, 2024. Each defendant faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for each visa fraud count, and a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 on the conspiracy count.The H-1B visa programme allows foreign workers to obtain temporary authorization to live and work for companies in the United States. In order to secure an H-1B visa, an employer or other sponsor must submit a Form I-129 petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). A petition and associated documentation must confirm the existence and duration of the job waiting for the worker, and describe key details including the wages associated with the position.","Kishore Dattapuram pleaded guilty in federal court this week to H-1B visa fraud and conspiracy to commit visa fraud. He and two other defendants, Kumar Aswapathi and Santosh Giri, were each charged in an indictment filed February 28, 2019, with one count of conspiracy. DattAPuram’s sentencing hearing is scheduled for February 24, 2025. Giri's sentencing hearing has been scheduled for November 25, 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115126806,imgsize-143922,width-400,resizemode-4/115126806.jpg"

Following Donald Trump ’s victory in the recent U.S. presidential election, security at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, has been significantly reinforced. The former president’s iconic property, which has drawn considerable attention over the years, is now equipped with advanced military-grade security technology. A recent video circulating on social media has revealed some of these high-tech measures, including the use of a robotic dog patrolling the estate’s grounds. As Trump begins his transition process, the fortified security at Mar-a-Lago reflects heightened safety concerns and precautions surrounding his new role.The footage, which has quickly gone viral on platforms like Twitter, offers a rare glimpse into the elevated security protocols implemented at Mar-a-Lago. One of the most noticeable additions is the use of a robotic dog, which is seen patrolling the property’s perimeters. These robotic security dogs are part of a cutting-edge technology used by various government and military organisations worldwide for their agility, surveillance capabilities, and ability to operate autonomously. Equipped with cameras and sensors, these robotic units can detect intruders, analyse threats, and provide real-time data to security personnel.This particular model, believed to be a product of advanced robotics, reflects Trump’s security team’s commitment to deploying the latest technology in protecting the president-elect. Mar-a-Lago’s extensive grounds and high-profile visitors make it essential to have both human and robotic surveillance in place, ensuring comprehensive coverage and enhanced protection.The upgraded security measures at Mar-a-Lago reflect the evolving challenges associated with safeguarding high-profile figures in today’s technological landscape. Security teams at Mar-a-Lago are now combining traditional protection with state-of-the-art technology, offering multi-layered security that leverages AI and autonomous systems. Robotic dogs, specifically, are ideal for extensive properties as they can patrol larger areas with minimal human intervention.These robotic dogs are programmed to navigate complex terrain, alert human guards to potential threats, and deter unauthorised individuals. Additionally, they possess cameras that transmit real-time video, allowing security teams to monitor multiple areas simultaneously. The technology behind these robotic dogs is gaining popularity not only for its efficiency but also for reducing risks to human security personnel.The deployment of advanced robotic security at Mar-a-Lago has stirred considerable interest on social media. Users on Twitter and other platforms have shared opinions ranging from fascination to curiosity about how technology is transforming traditional security protocols. The viral video has garnered thousands of views, with people commenting on the futuristic security approach and discussing its implications.Supporters have praised the move, noting that heightened security is a necessary precaution for the president-elect. Others, however, expressed concern about the implications of increased reliance on technology in personal security, speculating on how such measures might influence privacy and the future of security.Mar-a-Lago has long served as Trump’s winter residence and a hub for his political and business activities. With his upcoming presidency, the estate is likely to continue playing a significant role, hosting meetings with international leaders, supporters, and key figures in his administration. The reinforced security, therefore, is not just a precaution but a foundational aspect of safeguarding a property of such strategic importance.Trump’s decision to remain at Mar-a-Lago post-election could also mean that the estate will see a substantial increase in security personnel, both on-site and within the surrounding areas. The local community and authorities are expected to collaborate closely to ensure that Mar-a-Lago remains a secure location, equipped to handle the demands of a presidential residence.","Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, is now equipped with advanced military-grade security technology.

AI humanoid robot's Alan Turing painting sells for $1 million at auction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-humanoid-robots-alan-turing-painting-sells-for-1-million-at-auction/articleshow/115114571.cms,"How Ai-Da created this artwork



An artwork created by an AI-powered humanoid robot has sold for a record $1.08 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York. The painting, a 2.2-metre (7.5-foot) portrait of British computer scientist Alan Turing, surpassed its pre-auction estimate of $120,000-$180,000. It attracted 27 bids before being sold to an anonymous buyer.The artwork named “AI God: Portrait of Alan Turing,” was created by Ai-Da, a humanoid robot artist developed by Aidan Meller. Ai-Da uses AI algorithms and a robotic arm to create paintings, sculptures, and other forms of art.The painting's subject, Alan Turing, was a computer scientist who helped decrypt German codes during World War II but tragically died by suicide after facing persecution for his homosexuality. Meller hopes Ai-Da's work will spark reflection on the future of AI and its impact on humanity.Ai-Da, the humanoid robot artist, was brought to life in 2019 through a collaboration between Meller and a robotics company in Cornwall, UK.In a statement to CNN, Meller said that before starting a project, Ai-Da engages in discussions with its creators, expressing its preferences and ideas for the piece it wants to create.“In this instance, we had a discussion with her about ‘A.I. for good’ which led to Ai-Da bringing up Alan Turing as a key person in the history of A.I. that she wanted to paint,” Meller noted.Ai-Da's creation of the Alan Turing portrait involved a multi-stage process combining AI, robotics, and artistic decision-making. After discussing the painting's style and concept with its creators, Ai-Da used its camera eyes to analyze a photo of Turing and generate preliminary sketches.The robot then painted 15 individual portraits of Turing's face, each unique due to the AI algorithm's interpretation of the photo. Each painting took 6-8 hours to complete. Ai-Da then selected three of these portraits, along with a painting of Turing's Bombe Machine, to be combined into the final artwork.Due to the limited size of Ai-Da's canvas, the final image was printed onto a larger canvas using a 3D textured printer, preserving the original artwork's details. This process reflects the evolving capabilities of Ai-Da, whose agency and technology are constantly being refined.","Ai-Da, a humanoid robot artist, created a portrait of British computer scientist Alan Turing.

“Here is a critical question to its leadership: don't you have the vision and imagination to invest $400 million in another line of business where you can deploy those people you hired but you don't want anymore? Are there no such opportunities in tech? Are you so lacking in curiosity, vision and imagination? Are you so lacking in empathy?”.

What Freshworks CEO said



“In November 2024, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the Plan) to better align the Company's talent with its strategic priorities and to improve operating efficiency. The Company estimates that this will result in approximately 13% reduction in headcount and approximately $11 million to $13 million in charges in the fourth quarter of 2024, consisting primarily of cash expenditures for separation-related payments, employee benefits and related costs. The Company expects that the Plan will be substantially complete by the end of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.”

“There’s simply no good time to make a decision like this that affects people’s lives and it’s my responsibility to be transparent about how and why this decision was made. I am immensely grateful to those who will be leaving for their significant contributions to Freshworks. While this is likely an unexpected way to end your time here, I hope you leave feeling proud of the impact you’ve had.”

Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu slammed IT company Freshworks for its recent job cuts. Taking to microblogging site X (formerly Twitter), Vembu called the move “naked greed”, questioning the “vision” of its leadership.Earlier this week, Freshworks announced to lay off 12%-13% of its workforce. The job cuts, which is a part of the company’s efforts to streamline operations, will impact 660 employees across the US, India and other locations.In the post, Zoho CEO criticised the company for laying off employees, despite maintaining high cash reserves. He said “A company that has $1 billion cash, which is about 1.5 times its annual revenue, and is actually still growing at a decent 20% rate and making a cash profit, laying off 12-13% of its workforce should not expect any loyalty from its employees ever.”He stated that what adds ‘insult to injury’ to the impacted employees is that the layoffs are announced at a time “when it can afford $400 million in a stock buy back.” For those unaware, Freshworks recently announced that its board of directors approved a $400 million share buyback programme of its outstanding Class A common stock.He saidHe stated that this behaviour, “has become all too common in the US corporate world” and is being imported in India. “It has only resulted in large scale employee cynicism in the US and we are importing that too,” he added.Announcing the job cuts, Fresh works CEO Dennis Woodside said:","Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu slammed IT company Freshworks for its recent job cuts.

What the company has to say

Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) has reduced variable pay for some employees in the July-September quarter, a report has said, adding that the cuts have hit even those who have complied with the company's work-from-office policy.Citing sources close to the matter, Moneycontrol reported that while some employees received only 20-40% of their quarterly variable pay, others received no variable pay at all. This marks a significant drop from the 70% payout in the previous quarter.In April 2024, TCS revised its attendance policy, mandating a minimum of 85% office attendance for employees to receive their full variable pay. Employees with lower attendance rates receive a reduced percentage of their variable pay, with those below 60% ineligible for the bonus.TCS links variable pay to office attendance as well as it also depends on the performance of individual business units. The report also said that the recent cuts reflect the challenging demand environment and economic uncertainties that have led to slower growth for major IT services companies in the second quarter.In Q2, India's largest IT services company reported a 5.5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms.“We expect the headwinds to stabilise in Q3 and return to growth in Q4,” the company told analysts in its post-earnings call last month.A TCS spokesperson clarified that junior-level employees received 100% of their quarterly variable allowance (QVA). However, for other grades, the QVA is based on their unit's business performance, consistent with the company's usual practice.“For Q2FY25 we have paid out 100% QVA to junior grades across the company. For all other grades, the QVA depends on their unit’s business performance. This is in line with our standard practice across quarters,” a TCS spokesperson was quoted as saying.","Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) has reduced variable pay for some employees in the July-September quarter.

Sources briefed on the conversation told Axios that while specific policy details weren't discussed, the Ukrainian president found the timing of the call encouraging and was not left feeling anxious about Trump's victory.Musk's presence on the high-level diplomatic call follows reports of his substantial campaign contribution of $119 million to Trump and speculation about a potential cabinet position in the upcoming administration.The SpaceX CEO was also present during Trump's call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, where it was revealed the two were having dinner together.Despite Trump's campaign promises to quickly broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, sources say the president-elect did not delve into specific plans during Wednesday's call. Zelenskyy later acknowledged in Budapest that while Trump desires a swift end to the conflict, they hadn't discussed detailed proposals.The relationship between Musk and Ukraine has been complex, with the tech entrepreneur previously drawing criticism for mocking Ukraine's requests for aid and proposing his own peace plan in 2022. However, his Starlink technology remains vital to Ukraine's war effort.The billionaire's involvement in high-level diplomacy comes as The Wall Street Journal revealed his regular communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin since late 2022.

The latest solutions join its Birds product suite aimed at streamlining AI-powered business intelligence.During a conversation with journalists on the sidelines of Onix's inaugural Annual Day, company CEO Sanjay Singh along with CTO Niraj Kumar talked about tech companies' reliance on AI for growth has skyrocketed the demand for high-quality, compliant data.They noted that as organisations struggle to navigate the complexities of deploying and managing AI systems effectively, Onix's Kingfisher and Phoenix tackle these challenges, providing businesses with powerful tools to unlock the full potential of AI.“Kingfisher and Phoenix aren’t just products—they’re transformative solutions that enable enterprises to innovate at scale with absolute confidence in data privacy and efficiency,” said Singh, adding that the solutions provide privacy.As per Kumar, Kingfisher addresses the need for secure and privacy-compliant data by generating synthetic data that mirrors the characteristics of real data without compromising sensitive information. He explained that this AI-powered solution analyses production code and identifies edge cases to create comprehensive datasets that are statistically identical to real data, enabling risk-free development, testing, and AI/ML model training.After the synthetic data is created, Phoenix simplifies the process of extracting meaningful insights from data, and by leveraging AI-powered automation, Phoenix enables real-time, conversational data querying and delivers intuitive, explainable insights.When asked how Onix’s approach is different from other tech giants, Singh explained that the company differentiates itself in the industry by leveraging AI and data modernisation. He highlighted their unique approach to data migration and integration, focusing on building a contextual understanding of the data landscape to enable AI-driven solutions.As per Kumar, while Kingfisher solves scarcity issues while protecting sensitive information ethically, Phoenix simplifies AI deployment, enabling enterprises to harness powerful models without the usual complexities.When asked about bias and privacy about the generated synthetic data, Kumar told The Times of India Tech that “the notion of synthetic data generation is to take care of the ethical area.”“Otherwise what will happen? It will expose all real data to the users even though you have used it for training purposes. Hence, all the access privileges are defined, so we protect the data and implement all policies, privileges and roles, and the user groups accordingly,” he explained.For example, even if an AI chatbot is trained on data related to credit card numbers, when asked through LLM or natural language, it will only give users the answer if you have privileged access to it. Otherwise, it will say, “I'm not able to give because you don't have access to it”.","Onix has launched two AI-powered products aimed at solving the data-related challenges that large tech companies are currently facing.

Food delivery platforms Zomato and SoftBank-backed Swiggy have allegedly violated competition laws. India's antitrust watchdog, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), has reportedly discovered that Zomato and Swiggy engaged in practices that violate competition laws. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, documents have revealed that business practices of these popular food delivery platforms favour select restaurants listed on their platforms. The report cited some documents prepared by the CCI (which are not available to the public) to claim that Zomato offered lower commissions to restaurants that signed exclusivity agreements, while Swiggy guaranteed business growth to certain restaurants that listed exclusively on its platform. These practices are seen as anti-competitive and potentially harmful to smaller restaurants and consumers. The CCI's findings could lead to penalties and corrective measures for both Zomato and Swiggy.The investigation launched in 2022 reportedly started after a complaint by the National Restaurant Association of India. This complaint highlighted the impact on food outlets of the alleged anti-competitive practices of Swiggy and Zomato.While the CCI report remains confidential, its findings were shared with Zomato, Swiggy, and the National Restaurant Association of India, which filed the initial complaint.Zomato's shares fell 3% following the report. The CCI case is also listed as an “internal risk” in Swiggy's IPO prospectus, highlighting the potential for substantial penalties. The report also noted that Swiggy plans to launch a program similar to its discontinued "" Swiggy Exclusive "" (Swiggy Grow) in non-metropolitan cities, raising further concerns about potential anti-competitive practices.The CCI also reportedly found that Zomato imposed pricing and discount restrictions on restaurant partners, while Swiggy threatened to lower the rankings of restaurants that did not maintain price parity.The CCI is currently reviewing the investigation's findings and will make a final decision on any penalties or required changes to Zomato and Swiggy's business practices.","India's antitrust watchdog, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), has reportedly discovered that Zomato and Swiggy engaged in practices that violate competition laws.

How worried China and Taiwan's chip industries are preparing for Donald Trump’s return to White House,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-worried-china-and-taiwans-chip-industries-are-preparing-for-donald-trumps-return-to-white-house/articleshow/115085125.cms,"China races to stockpile chip equipment

Taiwan's semiconductor sector on edge

CHIPS Act future remains uncertain

China's semiconductor industry is gearing up for Donald Trump 's return to the White House by accelerating equipment purchases and exploring new talent recruitment strategies, according to industry experts and documents reviewed by Reuters.The aggressive preparation comes as Trump, who previously targeted Chinese tech giants Huawei and SMIC with trade restrictions, is expected to take an even tougher stance on China's chip ambitions in his second term. Industry experts told Reuters that Chinese firms are significantly better prepared this time, having learned crucial lessons from Trump's first presidency.Chinese manufacturers have particularly focused on acquiring lithography machines, with imports surging 35.44% to $7.9 billion in the first nine months of 2023, Chinese customs data reveals. The majority of these machines came from the Netherlands, valued at $7 billion, before new restrictions took effect.Companies have maximised equipment orders to hedge against future restrictions. Chinese chip maker Jinan Lujing Semiconductor Co's emphasis on self-reliance echoes a broader industry sentiment, noting that Trump's first term had already highlighted ""the necessity of localization.""""Chinese tech companies have progressively expanded their production capacities to mitigate future risks,"" Nori Chiou, investment director at Singapore-based White Oak Capital Partners, told Reuters.The Beijing Semiconductor Industry Association is advising companies to seize potential opportunities if global coordination on chip sanctions weakens under Trump. ""There could be benefits to China's semiconductor industry in terms of professional talents, multinational companies and foreign cooperation,"" said Zhu Jing, the association's deputy secretary-general, in a WeChat post.The situation has created ripples in Taiwan, where semiconductor giant TSMC faces uncertainty about its global operations. Despite growing concerns, Taiwan's leader William Lai Ching-te projected confidence on Wednesday, stating that ""the long-standing Taiwan-US partnership, based on shared values and interests, will continue to serve as a cornerstone of regional stability.""However, Trump's recent comments have stirred anxiety in Taiwan's chip sector. During an October appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Trump accused Taiwan of ""stealing"" the US chip industry, questioning the island's role in global semiconductor supply chains. His former national security adviser John Bolton notably warned that under a second Trump term, ""Taiwan is potentially toast.""Despite these tensions, TSMC has affirmed its commitment to its US investments. The world's largest contract chipmaker announced it would continue with its $65 billion investment plan for new factories in Arizona, regardless of Trump's election victory.TSMC has notified Chinese chip design companies that it will suspend production of their most advanced AI chips starting Monday, according to the Financial Times. The world's largest contract chipmaker will no longer manufacture AI chips at advanced process nodes of 7 nanometres or smaller for Chinese customers, with future supplies subject to Washington's approval.According to CNBC, despite Trump's campaign rhetoric against the CHIPS Act, policy experts believe the $53 billion semiconductor initiative will likely remain largely intact, though with possible modifications to fund allocation.While policy experts anticipate the CHIPS Act will survive Trump's return, the semiconductor industry's landscape remains in flux. As both Chinese and Taiwanese chip sectors brace for potential policy shifts, the $53 billion US semiconductor initiative stands as a critical factor in shaping the industry's global future, despite lingering uncertainty about Trump's trade policies.","China's semiconductor industry is gearing up for Donald Trump's return to the White House by accelerating equipment purchases.

TikTok ban: From US to Canada here’s a list of countries that have banned TikTok,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktok-ban-from-us-to-canada-heres-a-list-of-countries-that-have-banned-tiktok/articleshow/115082870.cms,"List of countries where TikTok is banned

Afghanistan: The Taliban banned TikTok in April 2022, citing its “misleading” influence on the country’s youth. The move aligns with Afghanistan’s restrictive cultural policies, where the government exercises strict control over media and content to enforce its societal norms.

Armenia and Azerbaijan: During periods of military tension, including recent border clashes, these two countries have temporarily blocked TikTok. Azerbaijan lifted its most recent ban in October 2023. The temporary bans reflect concerns that the app could be misused for spreading information or propaganda during conflicts.

Australia: TikTok has been banned on government devices in Australia since April 2023. However, the general public can still access and use the app, suggesting that Australia’s primary concern lies in protecting sensitive government data.

Austria, Denmark, and the European Union: Several European nations, including Austria and Denmark, as well as institutions within the European Union, have restricted TikTok on government-issued devices. European security agencies are concerned about the possibility of foreign access to user data, especially with China’s growing influence in technology.

India: India enacted a comprehensive ban on TikTok in 2020 after a deadly border clash with China. The government cited national security as the reason, marking one of the first full-scale bans on the app worldwide. Indian content creators, previously very active on TikTok, moved to other platforms such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels to maintain their audiences.

Indonesia: In October 2023, Indonesia banned TikTok’s “Shop” feature, citing violations of local e-commerce regulations. The country’s selective restriction is an example of how governments may choose to regulate specific functionalities of an app to align with local laws, rather than banning it outright.

Iran and Pakistan: Both countries have intermittently blocked TikTok, often citing social, moral, or ethical concerns. Iran has long restricted internet access to global platforms, including TikTok, as part of broader controls on content that conflicts with its government’s values.

United States: Congress and the U.S. military have barred TikTok from all government devices, and around half of U.S. states have adopted similar restrictions for state-owned devices. The primary concern in the U.S. is foreign access to personal data, as there are fears that the Chinese government could exploit user information for intelligence purposes.

Russia: Although TikTok is still accessible in Russia, users are mainly shown content generated within the country. This restriction reflects Russia’s increasing control over online information and its efforts to limit foreign influence on Russian users.

Other countries: Numerous other nations have enacted restrictions based on their unique concerns. For example, Jordan banned TikTok following civil unrest in December 2022, citing concerns over its use to spread misinformation. In Nepal, a ban was issued in November 2023, and Somalia has also blocked TikTok over concerns about its role in spreading propaganda and extremist content.

Canada has recently issued a directive to close TikTok’s offices in Toronto and Vancouver, citing increasing concerns over data privacy and potential foreign influence, specifically in relation to the app’s Chinese ownership. This action reflects a serious response to perceived risks associated with TikTok’s data collection and sharing practices, which have been scrutinised in Canada and internationally. The announcement, made by Canadian officials on Wednesday, underscores the government’s belief that TikTok poses a security threat due to the potential misuse of user data and the influence that foreign entities could exert through the platform.As more countries seek to protect their citizens’ information and limit potential foreign influence, TikTok’s operations and global reach may be further impacted, influencing both the app’s future growth and the broader conversation around data security and privacy on social media platforms.Canada’s move aligns with a growing international trend where countries are imposing bans, restrictions, or partial limitations on TikTok, typically because of privacy concerns, national security, or ethical reasons. Here’s a detailed overview of the actions taken by various countries:Across these regions, governments share common concerns around data privacy, national security, and the platform’s influence on social behaviour. Many governments worry that TikTok’s data-gathering techniques allow it to collect extensive personal information, which could be accessed by foreign entities. Additionally, with TikTok’s growing popularity, there’s a fear of the app being used to shape public opinion, especially in politically sensitive regions. For instance, during conflicts, TikTok could theoretically be leveraged to disseminate propaganda or influence public perception.","The Taliban banned TikTok in Afghanistan in April 2022, citing its ‘misleading’ influence on the country’s youth.

AWS remains Perplexity's preferred cloud infrastructure provider, and we're excited to announce expansions of that partnership in the coming weeks.”

“a threat to user choice”

“hundreds of millions”

“all-in”

How will this Perplexity deal help Microsoft

“Our customers expect to use multiple models as part of any workload. And we offer the broadest selection of models of any hyperscaler.”

Perplexity has signed a $750 million deal with Microsoft Azure. With this deal, the AI startup is expanding its business beyond its long-time cloud partner, Amazon. The three-year commitment will allow Perplexity to deploy AI models through Microsoft's Foundry service, including those from OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI, a report claimed, citing people familiar with the deal, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter. However, a Perplexity spokesperson has confirmed that as part of the Microsoft deal, the company hasn't shifted spending from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has long been the startup's primary cloud provider.In a statement to Bloomberg, a Perplexity spokesperson said,This deal comes after Perplexity and Amazon got engaged in a legal fight last year. In November 2025, Amazon sued Perplexity to prevent the startup from allowing consumers to use its AI tools to shop on Amazon's online marketplace. Perplexity responded by calling Amazon a bully and its actions. Meanwhile, that same month, Perplexity AI CEO Aravind Srinivas said his company had receivedin commitments from AWS.Perplexity built much of its business on AWS, using Amazon's Bedrock service to access Anthropic models for Perplexity's search engine. Srinivas is also a repeat speaker at AWS conferences. In a 2023 appearance, he said that he had decided to goon Amazon's cloud. AWS, in turn, has cited Perplexity as a cutting-edge AI customer using its services.For Microsoft, the Perplexity deal strengthens its efforts to position Azure as the platform for building AI applications and deploying models from a variety of vendors. Microsoft has long offered models from its partner OpenAI. In November 2025, the company also struck a deal with Anthropic to do the same.Earlier this week, during an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said,Over 1,500 Microsoft Foundry customers have already used both OpenAI and Anthropic models, Nadella said. The number of customers spending over $1 million per quarter on Foundry grew nearly 80% in the quarter which ended in December 2025, he added.Perplexity is a high-value AI startup but faces tough competition from Alphabet Inc.'s Google and OpenAI in its goal of changing how people search for information online. It also hasn't raised nearly as much money as OpenAI and Anthropic, which have recently made a series of infrastructure deals.Large companies typically rent cloud services from multiple providers, both to access unique capabilities and to avoid overreliance on any single vendor. This has increased during the AI era, as businesses test new tools and sign deals with model makers and cloud providers whose servers run that software.","Perplexity has signed a $750 million deal with Microsoft Azure.

Cloudflare says automated systems detected, mitigated attacks



Cloudflare, the web infrastructure giant, has said that it has successfully mitigated the “the largest attack ever disclosed publicly.” In its 2025 Q4 DDoS Threat Report (via Bleeping Computer), the company detailed a ‘record-breaking’ bombardment by the Aisuru/Kimwolf botnet, which peaked at a 31.4 Terabits per second (Tbps). Cloudflare came into spotlight after hundreds of websites were down in November.The report said that the hacking campaign was dubbed “The Night Before Christmas”, and targeted telecommunications providers, IT organisations and Cloudflare’s own dashboard infrastructure on December 19, 2025. It also claimed that the attack was “hyper-volumetric”, which means that it relied on sheer force to overwhelm networks.“The campaign targeted Cloudflare customers as well as Cloudflare’s dashboard and infrastructure with hyper-volumetric HTTP DDoS attacks exceeding rates of 200 million requests per second (rps) alongside Layer 4 DDoS attacks peaking at 31.4 Terabits per second, making it the largest attack ever disclosed publicly,” Cloudflare said in the report.Cloudflare reported that its automated systems detected and neutralised the threats so efficiently that no internal human alerts were even triggered.The company also reported that unlike other attacks which utilise compromised routers or basic Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the “Night Before Christmas” campaign came from compromised Android TVs.According to the web infrastructure giant, most of these attacks were short-lived but intense. About 50% of them lasted between one and two minutes, and 90% of the attacks peaked between 1–5 Tbps. Furthermore, the largest source of the year's attacks was reported to be from Bangladesh, followed by Ecuador, Indonesia and Argentina.When it comes to targets, China and Hong Kong were the most frequently attacked countries. Aisuru botnet previously held the record at 29.7 Tbps and once being attributed to a 15.72 Tbps attack on Microsoft. In 2025, Cloudflare recorded a 121% increase in DDoS incidents compared to 2024, totaling 47.1 million unique attacks.","Cloudflare says automated systems detected, mitigated attacks by Aisuru/Kimwolf botnet.

Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta is set to face trial next week in New Mexico. The lawsuit alleges that the Mark Zuckerberg-led company knowingly exposed children to sexual exploitation and prioritised corporate profit over the safety of its youngest users. The trial will begin on Monday (February 2) in Santa Fe District Court, is expected to span nearly two months.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the case has been brought by New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez, and centres on a 2023 undercover investigation dubbed “Operation MetaPhile.” During the probe, investigators created accounts on both Facebook and Instagram, posing as children under the age of 14.They claim that the accounts were quickly bombarded with sexually explicit material, and were contacted by predators seeking illegal content. According to the Attorney General's office, an operation that has already led to criminal charges against three individuals.The lawsuit also alleges that Meta’s platforms provided “unfettered access” for predators to connect with victims. Furthermore, the state claims that features like infinite scroll and auto-play videos have been intentionally designed to foster addictive behaviour.Meta has denied the allegations, dubbing the arguments as “sensationalist” and based on ‘cherry-picked’ internal documents.“For over a decade, we’ve listened to parents, worked with experts and law enforcement, and conducted in-depth research to understand the issues that matter most. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made, and we’re always working to do better,” the company stated.Meta’s also claims that company is shielded from liability in the case by the free-speech protections of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which generally bars lawsuits against websites over user-generated content.The evidence in the trial may include claims from a 2021 whistleblower and a previous report revealing an internal policy that once allowed Meta’s AI chatbots to engage in “romantic or sensual” conversations with minors.","New Mexico Attorney General's office alleges that Mark Zuckerberg-led company knowingly exposed children to sexual exploitation.

Sridhar Vembu: Engineering discipline matters

“I suggest the term ""AI-assisted Code Engineering"" with ACE as the acronym instead of ""vibe-coding"". We must have solid engineering discipline and ACE is the maturation of the tools and techniques”.

“It does not eliminate all software engineers but enables experienced engineers who ACE well to be much more productive,” he said, adding “It is also going to reshape our industry but that is a separate topic.”



What is vibe coding







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has suggested a new way to describe vibe-coding, a word that became one of the biggest “headache” of engineers in 2025. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Vembu argued that the termdoes not reflect the discipline required in real engineering work. He said that he prefers a new termto describe the growing use of AI tools in writing and maintaining software. In the post, Vembu said the focus should remain on solid engineering practices, even as AI becomes more deeply embedded in coding workflows.Sharing the post, Sridhar Vembu wrote:Vembu says that the term ACE does not remove the need for software engineers. Instead, it allows experienced engineers to “be much more productive”.Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming. It refers to building apps and websites by chatting with AI instead of writing code line by painstaking line.Vembu’s comments come at a time when AI-powered coding tools are being widely adopted by developers and companies to speed up software development. His remarks also highlight concerns among industry leaders that such language may underplay the importance of structure, accountability, and long-term reliability in software systems.Collins Dictionary named “vibe-coding” as its word of the year for 2025.","Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming.

Quote of the day by Apple CEO Tim Cook: “I love museums. But I don’t want to …”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-apple-ceo-tim-cook-i-love-museums-but-i-dont-want-to-/articleshow/126658877.cms,"Tim Cook (Image source: Reuters)

""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

What Tim Cook means by “loving museums”

Apple CEO Tim Cook (Image source: Bloomberg)

“I don’t want to live in one”: A warning against stagnation

A lesson in leadership and decision-making

Why the quote resonates beyond technology

A reflection of Tim Cook’s leadership style

Why the quote still matters

""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

,





Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple , doesn't give long speeches or use dramatic slogans. When he does say something, it's usually short, to the point, and well thought out. One of these lines is his quote:. The sentence is easy to understand, like a conversation. But it has a deeper meaning about how to move forward, how to be a leader, and how businesses and people should plan for the future.The quote is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Museums are places where history is kept. They keep ideas, inventions, and events that changed the world. They help us remember where we came from. Tim Cook has never said that we should forget or ignore history. Instead, he says that it is dangerous to get too comfortable with it.In today's world, where things change quickly, especially in technology, staying still can cost you a lot. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.Museums are very important to society. They keep culture, new ideas, and human accomplishments safe. Future generations would lose touch with the ideas and work that shaped the past if there were no museums. Tim Cook saying ""love"" shows that he cares. He thinks it's important to learn from the past. He likes what has already been made.Apple has a long and well-known history. People often study and admire the company's past innovations, which include the Macintosh, the iPod, and the iPhone. A lot of these items are now on display in museums and exhibitions all over the world. Cook knows more about this legacy than most people.But liking someone doesn't mean you care about them. His quote makes it clear that history is important to learn about, but it shouldn't be a place where you want to stay, especially in an industry driven by constant innovation, progress, and forward-looking thinking.The second part of the quote is where the real meaning is. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. It means comfort, safety, and familiarity. That comfort can slowly turn into stagnation in business and leadership.Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. The markets change. Technology changes. People's needs change. What worked ten years ago might not work anymore. Businesses that only care about keeping their legacy alive often have a hard time staying relevant.Apple has kept changing under Cook's leadership. The business has grown into services, put more emphasis on user privacy, put money into protecting the environment, and moved into new areas like custom silicon chips. These choices show that the company is willing to try new things, even if the old ones worked.The quote is true for all leaders, not just Apple. People often praise leaders for their past successes, using previous wins as proof of future capability and judgement. People trust you more when you have done well in the past. But depending too much on past success can keep you from coming up with new ideas or recognising when the environment has fundamentally shifted.Cook's words make it sound like good leadership needs to be balanced. You can learn from history, but don't let it tell you what to do all the time. Don't let your past experiences tell you what to do. This method lets businesses change instead of fighting it, allowing innovation to emerge naturally rather than defensively.This idea also works for people. Careers, skills, and fields of work change over time. It can be harder to grow if you hold on too tightly to what used to work. The quote quietly encourages people to be open and curious, even when change is hard, uncertain, or uncomfortable at first.This quote stands out because it is so simple. It doesn't use business jargon or technical language. People can all understand it. Most people know how nice it is to stick to their routines and how hard it is to try something new.In a broader sense, the remark addresses how cultures deal with progress. Traditions and fresh ideas frequently conflict. It is crucial to respect tradition and history while also being open to new experiences. Cook's remark acknowledges the history. It simply refuses to be confined by it.This balance is especially important now that technology is changing quickly and making people wonder about jobs, education, and social structures. The quote tells people that progress doesn't mean forgetting the past; it means building on it in a smart way.People often say that Tim Cook is calm, level-headed, and practical. His way of leading is different from Steve Jobs's, who was known for making bold and dramatic statements. Cook does things in a quieter way. His words are more likely to make you think than to make you angry, reflecting patience, consistency, ethical decision-making, and a long-term focus rather than short-term applause, values that align closely with Apple’s culture and leadership philosophy.This quote fits that pattern. It doesn't need attention. It makes you think. It gives a point of view without making people agree. That restraint is one reason it feels real.The quote doesn't give a big picture; it gives a way of thinking. It talks about how Cook sees progress, responsibility, and long-term success.is still true because it describes a problem that everyone faces. How can we remember the past without letting it control us? How do we go on without losing what matters?It's clear but not obvious what Tim Cook means. Value history. Take something away from it. Then decide to go on.In one short sentence, the CEO of Apple reminds us that we can choose to make progress. It takes work, curiosity, and a willingness to go beyond what you already know. Museums keep the past alive. But the future is being built somewhere else.","Tim Cook's quote has a deeper meaning about how to move forward.

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.""

Read Deepinder Goyal's full letter that he sent to shareholders

“Dear Shareholders,

Today, I am going to step away from the Group CEO role, and subject to shareholders' approval, will remain on the board of directors as Vice Chairman.

Albinder Dhindsa

(Albi) will be Eternal's new Group CEO.

Why this change

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.

This transition allows Eternal to remain sharply focused, while giving me the space to explore ideas that do not fit Eternal's risk profile.

What doesn't change

I have spent eighteen years, almost half my life, building this company. I will continue doing that.

Albi, Akshant, and I will continue to work closely together, as we always have. Our partnership, shared context, and trust remain unchanged. All our business CEOs will continue operating with the autonomy they have always had.

My involvement in long-term strategy, culture, leadership development, and ethics and governance, continues. This is where I have increasingly focused lately anyway.

What changes

The centre of gravity for operating decisions moves to Albi.

As Group CEO, he will own day-to-day execution, operating priorities, and business decisions.

Blinkit's journey from acquisition to breakeven happened under his leadership.

He built the team, the culture, the supply chain, the operating rhythm. He has the DNA of a battle-hardened founder and his ability to execute far exceeds mine. He is more than capable of leading Eternal as Group CEO.

Blinkit remains our largest growth opportunity and will remain as Albi's top priority. Our decentralized structure, where each business has a CEO with full ownership, continues unchanged - and will help Albi execute this well.

On alignment and ESOPs

My financial future remains meaningfully tied to Eternal, and my incentives remain aligned with long-term shareholder value creation.

As part of this transition, all of my unvested ESOPs will revert to the ESOP pool. This ensures that Eternal continues to have meaningful wealth-creation opportunities for its next generation of leaders, while strengthening long-term retention without incremental shareholder dilution.

Looking ahead

Eighteen years ago, the idea that a menu scanning company could be worth tens of billions of dollars, provide livelihoods to hundreds of thousands of people, and serve millions of families daily would have seemed absurd. We helped prove it was possible. And there's a lot in store for Eternal to do over the next few decades.

I believe Eternal is not going to lose focus or momentum through this change. Rather, it is reinforcing its institutional strength.

And personally, I gain the flexibility to explore ideas that sit outside Eternal's scope, without compromising the company's priorities.

I want Eternal to become India's most valuable company. I want us to serve a billion customers. I want us to create the most positive impact on society. I want us to be the source of livelihoods for millions of Indians. None of that changes.

This is a change in title, not in commitment towards outcomes. Eternal remains my life's work.

Thank you for your continued trust and support.

Deepinder Goyal”

When White House called Amazon's tariff plan an 'hostile act'





In April 2025, a pissed Donald Trump made a call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after learning that the company is planning to display the added cost of tariffs on certain items. Trump made the call to Bezos to complain about reports that Amazon was considering to highlight the cost of US tariffs next to prices for certain products on the company’s website. Trump later told reporters about the call to Amazon founder and said it was a “good call.” “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump told reporters. “He solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.”Punchbowl News first reported that Amazon will soon “display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs — right next to the product’s total listed price.” The move came after Trump slapped 145% tariffs on imports from China and a 10% minimum tax on all other countries.Now months later, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC in an interview Jassy at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Amazon.com is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures stemming from the US President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""We did a lot of pre-buying in the early part of 2025 to enable us to try and keep prices as low as possible for customers,"" Jassy said.He added, ""And a lot of our third-party sellers did a lot of forward-staging in our fulfillment network for the same reasons. And that supply is run out in the fall, so you start to see some of the tariffs creep in to some of the prices, some of the items.""""Some third-party sellers are raising prices in response while others are absorbing the costs in hopes of driving more demand,"" Jassy went on to add. ""Our priority is to try to figure out how to keep prices low as possible,"" Jassy said. ""At a certain point, because retail is a mid-single-digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it.""The warning marks a shift from the Amazon leader's commentary on tariffs last year. While he cautioned in April that third-party sellers could need to pass along tariff costs, he said on several occasions that Amazon had not seen selling prices appreciably rise from tariffs. ""Amazon's consumers overall have fared well. But we'll have to see what happens in 2026,"" CEO Jassy had said.The company has also maintained so far that over the past year it was seeing very little impact on consumer behavior and product prices from tariffs. It has doubled down on expanding product categories and speeding up delivery timelines to shield demand.In April 2025, at a briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the move a “hostile and political act,” adding that she had spoken about the matter with President Trump earlier. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Levitt’s comments, saying it’s a hostile act if a company goes out of its way to “make it seem” like tariffs have caused prices to change.“It’s nonsense,” he said Tuesday in a CNBC interview. “A 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price,” he added, referring to the nearly universal baseline tariff on all countries. “The only price will change would be a product that we don’t make here, like a mango.” The 10% tariff, however, is hardly the only one in effect.",Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the company is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures. The warning marks a shift from the Amazon leader's commentary on tariffs last year.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Satya Nadella said it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.

Debate at Davos



Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid







Palantir CEO Alex Karp has now issued a stark warning about the future of work in the age of artificial intelligence. Karp predicted that humanities-based jobs will now be among the first casualties. As reported by Business Insider, speaking during a panel at the World Economic Forum, Karp revealed that his own academic background which is a philosophy degree from Haverford College, a law degree from Stanford, and a Ph.D. in social theory from Germany, cautioned that such qualifications may no longer be viable. “AI will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp said. “You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market.”Karp believes that workers with technical and vocational training will be in then highest demand. He quoted battery manufacturing as an exampple, nothing that technicians in such industries are “very valuable, if not irreplaceable.” “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” Karp told BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who moderated the discussion.Not all leaders at Davos agreed with Karp’s assessment. Finance executives told Business Insider that liberal arts degrees may actually become more valuable, as AI takes over routine financial analysis. Critical and creative thinking, they argued, is increasingly prized in young recruits.Meanwhile, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei highlighted another trend: entry-level hiring is already declining due to AI. Amodei said software and coding roles at Anthropic were down across junior and mid-level positions.Recently, Karp said that value of skilled workers is rising. Speaking on TBPN, a tech talk show broadcast live from Palantir’s customer conference, AIP Con 8, Karp said, “Workers become more valuable. The person at the top is actually crazy valuable. People with technical expertise are crazy valuable."" His words underscore a trend that’s become increasingly apparent in Silicon Valley: in a world awash with automation and AI, human expertise, especially deep technical skill, has become a rare commodity.Karp calls these individuals “artist-shaped people,” a nod to the company’s unique culture, sometimes referred to internally as “an artist colony.” He added, “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid.”. The statement doesn’t just reflect Palantir’s philosophy; it mirrors the market reality, where top AI researchers and engineers have recently netted unprecedented paydays, sometimes reaching hundreds of millions, while thousands of others were laid off from companies like Microsoft and Meta.","Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid. “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid,” he said.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index. Most of her wealth comes from her share of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, significant assets transferred during her 2021 divorce from Bill Gates (including billions in stocks and real estate), and her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, focused on women's equality.","Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

Nvidia’s ‘Deep’Seek irony

After US export clearance, China has to green-light H200 imports

China has reportedly granted conditional approval for one of the country’s leading AI startup, DeepSeek, to purchase Nvidia’s high-performance H200 chips. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the conditions, however, are yet to be finalised by China’s state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The move comes almost exactly a year after the startup triggered a $600 billion wipeout of Nvidia’s market value.Citing sources familiar with the matter, Reuters said that Beijing has greenlit DeepSeek, alongside tech giants ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent, to acquire the H200, which is Nvidia's second most powerful AI processor.Notably, on January 27, 2025, shares of Nvidia plunged nearly 17% in a single day, reportedly the largest market cap loss in US history, after DeepSeek released its R1 model. The main reason for the decline was the Chinese company’s claim that high-level AI could be trained at a fraction of the cost using far fewer chips. This led investors to fear a collapse in demand for Nvidia’s high-end silicon.Not only Nvidia, shares of other AI companies like OpenAI – that have been spending billions to train their AI models – were also hit. One year later, DeepSeek is now transitioning from a perceived threat to a massive customer.The timing of the development is also critical as DeepSeek is expected to launch its next-generation V4 model in mid-February. It is said to have strong coding capabilities.Earlier this month, the US government formally cleared the H200 for export to China, however, the final approval decision rests with Beijing. China is looking to balance the immediate compute needs of its tech sector by nurturing domestic chipmakers like Huawei.Previous reports have claimed that the NDRC is considering “bundling” requirements, which means Chinese tech companies will have to purchase a specific ratio of domestic AI accelerators for every Nvidia H200 they import.Recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, told reporters in Taipei that the company has not yet received official confirmation, noting, “I believe that China was still finalizing the license.”","China has reportedly granted conditional approval for one of the country's leading AI startup, DeepSeek, to purchase Nvidia's high-performance H200 chips.

What ‘Melania’ producer said about Jeff Bezos’ involvement in the movie

Amazon MGM Studios producer Marc Beckman has dismissed reports that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was involved in the US First Lady Melania Trump's documentary deal with the company. With this clarification, he addressed rumours that the US First Lady had pitched the project directly to the billionaire during a visit to Mar-a-Lago last year. Beckman, who serves as a producer on the film and is also Melania's exclusive senior advisor, says Melania's only mention ofto Bezos during the meal came after other Amazon executives had already pitched the project. Trump's team insists that Bezos wasn't involved in the Amazon MGM movie deal after he and Lauren Sanchez visited Mar-a-Lago last year.Bezos's Amazon MGM Studios acquired the rights to the feature-length documentary about Melania Trump for a whooping $40 million and spent a further $35 million on a global marketing push. The film, directed by Brett Ratner, follows Melania in the 20 days leading up to last year's US presidential inauguration. The documentary was screened at a recent White House promotional event attended by what the Hollywood Reporter describes asincluding Amazon's Andy Jassy, Apple's Tim Cook, and former boxer Mike Tyson.However, one notable absence from thesneak peek White House screening was Bezos himself. Among the guests were Apple CEO Tim Cook and AMD CEO Lisa Su, as well as Amazon executives Andy Jassy and Mike Hopkins. The screening included custom-made popcorn buckets, framed screening tickets and a military band playing a tune from the film calledIn a statement to Page Six, Melania producer Marc Beckman said,“Bezos wasn’t involved in the contract negotiations at all, ever… He never had a conversation with me about anything surrounding the film — ever.Here’s what actually happened. The only interaction during that family meal between Melania and Jeff — with regards to the film — was that when Melania commented to Jeff that I was in talks with Amazon’s executive leadership, Bezos had no idea about the film or the contract negotiation. He wasn’t aware that I was already in talks with his team, and didn’t know about the film itself. It was a friendly meal with family members present, and definitely not a setting for a contract negotiation.[The] first person I reached out to at Amazon was in its executive leadership … I never interacted with Jeff — not an email, a text, he was never involved.”Beckman also added that “during the process, I became very impressed with Amazon’s team, their vision, and experience in the film industry.

Starting this week, the tool is being rolled out to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US aged 18 or older. The company said access will expand to more regions over time.Project Genie generates interactive environments in real time. As users move through a world, the system predicts and creates what comes next based on their actions. This differs from traditional 3D experiences, which are usually pre-built and static.The prototype is powered by Genie 3, along with Gemini and Nano Banana Pro, two other Google AI systems. Together, these models allow users to build, explore, and modify digital worlds rather than simply view them. Google DeepMind said this work is part of its broader effort to develop artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which would require AI systems that can operate across many different real-world situations.Project Genie focuses on three main features. The first is world creation, also described asUsers can use text prompts or upload images to create environments. Characters, environments, and modes of transportation, such as driving, flying, or walking can all be specified. Prior to entering the setting, users can also select viewing perspectives, such as first or third-person point of views.World exploration is the second feature. After a world is created, users are free to explore it. The system generates the environment in real time as users navigate, adjusting in response to movement and camera changes.The third feature is world remixing. Users can build on existing worlds by modifying prompts or exploring examples provided in a gallery. Finished experiences can be recorded and downloaded as videos.Google DeepMind reported that Project Genie remains an early research prototype and has several limitations. The worlds generated may not always align with the prompt, the physics may not be realistic, and the characters may be difficult to control. Each generated experience is limited to 60 seconds.","Google DeepMind has unveiled Project Genie, an experimental AI tool allowing users to create and explore interactive digital worlds from text prompts.

“the most intense environment they've ever seen, perhaps ever in the technology industry.”

Google DeepMind founder and CEO Demis Hassabis has credited ChatGPT maker OpenAI and other AI startups with scaling a technology initially developed by Google . In a recent podcast, Hassabis acknowledged that, although Google researchers developed transformer technology in 2017, which forms the base of almost all large language models (LLMs), the company was slow to commercialise and scale the innovation. He credited Sam Altman-led OpenAI and other competitors for using Google’s technology to scale their AI chatbots.In a recent episode of CNBC’s The Tech Download podcast, Hassabis said Google's challenge wasn't invention but execution. Referring to the technology’s commercialisation, he said,Hassabis added.Google merged its Brain research division with DeepMind in 2023 and appointed executive Josh Woodward to lead its Gemini AI assistant, enabling the company to catch up after OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Product failures with Google's AI products in 2024 further fuelled the impression that the company was struggling to compete.Hassabis noted.At the start of 2025, investors questioned whether Google could keep pace with OpenAI in AI. By year-end, Alphabet’s stock delivered its best performance since 2009. Google regained its strength in AI. Much of that came from DeepMind, the UK-based company Google bought in 2014 for around £400 million (almost $550 million).Hassabis called itof Google's AI work, saying that changes had been made to help the tech company quickly launch AI products in aHe noted that he talks to Google CEO Sundar Pichai showing how closely the two leaders are working to move fast on innovation.Hassabis said in the podcast.he continued.This could be important for Google as it faces another year of competition from OpenAI and many other companies, including Amazon, Perplexity, and Anthropic.Hassabis noted. He added thatlong-time tech workers who've been in the industry forhad told him this was","Google DeepMind's CEO Demis Hassabis admits the company was slow to commercialise its foundational AI technology, allowing rivals like OpenAI to scale chatbots. He emphasised a shift towards a scrappier, faster approach, with DeepMind now serving as the 'engine room' for Google's AI product launches.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127802614,imgsize-30694,width-400,resizemode-4/127802614.jpg"
How ‘friendship’ with Sam Altman is one of the biggest reasons behind Microsoft's $360 billion crash in one day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-friendship-with-sam-altman-cost-microsoft-360-billion-in-a-day/articleshow/127801014.cms,"Microsoft's $360 billion single-day crash exposed the catastrophic cost of its OpenAI alliance. After investing $13 billion in Sam Altman's money-losing venture, Microsoft has tied 45% of its cloud contracts to a partner burning cash with no path to profitability. Circular financing schemes and exploding AI spending finally triggered Wall Street's reckoning.

The circular money machine that created a $750 billion illusion

Altman's trillion-dollar fantasy is bankrupting Microsoft's future

Altman's contract trapped Microsoft with no exit strategy

The reckoning Wall Street finally delivered

Microsoft lost $360 billion in market value on January 28. That's the second-largest single-day wipeout in US stock market history. The only bigger crash? Nvidia's DeepSeek meltdown last year, which also traced back to AI delusion.The culprit this time is Sam Altman and his money-incinerating machine called OpenAI . Microsoft's stock plunged 10% after earnings exposed a reality investors can no longer ignore: the software giant has handcuffed itself to a partner that lost over $8 billion last year, burns $15 million daily on video generation alone, and has no credible path to profitability.The most alarming number from Microsoft’s Q1 26’s earnings call? OpenAI now represents 45% of Microsoft's $625 billion in future cloud contracts. Microsoft has effectively bet half its cloud business on a company whose CEO just declared ""code red"" because ChatGPT's user growth has stalled and Google is eating its lunch.Wall Street finally asked the obvious question: what happens when the music stops?OpenAI's entire business model is financial theatre. The company operates on circular deals that create the appearance of growth while generating zero real economic value.Here's how the con works: Microsoft has invested $13 billion in OpenAI since 2019. OpenAI promptly funnelled most of those billions right back to Microsoft as payment for Azure cloud computing. Both companies book revenue. Both companies tell investors they're winning. Neither has created a sustainable business.The scheme extends across Silicon Valley. Nvidia announced plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI. OpenAI will spend that money buying Nvidia's GPUs. CoreWeave signed deals worth $22 billion to provide OpenAI with computing power, then received $350 million in OpenAI stock that could theoretically pay for those services. SoftBank led a $40 billion investment in OpenAI, then committed $100 billion to build data centres that OpenAI will rent.Oracle struck the most absurd deal: $300 billion to construct data centres for OpenAI, which OpenAI will then pay roughly $300 billion to use over several years. It's the same money, moving in a circle. Oracle's stock has since crashed 45% from its September peak, wiping out over $360 billion in value as investors realised they'd been sold a Ponzi scheme with better branding.The arrangement is famously called ""circular financing."" Former asset manager George Noble called it what it is: ""a cash incinerator."" These aren't investments. They're companies trading Monopoly money while pretending the game will never end.Sam Altman has committed OpenAI to spending $1.4 trillion on AI infrastructure by 2033. That number isn't a typo. It's more than the market value of Amazon. It's twice the annual budget of the U.S. military. And it's predicated on the fantasy that ChatGPT will somehow evolve into a world-changing technology that prints money faster than OpenAI can burn it.Microsoft is now trapped financing Altman's delusion. The company's capital expenditures exploded to $37.5 billion last quarter, up 66% year-over-year. That was $1 billion higher than analysts expected and $3 billion higher than the previous quarter. Microsoft is now spending money at a rate that would make a defence contractor blush.Two-thirds of that spending went to GPUs and short-lived AI infrastructure that depreciates faster than a new car. CFO Amy Hood tried to spin this as strategic allocation. The reality is uglier: Microsoft is sacrificing its profitable cloud business to prop up Sam Altman's gambling habit.Azure cloud growth slumped to 39%, down from 40% the previous quarter and below Wall Street's 39.4% forecast. Hood admitted Microsoft is deliberately throttling Azure capacity for paying customers so it can divert computing power to internal AI products like Copilot and GitHub Copilot.Let that sink in. Microsoft is turning away revenue from Fortune 500 companies who want to pay for cloud services so it can give free computing power to AI products that users largely ignore.Microsoft 365 Copilot has 15 million paid seats. That sounds impressive until you remember Microsoft has 450 million total M365 commercial seats. Adoption is barely 3%. UBS analysts publicly questioned whether Copilot is worth the investment, noting that ""M365 revenue growth is not accelerating due to Copilot"" and ""many checks on Copilot don't suggest a strong usage ramp.""Meanwhile, OpenAI's competitive position is collapsing. Google's Gemini models now match or exceed ChatGPT's capabilities while running on more efficient infrastructure. ChatGPT's user growth has flatlined in Europe. China's DeepSeek built a competitive model for a fraction of the cost, proving the AI industry's spending is grotesquely wasteful.Deutsche Bank analyst Jim Reid estimates OpenAI will lose $140 billion between 2024 and 2029. He wrote: ""No start-up in history has operated with expected losses on anything approaching this scale. We are firmly in uncharted territory.""Financial expert Sebastian Mallaby predicts OpenAI could run out of money within 18 months. One venture capital investor told The Economist: ""This is the WeWork story on steroids.""The worst part? Microsoft can't escape without catastrophic damage.The company's contract with OpenAI includes a clause that restricts Microsoft from developing its own AGI until 2030. That means if OpenAI collapses tomorrow, Microsoft has legally blocked itself from building a replacement for three and a half years. It's the corporate equivalent of signing a prenup that requires you to stay single if your spouse leaves you.Those $625 billion in cloud commitments don't vanish if OpenAI implodes. Microsoft would be stuck with massive data centres built for a customer that no longer exists, financed by debt that still needs repaying. Oracle is already experiencing this nightmare, having raised tens of billions in bonds to build infrastructure for OpenAI while watching its credit risk gauge hit levels not seen since 2009.Microsoft has also spent three years publicly positioning itself as the indispensable partner in OpenAI's success. CEO Satya Nadella appears on stage with Sam Altman. Press releases trumpet their collaboration. The brand association is complete.Ditching OpenAI now would mean admitting to shareholders that Microsoft wasted $13 billion and countless strategic opportunities chasing a mirage. The reputational damage would be severe. The financial damage might be worse.Nadella himself has expressed skepticism about AGI, calling it ""nonsensical benchmark hacking"" on a podcast. Yet his company has structured its entire AI strategy around achieving exactly that. It's a contradiction that investors can no longer ignore.Bank of America analysts noted that Microsoft's dependence on OpenAI creates ""concentration risk"" at a time when the partner's financial health is deteriorating. Barclays analysts said Microsoft has entered ""a winners and losers phase"" in AI, where the market will punish companies tied to failing business models.January 28's $360 billion crash wasn't irrational panic. It was the market finally doing basic arithmetic.Investors looked at Microsoft spending $37.5 billion per quarter on AI infrastructure. They looked at OpenAI losing $12 billion per quarter with no revenue growth. They looked at circular financing deals that shuffle money without creating value. They looked at Azure growth slowing while capital expenditures explode.And they sold.Business professor Erik Gordon warned that when the AI bubble bursts, ""the suffering will be more painful than the aftermath of the dot-com bubble."" He's right. The dot-com bubble involved companies with maybe a few billion in market cap built on hype. Microsoft is a $3.2 trillion company that just lost 10% of its value in a single day because it tied itself to Sam Altman's sinking ship.The contagion is already spreading. Software stocks crashed across the board January 28. ServiceNow fell 9.9%. Salesforce dropped 6.1%. Atlassian declined at least 6%. The market is repricing every company exposed to AI speculation.Microsoft spent decades building credibility as a stable, profitable enterprise that delivers consistent shareholder returns. Sam Altman has torched that reputation in less than three years with circular deals, imaginary revenue, and a $1.4 trillion spending plan that assumes AI will magically become profitable before reality intervenes.January 28 was Microsoft's bill coming due. And Sam Altman is nowhere to be found to help pay it.","Microsoft's $360 billion single-day crash exposed the catastrophic cost of its OpenAI alliance.

Google founder Larry Page has long argued that companies should aim for breakthroughs rather than small improvements, a view he described as “10x” philosophy. During a 2013 TED interview, Page was asked to explain the philosophy that he lives by. “You don't want to go into a small, measurable arena of progress,” the interview said. Larry Page then replied saying “I see this as an economic concept of additionality, which means they are doing something that wouldn't happen unless you're actually doing it.” “I think the more you can do things like that, the bigger impact you have,” he explained, further adding “that's about doing things people might not think are possible.”During the interview, Page said he believes businesses should aim to build products that are ten times better than what already exists. He explained that small efficiency gains or code tweaks rarely lead to large outcomes. According to Page, real impact comes from rethinking problems from the ground up and exploring what technology can make possible.“The more you learn about technology, the more you learn what's possible,” he continued, saying “I just try to focus on – what is that future really gonna be? And how do we create it?” During the interview, Larry Page further explained what additionality really mean for him.“Looking at things people might not think about working on things that no one else is working on…. that's where the additionality really is.”Larry Page’s 10x approach influenced several major Google products. In his previous interviews, he has cited examples such as Gmail launching with far more storage than competing email services, Google Translate expanding across many languages, and efforts to digitise books at a global scale.The philosophy, as per reports, also led to the creation of Google X, a research division set up to work on long-term projects such as self-driving cars and advanced artificial intelligence systems. Larry Page said these projects were designed to explore ideas that would otherwise remain untested.","Google founder Larry Page has long argued that companies should aim for breakthroughs rather than small improvements.

Here’s what Zeehsan Patel wrote on X

Recently, I left my role @xAI. I joined last year as the first hire for the new video generation team. It's been a crazy journey to get where we are today with @Grok Imagine.

When I first joined, our goal was to create a SOTA video generation model within ~3 months from scratch. To build the best video generation model possible with a small team and short timeline at xAI required extreme first-principles thinking and ludicrous execution speed. In typical xAI fashion, we started a war room for this effort. After a couple months of burning the 3am oil 🪔, we trained xAI's first video model: Grok Imagine v0.9. With the latest release of @Grok Imagine 1.0, our model is now the most used video model in the world, generating millions of videos per day. It's quickly become one of the largest features both on @X and the Grok app. I'm super excited about the future Grok Imagine models, and I'm sure the team will continue to create delightful experiences for all of our users.

I’m very grateful to have found amazing friends and collaborators at xAI. I'd like thank @ibab

for bringing me into xAI and giving me the opportunity of a lifetime to build an amazing product. To @Sergey_xai @johnmullan for their support and giving me a warm welcome to the company. To @ZhibeiM @zeliu for being great mentors and close collaborators. To @chaoqi_w for pairing with me during the early war room days and the fun research discussions. To @EthanHe_42 @jathushan for being amazing friends and supportive late-night collaborators. To

@endernewton for all the great research insights and advice. To @chaitu for showing me what makes a great product. To @kwotsin @sishaar for all the great chats about research and life. To @hexianghu for all the helpful advice and fun conversations. To @r_ahulravi @araavp @SahilJain314 @evanzwangg @aheze0 @LiTianleli @JackCaiXun for the late night ping pong games and memorable discussions. And to everyone else I didn’t mention by name but who were amazing friends and colleagues ❤️.

Finally, a huge thank you to @elonmusk for his time and guidance. It's been a long journey from the early days when we had 3am review meetings with Elon till now and his support has been vital to our success. I had an amazing time learning directly from Elon to improve my engineering mindset and intuition.

Super proud of what we shipped as a team. As for me, I have embarked on a new adventure, one that feels familiar yet very different. I hope to share more soon.

We have been working for generations to build a strong and vibrant state here in Minnesota and will do so in the months and years ahead with equal and even greater commitment. In this difficult moment for our community, we call for peace and focused cooperation among local, state and federal leaders to achieve a swift and durable solution that enables families, businesses, our employees, and communities across Minnesota to resume our work to build a bright and prosperous future.

Tech leaders slam ICE agents' Minnesota shooting and call for action

Apple CEO Tim Cook shares memo with employees

Team,

I’m heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis, and my prayers and deepest sympathies are with the families, with the communities, and with everyone that’s been affected.

This is a time for deescalation. I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they’re from, and when we embrace our shared humanity. This is something Apple has always advocated for. I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.

I know this is very emotional and challenging for so many. I am proud of how deeply our teams care about the world beyond our walls. That empathy is one of Apple’s greatest strengths and it is something I believe we all cherish.

Thank you for all that you do.

Tim

Jeff Dean, chief scientist at Google DeepMind, called shooting 'absolutely shameful'

This is absolutely shameful. Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cell phone camera.

Every person regardless of political affiliation should be denouncing this.

He had a gun that he was legally allowed to carry, per NY Times. He did not reach for his gun, and videos showed an officer had disarmed him before he was shot multiple times in an unarmed state.

Read Sam Altman’s memo to employees

I love the US and its values of democracy and freedom and will be supportive of the country however I can; OpenAI will too. But part of loving the country is the American duty to push back against overreach. What's happening with ICE is going too far. There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what's happening now, and we need to get the distinction right.

President Trump is a very strong leader, and I hope he will rise to this moment and unite the country. I am encouraged by the last few hours of response and hope to see trust rebuilt with transparent investigations.

As a company, we aim to stick to our convictions and not get blown around by changing fashions too much. We didn't become super woke when that was popular, we didn't start talking about masculine corporate energy when that was popular, and we are not going to make a lot of performative statements now about safety or politics or anything else. But we are going to continue to try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best as we can, engage with leaders and push for our values, and speak up clearly about it as needed.

I try to not talk about politics…But recent events—a federal agent killing an ICU nurse for seemingly no reason and with no provocation—shock the conscience…I immigrated to the United States—and eventually cofounded Anthropic here—believing it was a pillar of these principles.

My deep loyalty is to the principles of classical liberal democracy: freedom of speech, the rule of law, the dignity of the human person. I immigrated to the United States — and eventually cofounded Anthropic here — believing it was a pillar of these principles. I feel very sad today.

The deaths of Renée Nicole Good and Alex Pretti are unconscionable and weighing heavily on so many of our hearts. No one in the United States should ever have to fear losing their life for taking peaceful, principled action in support of their beliefs. Our country is not our government—our country is us, we the people. For 250 years, we have been bound together by bedrock values, the rule of law, and inalienable rights. There is nothing more American than exercising our rights and holding our government accountable. Our democracy depends on it.

Ethan Choi:

I want to make it clear that Keith doesn’t represent everyone’s views here at @khoslaventures, at least not mine. What happened in Minnesota is plain wrong. Don’t know how you could really see it differently. Sad to see a person’s life taken unnecessarily.

I agree with @EthanChoi7. Macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration. The video was sickening to watch and the storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts by authorities almost unimaginable in a civilized society. ICE personnel must have ice water running thru their veins to treat other human beings this way. There is politics but humanity should transcend that.

Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman blames State Governor

What is it about Minneapolis that the two tragic ICE shootings took place there within two or so weeks of each other? Could it really be a coincidence?

It is almost as if the governor of Minnesota called for protestors to intervene in ICE enforcements in an incendiary manner?

Inciting the people to rise up against law enforcement is guaranteed to end badly, and now we have seen the tragic consequences. @GovTimWalz and those that emulate him, it is time to take the temperature down before more lives are lost.

Other tech workers also demanded ICE out of their cities

Tech demands ICE out of our cities

We are tech industry professionals in the United States.

We all witnessed ICE brutally kill a US citizen on the streets of Minneapolis. Then, the Trump administration brazenly lied about what happened.

We didn’t get here overnight. For months now, Trump has sent federal agents to our cities to criminalize us, our neighbors, friends, colleagues, and family members. From Minneapolis to Los Angeles to Chicago, we’ve seen armed and masked thugs bring reckless violence, kidnapping, terror and cruelty with no end in sight.

This cannot continue, and we know the tech industry can make a difference. When Trump threatened to send the national guard to San Francisco in October, tech industry leaders called the White House. It worked: Trump backed down.

Today we’re calling on our CEOs to pick up the phone again:

1. Call the White House and demand that ICE leave our cities.

Last week’s fatal shooting of nurse Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol agent in Minnesota has sparked widespread outrage throughout America, including the country’s corporate and technology communities. Following the death of the 37-year-old US citizen and Veterans Affairs nurse, over 60 CEOs from Minnesota's major corporations, including Target, 3M, and UnitedHealth Group, issued a joint letter calling for “immediate de-escalation”. Initially, only a handful of tech leaders voiced their condemnation on social media but soon, Silicon Valley heavyweights like Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke against the action taken by federal agents in Minneapolis.The spark started when ICE agents in Minnesota shot Renee Nicole Good, 37, killing her on January 7. Pretti, the second fatality in the same month in the same city, was killed on Saturday morning, January 24, while recording federal agents. While authorities stated he threatened officers with a legally owned firearm social media footage allegedly shows he was shot after being disarmed and restrained.The video recorded by bystanders went viral on social media, triggering a strom against the actions of ICE agents, who have been ordered to stop, detain and arrest people they suspect of being in the US illegally.They can use deadly force ""if the person poses a serious danger to them or other people, or the person has committed a violent crime"", as per an expert (via the BBC).As the videos went viral, several tech leaders slammed the actions, calling it absolutely shameful and ICE agents murderers. Soon, a letter was signed by 60 CEOs of Minnesota companies, demanding an “immediate de-escalation of tensions"" and called on officials to ""work together to find real solutions.” The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce released the letter on behalf of more than 60 CEOs.While the Minnesota CEOs focused on “de-escalation,” the reaction from Silicon Valley was condemning. Leaders like Tim Cook, Jeff Dean (chief scientist at Google DeepMind), OpenAI CEO Sam Altman were among scores of leaders who have spoken out against the actions. While some sent internal memos, other scribbled their thoughts on social media. Here’s a list of key figures who condemned the shooting and what they said.and now executive chairman at AMI Labs, reposted a video of the shooting, and wrote: “Murderers.”Garry Tan, the CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator, said in a post on X that the “Minneapolis tragedy is truly sad,” and he wanted “order and peace.”, amplified calls for Americans to “stand up” to the administration by resharing a number of posts on X, saying, “It's time for all Americans to do so.”",Tech leaders slam ICE agents' Minnesota shooting and call for action. Apple CEO Tim Cook: America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals. Sam Altman: I love the US and its values of democracy and freedom. But part of loving the country is the American duty to push back against overreach.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127795004,imgsize-324376,width-400,resizemode-4/minnesota-shooting.jpg"

Tesla has taken unusual and expensive steps



Financial Pressure and Energy Storage Growth



Elon Musk’s warning



Tesla CEO Elon Musk delivered a blunt warning in the closing minutes of Tesla’s earnings call. Musk warned the American companies that either they should build more battery-making infrastructure in the U.S. or risk falling behind. Sounding visibly fired up, Musk implored, “Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?”Musk argued that too many companies underestimate their exposure to geopolitical risks tied to the fragile supply chains for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage. “There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen. I’m way more paranoid than that,” he said.In order to insulate itself, Tesla has taken unusual and expensive steps which includes building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas. In December 2024, Tesla started processing lithium at its $1 billion Robstown refinery, and this month announced production of dry-electrode 4680 cells in Austin, destined for certain Model Y vehicles.Musk described these facilities as “more advanced than anything else in the world,” but stressed Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.Tesla’s heavy investments come as its auto business faces pressure. The company reported Q4 revenue of $3.8 billion from its Megapack energy storage batteries, a 25% increase year-over-year. Analysts, however, voiced concern about Tesla’s commitment of more than $20 billion in capital expenditures for new plants, AI infrastructure, and upgrades, noting uncertain near-term returns.Musk closed with a stark prediction: “Companies that don’t do that — a bunch of them will cease to exist.” His plea underscores Tesla’s strategy of building domestic battery infrastructure out of “desperation,” while urging others to share the burden of securing America’s energy future.",Tesla CEO Elon Musk delivered a blunt warning in the closing minutes of Tesla’s earnings call.

So it was a terrific quarter in India.”Cook said that India is shaping up strongly for the company, even as its market share is still at “modest” levels.“We really like what we see there. It’s the second-largest smartphone market in the world and the fourth largest PC market. And we still have, despite very nice growth history, we have modest share there, and so we think there’s a huge opportunity for us there, and we could not be more excited about it.”He said that first-time buyers were a big part of the company’s numbers, indicating growing acceptance of the premium brand with the masses. “The other thing that I would point out is that the majority of customers that are buying iPhone and Mac and iPad and Watch are all new to that product and so it speaks very well to opportunity there.”The Apple CEO said that India’s revenue growth is in line with the healthy trajectory it is witnessing across some of the world’s other large markets. “We set all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific, and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. We continued to gain momentum in emerging markets, which includes India, where we saw strong double-digit revenue growth.”He also said expansion of retail in India will continue and it will open a second store in Mumbai, which will be its sixth company-owned outlet. “We were excited to open our fifth store in India in December and have plans to open another store in Mumbai soon.”Apple’s CFO Kevan Parekh added that the number of people with Apple’s products is also witnessing a double-digit growth. “We’re seeing strong double digit growth in the install base in India as well, which is really encouraging.”","Apple CEO Tim Cook on Thursday called India a “huge opportunity’ for growth.

Why Apple's memory bill is climbing fast

Services business offers a cushion

Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed the elephant in the room during the company's Q1 2026 earnings call–the global memory shortage that's been keeping the tech industry up at night. Cook revealed that rising RAM and storage chip prices had a ""minimal impact"" on Apple 's gross margin in the December quarter. But he was quick to temper expectations, noting the company anticipates ""a bit more of an impact"" in the current quarter.""We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly,"" Cook told analysts. ""As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that."" When pressed for specifics, Cook kept his cards close. ""There are different levers that we can push,"" he said. ""Who knows how successful they'll be, but there's just a range of options.""The comments came as Apple reported a blockbuster quarter with $143.8 billion in revenue–up 16% year-over-year–and projected 13% to 16% growth for the current quarter with gross margins between 48% and 49%.Behind the scenes, Apple's negotiating efforts have taken an unusual turn. According to The Korea Economic Daily, the company's purchasing teams have set up extended stays at hotels in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province–within striking distance of Samsung and SK Hynix semiconductor plants. The goal is to lock in two-to three-year contracts for LPDDR5X RAM needed in upcoming iPhone models.But the chipmakers aren't budging. Both Samsung and SK Hynix are sticking to quarterly contracts, betting on continued price increases through 2027.Apple isn't alone in its Korean hotel marathon either – Dell, Google, and Amazon executives have also established extended stays in the region.The situation has become particularly tricky for Apple because SK Hynix and Micron have shifted focus toward high-bandwidth memory for AI applications. This has forced Apple to lean more heavily on Samsung for the LPDDR memory its iPhones require.Industry reports suggest the cost squeeze is real. Apple was reportedly paying around $30 per 12GB memory module in early 2025. By December, that same module was costing the company roughly $70–a 230% jump.Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported earlier this week that Apple is now negotiating memory prices with suppliers every quarter instead of the usual six-month intervals.According to Kuo, Apple plans to offset some of these rising costs through its services business, which includes Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple TV subscriptions. Services revenue hit an all-time high of $30 billion last quarter, growing 14% year-over-year.Memory now accounts for over 20% of smartphone production costs, up from around 15% a few quarters ago. Apple's efficient iOS architecture and higher profit margins may help it weather the storm better than competitors, but Cook declined to speculate on whether consumer price increases might eventually be on the table.","Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged rising memory chip prices impacting gross margins, expecting further effects this quarter.

Melinda Gates Pivotal network



The new non-profit filings have revealed the multi-billion-dollar promise Microsoft founder Bill Gates made to his ex-wide Melinda French Gates when she resigned from the Gates Foundation in 2024. As reported by Frobes, Bill Gates donated nearly $2 billion in 2024 to two of Melinda’s foundations named Pivotal Philanthropies Opportunities and Pivotal Philanthropies Momentum. Each of the foundations received $982 million.These gifts come on top of the $8.9 billion which Gates had already transferred to the two other Pivotal foundations, including a $7.9 billion donation to Pivotal Philanthropies, her main philanthropic vehicle, and $982 million to Pivotal Pathways. The fillings suggest that together Gates has given a total of $10.8 billion across four foundations and fulfilled nearly $12.5 billion commitment he made to fund Melinda’s new philanthropic endeavours. A Pivotal spokesperson confirmed that the agreement has been met, though it remains unclear when or where the remaining $1.7 billion was delivered.Bill and Melinda Gates co-founded the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000 and made it one of the world’s most influential philanthropic organisations.Over the years, the two have donated at least $52.6 billion to nonprofits, ranking them as the second-biggest givers globally.The Gates Foundation has also distributed around $83.3 billion in grants through 2024, funding initiatives from tuberculosis reduction to polio eradication. With an annual budget of $9 billion, it remains larger than the World Health Organization, which has a combined $6.2 billion budget for 2026–27.Melinda French Gates has been steadily building her own philanthropic ecosystem under Pivotal, founded in 2015. The umbrella organization now includes five foundations — Pivotal Philanthropies, Opportunities, Momentum, Pathways, and Firefinch — alongside a 501(c)(4) advocacy fund and Pivotal Ventures LLC, a private investment arm.In 2024, Pivotal Philanthropies distributed $487 million, including a landmark $250 million initiative supporting over 80 women’s health organizations worldwide. The smaller foundations, however, had not yet made charitable distributions as of their latest filings.","Melinda French Gates has been steadily building her own philanthropic ecosystem under Pivotal, founded in 2015.

Nokia CEO Justin Hotard has sene a message that both the US and Europe must work together, warning that the technology sector cannot survive on “one continent or the other”. His comments come as the European Union considers new measures to bolster homegrown industries and reduce its reliance on foreign technology companies.Hotard emphasised that the rapid scaling of modern technology requires the largest possible market access to justify the costs of innovation.“Every single one of us cannot subsist on one continent or the other. We need both. Particularly in technology, where the window and the right to win is dictated by that technology cycle, it's really critical that you have as big a market access as possible,” Hotard told Reuters in an interview Nokia CEO’s remarks highlight problems for companies like Nokia and Ericsson, who find themselves caught between European efforts to build ""technological sovereignty"" and their heavy reliance on the massive US market.The US lacks a major domestic manufacturer of 5G infrastructure, and after banning Chinese vendors over national security concerns, US carriers have become almost entirely dependent on Nokia, Ericsson, and South Korea’s Samsung for their wireless equipment.The CEO's comments are in line with a shift in Brussels, where the European Commission is proposing a phase-out of “high-risk vendors” from critical sectors, including 5G networks. Hotard has urged the EU to move beyond mere “recommendations” and make security guidelines mandatory for all operators.“Europe needs to support its business champions.

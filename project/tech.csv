UIDAI warns parents: Children’s Aadhaar may be deactivated without biometric update



Poll Are you aware that Aadhaar biometrics must be updated when a child turns 7? No, this is new to me Yes, already knew about it

UIDAI: Update Your Child’s Aadhaar biometrics for free



The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has issued a new advisory for the parents of children who have turned seven years old. UIDAI is urging the parents to complete the Mandatory Biometric Update (MBU) for children who have turned 7 years old. UIDAI has also warned that if the parents don’t complete the mandatory process then the Aadhaar card of their children will be deactivated. The warning comes as the UIDAI observes a significant number of children whose biometric data remains un-updated, despite existing regulations.As per the present rules under the Aadhaar Act 2016, children have to undergo a Mandatory Biometric Update (MBU) after five years of age. The process of MBU requires updating their fingerprints, iris scans, and facial images, as these attributes are considered mature enough for accurate capture at this age. However, UIDAI noticed that many parents have not complied with this requirement. So, UIDAI has now warned the parents that Aadhaar card of their children will get deactivated if they don’t get the biometrics updated.“Timely completion of MBU is an essential requirement for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of biometric data of children. If the MBU is not completed even after 7 years of age, the Aadhaar number may be deactivated, as per the existing rules,” said UIDAI.To address this gap, the UIDAI has started sending SMS messages to mobile numbers registered with the Aadhaar of children whose biometrics need to be updated. In the SMS UIDAI is urging the parents to complete the necessary MBU exercise.“As per existing rules, therefore, fingerprints, iris and photo are mandatorily required to be updated in his/her Aadhaar when the child reaches the age of five years. This is called first Mandatory Biometric Update (MBU). If the child performs the MBU between the age of five and seven years, it is free of cost. But after seven years of age, there is a prescribed fee of Rs. 100 only,” said UIDAI.“Timely completion of MBU is an essential requirement for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of biometric data of children. If the MBU is not completed even after 7 years of age, the Aadhaar number may be deactivated, as per the existing rules,” added UIDAI.","The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has issued a new advisory for the parents of children who have turned seven years old.

Before these reductions, Scale AI had a global workforce of 1,400 people. In a statement to CNBC, Scale AI spokesperson Joe Osborne confirmed the layoffs and noted that affected employees have been provided severance packages.Osborne told CNBC.Recently, Meta has been engaged in a major AI hiring effort to improve its competitive position against rivals like OpenAI and Google. As part of this push, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg selected Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang to serve as Meta’s chief AI officer, who is set to oversee the new Meta Superintelligence Labs organisation.

"Hackers can use just a radio to cause train accidents in US, CISA explains how",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/hackers-can-use-just-a-radio-to-cause-train-accidents-cisa-explains-how/articleshow/122591136.cms,"Representative Image

What CISA said about this train system vulnerability



“Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to send their own brake control commands to the end-of-train device, causing a sudden stoppage of the train, which may lead to a disruption of operations, or induce brake failure,” the CISA wrote in its advisory.”

What researchers said about this train system’s vulnerability



“So how bad is this? You could remotely take control over a Train’s brake controller from a very long distance away, using hardware that costs sub $500. You could induce brake failure leading to derailments or you could shutdown the entire national railway system.”

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued a warning about a key train system in the US. The warning specifically concerns the End-of-Train and Head-of-Train protocol, which the agency claims could be hacked using only a radio. This vulnerability stems from the system's lack of encryption and authentication protocols. The flaw involves the communication between a Flashing Rear End Device (FRED), or End-of-Train (EOT) device, attached to the back of a train, and a corresponding Head-of-Train (HOT) device in the locomotive. Installed in the 1980s to replace caboose cars, these devices can transmit data via radio signals, where commands can also be sent to the FRED to apply brakes at the rear of the train.The current system is dependent on data packets with a simple BCH checksum for error detection. However, CISA is now warning that a person using a software-defined radio could potentially send fake data packets, which would allow them to interfere with train operations.In its advisory, CISA wrote:CISA credited researchers Neil Smith and Eric Reuter for reporting this vulnerability. Moreover, in a post shared on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter) that he had first alerted the agency's predecessor, ICS-CERT, back in 2012 and no action was taken at the time.In his X post, Smith wrote:However, Smith noted that efforts to address a cybersecurity flaw stalled due to a disagreement between ICS-CERT and the Association of American Railroads (AAR) between 2012 and 2016, as the latter considered the risk too theoretical without real-world proof.When Smith raised the issue again in 2024, AAR still downplayed its importance, though it later announced plans to upgrade the outdated system in 2026.","The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued a warning about a key train system in the US.

Energy worries of Technology companies

US President Donald Trump announced $92 billion in energy and infrastructure deals intended to meet Big Tech's soaring demand for electricity to fuel the AI boom. Donald Trump made the announcement at the inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit at Carnegie Mellon University. Top executives from Google, Palantir, Anthropic, Exxon and Chevron attended the event. President Trump asserted about the need of beating China in the global AI race.""Today's commitments are ensuring that the future is going to be designed, built and made right here in Pennsylvania and right here in Pittsburgh, and I have to say, right here in the United States of America,"" Trump said at the event. He added, ""We are way ahead of China and the plants are starting up, the construction is starting up."" His comments reflect the growing sentiment in Washington that the United States must not lose ground to China in the race to develop AI.Among investments, Google committed $25 billion to build AI-ready data centers in Pennsylvania and surrounding regions. ""We support President Trump's clear and urgent direction that our nation invest in AI... so that America can continue to lead in AI,"" said Ruth Porat, Google's president and chief investment officer, as per a report in AFP.Google also announced a partnership with Brookfield Asset Management to modernize two hydropower facilities in Pennsylvania, representing 670 MW of capacity on the regional grid. Investment group Blackstone pledged more than $25 billion to fund new data centers and energy infrastructure.The tech world has fully embraced generative AI as the next wave of technology, but fears are growing that its massive electricity needs cannot be met by current infrastructure, particularly in the United States. Generative AI requires enormous computing power, mainly to run the energy-hungry processors from Nvidia, the California-based company that has become the world's most valuable company by market capitalization.Officials expect that by 2028, tech companies will need as much as five gigawatts of power for AI -- enough electricity to power roughly five million homes.",US President Donald Trump announced $92 billion in energy and infrastructure deals to meet Big Tech's soaring demand for electricity to fuel the AI boom.

Apple's former design director warns: Bring the culture, not the habits



“I came in thinking I was supposed to behave the way I behaved at Apple... That’s not really where Pinterest was at the time.”

Why ""slowing down"" matters when you join a new team



“When you go into a new culture, you need to slow down, deeply observe, don’t judge or compare.”

Carry strengths, not habits: The real transition challenge



Which of my strengths fit this culture?

How do I express them here?

How others have done it right



Common day‑one mistakes and how to avoid them

Starting a new job can feel like being dropped into a foreign country. You know the role, you know the company name, but the culture? That’s invisible. Former Apple design director Bob Baxley learned this the hard way when he jumped straight from Apple to Pinterest—“Friday to Monday”—and his Apple instincts clashed with Pinterest norms. He calls it being caught in Apple’s cultural imprint, or what Steve Jobs playfully dubbed “the Apple car wash.”According to Baxley, the biggest mistake people make on day one is not pausing to reset. Here’s why slowing down—and learning how to blend your past strengths with your new setting—is essential for your career success.Baxley shared how he “bounced off” Pinterest by carrying over Apple’s direct and intense style—an environment he thrived in at Cupertino but didn’t translate elsewhere. He said:He describes Apple’s culture as a “really powerful” imprint that sticks around long after you leave. To adapt effectively, Baxley recommends adopting a “personal period of adjustment”—a “car wash” to rinse off old workplace behaviours.In fast-paced industries—especially tech—you might not get a delay between jobs. But Baxley says that even then, you can buffer:That means listening more than speaking early on, watching how decisions are made, and noticing norms around communication, feedback, and risk. This approach keeps you from stepping on toes.Baxley isn’t saying throw away your toolbox—just be strategic about using it. He notes that your former employer hired you for your values—such as focus, detail, or creative rigour—but not necessarily for your past behaviours.So the key: pause, rethink, and ask yourself:That alignment not only earns you credibility, it also avoids cultural misfires.Baxley points to Hiroki Asai—a former Apple marketing VP who took several years off before joining Airbnb—as a good example. That “rewirement” gave him time to recalibrate his mindset, easing the cultural transition.If you can’t take a break, you can still mimic the effect by spending your first few weeks observing, learning, and asking questions—instead of immediately implementing.Even beyond tech, starting a new job often means tripping over invisible cultural patterns. Reddit users in r/Accounting recently shared first-week mistakes like rushing into tasks without checking procedures, then hiding them—it’s normal. The advice? Own your mistakes, document clearly, and ask for feedback early.This aligns with Baxley’s core tip: slow down, ask clarifying questions like ""Can you walk me through your preferred process?"" and adjust before acting.","Apple's former design director warns: Bring the culture, not the habits.

Remake of the world's costliest divorce: Car maker Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe’s voting control goes down after divorce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/remake-of-the-worlds-costliest-divorce-rivian-ceo-rj-scaringes-voting-control-slips-after-divorce-settlement/articleshow/122588046.cms,"Change in voting power at Rivian

New ownership structure of Rivian

There has been a remake, or kinda, of the world's costliest divorce, the one between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott. In 2019, Bezos and MacKenzie Scott got divorced. The break-up saw Scott receive 400 million shares in Amazon, lowering Bezos' stake. In a similar case, Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe has seen a slip in his voting control and ownership of the company following his divorce settlement. According to a regulatory filing, Rivian CEO Scaringe has transferred a portion of his ownership stake and voting power as part of a newly settled divorce proceeding.Scaringe founded Rivian in 2009. He got married in the year 2014. Records obtained from Orange County Superior Court show that Scaringe filed for divorce in October 2023, with his ex-wife agreeing to separate in another filing one month later.Scaringe’s ownership stake in Rivian was 2% prior to the divorce settlement, according to the proxy filing. But he had a 7.6% share of the voting power, thanks in part to the Class B stock, which comes with 10 votes per share. (Rivian’s Class A stock only comes with 1 vote per share.) The transfer of shares and options in the settlement cuts his voting power to around 4%.How many shares of Rivian have gone to RJ Scaringe’s wifeScaringe reportedly moved about 4 million shares and 6 million options to his ex-wife, Meagan Scaringe, on July 9 as part of the settlement, the filing shows. At Rivian’s current stock price, those shares and options could be worth roughly $130 million, though they have varying strike prices that would affect the total return if sold. The change in stock ownership comes at the end of a two-year-long divorce proceeding, court documents show.Scaringe owned more than 15 million shares of Class A stock and nearly 8 million Class B shares when the company submitted its annual proxy report April 29. As a result of the transfer, Scaringe’s voting power has slipped from 7.6% earlier this year to around 4%, the lowest since Rivian’s 2021 IPO.The ownership structure of Rivian has changed since its IPO in 2021. At that time, Amazon and Ford were among the largest stakeholders. This has changed now. Ford is largely out and Germany's Volkswagen Group has emerged as a major player. In late 2024, Rivian entered into a joint venture valued at $5.8 billion with Volkswagen focused on software and electrical architecture. Rivian has provided technology and employees to the joint venture, while Volkswagen has largely contributed money in the form of share purchases and convertible debt.As a result, Volkswagen now owns 12.3% of Rivian. This puts it slightly behind Amazon, which owned 14.2% of Rivian as of the April 2025 proxy filing. That’s enough to give Amazon the most voting power of any single shareholder: 13.3%.","Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe has transferred a portion of his ownership stake and voting power as part of a newly settled divorce proceeding.

Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for 'offensive' political slurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/poland-flags-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-to-the-eu-for-offensive-political-slurs/articleshow/122348777.cms,"Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for “offensive” political slurs

Why Poland says Elon Musk's Grok chatbot crossed a red line



Offensive answers: From antisemitic tropes to political insults



European digital rules put xAI under the spotlight



Previous incidents: Turkey, hate speech, and Grok’s growing rap sheet



xAI and Musk offer silence, at least for now



Poland just pulled the alarm on Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk ’s xAI. Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates. Poland’s complaint tees up an early test of those combined powers.Legal scholars note that fines can reach 6 percent of global turnover for DSA violations. For Musk’s empire, that runs into billions.Poland is not alone. A Turkish court ordered X to block Grok content that mocked President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Islamic beliefs.In June, users spotted the bot rambling about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. xAI blamed an “unauthorised change” to its response code.Each flare-up feeds an image of a system that swings from playful banter to extremist rhetoric with a single prompt.As of Wednesday afternoon, xAI had not replied to Reuters’ emailed questions, and Musk’s normally hyperactive X feed stayed quiet on the topic.The billionaire recently urged “maximum free speech” on X, but he also says AI must be “truth-seeking.” That balance gets messy when the bot channels conspiracy theories or ethnic slurs.","Poland says the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

Nvidia to resume selling H20 chips in China



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold an additional 225,000 shares of the chipmaker, amounting to approximately $37 million, as reported in a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing. A report said that this sale is part of a prearranged plan, adopted in March, allowing Huang to sell up to 6 million shares of the US-based GPU and artificial intelligence (AI)-chipmaking company.Huang began trading stock last month, and his most recent transaction, disclosed last Friday, also involved 225,000 shares, valued at around $36 million.According to CNBC, since Huang started selling stock this year, he has offloaded a total of 1.2 million shares, accumulating approximately $190 million, according to InsiderScore. In his prearranged plan from last year, he cashed in over $700 million.Huang wasn't the only stakeholder to sell Nvidia shares; board member Brooke Seawell also sold $16 million worth of stock.The soaring demand for AI and the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power large language models (LLMs) have boosted Huang’s net worth and propelled Nvidia past a $4 trillion market capitalisation, making it the most valuable company globally.This surge has placed Huang's net worth above that of Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett on Bloomberg's Billionaire Index.The development comes days after Nvidia announced this week that it plans to soon restart sales of its H20 chips to China. The Trump administration indicated it would approve the necessary export licenses. Earlier this year, the administration had stated that Nvidia would require such licenses to ship these chips, which were specifically designed for the Chinese market.","Huang began trading stock last month, and his most recent transaction, disclosed last Friday, also involved 225,000 shares, valued at around $36 million.

US President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, Mike Waltz , has claimed that the encrypted messaging app , Signal, which played a central role in the recent ""Signalgate"" scandal, was ""recommended"" to him. Waltz, who was removed from his post in May, said that he was using the commercially available app for discussing a sensitive military operation after it was recommended by the Biden administration . The incident in question involved him mistakenly adding The Atlantic editor, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a Signal group chat (that included Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, as well as other government officials) that was used to discuss a US military operation in Yemen. Testifying at a recent Senate hearing for his nomination as US ambassador to the United Nations, Waltz was questioned about a potential national security breach that was caused by the “mistake”.Responding to US Senator Chris Coons’ question about whether he had been investigated for using the app to discuss sensitive information, Waltz said, “The use of Signal, as an encrypted app, is not only authorised, it was recommended in the Biden era CISA guidance.”In this reply, Waltz was talking about a set of guidelines which was released by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in November 2024 to address cyber espionage activities linked to the People’s Republic of China. CISA is the federal body tasked with safeguarding cybersecurity and infrastructure across the US government and states.According to a report by The Independent, this advisory was intended to be general guidance. The CISA policy introduced during the Biden administration, which was aimed specifically at government employees, also discouraged using personal devices for work-related tasks, the report notes.At the same time, the Department of Defence also had a stricter policy which explicitly prohibited Signal and other encrypted commercial messaging apps. The policy stated that they were “not authorised to access, transmit, process non-public DoD information,” the report adds.However, Waltz and other Trump officials have maintained that no classified information was shared in their group chat and that Signal was authorised to some extent. While defending his use of the app. Waltz reiterated this point to Senator Coons.","Mike Waltz, former national security adviser, said Signal app was'recommended' to him.

Company morale hits rock bottom amid restructuring

Microsoft 's King division, the developers of popular game Candy Crush, had laid off around 200 employees, and now these human workers will reportedly be replaced by artificial intelligence tools they helped create, according to multiple sources speaking to. This comes as Microsoft pushed its gaming division into broader restructuring, cutting thousands of jobs across Xbox and its subsidiaries earlier this month.Designers, user researchers, UX writers, and narrative copywriters who spent years building and training these AI systems, are the ones now being replaced for now. King's London-based Farm Heroes Saga team also faces severe cuts, with sources indicating about 50 people, roughly half the team, will be made redundant, including key leadership positions.""Most of level design has been wiped, which is crazy since they've spent months building tools to craft levels quicker,"" said one King staffer speaking anonymously to. ""Now those AI tools are basically replacing the teams. Similarly the copywriting team is completely removing people since we now have AI tools that those individuals have been creating.""The situation has created widespread frustration among remaining employees. ""The fact AI tools are replacing people is absolutely disgusting but it's all about efficiency and profits even though the company is doing great overall,"" the same source continued. ""If we're introducing more feedback loops then it's crazy to remove the developers themselves, we need more hands and less leadership.""Sources indicate the total number of cuts may exceed the initially reported 200 positions, with centralized staff in research and quality assurance also being eliminated. A recent internal employee survey conducted before the layoffs showed morale was already at an all-time low, with one person familiar with the results saying it's now ""in the gutter.""The restructuring affects King's offices in London, Barcelona, Stockholm, and Berlin, with many employees remaining in limbo throughout the summer as union negotiations continue. Senior staff have been placed on gardening leave ahead of expected September departures.","Microsoft's King division, the developers of popular game Candy Crush, laid off around 200 employees.

The IT firm sent an email to its employees last week, informing them about the variable payout, which the publications claims to have seen a copy of. “All employees up to C2 grade (or equivalent grades) covered under the QVA plan will receive 100% of the Quarterly Variable Allowance (QVA).

Windows 11 upgrade becomes essential for latest Office tools

Microsoft has quietly announced it will stop delivering new features to Office apps for Windows 10 users starting in August 2026, marking another significant step in the company's push to migrate users to Windows 11. While security updates will continue until October 2028, the feature freeze effectively forces users seeking the latest Office capabilities to upgrade their operating system.The timeline varies by subscription type: Microsoft 365 Personal and Family users will lose access to new features with version 2608 in August 2026, while enterprise customers face cutoffs between October 2026 and January 2027 depending on their update channel. All versions will remain frozen at the 2608 feature set regardless of subscription tier.Microsoft's decision represents a significant shift from its previous commitments. The company had originally planned to end Office support alongside Windows 10's October 2025 end-of-life date but reversed course earlier this year following user backlash. However, as The Verge first reported, the company failed to initially disclose that new features would be restricted starting in 2026.The change means Windows 10 users experiencing Office issues unique to their platform will receive limited support. Microsoft's official guidance directs such users to upgrade to Windows 11, with support staff providing only ""troubleshooting assistance"" and warning that ""technical workarounds might be limited or unavailable.""This move aligns with Microsoft's broader strategy to accelerate Windows 11 adoption. Despite Windows 11 recently overtaking Windows 10 as the most-used desktop OS, millions of devices still run the older system. The company has offered various incentives for upgrading, including free extended security updates for Windows 10 users who enable Windows Backup or pay $30 per device.For users unwilling or unable to upgrade, Office web apps will remain an alternative for accessing new features.

As AI evolves, it paves the way for a brighter, more intelligent future for all.As we celebrate AI Appreciation Day, it’s clear that people expect more from smart brands than just automated features - they’re seeking technology that understands, adapts, and truly adds value to their daily lives. In India, we’re witnessing a remarkable evolution: consumers are moving past surface-level AI toward solutions that address authentic challenges and drive meaningful improvements.Over the last few years, AI has become a crucial component driving bold transformations. By cutting through complexity, it empowers faster, smarter decisions that drive real business outcomes. The future belongs to organisations that align people, purpose, and plans to harness AI’s full potential. Operational excellence is just the beginning; inclusive intelligence is the destination.AI is fundamentally reshaping how businesses operate and innovate within India’s fast-paced digital economy. Today, embracing AI has become essential for keeping pace with evolving industry demands and unlocking new opportunities. One of the clearest signs of AI’s growing influence is the wave of entrepreneurial interest in the area.On AI Appreciation Day, we're reminded that the true power of artificial intelligence lies not in complexity, but in its ability to intuitively simplify our lives. The best AI quietly adapts to people learning preferences, enhancing comfort, and making everyday living more efficient from behind the scenes.It is not an overstatement to say that the adoption of AI is moving at breakneck speed. The ease of using generative AI to create and enhance content is having a far-reaching impact on people’s lives. AI tools and capabilities continue to evolve. Unfortunately, the AI-based tools that are powering innovation, productivity, and efficiency in business are also being used by cyber attackers to develop and scale increasingly complex, sophisticated, and evasive cyber threats. Organisations need their own, powerful multimodal AI security that can detect and neutralize AI-based attacks regardless of whether they are delivered in an image or a QR code, and even if the language and sender seem completely legitimate.AI’s real promise lies in augmenting—not replacing—human capability. We are entering an era of Dual Intelligence, where the combination of human judgment and machine precision creates exponential value. Whether it’s transforming enterprise data into decisions or enabling an AI-ready workforce, the focus must remain on purposeful application. AI Appreciation Day is a timely reminder that the future of innovation is rooted in collaboration between people and intelligent systems, driving outcomes that are scalable, ethical, and inclusive.AI has already started to change how people experience their personal devices. Much like how smartphones transformed how we connect, AI is now powering a shift in how we create, work, and interact with PCs. The focus is moving beyond performance towards building machines that are more intuitive, ones that understand, evaluate, and adapt to the user experience in real time. We’re seeing everyday tasks become smarter, creative workflows get faster, and personalisation move to an entirely new level. Early AI PC benchmarks have shown up to 40% better battery efficiency and significant performance gains in AI-accelerated tasks.","AI Appreciation Day, observed annually on July 16, celebrates the transformative power of artificial intelligence in shaping our world.

Amid its AI hiring spree, Facebook-parent Meta has reportedly hired another two researchers – Jason Wei and Hyung Won Chung from Sam Altman-led OpenAI. According to a Wired report, OpenAI has deactivated the internal Slack account of both the researchers. As per the report, both Wei and Chung have a close working relationship. Meta has been on a hiring spree in recent times. The company has aggressively hired talent from rival companies – Apple, GoogleDeepMind, GitHub and others. Meta is allegedly offering up to $300 million over four years to its top AI talent.As per Wired report, Jason Wei worked on OpenAI’s o3 and deep search models. He joined the company in 2023. Before OpenAI, he worked at Google on chain-of-thought research, that involves training an AI model to process complex queries step-by-step.A self-described “diehard” at OpenAI, Wei became deeply passionate about reinforcement learning — a way of teaching AI by giving it rewards for good actions and penalties for mistakes. This method has become an important part of AI research, and many of the experts recently hired by Meta for its superintelligence team are specialists in this field.Hyung Won Chung also joined OpenAI in 2023. He worked on some of the same projects at the company as Wei. These included deep research and OpenAI’s o1 model. His research is primarily focused on reasoning and agents, the website says.Interestingly,. Chung overlapped with Wei at Google as well, and joined OpenAI at the same time as Wei.Dell CEO Michael Dell has raised concerns about the internal culture impact Meta may face due to its aggressive hiring of artificial intelligence talent from rivals – Google DeepMind, OpenAI, GitHub, Apple and others. Speaking on the BG2 podcast hosted by Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner on Thursday, Dell warned that bringing in top AI professionals at high salaries could lead to dissatisfaction among existing staff at Meta Platforms. “It’ll be a challenge culturally for sure,” Dell said.He further explained that offering higher pay to new hires could make current employees feel left out or underappreciated, which may result in friction within teams and create a long line of “complaining” employees outside CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s office.",Facebook-parent Meta has reportedly hired two researchers from OpenAI.

"'Chinese threat' that made Donald Trump make deal with China is now worrying TV, speaker, smartwatch and other electronics makers in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinese-threat-that-made-donald-trump-make-deal-with-china-is-now-worrying-tv-speaker-smartwatch-and-other-electronics-makers-in-india/articleshow/121961105.cms,"Rare Metal worries 'come to India'

What are '17 Elements' called Rare Earth Minerals

China’s control over critical minerals, also called Rare earth metals/minerals, is reportedly a powerful bargaining chip in trade talks, as seen in recent US-China discussions. By easing export restrictions, China can secure concessions, such as tariff relief or relaxed visa policies, as hinted in negotiations where Trump claimed progress on access to Chinese magnets and mineralsThe America's reliance on China for these minerals is seen as a strategic vulnerability. In April, China reportedly restricted rare earth mineral exports in response to Trump’s tariff increases. The export restrictions on rare earth minerals is said to have made President Donald Trump furious. On June 11, Trump announced on Truth Social that China agreed to supply the U.S. with these minerals as part of a trade deal, calling it “done”.Similar worries about rare earth metals has reportedly come closer home. China's export controls on rare earth metals, particularly Terbium and Dysprosium used in Neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, is reportedly creating panic among speakers, wearables, and television and some other consumer electronic manufacturers in India. According to a report in Economic Times, China’s export control licensing of rare earth metals is worrying electronics companies who are sitting on thin supplies of permanent magnets with the threat of production coming to a standstill looming large, industry executives and associations said.Among the seven rare earth metals facing restricted exports, Terbium and Dysprosium are critical components in Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) magnets, or permanent magnets, which is the preferred choice for high-performance, portable and compact audio products. These magnets are said to be vital for high-performance audio products, constitute 5-7% of the bill of materials, with India importing nearly 100% from China, per ELCINA 's whitepaper.ELCINA warned that the inability to procure NdFeB magnets could halt speaker production in Noida, Chennai, and Pune, potentially forcing OEMs to import finished speakers, undermining the ""Make in India"" initiative. Chinese port delays, requiring end-use declarations, are further disrupting speaker assembly units, delaying supplies to domestic TV and audio brands.According to the report, the industry body has claimed that shipments of magnets and even finished products with embedded magnets are being stopped at Chinese ports, pending end-use declarations. This is leading to production disruptions of speaker assembly units in India, delaying supplies to customers including domestic TV and audio brands.Indian manufacturers and importers are seeking government-issued end-use certificates to meet Chinese export requirements. IESA president Ashok Chandak attributed the crisis partly to India’s lack of local processing capabilities and overreliance on imports, despite having critical mineral reserves. He told ET that the current situation can be partially blamed on Indian manufacturers who ignored the risk back in 2020.Since China’s April export control announcement, magnet prices have risen 15%, with costs doubling when sourced from Japan, Vietnam, or recycled Indian suppliers, per ELCINA’s analysis.Rare earth minerals are a group of 17 elements, including Scandium, Yttrium, and the 15 Lanthanides, found in the Earth’s crust. Despite their name, they are relatively abundant, but extracting and processing them is complex, costly, and environmentally damaging. These minerals are critical for high-tech industries, powering everything from smartphone screens and electric vehicle motors to defense systems and medical devices.","China's export controls on rare earth metals, particularly Terbium and Dysprosium used in Neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, is reportedly creating panic among speakers, wearables, and television manufacturers in India.

"Why is US breeding flies in Texas, near Mexico border",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-is-us-breeding-flies-in-texas-near-mexico-border/articleshow/121960640.cms,"An adult New World screwworm fly sits at rest in this undated photo. (Denise Bonilla/U.S. Department of Agriculture via AP)

The U.S. government has announced plans to open a facility in Texas by year’s end to breed millions of sterile New World screwworm flies, aiming to protect American cattle from a flesh-eating parasite that has reemerged in southern Mexico. The $8.5 million facility, to be built at Moore Air Base near the Mexican border, will release sterile male flies to mate with females, preventing the production of larvae that feed on living tissue.Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, speaking at a news conference alongside Texas and cattle industry officials, emphasized the urgency of the initiative. “The United States has defeated NWS before, and we will do it again,” she said, referencing the successful eradication of the screwworm in the U.S. during the 1960s. The new facility will be only the second of its kind in the Western Hemisphere, joining one in Panama that produces about 100 million sterile flies weekly.The screwworm’s recent spread in southern Mexico, detected as close as 700 miles from the U.S. border, prompted the U.S. to suspend imports of live cattle, horses, and bison from Mexico last month. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also plans to invest $21 million to convert a fruit fly-breeding facility near Mexico’s border with Guatemala into one for screwworm flies, though it won’t be operational for 18 months. The Texas facility could produce up to 300 million flies per week, significantly bolstering efforts to curb the parasite’s northward migration.The National Beef Cattlemen’s Association president, Buck Wehrbein, underscored the economic threat to ranchers, noting that Moore Air Base previously hosted a similar facility in the 1960s. “The only way to protect the American cattle herd from the devastating threat of New World screwworm is by having a sufficient supply of sterile flies to push this pest away from our border,” he said.Mexican Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegué welcomed the plan, calling it a “positive step” for U.S.-Mexico cooperation in a post on X. He expressed optimism that cattle exports could resume soon based on USDA inspections.The screwworm, which can infest any mammal including pets and occasionally humans, poses a broader risk. Kansas Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith highlighted concerns about wildlife, such as feral pigs and deer, potentially carrying the parasite across borders unchecked. Texas officials praised the federal response, while other states remain vigilant, emphasizing the need for sterile flies to outnumber fertile ones to halt the pest’s advance.","The $8.5 million facility will be built at Moore Air Base near the Mexican border.

Bill Gates spent $38 million on equestrian real estate for daughter Jennifer

A 4.5-acre horse farm for $8.7 million.

In 2016, he bought a neighboring 4.5-acre estate for $13.5 million.

He then snapped up two vacant lots for around $5 million.

Another 5.2-acre compound with barns and residential buildings was acquired for $8.7 million.

Finally, a 1.3-acre plot was purchased for $2.5 million to complete the puzzle.

‘Like Pac-Man’: Bill Gates quietly bought out an entire neighborhood

The Bill Gates’ approach to parenting

“We absolutely did not just buy them things. It was much more of an upbringing like I grew up in. A very middle-class household where money did dictate whether I got an extra pair of shoes that year or not.”

Jennifer Gates: From equestrian star to pediatrician

“Pediatrician incoming!!!”

“This is a dream come true,”

After Stanford, Jennifer Gates got a 124-acre horse estate

A father’s gift, a daughter’s dream



“Beyond a certain point, it’s the same hamburger.”

When it comes to supporting their children’s passions, most parents settle for lessons, gear, or maybe even a trip to a championship. But when you're Bill Gates , the Microsoft co-founder and one of the richest men in the world, the scale of parental support takes a whole new dimension.In what might be one of the most extravagant gestures of modern parenthood, Gates reportedly spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams. What began as a simple rental in 2011 evolved into a strategic series of acquisitions that transformed the elite Mallet Hill Court neighborhood into a private horse-centric haven, complete with barns, mansions, and lots of privacy.The Gates family initially dipped their toes into Wellington’s equestrian scene in 2011, renting a home for four months at a cost of $500,000. Their teenage daughter, Jennifer, was already training as a competitive show jumper, and Wellington, a hub for global equestrian sports, was the perfect base.By 2013, Bill Gates had made his first major purchase:From there, the acquisitions accelerated:In total, Bill Gates acquired 18 acres of land, effectively transforming a residential street into a private equestrian neighborhood.The scale and strategy of the acquisitions caught local attention. As one local told the Daily Mail, Gates was “gobbling up properties like Pac-Man.” Many purchases were reportedly made at two to three times the appraised market value, all in a bid to secure surrounding lots and guarantee privacy for Jennifer and her team.Stuart Roffman, a former property owner on the street, explained that despite the gated entrance, the activity level was still high. “Between trucks, stable hands, grooms, and house staff, that's a lot of people on a small street,” he noted. Gates’ solution? Buy the neighbors out.Although the purchase spree appears lavish, Melinda French Gates defended their parenting approach in a 2024 interview with The New York Times, saying,She emphasised that Jennifer and her siblings were raised with allowances, chores, and boundaries. “They were explicitly told not to mention private jets to their classmates,” Melinda added, underscoring an attempt to keep their lives grounded, despite the multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio.Now 29 years old, Jennifer Gates has successfully balanced her equestrian career with impressive academic achievements. A graduate of Stanford University, she later attended medical school and recently announced her residency in Pediatrics Research at Mount Sinai, one of her top choices.In a recent Instagram post, she wrote:she added, celebrating the match to her desired program.Jennifer is now married to Olympic show jumper Nayel Nassar and continues to compete in equestrian events while working in the medical field.Florida isn’t the only state where Jennifer enjoys equestrian luxury. For her graduation from Stanford, the Gates family purchased a 124-acre equestrian estate in North Salem, New York, reportedly worth $15.8 million. The property, located near New York City, consists of three large parcels, giving her ample space to house horses, practice riding, and enjoy countryside serenity. She often shares glimpses of her quiet life there on social media. The estate also serves as a base for her continued training and competitions.Bill Gates once downplayed the perks of wealth by saying,But in this case, the metaphorical burger came with a mansion, barns, paddocks, and full-time staff. What began as a teenager’s passion has turned into a lifestyle, supported by one of the most influential tech moguls in history.While many parents support their children's hobbies with encouragement or a few lessons, Bill Gates offered Jennifer a community, a sanctuary, and the freedom to chase her dreams without compromise. His investment wasn’t just financial—it was deeply personal. It showed how belief in a child’s passion can create a legacy beyond wealth.","Bill Gates spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams.

Sacks says Chinese companies moving fast in AI chip-making

David Sacks , the White House's AI and crypto czar, has warned that the United States' overly strict chip export rules could weaken its long-term tech dominance, potentially boosting Chinese rivals. He pointed to January's "" DeepSeek moment "" where the launch of the AI model revealed China was perhaps only ""three to six months behind"" in AI capabilities, a much smaller gap than previously believed.In a Bloomberg Television interview (via Business Insider), Sacks emphasised that China is rapidly closing the AI gap, urging the US to rethink its chip export controls if it intends to maintain its leading edge. He pointed to a ""DeepSeek moment"" in January, where the launch of the Chinese AI model revealed China was perhaps only ""three to six months behind"" in AI capabilities, a much smaller gap than previously believed.Despite current ""supply-constrained"" conditions for chip production in China, Sacks predicts this will change quickly. While he estimates China might be one and a half to two years behind the US in chip design, companies like Huawei are ""moving fast"" to catch up.""Even before they fully caught up, I think you will see them exporting their chips for the global market,"" Sacks cautioned. He warned that if the US becomes ""overly restrictive in terms of US sales to the world,"" it risks a future where ""Huawei is everywhere.""Sacks' concerns echo sentiments from other prominent tech leaders. At the Computex Taipei tech conference in May, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that US chip export rules were a ""failure"" because they spurred Chinese tech development. Huang noted that Nvidia's market share in China has plummeted from 95% four years ago to 50%, attributing this decline directly to the export controls.","Sacks says Chinese companies moving fast in AI chip-making.

Thank you for being such an important part of Scale.

It is an honor to step into the role of interim CEO at Scale during such a pivotal moment for our company and the broader AI landscape. I can’t thank Alex enough for what he built and I’m honored that he and the Board have chosen me to shepherd it into the future. I’m incredibly energized by the conversations I've had this week, and I want to take this opportunity to share my vision and correct some misunderstandings.

Scale has always been at the forefront of innovation, and as we embark on the next stage of Scale we're not just continuing that legacy – we're accelerating it.

The Meta Deal

Let's first talk about the news of the past week. I know there's been a lot of news reporting, but some of it has been incorrect or misunderstood. Unlike some other recent tech deals you might have heard about in the AI space, this is not a pivot or a winding down. Scale remains, unequivocally, an independent company.

This deal rewards many of the people who helped build Scale into what it is today, but more importantly to me, it's also a validation of the course we're on. Scale remains a well-resourced company, with multiple promising lines of business and a seasoned leadership team to help them grow. I've been pleasantly surprised by the inbound interest from technical and non-technical people in joining our team, and I hope to announce additional leaders soon.

And let me make one point absolutely clear: nothing has changed about our

commitment to protecting customer data. Security, privacy, and customer trust have always been core to our business, and we will continue to ensure the right protections are in place to help safeguard all of our work with customers.

Building an Agentic Future

To our customers: we’re not slowing down. Our focus on data and applications remains unwavering, and we are building products in service of an agentic future. One where AI is aligned with human values, and it is used to improve our lives, our governments, and the services we use every day.

Data: Our Enduring Foundation

Data is the foundation of our business today, and it will remain a critical component of our success going forward. We remain one of the only providers capable of serving customers at volume, a testament to our robust infrastructure and expertise.

The need for high-quality data for AI models remains significant, and with the largest network of experts training AI, we are set up well to help model builders keep pushing the frontier of what’s possible.

We will also continue to be model-agnostic. When everyone in the industry learns and improves, the world improves. Our research teams will continue to publish cutting-edge research and develop unbiased leaderboards that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of every model.

Of course what fueled our growth in the past, won’t be enough to fuel our growth in the future. That’s why we are continuing to evolve and expand.

We are a diversified business. We are more than just data labeling. But I get it – labels stick.

Applications: The Limitless Horizon

Over the past several years, long before this deal, we were already building out our applications business units. These units span across governments and enterprises, and are focused on building AI applications for our customers that protect Americans, personalize education, improve healthcare, speed up drug discovery, and make customer service better.

We already work with numerous global businesses, the U.S. Government, and governments abroad, but we are going to double down on building applications because that is where we see the future, and that is where we can best service an ever-growing roster of customers.

And as we move towards an agentic future, where AI is embedded in almost everything we do, Scale will continue to be the company that ensures AI retains a human touch. Internally, we often talk about the need to strengthen human sovereignty – the concept that humans must retain control over AI and that AI stays aligned with our values. As a company built around the human aspect of AI, that call to action will remain central to Scale.

I'm incredibly optimistic about our future. We have an exceptional team, a clear vision, and the resources to achieve truly remarkable things. In the coming months, we’ll be sharing some exciting announcements that will further illustrate how we are better positioned for success than ever before.

Thank you for your continued dedication and belief in Scale.

Sincerely,

Jason Droege, Interim CEO, Scale

Meta recently made an investment of $14.4 billion in ScaleAI — an AI data labelling firm. Meta’s $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, previously valued at $14 billion, includes the transition of Scale’s CEO, Alexandr Wang , to Meta, where he will lead efforts to develop “superintelligence.” This has intensified worries among Scale’s clients, particularly generative AI companies, that their sensitive research priorities and technical blueprints could be accessed by Meta through Scale’s data-labeling operations. Now, Scale AI 's interim CEO, Jason Droege has posted a message assuring its employees, customers and investors that the company is ‘not shutting down’.Dorge published a letter on the company’s blog addressing the recent speculation and concerns. Dorge said, “Unlike some other recent tech deals you might have heard about in the AI space, this is not a pivot or a winding down."" He also stressed that Scale AI remains an ""unequivocally, independent company.""The recent ScaleAI deal gave Meta 49% non-voting stake in the company. This latest investment raised questions and concerns among competitors. Reports also suggested that Scale AI's major clients, including OpenAI and Google are also re-assessing their partnerships due to concerns about potential conflicts of interest with Meta.","Jason Droege, interim CEO of ScaleAI, explains the company's plans for the future. He says Scale will continue to be the company that ensures AI retains a human touch. The company's focus on data and applications remains unwavering, he says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121955916,imgsize-20370,width-400,resizemode-4/scale.jpg"

Bill Gates-backed nuclear power startup TerraPower has raised $650 million to support the ongoing development of its advanced nuclear reactor project in Wyoming. The funding round includes new investors like NVentures, the venture capital arm of Nvidia , and existing backers such as Gates and South Korean company HD Hyundai. The money will help continue construction of the 345-megawatt plant being built at the site of a retiring coal facility in Wyoming. The reactor aims to provide steady, carbon-free electricity to meet the growing demand from industries such as artificial intelligence and data centers.Nvidia’s investment highlights growing ties between the tech industry—which needs clean, reliable power for data centers and AI—and nuclear energy firms working on new reactor designs.“As AI continues to transform industries, nuclear energy is going to become a more vital energy source to help power these capabilities,” said Mohamed Siddeek, head of NVentures, in a statement.TerraPower’s reactor design has been developed in partnership with the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Project. It includes a 345-megawatt small modular reactor (SMR) combined with a molten salt energy storage system. This setup allows it to boost output up to 1 gigawatt when needed, helping balance supply and demand.Construction has already started on the non-nuclear parts of the facility, but full regulatory approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission is not expected until 2026, according to The Register.The company had initially aimed to launch in 2028, but faced delays after losing access to its Russian fuel supply following the invasion of Ukraine.","Bill Gates-backed nuclear power startup TerraPower has raised $650 million to support the ongoing development of its advanced nuclear reactor project in Wyoming.

Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly looking to bring former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman on board, reports The Information. As per the report, the aim is to support the company’s artificial intelligence efforts. The report quoted a person familiar with the matter. It said that the social media giant is also in talks with Daniel Gross—Friedman's partner at investment firm NFDG—about a potential role related to AI at Meta. Additionally, Meta is considering a partial buyout of NFDG, the report said.These developments come as major tech firms continue to invest heavily in AI to maintain a competitive edge. Last week, Meta announced a $14.8 billion investment in Scale AI, its second-largest investment to date. The company also hired Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang to lead its newly formed superintelligence unit.Friedman currently serves on Meta’s Advisory Group, an external council that offers guidance on technology and product strategy.As mentioned above, the company hired 28-year-old Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang as Superintelligence Chief recently. Meta signed an investment of $14.3 billion in Scale AI, taking a 49% stake in a deal. Confirming the partnership, Meta said: “We will deepen the work we do together producing data for AI models, and Alexandr Wang will join Meta to work on our superintelligence efforts.”Sending a memo to ScaleAI employees, Wang confirmed his exit from the company. He will remain on Scale’s board. Scale’s Chief Strategy Officer, Jason Droege, will serve as interim CEO. Wang also told employees that a small number of Scale’s 1,500 workers will join him at Meta.","Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly looking to bring former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman on board.

In order to encourage the young tech professionals, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma has shared a candid message. Jack Ma emphasised that professioanls should make mistakes in the career journey and also urged them not to shy away from failures. Speaking at a recent event, Ma said that techies in their 20s and 30s should learn to embrace failure. “When you are 20 to 30 years old, follow a good boss,” he advised. “Learn how to do things properly. It’s not about success yet—it’s about building your foundation”.Ma stressed on the fact that early career blunders are not just missteps but are important learning experiences. He also highlighted that he himself faced a lot of rejections throughout his early life. He revealed that he failed university exams multiple times and was turned down from 30 jobs including a position at KFC. Yet, he never regretted these failures, seeing each as a stepping stone.Ma stressed on the importance of perseverance and said, “You fall, you stand up, you fall, you stand up.” The tech billionaire mentioned that success is not about avoiding mistakes, but learning from them and also using them to grow further. He also pointed out that when one succeeds, then the past mistakes become ‘legendary’ stories and failures simply become ‘garbage’.Along with this, Jack Ma also advises the young techies to focus on finding a ‘good boss’ rather than a ‘good company’ before the age of 30. He feels that a good mentor can teach valuable professional and life lessons which function as a strong foundation for the future entrepreneurial journey. After 30 he encourages individuals to take more risks and work for themselves and by 40 the individual should focus on what they want. Finally after 50, Ma suggests them to focus on supporting and empowering younger generations.Jack Ma's own journey from an English teacher to building a global e-commerce empire like Alibaba is a testament to his belief in learning from mistakes and never giving up.",Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma has shared a candid message to young tech professionals.

By samad hoqueGURGAON: Three years after his motorcycle vanished without a trace, Tilak Raj's phone buzzed with an unexpected message. It was a traffic challan notification from Punjab Police. For Tilak, it wasn't just a fine he needed to pay. It was the first clue to his stolen bike's whereabouts.According to the text — delivered on Aug 30 last year — Tilak's bike — HR26DS7409 — was fined Rs 500 for ""violation of mandatory signs"" near Old Neelon Bridge in Bohapur, Punjab. Over the next few months, the message triggered a frustrating chase that cost him more than just money — hope to find his bike.The shop owner's ordeal began on Jan 3, 2021, when his Hero Honda CD Deluxe disappeared from outside his shop in Sector 14. His wife, Renu Bala, promptly filed a police complaint, but the case gathered dust until that fateful text last Aug.""I still remember the day that message popped up on my phone. I was down with fever. It was my wife who showed me the text. The shock of seeing a challan for our stolen motorcycle was enough to make me forget my illness,"" recalled Tilak.With renewed energy and a flicker of hope, the couple approached police again, expecting swift action this time.But bureaucratic hurdles and apparent indifference continued to plague their case.""I made countless rounds of the police station. My primary concern was that the bike could be used for illegal activities,"" the shop owner said.Tilak's frustration grew when the cops did not act despite the challan clearly indicating the bike's location in neighbouring Punjab. ""I asked police what kept them waiting even after the challan. They said they were yet to get approval from higher authorities,"" he said.When some cops cited travel expenses as a barrier, Tilak took matters into his own hands.The shop owner offered his personal i20 to police and funded a trip to Bohapur in Ludhiana this May. The expedition cost him nearly Rs 7,000 — Rs 3,830 for fuel, Rs 1,100 for toll taxes, and Rs 2,000 for meals.The outcome? A double disappointment.Not only did the cops return empty-handed, but Tilak's car suffered damage as well. ""It stood at the police station for two days. When I tried to start it, both the fuel tank and battery were dead,"" he rued.Finally, responding to Renu Bala's renewed complaint after the text in Aug 2024, an FIR was registered at Sector 14 police station for theft this Tuesday. The motorcycle, valued at around Rs 40,000, is still untraced.Asked about the delay in registering the FIR, ASI Omprakash Yadav said that he took charge of the probe only recently and needed to know the case in detail.""I received the complaint only yesterday (Tuesday). As of now, I don't know who handled the case previously. We hope to apprehend the culprit soon,"" the ASI said on Wednesdau.Meanwhile, as Gurgaon police begin their chase, Tilak waits for another challan — hoping it would give fresh leads about his bike's latest location.","Hero Honda CD Deluxe disappeared from outside Tilak Raj's shop in Gurgaon in Jan 2021.

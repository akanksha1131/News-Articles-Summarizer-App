Nadella cautions employees about future of technology



Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has revealed that he is “haunted” by the possibility of Microsoft not surviving the era of artificial intelligence (AI). Speaking at an employee-only town hall, Nadella was responding to a question about a perceived change in the company's culture, but his answer also exposed his personal fears about the company's future.“Some of the biggest businesses we’ve built might not be as relevant going forward,” Nadella said in the town hall last week, as per The Verge.He cited Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) as a cautionary tale of a once-dominant tech company that disappeared after it failed to adapt to new technologies like the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture.“Our industry is full of case studies of companies that were great once, that just disappeared. I’m haunted by one particular one called DEC,” said Nadella, adding that DEC, a leader in the early 1970s, faced competition from IBM and others, making it irrelevant.The CEO, who said his first computer was a DEC VAX and that he always wanted to work there, reflected on what it takes for a company to not only thrive but to continue attracting top talent.“Some of the people who contributed to Windows NT came from a DEC lab that was laid off,” Nadella noted. His remarks were made in response to an employee from the UK who described the company's atmosphere as “markedly different, colder, more rigid, and lacking in the empathy we have come to value.”The Microsoft CEO recently told employees that the company needs to “do better” in rebuilding trust with its workforce, while accepting a perceived lack of empathy in the company’s culture“I deeply appreciate that, the question and the sentiment behind it. I take it as feedback for me and everyone in the leadership team, because at the end of the day, I think we can do better, and we will do better,” as per an audio obtained by CNBC.",Nadella was responding to a question about a perceived change in the company's culture.

How hackers used ChatGPT to create fake ID cards



Apple Watch Ultra 3, Series 11 & SE 3 – Which One Should You Buy?





A suspected North Korean hacking group has used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card, a report claims. According to cybersecurity researchers, these fake IDs was reportedly used to make a phishing attempt more credible by linking to malware that could extract data from the recipient's device. The cyber-espionage unit, which researchers have dubbed Kimsuky, is suspected of being sponsored by North Korea and has been linked to other spying efforts against South Korean targets. The US Department of Homeland Security previously stated that Kimsuky is likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence-gathering mission. The details were published in a report by the South Korean cybersecurity firm Genians.During their investigation into forged identification documents, Genians researchers tested ChatGPT. While the system initially refused to generate a government ID (which is illegal under South Korean law) however, adjusting the prompt allowed the restriction to be bypassed.Mun Chong-hyun, director at Genians said that the broader trend shows how attackers are turning to AI for tasks such as planning attacks, developing malware, creating hacking tools, and impersonating recruiters.In July, cybersecurity firm Genians shared its latest findings on signs of suspected North Korean operatives using AI in intelligence-gathering.Later on, in August, Anthropic reported that North Korean hackers had leveraged its Claude Code tool to secure remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies. The AI system assisted them in crafting fake identities, passing coding tests, and even delivering technical work once hired.Earlier, in February, the company said it had banned accounts linked to North Korea that were using its service to generate fraudulent resumes, cover letters, and social media content to support recruitment schemes.Recent phishing attempts targeted South Korean journalists, researchers, and human rights activists focusing on North Korea. Emails appeared to come from an address ending in .mli.kr, mimicking a South Korean military domain. The number of victims remains unclear.US officials have long accused North Korea of running cyber operations, cryptocurrency theft, and IT contracting schemes to collect intelligence and generate revenue. Washington alleges that the funds support Pyongyang’s efforts to evade sanctions and advance its nuclear weapons program.","Hackers used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Tesla recently proposed a $1 trillion pay package for the company’s CEO Elon Musk . The pay package has drawn fresh criticism, this time from Pope Leo XIV, who warned it reflects dangerous levels of inequality in society. In a media interview, published by Crux last week as part of a new biography by Senior Correspondent Elise Ann Allen, the Pope said such outsized compensation highlights the widening gap between workers and corporate executives.“Yesterday the news that Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world. What does that mean and what's that about?” Pope Leo said. “The Chicago-born linked Musk’s pay deal to growing polarization in both society and the Catholic Church. “CEOs that 60 years ago might have been making four to six times more than what the workers are receiving … 600 times more (now),” he said. He warned that if money alone defines value, “then we’re in big trouble.”Musk’s package has been at the center of debate in recent months. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders called it “grossly immoral” and “insane economics,” while Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended it as a reward for “doing things that no one else has done before.”Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas described it as a “good deal” for investors despite the massive number.Musk remains the world’s richest man, though he was briefly overtaken last week by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison after Oracle’s earnings beat expectations.The chairperson of Tesla's board of directors, Robyn Denholm, has defended Musk’s new multibillion-dollar compensation plan. The plan, which could be the largest in corporate history, was unveiled in a regulatory filing last week. In a recent interview with The New York Times, at Tesla’s engineering headquarters in California, Denholm said that Musk's compensation should depend on his ability to achieve ""seemingly impossible goals. "" She stated that Musk is capable of delivering world-changing technology if he is driven by these ambitious targets, even as the company faces a drop in sales and profits.“Putting together any compensation plan, you need to look at what motivates the individual that you’re trying to motivate. And for Elon, it’s doing things that no one else has done before,” Denholm said when asked about Musk’s proposed pay package.",Tesla recently proposed a $1 trillion pay package for the company’s CEO Elon Musk.

Questions remain over algorithm control and congressional approval





The United States and China announced they have reached a ""framework"" agreement to transfer TikTok to US-controlled ownership, potentially averting a ban of the popular social media app just days before a September 17 deadline. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the preliminary deal during trade talks in Madrid, saying President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will finalize the agreement in a Friday phone call.The framework would shift ownership of TikTok's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance to American investors, addressing national security concerns that have dominated the app's future for years. While Bessent declined to reveal commercial terms, calling it a deal ""between two private parties,"" he emphasized the agreement protects US security interests while preserving what Chinese negotiators consider the app's cultural characteristics.Trump celebrated the breakthrough on Truth Social, writing that ""a deal was also reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save.""The announcement comes after months of negotiations and three deadline extensions since Trump took office, with the current ban scheduled to take effect Wednesday if no agreement is reached.Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang confirmed the two sides reached a ""basic framework consensus"" on resolving TikTok-related issues through cooperation. However, he warned the US against continued ""suppression"" of Chinese companies while seeking Chinese accommodation on American concerns.Critical details remain unresolved, including whether ByteDance will transfer control of TikTok's valuable recommendation algorithm that drives user engagement. Chinese officials previously expressed reluctance to export the algorithm technology, which Beijing considers strategically sensitive. Wang Jingtao from China's cyberspace regulator suggested the deal could involve licensing intellectual property rights rather than full transfer.Any final agreement may require approval from Congress, which passed bipartisan legislation in 2024 requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban due to national security fears. The law, upheld by the Supreme Court, prohibits companies from ""foreign adversary"" countries from owning more than 20 percent of the platform.Industry analysts expect Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a Trump ally whose company currently hosts TikTok's US data, to lead the American investor group. TikTok serves approximately 170 million US users, making it one of the most significant social media platforms in the country.","The United States and China announced they have reached a ""framework"" agreement to transfer TikTok to US-controlled ownership.

Why DeepSeek and its model made waves in US tech industry

Chinese AI developer DeepSeek has revealed the cost of training its R1 model, a figure that is significantly lower than those reported by its US rivals. After launch, the DeepSeek R1 model stood out for its cost-efficient development and its open-source nature, offering unlimited free usage to a wide audience. Its emergence as a direct competitor to models from industry leaders such as OpenAI Google , and Anthropic has brought new scrutiny to the financial investments required for AI development.According to a report by Reuters, DeepSeek revealed that the company spent a significantly low amount—just $294,000—to train its R1 model. This figure was published in a peer-reviewed article in the academic journal Nature.The company’s disclosure may reignite a debate in the tech industry over why US giants are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to train large language models (LLMs).DeepSeek's release of what it claimed were lower-cost AI systems in January caused investors to sell off tech stocks, as they worried the new models could threaten the dominance of companies like Nvidia. The update, which is the first cost estimate the Hangzhou-based company has released for its R1 model, appeared in a paper co-authored by its founder, Liang Wenfeng.The paper specified that the reasoning-focused model was trained using 512 Nvidia H800 chips.By comparison, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in 2023 that ""foundational model training"" had cost ""much more"" than $100 million, though his company has not provided detailed figures, Reuters reported.Some of DeepSeek's previous claims about its development costs and technology have been questioned by US companies and officials. The company’s use of H800 chips comes after the US in October 2022 made it illegal for Nvidia to export its more powerful H100 and A100 AI chips to China.In a supplementary document to the Nature article, DeepSeek acknowledged for the first time that it does own A100 chips and used them in the “preparatory stages of development” for R1.US officials claimed in June that DeepSeek had access to “large volumes” of H100 chips procured after export controls were in place, a claim Nvidia has denied, stating that DeepSeek used lawfully acquired H800 chips.","Chinese AI developer DeepSeek has revealed the cost of training its R1 model, a figure that is significantly lower than those reported by its US rivals.

At Meta's annual Connect event, CEO Mark Zuckerberg was left red-faced after a live demonstration of the new Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses and accompanying neural wristband suffered a technical glitch. During the presentation, Zuckerberg successfully demonstrated the wristband's subtle gesture-based typing but the system failed to respond when he tried to initiate a video call using hand motions.

The accompanying neural wristband is designed to allow users to control the glasses with subtle hand gestures.During the demo, Zuckerberg successfully used the wristband to send text messages to Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth. However, when he attempted to initiate a video call using a hand gesture, the system failed to respond. This happened even after several attempts.“That’s too bad,” Zuckerberg said, adding, “ I don’t know what happened.”Bosworth eventually joined him on stage, commenting on the poor Wi-Fi connection. Zuckerberg admitted the moment was unexpected, saying, “We'll debug that later. You practice these things like 100 times, and then you never know what's going to happen.”The video of the failed demo quickly spread on social media like Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter), prompting a range of reactions from X users.One user commented that the Wi-Fi excuse was ""not really believable,"" while another joked about seeing the ""raw uncut footage"" of Zuckerberg's reaction afterward.In 2019, Musk was presenting the Cybertruck and during the live demo, lead designer Franz von Holzhausen smashed two of the vehicle's “armor glass” windows on stage with a metal ball. The unexpected failure left Musk visibly stunned but handled the situation by saying, “It didn’t go through”.Following the incident, Musk took to Twitter to explain what went wrong. He said that a prior test, where the door was hit with a sledgehammer, had ""cracked the base of the glass.""

Nvidia and Intel face maximum economic pressure

Google's blocked services limit Beijing's leverage





China has strategically dropped its antitrust investigation into Google while intensifying regulatory pressure on Nvidia and Intel, as Beijing selectively targets semiconductor companies that represent the most critical leverage points in escalating US-China trade negotiations. The decision to terminate the Google probe, which focused on Android's dominance among Chinese smartphone makers, comes as China simultaneously bans its tech giants from buying Nvidia's AI chips and pursues potential fines against the chipmaker that could reach billions of dollars.The State Administration for Market Regulation terminated its competition probe against Google's Android operating system dominance, which had targeted the platform's impact on Chinese smartphone makers like Oppo and Xiaomi , according to the Financial Times. The decision signals Beijing's tactical shift toward concentrating regulatory firepower on chipmakers rather than dispersing enforcement across multiple tech giants.The contrast highlights China's calculated targeting of companies where mutual economic dependence creates maximum negotiating leverage. Intel recorded $15.5 billion in Chinese sales during 2024, representing 29 percent of its global revenue and making China the chipmaker's largest market worldwide, surpassing the United States, the FT reported.Similarly, China accounted for 13 percent of Nvidia's global sales in the first three quarters of 2024, establishing it as the AI chipmaker's second-biggest market.SAMR this week determined Nvidia violated antitrust law during its 2020 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, potentially exposing the company to fines between 1 and 10 percent of annual sales, according to the Financial Times.China's Cyberspace Administration simultaneously banned major domestic tech companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, from purchasing Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D chips specifically designed for the Chinese market.Google presents fundamentally different economics for Chinese regulators. The company's search engine has been blocked in China since 2010, along with most parent company Alphabet's core services. Google's primary Chinese revenue streams come from advertising sales to domestic companies targeting overseas markets and limited cloud services operations.The Asia-Pacific region contributed 17 percent of Alphabet's total sales in 2023, with China representing an undisclosed portion, the FT noted. This restricted market presence reduces both Google's vulnerability to Chinese regulatory action and Beijing's potential leverage during trade negotiations.""Drop one case but seize the other,"" explained one person familiar with the matter. ""China is trying to narrow its retaliatory targets to make them more potent"" as US-China trade talks continue addressing tariffs, export controls and technology restrictions.",China terminates antitrust probe into Google while intensifying pressure on Nvidia and Intel.

How shareholders of this Chinese tech giant may be a 'problem' for Donald Trump’s TikTok deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-shareholders-of-this-chinese-tech-giant-may-be-a-problem-for-donald-trumps-tiktok-deal/articleshow/123975109.cms,"Why these ByteDance shareholders may be concerned by Trump’s TikTok deal



“There is no provision in the law preventing US investors from controlling the new company through their Chinese shares. They are US investors, and under the law that does not amount to additional Chinese ownership, which is capped at 19.9%.”

“If these guys who hold ByteDance stock want in, they are probably going to have to sell. If this thing looks like it’s going to be majority owned or even close to it by the Chinese, Congress is going to go nuts. I just don’t see how they sell a company that is controlled using mostly ByteDance stock as equity,” the equity investor added,”





US President Donald Trump 's deal with TikTok is reportedly facing a last-minute obstacle. A report claims that major US investors, who are shareholders in ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of the short video app, may pose a hindrance. Key shareholders, including billionaire Jeff Yass, a prominent Trump backer, are concerned they could face significant US tax burdens or congressional backlash if they are forced to sell their stakes to buy into a new, US-controlled TikTok.According to a report by On The Money, insiders have claimed that investors such as Yass, Bill Ford of General Atlantic Partners, and private equity firm KKR are hoping to ""roll"" their current shares into the new US company. This would allow them to avoid paying potentially hefty capital gains taxes.However, this manoeuvre is creating a problem for the deal as Congress and tax regulations could oppose such an arrangement. To compare, Susquehanna reportedly holds about 15% of ByteDance, with General Atlantic believed to have a similar share. Meanwhile, KKR’s ownership is estimated at roughly 1.7%.The key issue in this deal is whether a roll-over aligns with the law requiring that TikTok remain under majority US control.On paper, Chinese shareholders could still end up holding most of the equity in the new entity once the 19.9% stake earmarked for ByteDance in mainland China is included. However, the White House maintains that the deal is consistent with the law.In a statement, a White House source said:However, others close to the negotiations are less convinced. Lawmakers are increasingly concerned that the arrangement may still breach legislation intended to ban TikTok unless it is fully separated from China.one prospective equity investor told On The Money.Meanwhile, China critics in Congress are reviewing the proposed US-led TikTok framework, with some still pushing for a shutdown over concerns about spying and harmful content for young users. Possible solutions include investors such as Yass, Ford, and KKR making new investments, partially rolling over their ByteDance shares, or transferring them fully into the new entity. These scenarios could leave ByteDance with up to 49% equity.On the other hand, China's President Xi Jinping has reportedly agreed to let Oracle control and revise TikTok’s algorithm, once seen as the biggest obstacle. So, the ownership of ByteDance shares has now become the key sticking point.","Major US investors in ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of the short video app, may pose a hindrance.

China’s strategic push







Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has issued a warning in relation to the US AI chips. Speaking at the Axios AI+ DC Summit, the Anthropic CEO has urged the US government to again consider its plans to allow chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to continue selling their advanced AI chips to China. Amodie’s AI startup is backed by Jeff Bezos stressed on the fact that US’s dominance in the chip technology is its las strategic edge over China. “It may be the only advantage we have because we’re so far behind on things like munitions, ship building,” Amodei said, adding, “It is mortgaging our future as a country to sell these chips to China”.The comments from Amodei comes at the time when geopolitical tensions are rising and a controversial US proposal would allow chip exports to China, with a portion of the revenue redirected to the government. While this move from the US government aims to balance economic interest and national security, Amodei feels that this decision could lead catastrophic consequences. “This could control the fate of nations. This could control the future of freedom and democracy,” he warned.Amodei’s sharp stance on the matter of US AI chips has placed him at odds with the Trump administration, which has taken a more permissive approach to AI chip exports than some industry leaders expected.He criticized the policy shift, calling it: “The single most disastrous national security decision made in this term”.While the other tech CEO’s have agreed to the plan of the US government to export US AI chips, Amodei has emerged as a vocal dissenter, advocating for stricter safeguards on chip technology.The warning from Anthropic CEO is followed by China’s ban on major tech firms for purchasing Nvidia’s latest AI chipset. Along with this, China has also launched its anti-dumping investigation into the U.S. semiconductor sector, further escalating the tech rivalry.Despite acknowledging the risks posed by AI, Amodei stressed that the U.S. must maintain its lead in chip innovation to preserve its global influence. “Even with the dangers of the technology and the need for guardrails, defeating China in this field is crucial,” he said",Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has issued a warning in relation to the US AI chips.

Why is Paramjit Singh detained

Not a first





US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has detained an Indian-origin businessman, Paramjit Singh for more than a month. According to a Newsweek report, Singh, who has been a green card holder for over 30 years, was held at Chicago O'Hare Airport in July. Paramjit Singh, who was then returning from an India trip, was detained citing an old incident when he used a pay phone without paying. Singh's attorney Luis Angeles told the publication that the detainment has been ""nothing short of horrific"" for him and his family.Paramjit Singh runs a business in Fort Wayne, Indiana for the past three decades. He has a brain tumour and heart condition. His family told local news station WPTA that he makes several trips to India for his treatment.Singh was detained by ICE on July 30 when he was returning from one such trip to India. As per reports, he was kept inside the airport for five days where his condition deteriorated to the point where he had to be taken to the emergency room (ER).Angeles told Newsweek that Paramjit’s family was not notified of the ER visit until they received a bill for his medical stay.As mentioned above, Paramjit Singh was detained over an old incident where he used a pay phone without making any payment.Angeles calls it a ""minor infraction for which he has already taken full accountability, served his time, and paid his debt to society.""Stating that efforts to secure his release have been “exhaustive but frustrating,” Angeles said“We filed for a bond redetermination and successfully won the bond hearing. However, DHS has continued to employ what I would describe as legal—yet arguably unethical—tactics to prolong his detention, despite being fully aware of his severe medical condition, which requires emergency surgery. The government is holding him without justifiable cause, exacerbating his health risks and causing immense distress to his family”.The Newsweek report says that Paramjit’s case is not an isolated incident. Several green card holders have been detained recently on the basis of their decades-old legal issues. The publication cites a similar case of Jemmy Jimenez Rosa, a Massachusetts mother who was held for 10 days based on a decades-old marijuana conviction. As per the report, she was taken to the hospital while being held in the airport without access to medication.","US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has detained an Indian-origin businessman, Paramjit Singh for more than a month.

Intel's $20 billion mistake now becomes survival strategy





Twenty years after Intel rejected buying Nvidia for $20 billion, the roles have completely flipped: Nvidia is investing $5 billion in its struggling former takeover target and rescue Intel through a strategic chip partnership. The deal announced Thursday sees Nvidia purchasing Intel stock at $23.28 per share—a 6.5% discount—while the companies collaborate on PC and data center processors. Intel will embed Nvidia's cutting-edge graphics into consumer chips and manufacture specialized processors for Nvidia's AI systems.The partnership crystallises one of tech's most dramatic power shifts. Intel, once Silicon Valley's undisputed chip king with double Nvidia's revenue as recently as 2022, now has a market value under $100 billion. Nvidia has exploded to over $4 trillion, making it the world's second-most valuable company.Back in 2005, then-Intel CEO Paul Otellini pitched acquiring Nvidia to his board, recognizing that graphics chips might revolutionise data centers. Directors balked at the unprecedented price tag and Intel's poor acquisition track record, instead backing an internal project called Larrabee that burned hundreds of millions before collapsing in 2009.Nvidia seized the moment Intel missed. While Intel clung to traditional processors, Nvidia anticipated the AI revolution, developing specialised chips perfect for machine learning before ChatGPT made headlines. When tech giants raced to build AI infrastructure, they turned to Nvidia's ready-made solutions.Today, Nvidia approaches $200 billion in annual revenue—soon earning more each quarter than Intel generates yearly. Its data center business alone dwarfs entire chip companies.Intel has desperately chased the AI wave through acquisitions like Nervana Systems ($400 million) and Habana Labs ($2 billion), but gained little ground against Nvidia's dominance. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who replaced the ousted Pat Gelsinger this year, admits Intel won't compete with Nvidia's high-end systems ""anytime soon.""The Nvidia partnership represents pragmatic surrender disguised as collaboration.

At Meta's annual Connect event, Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a comprehensive new lineup of AI-powered glasses, including two new models and a new category. These products, developed in partnership with eyewear giants Ray-Ban and Oakley, are designed to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into daily life.According to the company, the AI glasses are designed with three core values, including light, feel comfortable and great looks. They are loaded with AI technology, taking “superintelligence seriously”.“Our glasses are engineered to get better over time. As the AI improves, your glasses do, too. And because good things come in threes, we’ve got three major AI glasses announcements to share, the company said in a press note.The new Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses build on the success of the previous model with key upgrades, Meta says, claiming that the battery life has been doubled to up to eight hours of mixed use, and the camera now records in ultra HD 3K video, capturing sharper and more vivid content.A new feature called “conversation focus” will help users hear better in noisy environments by using the glasses' open-ear speakers to amplify a person's voice.The second generation is available now, starting at $379, and comes in three new colours.For athletes and outdoor adventurers, Meta is introducing the new Oakley Meta Vanguard. These performance AI glasses are built for durability with an IP67 rating, making them sweatproof and resistant to temporary submersion. They feature a centered 12MP camera with a wide 122-degree field of view and up to nine hours of battery life, the company says.The open-ear speakers are 6 decibels louder than previous models and include advanced wind noise reduction. The glasses integrate with fitness apps like Garmin and Strava, providing real-time stats and an autocapture feature that automatically records videos at key workout milestones. The Oakley Meta Vanguard is available for pre-order at $499.The most significant announcement was the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which introduce a new category of AI eyewear. These glasses are the first in the lineup to feature a high-resolution, full-colour monocular display built into the lens.According to Meta, the display, which disappears when not in use, has a resolution of 42 pixels per degree—higher than any of Meta’s consumer VR headsets—and a brightness of up to 5,000 nits. The glasses are controlled with the new Meta Neural Band, a wrist-worn device that uses surface electromyography (sEMG) to interpret subtle hand and finger movements.The system also allows users to view messages, take video calls, use pedestrian navigation, and see live captions, all without taking out their phone.The Meta Ray-Ban Display, which includes the Neural Band, is available for purchase on September 30 for $799.Zuckerberg also highlighted the social impact of the technology, noting that the AI glasses are being used by Blind and Low-Vision individuals and are being issued by VA Blind Rehabilitation Centers to help veterans navigate the world more independently.","The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are the first in the lineup to feature a high- resolution, full-colour monocular display built into the lens.

Elon Musk’s scriptural response







Tesla CEO and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has finally responded to the criticism from Pope Leo XIV over Tesla’s proposed $1 trillion pay compensation package with a sharp Bible verse. Musk’s response to Pope’s criticism has started a global debate on wealth, corporate ambition and morality. The controversy started when Pope Leo, the first American-born pontiff raised questions on Musk’s potential rise as the world’s first trillionaire.In a recent interview with The Crux, the Pope said, “Yesterday the news that Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world. What does that mean, and what’s that about? If that is the only thing that has value anymore, then we’re in big trouble”. He linked Elon Musk’s pay package to the growing income inequality. He mentioned that the CEO’s earn 600 times more as compared to an average worker. The pontiff warned that such disparities reflect a dangerous shift in societal values.Tesla proposed a compensation plan which would award Musk up to 423.7 million shares over a decade. The chairperson of Tesla's board of directors, Robyn Denholm, has defended Musk’s new multibillion-dollar compensation plan.The plan, which could be the largest in corporate history, was unveiled in a regulatory filing last week. In a recent interview with The New York Times, at Tesla’s engineering headquarters in California, Denholm said that Musk's compensation should depend on his ability to achieve ""seemingly impossible goals. "" She stated that Musk is capable of delivering world-changing technology if he is driven by these ambitious targets, even as the company faces a drop in sales and profits.“Putting together any compensation plan, you need to look at what motivates the individual that you’re trying to motivate. And for Elon, it’s doing things that no one else has done before,” Denholm said when asked about Musk’s proposed pay package.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has now responded to Pope’s criticism by sharing a Bible Verse in a post on X (formerly known as twitter). “Why do you see the speck in your neighbor’s eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye?” wrote Musk.The verse shared by Musk has been interred as a jab at the Vatican’s own wealth which is estimated to be $2 trillion.","Pope Leo XIV raised questions on Musk's potential rise as the world’s first trillionaire.

USCIS or the US Citizenship and Immigration Services has announced a new version of the naturalization civics test that will take effect in 2025. In a press release, the immigration authority said it has posted a Federal Register notice announcing implementation of the 2025 naturalization civics test. The new test is part of the process immigrants must go through to become US citizens. It is aimed to measure the applicant’s knowledge of US history and government, as required by the law.“The 2025 test assesses an alien’s understanding of U.S. history and government in line with the statutory requirement and is one of many steps in an ongoing effort to restore integrity to the naturalization process and meet congressional intent,” USCIS said adding “Naturalization is a privilege that allows aliens to become fully vested members of American society, with important rights and responsibilities that all citizens should exercise and respect. ”USCIS Spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said “American citizenship is the most sacred citizenship in the world and should only be reserved for aliens who will fully embrace our values and principles as a nation.”“By ensuring only those aliens who meet all eligibility requirements, including the ability to read, write, and speak English and understand U.S. government and civics, are able to naturalize, the American people can be assured that those joining us as fellow citizens are fully assimilated and will contribute to America’s greatness.These critical changes are the first of many,” he added.The immigration agency has also rolled out stricter rules, such as tougher reviews for disability-based exemptions from test requirements, closer checks on applicants’ moral character, and neighborhood investigations to verify eligibility. In addition, USCIS said that it is resuming neighborhood investigations to ensure that aliens meet statutory requirements and are worthy of U.S. citizenship.Other recent policies include clarifying that unlawfully voting, unlawfully registering to vote, and making false claims to U.S. citizenship disqualify aliens from showing good moral character.",USCIS has announced a new version of the naturalization civics test that will take effect in 2025.

US-China trade tensions drive Apple's iPhone production shift to India





Tata Electronics has positioned itself as Apple 's most significant manufacturing partner in India, capitalising on the iPhone maker's efforts to reduce dependence on Chinese production for the US market.Regulatory filings reviewed by ET reveal that Apple's iPhone shipments to the US now represent nearly 37% of Tata Electronics' FY25 revenue, generating over Rs 23,112 crore for the Indian manufacturer. The shift marks a strategic pivot from the previous year, when Tata assembled iPhones exclusively for Taiwan and domestic consumption.The transformation has delivered substantial financial returns for the Tata Group subsidiary. Consolidated operating income reached Rs 66,206 crore in FY25, up from Rs 3,752 crore the previous year. Tata Electronics Systems Solutions, formerly the Wistron facility acquired in March 2024, reported revenues of Rs 75,367 crore during the 15-month period through March 2025, compared with Rs 14,350 crore in 2023.Apple is manufacturing all four iPhone 17 models across five Indian factories, including recently operational plants, Bloomberg reported. This represents the first instance of all new iPhone variants shipping from India at product launch.Manufacturing capacity controlled by Tata Group is expected to account for up to half of India's total iPhone output over the next two years, according to industry sources cited by Bloomberg. The expansion includes Tata's facility in Tamil Nadu's Hosur and Foxconn Technology Group's production hub near Bangalore airport.The company has strengthened its position through strategic acquisitions. Beyond the Wistron purchase, Tata Electronics acquired a 60% controlling stake in Pegatron Technology India for Rs 1,650 crore in January.Apple's production realignment coincides with ongoing US-China trade tensions and tariff policies implemented under the Trump administration. iPhone exports from India totalled $7.5 billion during the four-month period beginning April 2025, representing significant acceleration from $17 billion exported during the entire previous fiscal year.Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has committed to $600 billion in US investments over four years, a pledge industry observers view as aimed at maintaining tariff exemptions for India-manufactured devices. Cook previously stated that over 70% of iPhones sold in the US market are now produced in India.The manufacturing shift follows Apple's broader strategy to reduce supply chain concentration in China, a process accelerated by pandemic-related disruptions and geopolitical tensions.

Mindset over metrics







At GitHub, it is important and mandatory for the employees to use artificial intelligence tools. As reported by Business Insider, Github CEO Thomas Dohmke has made it clear that every GitHub employee irrespective of their role are expected to actively use AI tools such as GitHub Copilot as part of their daily work routine. “There is no world where I would allow for somebody to say, ‘Well, sorry, I don’t want to use GitHub,’” Dohmke said on a recent episode of the Decoder podcast. “It’s part of our company culture that everybody at GitHub uses GitHub.”As per the report, Dohmke’s comments came in defense of a Microsoft memo which asked the managers to evaluate employees on the basis of their use of internal AI tools. The authored by Microsoft executive Julia Liuson, stated that AI usage should be part of “holistic reflections” on employee performance.“AI is now a fundamental part of how we work,” the memo read. “Just like collaboration, data-driven thinking, and effective communication, using AI is no longer optional—it’s core to every role and every level.”Dohmke supports the same sentiment and feels that it’s totally fair to ask employees to reflect on their AI usage. “Did you use GitHub Copilot or Microsoft Copilot, Teams Copilot to summarize a meeting, and if not, why not?” he asked.As per the report, Dohmke also clarified that measuring AI usage is not about counting the lines of code written with the help of copilot. But it is about building a mindset which foster continuous learning and adaptation.He also stressed on the fact that the expectation from employees to use the internal AI tools is across departments ranging from engineering to HR, legal, and sales. “If the employee doesn’t want that, then there’s tens of thousands of other tech companies out there where they can have that,” Dohmke said.","GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke has made it clear that every GitHub employee irrespective of their role are expected to actively use AI tools such as GitHub Copilot. “There is no world where I would allow for somebody to say, ‘Well, sorry, I don’t want to use GitHub,’” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123963512,imgsize-700835,width-400,resizemode-4/github-ceo.jpg"

“Now, if you run a search, it gives you back an answer at the top of the page. It doesn’t give you a treasure map. Instead, it provides you with what they call an AI Overview, which has taken a whole bunch of content, smashed it together, summarised it in various ways, and synthesised it.”

“answer engine,”

What Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said about the future of internet



“Black Mirror possibility,”

“There will be a conservative one, and there will be a liberal one, and there’ll be a Chinese one, and there’ll be an Indian one,”

“siloed.”

“great information equaliser, democratiser.”

“This is an existential threat to us. If the internet stops existing, what’s left for Cloudflare to do? So one of the things that is really important to us is a thriving and vibrant internet ecosystem,”

Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) is ruiningthe internet. During a recent interview, he said that the days of search engines beingareSpeaking on the WIRED Big Interview Podcast, Prince expressed his concerns about a near-term dystopian AI scenario. He said:Prince also noted AI is not a search engine but anand it does not generate traffic, which is essential for funding the work of internet content creators such as researchers, writers, and journalists.Prince has outlined three future possibilities for the internet as answer engines replace search engines. He dismisses the first one, where research may vanish and be entirely replaced by AI, since it still depends on human-created content.The second, which he sees as more likely, is awhere most content creators end up employed by a few AI companies, similar to how powerful families like the Medicis once controlled art and knowledge output in the 1400s.In this scenario, major AI firms could dominate global information flows and shape them according to their own views, as seen when researchers found xAI’s Grok aligned its responses with Elon Musk’s opinions.Prince added.Prince warns that if people must subscribe to a few big AI companies for perspectives, information will becomeHe says this goes against the internet’s original purpose of free knowledge sharing and risks undermining its role as theHe even outlined a third possibility where AI companies will shift to a licensing model similar to Netflix, paying creators for content rather than scraping it for free. He argues that this would require content creators to create scarcity by blocking AI scrapers unless they are compensated.Some publishers have already filed lawsuits over the unauthorised use of their work, with Penske Media recently suing Google. Cloudflare has begun supporting this approach by letting customers block AI crawlers unless they pay, with clients like the Associated Press and Conde Nast already on board.Prince added.","Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) is ruining the internet.

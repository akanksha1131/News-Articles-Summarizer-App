"Reliance Jio user losses also means 'bad news' for India's mobile broadband market, breaks this 2-year impressive record",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/reliance-jio-user-losses-also-means-bad-news-for-mobile-broadband-market-breaks-this-2-year-record/articleshow/115635308.cms,"What's behind the fall in Reliance Jio customer base

The 3 biggest players in India's broadband market

Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea — continued to suffer customer losses for the third month in a row in September, as per the latest TRAI data . The fall comes following the mobile data tariffs hikes announced by the three telcos in early July. As per data released by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) for the month of September, Jio lost 7.9 million wireless customers, followed by Vodafone Idea which saw a decline of 1.5 million wireless customers and Bharti Airtel lost 1.4 million wireless users.This fall in Reliance Jio's 4G and 5G user base triggered a sharp fall in India's mobile broadband user base in September -- the first decline after two years of steady growth since the launch of 5G services in October 2022. India's 4G-cum-5G user base plunged by a record 5.6 million in September, shrinking the nation's mobile broadband user base to 901 million. This user base had earlier risen from 790 million in October 2022 to around 906 million in August 2024.Notably, state-owned BSNL, which did not implement price hikes, gained 1.5 million users.According to a report in Economic Times, analysts at Jefferies attribute this sharp decline to the price sensitivity of Jio's customer base. The telecom giant, along with Airtel and Vi, had increased their tariffs by 11-25% in July, primarily to boost their average revenue per user (ARPU).As a result of the tariff hike, Jio's market share in the data subscriber segment dipped by 60 basis points, while Airtel, BSNL/MTNL, and Vi gained market share. However, Jio remains the dominant player in the combined 4G/5G user segment, holding a 51% market share.According to the latest data as of September 30, 2024, India's broadband market continues to be dominated by five major players who collectively command 98.42% of the total wired and wireless broadband market share.Reliance Jio Infocomm leads the pack with 477.94 million subscribers, followed by Bharti Airtel with 285.17 million subscribers. Meanwhile, Vodafone Idea maintained its third position with 126.36 million subscribers, while the state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) holds 37.73 million subscribers.Atria Convergence Technologies rounds out the top five with 2.27 million subscribers.","Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea continued to suffer customer losses for the third month in a row in September.

Google's former CEO and chairman Eric Schmidt is asking for a radical shift in America's military strategy. He proposes that the US military should replace its traditional tank fleets with AI-powered drones . Schmidt served as Google’s CEO for almost 10 years -- from 2001 to 2011, a time of rapid growth for the search giant. He later became executive chairman for Google, and in 2015, for its new parent company, Alphabet, before resigning as chairman in the year 2018.Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia recently, Schmidt said, ""I read somewhere that the US had thousands and thousands of tanks stored somewhere."" ""Give them away.Buy a drone instead."" Schmidt's advocacy for drones is rooted in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war . He argues that the conflict has demonstrated the effectiveness of affordable, off-the-shelf drones in neutralizing expensive military equipment.Schmidt, according to reports by Forbes, reportedly told the audience that the Ukraine-Russia war has demonstrated how “a $5,000 drone can destroy a $5 million tank.”As per a Forbes report earlier this year, Schmidt is the founder of White Stork, a military startup that is building a “Kamikaze drone” for Ukraine. The drones are reported to be designed to loiter on the battlefield before being dispatched to destroy its target.“White Stork” is also a reference to a species of bird that is commonly found in Ukraine. Schmidt's startup White Stork is reportedly actively developing autonomous Kamikaze drones designed to target enemy positions in Ukraine. These drones, equipped with AI, can operate in challenging environments and identify targets even when GPS signals are jammed.In July 2023, Schmidt wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal calling drones as “the future of war. According to Schmidt, Ukrainian forces have “succeeded” despite the fact that Russia has a 3-to-1 advantage in soldiers as well as air superiority. Reason is: Ukraine's deployment of drones.Schmidt is listed by Bloomberg Billionaires Index among the 100 richest people in the world with a fortune valued at almost $35 billion.","Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO and chairman, is calling for a radical shift in America's military strategy.

He talked about a range of topics around AI, Supercomputers, potential restrictions under Donald Trump administration.Nvidia surpassed Apple early this month to become the highest valued company in the world.Huang encouraged a shift in thinking toward AI's ultimate goal: inference, rather than solely training models.

He envisions a world where AI supercomputers are strategically placed to harness renewable energy sources and minimize environmental impact.As the AI era unfolds, Huang said that he believes that the opportunities for innovation are boundless. He urged young graduates to embrace this transformative time and contribute to shaping the future of technology. Huang said, ""If the world uses more energy to power the AI factories of the world, we are a better world when that happens"". Huang said ""the goal of AI is not for training, the goal of AI is for inference"". He said AI can discover, for instance, new ways to store carbon dioxide in reservoirs, new wind turbine designs and new materials for storing electricity.Earlier in a speech, Huang told engineering students that ""the age of AI has started"". ""A new computing era that will impact every industry and every field of science,"" he said. The 61-year-old CEO of the world's most-valuable company Nvidia, Huang told students that he wished he had started his career at this time. ""The whole world is reset.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk joined in a call between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and US President elect Donald Trump , reports The Information. The call took place shortly after Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the November 5 presidential election. It is not yet known what else was discussed on the phone call, apart from the congratulatory message. Musk reportedly listened in as Pichai congratulated and spoke with Trump.This isn’t the first time that reports of a conversation between Trump and Google’s CEO have surfaced online. During his election campaigns, Trump mentioned twice about calling Pichai.In an interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait last month, Trump said that he called Google CEO Sundar Pichai to highlight alleged biases in Google search, claiming it only shows negative stories about him. He then said “I called the head of Google the other day and I said, ‘I’m getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don’t find them in Google’,” he said. Pichai, Trump said in the interview, told him that “you’re the No. 1 person on all of Google for stories”.Also read: Donald Trump: I called Google CEO Sundar Pichai the other day and said ...

He was recently appointed as co-chair of the newly formed “Department of Government Efficiency” alongside Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies - Essential to the 'Save America' Movement,” Trump said.The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has previously participated in calls with global leaders and has offered advice on personnel decisions, both privately and publicly, through X—the social media platform he acquired in 2022. He has briefly joined a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as listened during a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Microsoft President Brad Smith acknowledge shortcomings

Microsoft has faced a series of security setbacks in recent times, prompting company CEO Satya Nadella to acknowledge the need for a cultural shift within the company. The top executive said that an overhaul is needed to prioritise security and address these challenges.In a recent interview with Wired (via Business Insider), Nadella stressed the importance of changing the company's mindset.“That's what will be culture change,” he stated, emphasising the need to move beyond simply blaming employees and address the root causes of security vulnerabilities.“This is not about a witch hunt internally at Microsoft,” he said, when asked whether there were any firings at the company.While acknowledging the ""perverse incentives"" that often prioritise new product development over securing existing ones, Nadella expressed frustration with the tendency to focus on problems only after they occur.He criticized those who “chase ambulances,” implying a reactive rather than proactive approach to security, while accepting the criticism directed at Microsoft and emphasised commitment to improving the company's security posture.Over the past year, Microsoft has grappled with several high-profile cybersecurity incidents. For example, in July, a faulty update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike triggered a global IT outage impacting countless Microsoft users.Earlier, in March, a US Department of Homeland Security report criticised Microsoft's security systems as inadequate, highlighting its vulnerability to attacks, particularly from a Chinese hacking group known as Storm-0588.In 2020 SolarWinds attack, a report claimed that Microsoft knowingly concealed a security flaw in one of its services to avoid jeopardizing potential government investment in its cloud business. This vulnerability was later exploited by Russian hackers.Not only Satya Nadella, Microsoft President has openly acknowledged these shortcomings. Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft, accepted responsibility for the issues raised in the Department of Homeland Security report.The company also confirmed that its systems were compromised by the Russian hacking group Midnight Blizzard , resulting in unauthorised access to a small number of corporate email accounts.",Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has acknowledged the need for a cultural shift within the company.

Amazon is offering employees in Germany the option to work from home up to two days per week, creating a notable exception to its controversial global return-to-office mandate, according to internal documents obtained by Business Insider.The e-commerce giant will begin accepting flexible work applications from German staff starting December 15, even as it prepares to implement a five-day office requirement worldwide in January. The policy allows for both formal arrangements, which modify employment contracts, and informal arrangements requiring 24-hour advance notice.The exception for German employees stands in contrast to Amazon's broader stance on office attendance, which is notably stricter than peers like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, which maintain two to three-day office policies.Employees have also been mounting resistance to Amazon top executives over the stricter office attendance policy . Over 500 Amazon Web Services employees recently sent an open letter to AWS CEO Matt Garman , criticising the mandate as ""an outright abdication of AWS' role as one of the world's most innovative companies.""Garman has defended the policy, claiming that ""nine out of 10 employees"" he spoke with were ""actually quite excited by this change."" During an all-hands meeting, he suggested that dissatisfied employees could seek employment elsewhere, stating, ""If there are people who just don't work well in that environment and don't want to, that's okay, there are other companies around.""CEO Andy Jassy recently pushed back against speculation that the return-to-office mandate is a ""backdoor layoff,"" emphasising that the decision is ""very much about our culture and strengthening our culture."" The policy has particularly significant implications in Germany, where Amazon plans to employ over 40,000 permanent workers by year's end and has committed to a €10 billion investment in logistics and cloud infrastructure.The flexible work policy in Germany includes strict compliance measures, with Amazon reserving the right to take disciplinary action, including termination, for those who fail to follow the guidelines. Remote work arrangements will be limited to one-year terms and can be reconsidered at the company's discretion, Business Insider reports.","Amazon is offering employees in Germany the option to work from home up to two days per week.

Court order to Discord

The 'big Netflix leak'

Earlier this year, Netflix suffered from a massive leak that saw full episodes and pictures of some of its most popular shows including Terminator Zero, Arcane, Squid Game and Ranma 1/2 leak online ahead of their official release. Streaming giant Netflix had then released an official statement saying that it was “actively taking action” against the perpetrator of the leaks.It now appears, it may have found some lead here. Netflix is enlisting the help of Discord to track down the individual responsible for leaking unreleased footage of its Blockbuster shows. According to a report in Polygon, ""Netflix is looking toward Discord for help in figuring out who, exactly, is leaking unreleased footage from some of its popular shows.""The Northern District of California court recently issued a subpoena to compel Discord to share information that can help identify the Discord user who’s reportedly involved in leaking episodes and images from these popular Netflix shows. Documents filed alongside the subpoena reportedly specifically call out an unreleased and copyrighted photo from the second season of Squid Game, posted by a Discord user @jacejohns4n.The leak, which occurred in August, is believed to have originated from a security breach at Lyuno, a post-production studio that works with major streaming platforms. “One of our post production partners has been compromised and footage from several of our titles has unfortunately leaked online. Our team is aggressively taking action to have it taken down,” a Netflix representative told press at the time.In a statement published on Lyuno's website, a company spokesperson said, “Iyuno is aware of a recent security issue, involving unauthorized access to confidential content.” “Protecting our clients’ confidentiality and ensuring the security of their content is our highest priority. We are actively investigating this security breach to mitigate any potential risks and identify the responsible parties.”Other than Netflix, Lyuno's other customers include Amazon Studios, BBC, Disney, HBO, and DreamWorks.","Netflix is enlisting the help of Discord to track down the individual responsible for leaking unreleased footage of its Blockbuster shows.

The big Yes and No on Tiktok ban in the US

TikTok CEO Chew Shou Zi reportedly sought advice from Tesla CEO Elon Musk . According to an exclusive report in WSJ, ByteDance-owned TikTok chief executive officer Chew Shou Zi has sought input on US matters from Elon Musk. Tesla CEO has emerged as one of the closest advisers to President-elect Donald Trump.The Wall Street Journal reported on November 23, citing people familiar with the matter.TikTok CEO Chew is reported to have reached out to Tesla CEO in recent weeks and asked for his opinions on topics ranging from the incoming administration to potential tech policy, the report added as per news agency Reuters.The report added that both the executives have not discussed specific measures to keep TikTok running in the United States. ByteDance's senior leadership remains cautiously optimistic. Before the US election, ByteDance executives met with people close to both Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.Incidentally, there are also reports that Musk joined President-elect Donald Trump during his call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And earlier this week, The Information reported that Musk was there in the call when Google CEO Sunadr Pichai called to congratulate Pichai.Trump, who previously attempted to ban TikTok, has stated that he would not allow the app to be barred if elected in November. However, President Trump's pick for Federal Communications Commission chairman could be bad news for TikTok. In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr asserted that the Chinese social media platform TikTok “poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America’s national security” and should be banned.The new FCC chairman also reportedly has a close relationship with Musk and has accused Democrats of waging “regulatory lawfare” against Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service.","TikTok CEO Chew Shou Zi reportedly sought advice from Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

How Elon Musk became the richest person again

There's still some more way to go

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is officially the richest he’s ever been (and the wealthiest person ever) with a net worth of $334.3 billion, according to Forbes. The planet’s richest person grew much richer as shares of the Musk-led publicly traded electric vehicle company Tesla soared after Donald Trump's win in the US election. Musk was the biggest supporter of Trump during the election campaign, even taking part in some of his rallies.He has been appointed chair of the new “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), where he will work alongside Vivek Ramaswamy.According to Forbes, the net worth of Elon Musk was a record $321.7 billion at market close Friday, November 22, getting a $7 billion boost as Tesla stock climbed 3.8% to a new 3.5-year closing high of $352.56 per share. That eclipses the previous high of $320.3 billion set on November 5, 2021 amid Tesla’s pandemic era surge.Musk's net worth is now more than $80 billion richer than the next wealthiest person, his friend and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison at $235 billion. Much of Musk's fortune comes from his 13% stake in Tesla worth $145 billion, with another 9% equity award in the company pending an appeal in Delaware court (Forbes discounts the value of the award by 50% in its valuation of Musk wealth).The substantial valuation of Musk's AI company xAI , valued at $50 billion, has further contributed to his wealth. SpaceX , valued at $210 billion, also plays a significant role in Musk's overall net worth.With this, Musk's fortune is now about $70 billion larger than it was on Election Day as Tesla shares surged 40% as Wall Street bought into what should be a more friendly regulatory environment under Trump for Tesla, especially for its self-driving vehicles, as per Forbes.Elon Musk's close ties with president elect Donald Trump have fuelled investor confidence. Wall Street analysts view the incoming administration's anticipated deregulation efforts as a significant advantage for Tesla, particularly for its Full Self-Driving initiatives, which have faced regulatory scrutiny.The other primary source of Musk's fortune is his 42% stake in SpaceX, which was valued at $210 billion in a June tender offer, putting his stake in the private aerospace and satellite communications company at $88 billion. Speculation around SpaceX's upcoming funding round, which could value the company at $250 billion, suggests that Musk's net worth might climb even higher, potentially adding $18 billion to his fortune.However, despite this historic rise in fortune, there still may be some more way to go as Tesla shares still remain about 14 per cent below their all-time high from late 2021.","Musk's net worth is now more than $80 billion richer than the next wealthiest person, his friend and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison at $235 billion.

Adani Group trashes charges

US prosecutors have indicted Gautam Adani and his nephew, Sagar Adani, among others, for their alleged involvement in a $265 million (Rs 2,000 crore) bribery case to secure solar power supply contracts in India. According to court records cited by Reuters, arrest warrants have been issued in the US for Gautam and Sagar Adani, with prosecutors planning to hand these warrants to foreign law enforcement.Early Wednesday, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged Adanis, former Adani Green CEO Vneet Jaain, and executives from Azure Power and Canadian pension fund CDPQ under the Foreign Corruption Prevention Act (FCPA).Separately, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Gautam and Sagar Adani with raising funds from US investors through “false and misleading statements.” The SEC alleges they were directly involved in bribing Indian officials to secure contracts benefiting Adani Green.This account of how the alleged scheme unfolded is reportedly drawn from federal prosecutors' 54-page criminal indictment of Adani and seven of his associates and two parallel civil SEC complaints. These extensively cite electronic messages between the scheme's alleged participants. A Reuters report also claims that SEC has quoted WhatsApp chat of Sagar Adani and the Azure CEO in the case.Sagar Adani and the Azure CEO reportedly discussed the delays in the Solar power project and hinted at bribes on the encrypted messaging application WhatsApp, according to the SEC.What are the WhatsApp messages being quotedWhen the Azure CEO wrote on November 24, 2020, that the local power companies ""are being motivated,""reportedly dealt with the states of Jammu and Kashmir as well as Chhattisgarh as potential purchasers of green power.As per Reuters report, during a visit to the United States on March 17, 2023, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents seized Sagar Adani's electronic devices.

How robbers tricked SBI ATM machine

How the 'ATM scam' was detected

Two unidentified men have reportedly been accused of stealing Rs 2.52 lakh from an SBI ATM in Fort, Thiruvananthapuram, by manipulating the cash delivery system. The Fort police have registered a case under IPC Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) and are investigating the matter.The fraud, which occurred between June 2022 and July 2023, involved the suspects using multiple stolen or lost ATM cards to withdraw money from the SBI ATM on Padmavilasam Road.They employed a clever technique: after withdrawing cash, they would leave a single note in the machine's cash delivery compartment. This trickery led the ATM to register the transaction as incomplete and display a Timeout Error, preventing the amount from being deducted from the account holders' balances.This meant that no report was made of ATM fraud, as money was not deducted from any bank customer's account. But there was a mismatch in the money deposited in the ATM machine and the amounts withdrawn from customers accounts.The scam was detected when discrepancies were found between the total cash deposited in the ATM and the amounts withdrawn. A bank committee initially investigated the irregularities but couldn't pinpoint the cause. Not being able to find any proof as well as lead, the committee even suspected bank staff.However, a breakthrough came when the investigation team reviewed CCTV footage, identifying the suspects and their use of multiple stolen cards. They observed the suspects frequently visiting the machine and identified that they had used various stolen or lost ATM cards. Subsequently, SBI officials filed a report with the Fort police and gave VVTV captured photos of the suspects.","Two unidentified men have reportedly been accused of stealing Rs 2.52 lakh from an SBI ATM in Fort, Thiruvananthapuram.

"UK regulator says Apple ‘blocked’ browser innovation on iPhones; company says, “We are concerned that…”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-regulator-says-apple-blocked-browser-innovation-on-iphones-company-says-we-are-concerned-that/articleshow/115570965.cms,"Apple-Google search deal under lens

What Apple has to say

Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users. We disagree with the findings in the report regarding Safari, WebKit, and in-app browsing on iOS. We are concerned that the interventions discussed in the report for future consideration under the Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Act would undermine user privacy and security and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart. We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.

The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has provisionally found that Apple's policies are hindering innovation in mobile web browsers. The regulator also targeted Google’s $20 billion search deal with Apple in keeping the revenues flowing for the companies.The CMA's inquiry group specifically criticised Apple's requirement that all iOS browsers use its WebKit engine, which limits the functionality and differentiation of competing browsers.“The group has provisionally found that Apple’s rules restrict other competitors from being able to deliver new, innovative features that could benefit consumers. Other browser providers have highlighted concerns that they have been unable to offer a full range of browser features, such as faster webpage loading on iPhone. Many smaller UK app developers also told us that they would like to use progressive web apps – an alternative way for businesses to provide apps to mobile users without downloading apps through an app store – but this technology is not able to fully take off on iOS devices,” the CMA said.The CMA's report also highlights a revenue-sharing agreement between Apple and Google, suggesting that the arrangement reduces their incentive to compete with each other.“In addition, the group has provisionally found that a revenue-sharing agreement between Google and Apple significantly reduces their financial incentives to compete in mobile browsers on iOS,” it added.The CMA launched its investigation into Apple and Google's mobile dominance in 2021, focusing on app store practices, browsers and cloud gaming. While the CMA has dropped the cloud gaming aspect of its probe due to recent changes by Apple, it maintains concerns about Apple's browser policies.“The CMA is inviting comments on its provisional findings by December 13 and expects to make a final decision in March 2025,” it added.An Apple spokesperson said that it disagrees with the findings, as per a report by TechCrunch.",The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has provisionally found that Apple's policies are hindering innovation in mobile web browsers.

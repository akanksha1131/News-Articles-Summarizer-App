"'Too Intimate and Embarrassing' to make public, says Texas governor in a letter on emails with Elon Musk",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/too-intimate-and-embarrassing-to-make-public-says-texas-governor-in-a-letter-on-emails-with-elon-musk/articleshow/122459698.cms,"What Texas governor said in letter about emails with Elon Musk

Elon Musk's 'growing influence' in Texas

Texas Governor Greg Abbott is reportedly withholding months of communications with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his companies, citing privacy exemptions under Texas public records laws. According to a joint investigation by ProPublica, The Texas Newsroom, and The Texas Tribune, Texas governor doesn’t want to reveal months of communications with Elon Musk or representatives from the tech mogul’s companies, arguing in part that they are of a private nature, not of public interest and potentially embarrassing.In a letter to the Texas attorney general shared by The Texas Newsroom, one of Abbott’s public information coordinators said the emails consist “of information that is intimate and embarrassing and not of legitimate concern to the public,” such as “financial decisions that do not relate to transactions between an individual and a governmental body.”The decision has reportedly sparked debate over transparency, given Musk’s growing influence in the state. The Texas Newsroom, probing Musk’s sway over Texas governance, requested emails between Abbott’s office and Musk dating back to last fall. Initially, the governor’s office accepted a $244 fee to compile the records but later refused to release them. In a letter to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, an Abbott public information coordinator argued the emails contain “highly intimate or embarrassing” details, including financial decisions unrelated to government transactions, and are thus exempt from disclosure. SpaceX , Musk’s aerospace company based in Texas, also objected, claiming the emails could cause “substantial competitive harm.Elon Musk’s presence in Texas has expanded significantly in recent years. Three of his biggest companies -- Tesla, SpaceX and Twitter now call Texas home, with SpaceX’s Starbase facility in South Texas recently approved as a new town by local voters. Abbott has praised Elon Musk, crediting him for inspiring the creation of a state efficiency office and celebrating his companies’ relocation to Texas. Elon Musk’s lobbyists also secured several favorable laws during this year’s legislative session.Public records have previously shed light on Elon Musk’s influence. The Texas Newsroom claims to have uncovered emails showing a Texas lawmaker meeting with SpaceX representatives and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick advocating to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to allow more SpaceX rocket launches.","Texas Governor Greg Abbott is reportedly withholding months of communications with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his companies.

Mark Zuckerberg vs Meta shareholders in $8 billion trial: Read the list of high-profile executives named in this case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mark-zuckerberg-vs-meta-shareholders-in-8-billion-trial-read-the-list-of-high-profile-executives-in-this-case/articleshow/122453587.cms,"Zuckerberg dismisses ‘extreme claims’



Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, is set to appear this week as a key witness in an $8 billion trial. He stands accused of operating Facebook as an illegal enterprise that allowed widespread harvesting of user data without consent, news agency Reuters reported. Shareholders of the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, have sued Zuckerberg and other current and former company leaders, claiming these individuals consistently violated a 2012 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) designed to protect user data.The lawsuit stems from the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal , where data from millions of Facebook users was accessed by the now-defunct political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump's 2016 US presidential campaign.Shareholders are seeking reimbursement for over $8 billion in fines and costs Meta incurred due to the scandal, including a record $5 billion fine from the FTC in 2019 for breaching the 2012 agreement.Defendants in the case include former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg , venture capitalist and board member Marc Andreessen, and former board members Peter Thiel (Palantir Technologies co-founder) and Reed Hastings (Netflix co-founder).Specifically, Zuckerberg and Sandberg are accused of knowingly causing the company to violate the law.Zuckerberg and the other defendants have dismissed the allegations in court filings as ""extreme claims."" The non-jury trial begins on Wednesday (July 16) in Wilmington, Delaware, and is scheduled to last eight days. It will primarily focus on events and board meetings from a decade ago to determine how Facebook leaders implemented the 2012 agreement.While the trial addresses past policies, it comes as Meta continues to face intense scrutiny over privacy concerns, particularly regarding its training of AI models. Meta asserts it has invested billions since 2019 in programmes to safeguard user privacy.Two years ago, the defendants tried to get the case dismissed, but the judge, Travis Laster, denied the request, calling it ""a case involving alleged wrongdoing on a truly colossal scale."" The trial will now be overseen by Judge Kathaleen McCormick in the Court of Chancery.Defendants maintain that the plaintiffs lack sufficient evidence to prove their claims. Conversely, shareholders, in pretrial court papers, argue they can show that Facebook continued deceptive privacy practices under Zuckerberg's direction after the 2012 agreement.","Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, is set to appear this week as a key witness in an $8 billion trial.

‘They don't need…certainly...’: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on concerns over China military using US chips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/they-dont-needcertainly-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-concerns-over-china-military-using-us-chips/articleshow/122450740.cms,"‘Want American tech stack to be the global standard’: Huang



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has pushed back against US concerns that his company's chips could aid the Chinese military. His comments come as Huang prepares for his second trip to China this year for which he has also been sent a ‘warning letter’ by some US senators.Speaking in a CNN interview, Huang asserted that the Chinese military ""don't need Nvidia's chips, certainly, or American tech stacks in order to build their military,” elaborating, “they simply can’t rely on it” because US technology “could be limited at any time; not to mention, there’s plenty of computing capacity in China already.”These remarks address US policy that restricts advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chip sales to China. Huang has previously criticised these export controls, arguing they are “counterproductive” to the US's goal of maintaining tech leadership.He stressed that for the “American tech stack to be the global standard,” the technology must be accessible to AI developers worldwide, including the 50% located in China.The latest US restrictions on Nvidia's sales to China, implemented in April, are projected to result in billions in losses for the company. In May, Huang noted that previous chip restrictions had already cut Nvidia's China market share by nearly half.Nvidia is reportedly developing a new chip that complies with the latest export controls. Last week, the Nvidia CEO met with US President Donald Trump, and lawmakers reportedly cautioned him against engaging with companies linked to China's military or intelligence, or those on America's restricted export list.Huang has also addressed concerns about DeepSeek’s open-source R1 reasoning model, which was trained in China. While acknowledging the concerns, he stated there was no evidence that its origin alone presented dangers. He praised the R1 model as “revolutionary” and noted its open-source nature empowers startups, new industries, and countries to participate in AI development.",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has pushed back against US concerns that his company's chips could aid the Chinese military.

The new iOS app called Sun Day helps users track their UV exposure and estimate vitamin D levels based on location, skin type, and how much clothing they're wearing.The app works by using your phone's location to pull up the local UV index, then lets you manually toggle when you're stepping in and out of sunlight. Tell it your skin type from six options, mention whether you're rocking shorts and a t-shirt or bundled up, and Sun Day calculates how much vitamin D you're getting and how long you can stay outside before risking a burn.This follows last weekend's release of Bitchat, Dorsey's encrypted peer-to-peer messaging app that works over Bluetooth without needing internet. Both apps are part of what he calls his ""learning"" process through weekend coding projects, and he's building them using an open-source AI coding tool called Goose , which is developed by Dorsey’s Block .The app keeps things simple. You tap a button when you go outside, tap it again when you head back in, and it gives you a rough estimate of your vitamin D gains for that session and the whole day. It also shows useful info like sunrise and sunset times, cloud cover, and your personal burn limit based on the UV index.Sun Day is currently available through Apple's TestFlight beta program, with the full source code posted on GitHub for anyone who wants to dig in. There's no word yet on when it might hit the regular App Store or if an Android version is planned.

Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for 'offensive' political slurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/poland-flags-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-to-the-eu-for-offensive-political-slurs/articleshow/122348777.cms,"Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for “offensive” political slurs

Why Poland says Elon Musk's Grok chatbot crossed a red line



Offensive answers: From antisemitic tropes to political insults



European digital rules put xAI under the spotlight



Previous incidents: Turkey, hate speech, and Grok’s growing rap sheet



xAI and Musk offer silence, at least for now



Poland just pulled the alarm on Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk ’s xAI. Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates. Poland’s complaint tees up an early test of those combined powers.Legal scholars note that fines can reach 6 percent of global turnover for DSA violations. For Musk’s empire, that runs into billions.Poland is not alone. A Turkish court ordered X to block Grok content that mocked President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Islamic beliefs.In June, users spotted the bot rambling about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. xAI blamed an “unauthorised change” to its response code.Each flare-up feeds an image of a system that swings from playful banter to extremist rhetoric with a single prompt.As of Wednesday afternoon, xAI had not replied to Reuters’ emailed questions, and Musk’s normally hyperactive X feed stayed quiet on the topic.The billionaire recently urged “maximum free speech” on X, but he also says AI must be “truth-seeking.” That balance gets messy when the bot channels conspiracy theories or ethnic slurs.","Poland says the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

Elon Musk's AI startup xAI ask employees to install 'spy software' on their laptops



Elon Musk’s xAI apologises for what 'happened on July 8



Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI has reportedly implemented a controversial policy which requires all its employees to install a ‘spyware software’ on their laptops issued by the company. This move of the company which aims to enhance the security has started discussions about the privacy of the employees. As reported by Business Insider, the staff at xAI involved in the training of Grok has been asked to install a monitoring tool called Hubstaff, which will keep a track of the websites visited, apps used, mouse movements and more.According to a report by Business Insider, Elon Musk’s AI startup has asked the employees training Grok to download and install a workforce management system called Hubstaff. This monitoring toll is designed to keep track of employee activity including keystrokes, screen activity, and application usage.The company has not yet revealed the exact reason behind this new policy, but it is speculated to be a response to the highly competitive and sensitive nature of AI development, where intellectual property and data security are paramount.Initially, the directive applied to all employees, regardless of whether they had company-issued laptops, with a July 11 deadline for compliance. Later the company asked the employees using their personal devices to either purchase a new device using the xAI $50 per month tech stipend or create different profiles to separate their work from personal browsing.The company’s HR team said that the new software would help the company in streamlining the work process and will also offer better insights into daily tutoring activities. “This new tool serves to streamline work processes, provide clearer insights into daily tutoring activities, and ensure resources align with Human Data priorities,"" the company's human resources team said in a mass email to employees.However, the employees feel that the new monitoring tool is “surveillance disguised as productivity”.The report further adds that apart from Hubstaff, xAI also uses HR manager Rippling to clock the hours of workers. Along with this, the company’s in-house system Starfleet tracks the amount of time the tutors spent on each task.Meanwhile, it has been a tough time for xAI. The Elon Musk-owned company apologised “for the horrific behaviour that many experienced” for 16 hours, starting on July 8. Through the official Grok account on X (formerly Twitter), the AI company said that “the update was to provide helpful and truthful responses to users” but it spit out responses which “contained extremist views.”xAI has also provided an explanation on what went wrong. It said that the incident stemmed from a July code update that activated deprecated instructions, causing Grok to reflect extremist views from X posts for 16 hours, a vulnerability not anticipated despite pre-release testing, as revealed by xAI's investigation.","Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI has reportedly implemented a controversial policy which requires all its employees to install a ‘spyware software’ on their laptops.

Elon Musk’s ex-wife and Canadian author Justine Wilson has revealed what she believed is the key to his incredible success – the word ‘No’. Speaking at a TEDx Talk a few years ago, Justine said that while Elon Musk worked extremely hard, one of his biggest strengths was saying no to distractions. “I was married to a man who became extremely successful. And as I watched him rise I noticed two things. He worked very hard, much harder than your average bear. And he said no, a lot,” she said.According to Justine, Elon Musk often turned down requests for his time, attention, and energy. Why? So he could stay focused on his personal and professional goals.""He said no to people who wanted his time and attention and energy. He said no in a way that protected his resources so he could channel them towards his own goals. And I realized that behind every no there is a deeper yes to whatever it is that you do want,"" Justine added.Explaining further, Justine said “He had grown up in the male-dominated culture of South Africa, and the will to compete and dominate that made him so successful in business did not magically shut off when he came home”.Justine married Elon in 2000 and moved to Los Angeles. They tragically lost their first son, Nevada, to SIDS, and later had twins and triplets. The couple divorced in 2008, the same year Musk became Tesla CEO.Despite the challenges in their marriage, Justine Musk said she has no regrets. She emphasized that Elon’s success is a clear example of what focus and strong boundaries can achieve.","Elon Musk’s ex-wife and Canadian author Justine Wilson has revealed what she believed is the key to his incredible success – the word ‘No’ According to Justine, Elon Musk often turned down requests for his time, attention, and energy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122439633,imgsize-35634,width-400,resizemode-4/I-was-married-to-a-man-who-says-Elon-Musks-ex-wife-in-a-big-reveal.jpg"

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has empahised that the AI he envisions will not lead to mass layoffs. Contrary to the common narrative that artificial intelligence will lead to widespread job displacements, Benioff feels that AI will be used to augment rather than replace the workforce. While industry leaders and analysts have warned about significant layoffs due to automation, the Salesforce CEO has a more optimistic outlook, hinting at a different kind of AI integration.Speaking at the 2025 AI for Good Global Summit, Marc Benioff said that AI is dramatically reshaping Salesforce and that is why he feels that AI will not wipe-out white collar jobs. Benioff quipped, “Maybe they have AI I don’t have,” in response to predictions from other tech leaders that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level office jobs. “In the AI I have, it’s not going to be some huge mass layoff of white-collar workers,” he said. “It is a radical augmentation of the workforce.”Marc Benioff’s comments comes at a time when the tech industry is witnessing AI-driven restructuring. Company’s like Anthropic and Nvidia have already warned about mass layoffs due to AI. However, Benioff insists that the Salesforce customers are not laying off staff due to AI. Instead, he feels that AI works a a co-pilot which boosts productivity and unlock new opportunities.“When I speak with our customers, they’re not saying, ‘I’m laying off employees because of AI advancements in A, B, or C technologies.’ That fear—we need to let it go.” said Benioff.Benioff also revealed that he paused the hiring of engineers, lawyers and customer service agents for Salesforce for almost and year to allow AI productivity gains to take hold. However, the company is ramping up sales-related hiring to meet surging demand for AI deployment.Marc Benioff wrapped up his point by saying, “Given the remarkable productivity gains AI is bringing to engineering this year, let’s take the time to integrate those advances—so we’re not racing to hire another thousand, two thousand, or even three thousand engineers.”","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has said that the AI he envisions will not lead to mass layoffs.

Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino was set up to fail ‘by Elon Musk’ as …say analysts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/twitter-ceo-linda-yaccarino-was-set-up-to-fail-by-elon-musk-as-say-analysts/articleshow/122438460.cms,"A clash of styles and control between Yaccarino and Musk



Musk felt Yaccarino was not fully transparent



Linda Yaccarino 's two-year tenure as CEO of X (formerly Twitter) has come to an end, with many industry insiders and former colleagues suggesting she was ultimately set up for failure by owner Elon Musk . Just three weeks ago, Yaccarino publicly maintained her position and reporting structure after Musk merged X with his artificial intelligence (AI) company, xAI . She said that she’s the CEO of X and “my boss remains the same” but she quit last week, noting X was “entering a new chapter” with xAI.The report says that Yaccarino's primary mandate was to lure back advertising revenue to a platform whose owner had infamously told dissenting brands to ""go f*** themselves."" Citing industry insiders, a Financial Times report says that Yaccarino was – in many ways – set up to fail by Musk.According to four individuals who worked closely with both, Musk's demanding and blunt management style consistently clashed with Yaccarino's polished Madison Avenue approach, preventing them from finding a functional working rhythm.“Sheryl [Sandberg] found the rhythm with Mark [Zuckerberg],” one person noted, drawing a comparison to Meta's successful executive partnership, “Linda couldn’t find the rhythm with Elon.”The report also says that while Yaccarino largely succeeded in boosting X’s advertising business, her role became increasingly untenable, particularly after Musk’s xAI acquired X for $45 billion in March. As Brian Wieser of Madison & Wall, an advertising consultancy, put it, “she had to question why she was there.”As per the report, Musk’s round-the-clock involvement meant that Yaccarino never had the control that a CEO has. It added that over the past six months, despite Musk reported distraction by his work with the Donald Trump administration – which recently ended in a public falling out – he still made decisions at X, sometimes surprising Yaccarino and her team.“Elon calls all the shots. She tried to ride the tiger but was thrown off,” an advertising executive familiar with both told the Financial Times, adding that Yaccarino's position had become untenable in recent months.Despite her public loyalty to Musk, some who worked with both believed her talent as a consummate salesperson ultimately strained their relationship. Musk reportedly felt Yaccarino was not being fully transparent about the company’s status with advertisers, believing she “put a gloss on reality” when he wanted a faster financial turnaround.“He did not dig her style as a shiny, flashy Madison Avenue executive,” said one source, adding, “He wants to have an authentic conversation and not be bullshitted.”Tensions escalated approximately a year ago when Musk issued warnings to Yaccarino to accelerate growth and temporarily brought in longtime lieutenant Steve Davis to review X's finances. The billionaire later hired former Tubi executive Mahmoud Reza Banki as Chief Financial Officer. Banki reportedly reported directly to Musk, frequently bypassing Yaccarino, leading to a quickly strained relationship between the CEO and CFO.","Musk felt Yaccarino was not fully transparent about the company’s status with advertisers, believing she “put a gloss on reality” when he wanted a faster financial turnaround. “She tried to ride the tiger but was thrown off,” an advertising executive familiar with both said.

One week earlier, he sat on an estimated $175 billion; the revision puts him near $124 billion, nudging him down to twelfth place globally. The plunge isn’t the result of bad bets or a Microsoft sell-off gone wrong. Instead, it reflects Gates’ plan to empty his pockets long before the undertaker knocks. In a May blog post, he vowed that no obituary would say he “died rich,” and he gave his foundation a deadline of 31 December 2045 to distribute almost everything he owns.Bloomberg simply caught up with how aggressively those transfers have already begun. So while headlines shout “loss,” Gates sees progress toward a promise that reshapes both the billionaire rankings and the future cash flow of the world’s largest private charity.Between 3 July and 10 July, Gates’ listed wealth slid from $175 billion to $124 billion, a 29 percent haircut. Most of the shift comes from updated accounting of shares he has already earmarked—or outright transferred—to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and related philanthropic vehicles. Because he still holds about 3.5 percent of Microsoft through personal and family trusts, day-to-day market moves matter, but the big swing this month is bookkeeping catching up with his give-away schedule.In a May 8 essay, Gates wrote, “There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold on to resources that could be used to help people.” He set a 20-year window to donate at least 99 percent of his remaining assets and to wind down the foundation by 2045. The commitment formalises what observers have called “the long goodbye” to his billionaire status—only now the timeline is public and the pace is accelerating.Since 2000, the organisation has granted more than $100 billion and still holds an endowment of $77 billion, even after the latest transfers.Gates’ slide pushed him below former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, now worth about $173 billion and sitting in fifth place. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Tesla’s Elon Musk still dominate the top slots. Analysts note the rankings may yo-yo as Gates continues to vest shares or as Microsoft’s price wiggles, but the directional trend is clear: philanthropy is winning the tug-of-war with personal net worth.The 69-year-old argues that capital stuck in a brokerage account is “opportunity cost incarnate.” He points to stalled humanitarian progress—especially cuts in Western foreign-aid budgets—and insists private capital must fill the gap. Critics worry about outsized influence from one donor, yet even they acknowledge his cash is now the lifeblood of several global-health campaigns once bankrolled by governments.","The Bloomberg Billionaires Index updated its ledger on July 13 and wiped $51 billion off Bill Gates’ fortune in a single stroke.

Jensen Huang questions MIT study

How Nvidia CEO uses AI himself, and why he says it makes him smarter

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed recent MIT research suggesting artificial intelligence diminishes cognitive abilities, arguing instead that his daily AI use has actually enhanced his thinking skills. Speaking on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" that aired Sunday, Huang said he uses AI ""literally every single day"" and believes his "" cognitive skills are actually advancing.""""I haven't looked at their research yet, but I have to admit, I'm using AI literally every single day,"" Huang stated during the interview. ""I think my cognitive skills are actually advancing, and the reason for that is because I am not asking it to do the thinking for me.""The MIT Media Lab study, which analyzed 54 subjects writing SAT essays using ChatGPT, Google Search, or no tools, found that ChatGPT users showed the lowest brain engagement and ""consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels."" Researchers used EEG technology to monitor brain activity across 32 regions during the writing process.Huang challenged the study's methodology, questioning how participants were using AI tools . ""I'm not exactly sure what people are using it for that would cause you to now not have to think,"" he said on the CNN program. ""But if you have the thing in order, for example, the idea of prompting an AI, the idea of asking questions... you're spending most of your time today asking me questions in order to ask good questions. It's a highly cognitive skill.""Nvidia CEO emphasized that AI should be used as a learning tool rather than a replacement for thinking. ""I'm asking it to teach me many things that I don't know or help me solve problems otherwise I wouldn't be able to solve reasonably or research,"" Huang explained during the Sunday interview.Huang further that effective AI interaction requires sophisticated cognitive skills, particularly in formulating quality questions. ""As a CEO, I spend most of my time asking questions, and 90% of my instructions are actually, you know, conflated with questions,"" Huang explained. ""When I'm interacting with AI, it's a questioning system. You're asking a question, so I think that in order to formulate good questions, you have to be thinking, have to be analytical, reasoning yourself.""Huang described his approach of using multiple AI systems to cross-reference and critique responses. ""I wouldn't just receive it. Usually, what I do is say, 'Are you sure this is the best answer you can provide?' Take the answer from one AI, give it to another AI, ask them to critique itself,"" he said during the CNN interview. ""There's no different than getting three doctors' opinions.""This methodology, according to Huang, actually strengthens analytical abilities rather than weakening them. ""So I think that process of critiquing and critiquing the answers of your critical thinking enhances cognitive skills,"" he concluded on ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" offering direct advice to the MIT study participants: ""Apply critical thinking.""","MIT study found ChatGPT users showed lowest brain engagement and ""consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says he uses AI ""literally every single day"" and believes his "" cognitive skills are actually advancing"" He argues formulating quality questions for AI requires analytical and reasoning skills.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122438099,imgsize-57344,width-400,resizemode-4/122438099.jpg"
"Jio Platforms launches JioPC, a virtual desktop service that turns TV into PC; free trial start",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jio-platforms-launches-jiopc-a-virtual-desktop-service-that-turns-tv-into-pc-free-trial-start/articleshow/122434137.cms,"What is JioPC

JioPlatforms has launched a new virtual desktop service called JioPC. The service is aimed at turning televisions into personal computers and works through the Jio set-top box, which comes free with Jio’s broadband plans or can be bought separately for Rs 5,499 ($64). JioPc is currently available on a free trial basis and by invitation only. The move signals Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani ’s ambition to expand computing access in a country where PCs are still out of reach for many.As mentioned above, JioPC is a virtual desktop service. It lets users access a cloud PC setup on their TV by simply plugging in a keyboard and mouse.At this stage, JioPC does not support external devices such as cameras or printers. It also does not come with Microsoft Office pre-installed. Instead, users can access Office tools through the browser. The system comes with LibreOffice, an open-source alternative, already installed.Despite these restrictions, the concept appears promising. JioPC could become a new way to offer basic computing to homes that already have TVs but no computers.According to the government data, India has around 57 million active set-top box users. But the traditional direct-to-home (DTH) TV market is declining as more people switch to online streaming. Between March last year and this year, DTH subscriptions dropped by 8%.Meanwhile, the overall PC market in India grew over 8% in Q1 2025, reaching 3.3 million units. Still, India lags behind countries like the US and China in PC ownership, mainly due to the high cost of devices and the popularity of smartphones.“JioPC is a very effective way for the Mumbai-headquartered company to increase its user base,” Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint told TechCrunch. He noted that while 70% of Indian households have a TV, only about 15% own a PC.However, he also warned of a challenge: “You need to convince people that you can still use a PC on your TV using the set-top box.”Prabhu Ram, vice president at CyberMedia Research, believes the product could succeed among new users in underserved regions. “While its potential reach is broad, its success will depend on execution — especially in addressing connectivity gaps and digital literacy,” he said.","JioPlatforms has launched a new virtual desktop service called JioPC.

Musk confirmed the news in a post on X (formerly Twitter). Replying to a user who said “Tesla needs to be able to invest in xAI 🙏 otherwise not fair to $TSLA retail investors,” Musk wrote: “It’s not up to me. If it was up to me, Tesla would have invested in xAI long ago,” before adding “We will have a shareholder vote on the matter”.For those unaware, xAI is an artificial intelligence company started by Elon Musk in early 2023, after OpenAI’s ChatGPT became popular. Since then, the company has created its own AI chatbot called Grok – a direct competitor to other chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. The AI bot was recently updated to a new version called Grok 4.Earlier this year, Musk merged xAI with his social media company X in a deal that valued xAI at $80 billion.A recent Wall Street Journal report said that Musk’s space company SpaceX is planning to invest $2 billion into xAI as part of its $5 billion capital raise.

Oppo Reno 14 Pro Review: Flagship Features Without the Flagship Price?

In a stern message to visa holders and applicants, the US Embassy in India has clarified that obtaining a US visa is not the end of scrutiny. In a recent post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the embassy stated that US authorities continue to monitor visa holders even after a visa has been granted.“U.S. visa screening does not stop after a visa is issued. We continuously check visa holders to ensure they follow all U.S. laws and immigration rules – and we will revoke their visas and deport them if they don’t” read the post from the official U.S. Embassy India handle.The statement serves as a reminder to Indian nationals, especially students and workers heading to the US, that visa approval is not a guarantee of permanent entry or stay. It underscores the importance of compliance with US laws, including immigration, academic, and employment regulations.The embassy's post comes at a time when US authorities have reportedly stepped up scrutiny of international travellers amid concerns over visa fraud, overstaying, and misuse of student and work visas.Though the embassy did not cite specific cases, officials have in the past emphasized that any violation — from false claims in applications to unauthorized employment — can lead to visa cancellation, detention, or deportation.The embassy previously shared a post stating “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas.” “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form” the post further added.The US government shared fresh guidelines for F, M, and J non-immigrant visa applicants last month. “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under U.S. law,"" the US embassy in India wrote in an X post.The embassy’s latest message is likely aimed at reinforcing legal compliance and deterring misuse of the US visa system. Applicants are advised to provide truthful information during the application process and adhere strictly to the terms of their visa while in the US. Any changes in status, such as switching jobs or dropping out of a course, must be reported to immigration authorities to avoid complications.","The US Embassy in India has clarified that obtaining a US visa is not the end of scrutiny.

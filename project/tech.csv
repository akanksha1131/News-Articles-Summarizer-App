Anthropic Claud Opus 4.6 gets ‘Fast Mode’: What is it and how it is different from standard mode,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anthropic-claud-opus-4-6-gets-fast-mode-what-is-it-and-how-it-is-different-from-standard-mode/articleshow/128068700.cms,"With Claude Opus 4.6 Fast Mode , Anthropic takes on Google Gemini 3 Flash

Days after launching its latest flagship model Opus 4.6, Anthropic has introduced “Fast Mode” for the LLM with the basic functionality – to provide significantly quicker response times for complex reasoning and software development tasks. The rollout comes as Anthropic gains broader mainstream recognition beyond the technology sector, such as Goldman Sachs infusing the AI company’s AI solution in their operations.According to Anthropic, the new mode can deliver responses up to 2.5 times faster than the standard version of Claude Opus 4.6. Currently in a limited research preview, Fast Mode is being offered as an early experiment through the Claude Developer Platform (API) and Claude Code.“Our teams have been building with a 2.5x-faster version of Claude Opus 4.6. We’re now making it available as an early experiment via Claude Code and our API,” the company said in a post on X.Apart from highlighting its prowess in undertaking tasks quickly, Anthropic also announced that running the fast mode is going to be pricier than the standard mode.“Fast mode is more expensive to run. It’s for urgent, high-stakes projects, combining impressive speed with Opus-level intelligence,” the company stated in a separate post on X.With this mode, Anthropic aims to take on Gemini 3 Flash which also offers fast responses as compared to Gemini 3. According to Google, Gemini 3 Flash is up to 3 times faster than Gemini 2.5 Pro, with Gemini 3.0 mainly recommended for “complex reasoning, multimodal and vision understanding and agentic and vibe coding tasks.”However, unlike Claude Opus 4.6 Fast Mode, Google Gemini 3 Flash is cost effective.“Gemini 3 Flash retains this foundation, combining Gemini 3's Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level latency, efficiency and cost. It not only enables everyday tasks with improved reasoning, but also is our most impressive model for agentic workflows,” the company added.Claude Opus 4.6 serves as Anthropic's most capable model to date, featuring improved planning capabilities and the ability to manage long-running, autonomous tasks.","Claude Opus 4.6 Fast Mode is being offered as an early experiment through the Claude Developer Platform (API) and Claude Code.

Netflix subscriber count increased despite price hike: Sarandos

Consumers have ‘one-click’ solution

Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos addressed lawmakers’ concerns over potential price hikes if the company’s proposed $72 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming assets is completed. While appearing before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust to defend the deal, Sarandos argued that the “one-click cancel” button remains the ultimate check on the entertainment giant’s power.During the hearing, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) challenged the merger, noting that Netflix has already demonstrated a pattern of raising prices. She said that once Netflix acquires the content on HBO Max, it will remove the competitive pressure that has helped keep subscription costs in check.Sarandos rejected the concerns, saying that the deal will not hurt consumers because past price increases have always been matched by an increase in content quality.“Whenever we come back and ask for a little more money, it’s because we’ve given them a lot more value,” Sarandos testified. He further claimed that Netflix subscribers currently pay an average of only 35 cents per hour of content consumed.He also emphasised that Netflix doesn't have “lock-in” mechanisms, and allows consumers to cancel their subscription if they think they are overpaying for what they are getting.“We are a one-click cancel. If at any point the consumer says, ‘That’s too much for what I’m getting,’ they can just with one click of the button cancel Netflix,” Sarandos told lawmakers.He also said that the merger will allow Netflix to expand its own production in the US, adding American jobs.“[Subscribers] have to really love what they’re watching, and thank goodness we’re doing a good job of that,” he added.The deal, which Netflix recently amended to an all-cash transaction, would bring HBO Max, the Harry Potter franchise, and The Big Bang Theory under the Netflix banner. The merger, however, will not include Warner Bros. Discovery’s linear cable networks.","Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos addressed lawmakers’ concerns over potential price hikes if the company’s proposed $72 billion acquisition of Warner Bros.

Why Microsoft needs a quality czar right now

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre. Charlie Bell, who led the company's security operations since 2021, is stepping down from that role to become what's effectively an engineering quality czar—reporting directly to Nadella.""Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo shared on Wednesday. ""And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!""Bell's replacement? Hayete Gallot, who's returning to Microsoft after an 18-month stint as Google Cloud's President of Customer Experience. She previously spent over 15 years at Redmond, climbing to the rank of corporate vice president across Windows, Office, and security teams.The shift is significant. Bell oversaw a team of roughly 10,000 people and was the driving force behind Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative—a company-wide push launched after Chinese hackers breached US government email accounts through a Microsoft Cloud exploit in 2023. That incident triggered a scathing review from the Department of Homeland Security, which called Microsoft's security culture ""inadequate.Now, Bell will work closely with cloud and AI chief Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on what Nadella calls the ""Quality Excellence Initiative."" The initiative is aimed at delivering ""durable, high-quality experiences at global scale""—corporate speak that likely translates to fewer Azure outages, fewer broken Windows patches, and fewer out-of-band emergency fixes.Gallot's appointment signals a shift in how Microsoft thinks about its security business. Nadella specifically highlighted her ability to combine ""product building with value realization for customers."" She'll also oversee Ales Holecek, who takes on a newly created Chief Architect for Security role.The timing isn't random. During last week's earnings call, Nadella talked up momentum in security products like Security Copilot agents and Purview. The company clearly wants someone who can sell security as aggressively as they build it.Nadella's memo doesn't spell out exactly why engineering quality needs its own dedicated leader at this moment. But the clues aren't hard to find. Microsoft now uses AI to write around 30 percent of its own code, Azure outages remain a recurring headache, and Copilot adoption sits at a modest 3.3 percent among Microsoft 365 users. Bell's got his work cut out.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre.

Meet Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei: Former OpenAI researcher who turned his AI vision into a $3.7 billion company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-former-openai-researcher-who-turned-his-ai-vision-into-a-3-7-billion-company/articleshow/127943143.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s academic background and early career path



Dario Amodei’s rise at OpenAI and the birth of GPT models



Dario Amodei leaves OpenAI and builds Anthropic



Dario Amodei’s cautious leadership style



Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now. He is not a loud public figure, and he rarely chases attention, but his work has quietly shaped how modern AI systems are built and controlled. Before running a multi-billion-dollar company, Amodei spent years in labs and research roles, studying complex systems and how they behave under pressure. That background still shows in how he talks about artificial intelligence today. While others focus on speed and scale, he appears more concerned with safety, limits, and long-term risks. As AI moves faster than regulation, Amodei’s cautious approach is becoming harder to ignore.Before AI became the world’s favourite buzzword, Amodei was deep in academia. He studied physics at Stanford University and later earned a PhD in biophysics from Princeton. At the time, he was focused on understanding complex biological systems. Cells. Signals. Patterns that emerge rather than being designed. Looking back, that mindset fits AI almost too well.After completing his doctorate, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine.There was no clear path to becoming a tech billionaire. That part came later. Almost accidentally, it seems. Amodei eventually moved into machine learning research, joining companies like Baidu and Google Brain. At Google, he worked on neural networks and AI safety.Colleagues from that period say he already seemed concerned about failure modes. In 2016, he joined OpenAI. Things moved fast after that.At OpenAI, Amodei rose quickly. By 2019, he was Vice President of Research, helping set the organisation’s overall research direction. He led work on GPT-2 and GPT-3, models that changed public perception of AI almost overnight.These systems could write essays, answer questions, and even mimic conversation. Sometimes convincingly. Sometimes awkwardly. During this time, Amodei also co-invented reinforcement learning from human feedback. RLHF sounds technical, but the idea is simple. Teach AI systems by showing them what humans actually prefer, not just what scores well mathematically.In 2021, Amodei left OpenAI along with six others, including his sister Daniela Amodei. They founded Anthropic. Some people were sceptical at first. But Anthropic took a different route. It became a public benefit corporation. That detail mattered. It signalled that profit would not be the only priority. At least in theory. Their AI model, Claude, leaned into being cautious. Less dramatic. More restrained. That tone appealed to companies worried about reputational risk.By September 2025, Anthropic was reportedly valued at $183 billion by private investors. That number raised eyebrows. Especially for a company without much public hype.Partnerships with Alphabet and Amazon helped fuel that growth. So did rising concerns about AI safety across governments and corporations. As Anthropic’s valuation climbed, so did Amodei’s wealth. His real-time net worth now sits around $3.7 billion, ranking among the world’s richest people.Amodei does not sound like most tech CEOs. He hedges. A lot. “It seems.” “It might.” “We’re not fully sure yet.” That language annoys some people. Others trust it more. He avoids grand predictions. No promises of utopia. No claims that AI will solve everything.Experts say his influence shows up in quieter ways. Safety research is becoming mainstream. Alignment discussions moving from fringe to boardroom. Competitors are copying ideas they once ignored. No one really knows what comes next for Dario Amodei. AI is moving fast. Faster than regulation.","Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now.

'OpenAI deal is eating Oracle alive financially'

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

US banks are pulling back—and that's a big problem

A possible Cerner sale and 40% upfront customer deposits show how tight things have gotten

Oracle is staring down the possibility of its largest-ever workforce reduction—and at the heart of it is a $300 billion partnership with OpenAI that's proving far more expensive than anyone initially let on.Investment bank TD Cowen reported this week that Oracle is weighing cuts of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs. The move would free up an estimated $8 to $10 billion in cash flow, money the company desperately needs as it tries to bankroll a sprawling network of AI data centers built largely to serve Sam Altman 's company.TD Cowen puts the OpenAI commitment alone at around $156 billion in capital spending—and roughly 3 million GPUs to back it up. Oracle has already burned through $58 billion in debt in just two months. That's $38 billion for data centers in Texas and Wisconsin, $20 billion for a campus in New Mexico. Total debt now sits north of $100 billion.The kicker? That $58 billion covers only a slice of what's actually needed. Since its September 2025 peak, Oracle's stock has shed more than half its value—about $463 billion in market cap, gone.The financing crunch isn't just an Oracle internal issue anymore.Multiple US banks have quietly retreated from lending on Oracle-linked data center projects. TD Cowen noted that lenders have roughly doubled the interest rate premiums they charge Oracle since September, pushing borrowing costs into territory usually reserved for junk-rated companies.The result? Several data center leases Oracle had been negotiating simply stalled. Private operators couldn't get the funding to build, which means Oracle can't deliver the capacity its customers—especially OpenAI—are counting on. Some Asian banks are still willing to step in, but that doesn't solve the immediate problem in the US, where most of Oracle's expansion is planned.Oracle isn't sitting idle. The company is now requiring new customers to pay up to 40% of contract value upfront—essentially asking clients to co-fund the infrastructure. It's also exploring ""bring your own chip"" arrangements, where customers supply their own hardware.On the table too is a potential sale of Cerner, the healthcare software unit Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in 2022. That would be a significant strategic pivot, signaling that AI infrastructure is now the clear priority—everything else is up for grabs.TD Cowen also flagged that OpenAI has already begun shifting some near-term capacity needs over to Microsoft and Amazon, which is not exactly a vote of confidence in Oracle's ability to deliver on schedule.The company has not publicly commented on the layoff reports or the financing difficulties.","Oracle faces massive job cuts, potentially 20,000-30,000, to fund its costly $300 billion OpenAI partnership.

"Egypt bans Roblox nationwide over child safety concerns, raising global questions about kids' online freedom",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/egypt-bans-roblox-nationwide-over-child-safety-concerns-raising-global-questions-about-kids-online-freedom/articleshow/127935398.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Roblox faces a government ban in Egypt: Here’s why



What this ban means for kids and parents



Roblox going dark in Egypt, the platform that lives almost entirely on screens, the sudden loss felt very real. With games loading, Avatars running around blocky worlds. And then Egypt has officially banned Roblox, saying the move is about protecting children from harmful online content. The story underneath feels layered, political, and a little messy. Roblox looks harmless on the surface but experts say the risk is not the visuals but the interaction. The platform allows users to create games, chat with strangers, and move freely between user-generated worlds.A spokesperson confirmed the company has reached out to Egyptian authorities, offering dialogue to resolve the issue and restore access. The company says it has worked with regulators in other regions to build localised safety systems that align with cultural values. Last year, the company restricted some features across parts of the Middle East to address safety concerns. This ban did not come out of nowhere. Roblox has already been blocked or restricted in countries like Qatar and Turkey with other nations watching closely.The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.According to state-run media, the ban will be coordinated with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. That means internet providers are expected to block access nationwide with no single official explanation was released at first. Later, state outlets pointed to growing concerns about children’s exposure to inappropriate content, online interactions, and psychological risks as reported by Bloomberg. An Egyptian senator had already called for regulating Roblox to protect children’s moral and educational values.President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi recently called for limits on children’s phone use, pointing to similar moves abroad. Australia has banned social media for certain age groups. France is moving in the same direction. Egypt’s parliament is now discussing broader rules for digital platforms including unified age classifications, stronger verification, penalties and possibly forcing companies to have local representatives inside the country.For children, the ban feels abrupt and confusing. For parents, reactions are mixed. Some welcome the move, while others worry it pushes kids toward less visible, less regulated platforms, potentially exposing them to more risks. That is the irony experts often point out. When one door closes, another usually opens. Sometimes darker, more unpredictable, and harder to monitor.Still, supporters of the ban argue that Roblox’s scale makes it different. Millions of users. Constant interaction. Endless content that cannot realistically be watched, moderated, or controlled by humans alone, leaving significant safety and privacy concerns for young players and families.","The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive. Anime Paradox February codes let you redeem gems, stat chips, trait rerolls, and more.For players trying to build a decent team without sinking hours into farming, they matter.Below is the list of all working Anime Paradox codes in February 2026.Anime Paradox is a Roblox tower defence game where players summon and command powerful anime-style units to fend off waves of enemies and bosses as they defend a base. It blends classic tower defence mechanics with strategic placement and AI-controlled unit combat, so battles play out automatically once your units are deployed.Anime Paradox is built around summoning and upgrading units.That’s the loop. And like most Roblox games built this way, Gems sit at the centre of everything. It sounds simple, but the cost adds up quickly. Progress slows if you rely only on gameplay rewards. They give players a chance to catch up, try new units, or recover from a bad roll.As of the latest update, several Anime Paradox codes are still active.As per the recent updates, there are no expired Anime Paradox codes; however, this can change at any time.Redeeming codes in Anime Paradox is refreshingly simple.

These include the ability to “ask me anything,” an emphasis on safety through “guardrails,” and a clear statement that Claude offers “ad-free chats.”X user NIK @ns123abc shared a screenshot of Claude’s new home page with the caption: “Anthropic won't stop COOKING OpenAI>they just put 'ad-free chats' on the welcome screen…lol, someone check on @sama”This comes days after the Claude-maker made its Super Bowl advertising debut with a 30-second spot which pokes fun at the ChatGPT-maker. The commercial dramatised the potential frustration of ads intruding into AI conversations.One of the ads released show a young man doing pull-ups in a park and he asks a muscular bystander for tips on how he can achieve six-packs abs. After listening to his question, the bystander starts with a robotic, chatbot-like response before abruptly pitching ‘StepBoost Max’ insoles, complete with a discount code. The tagline drives the point home: ‘Ads are coming to AI, But not to Claude’.","Anthropic has updated the homepage of its AI assistant, Claude, with a short introduction that highlights what the company says sets it apart.

How carmakers and their suppliers are reacting to US government’s deadline

“The suppliers don't want to share source code. That's their IP.”

“The connected-vehicle rule is a major tailwind for onshoring both software development and manufacturing,”

“If you think rare earths are a bad dependency to have on China, wait till you're dependent on cellular modules. It's much, much worse. It's broader,”

“More challenging is to be sure that no data that the car collects can ever be transmitted to China.”

Modern cars come with internet-connected apps and features that provide real-time data, convenience, and safety options. They enable the vehicle to communicate with external systems (the cloud), the driver's smartphone, and, in some cases, other vehicles or road infrastructure. Several of these systems are powered by Chinese technology. Now, the American car industry is reportedly scrambling to identify and remove this technology ahead of a looming March 17 deadline.New US government rules will soon ban Chinese software from internet-connected vehicle systems. This comes as part of an effort to prevent cameras, microphones, and GPS tracking in cars from being misused by foreign adversaries. Before the March deadline, carmakers must demonstrate to the US government that key components of their products don't contain software written in China or developed by a Chinese company.The connected-vehicle rule was introduced by the US Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which will also permit software if the carmaker gets the Chinese code transfered to a non-Chinese entity before the deadline.The Bureau of Industry and Security team has also suggested it plans to extend restrictions on Chinese technology to other products, including commercial vehicles and drones. This will be a test case for America's ability to decouple from Chinese supply chains.According to a Wall Street Journal report, the approaching deadline has increased pressure across the auto industry to reduce reliance on Chinese components. The shift began during pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and has continued amid growing geopolitical tensions, the report notes. Last year, Tesla decided to stop sourcing parts from China-based suppliers for vehicles manufactured in the US.Automakers typically procure electronic systems from large suppliers, who may, in turn, rely on smaller companies or joint ventures in China for software. This layered supply chain makes it difficult for automakers to clearly understand the origin of all the software in their vehicles. As new rules limit the use of Chinese software, companies are under pressure to gather information they did not previously need. However, suppliers are often unwilling to share details. As Brandon Barry, founder of Block Harbor, said,Even when Chinese software is identified, replacing it is not straightforward. Since automotive software is highly customised, making changes to an existing vehicle can pose safety and technical risks. Because of these challenges, cybersecurity experts expect that some automakers and suppliers may receive temporary exemptions if they can show they are managing risks through other measures.These rules are also driving changes across the industry. According to Matt Wyckhouse, CEO of Finite State, companies are even restructuring their operations. For example, global suppliers are relocating China-based software teams elsewhere, while Chinese firms are seeking new owners for their Western businesses.Pirelli is one example. The tyre maker may be affected because its largest shareholder is Sinochem, a Chinese company, and its smart tyres connect to the cloud. Pirelli, its shareholders, and the Italian government are discussing options. This includes reducing Sinochem’s stake or separating the US smart-tyre business.Some companies are benefiting from the shift. Ohio-based Eagle Wireless is working to build a US supply of cellular modules. It acquired source code from China’s Quectel and is helping automakers deliver software updates ahead of deadlines.said Mark Kvamme of Eagle.Chinese companies still dominate the market, holding 87% share last year. This has raised concerns, the report added.Charles Parton, an ex-UK diplomat, said at a US congressional committee in December 2025Commenting on the situation, Volvo CEO Håkan Samuelsson said,","New US government rules will soon ban Chinese software from internet-connected vehicle systems. This comes as part of an effort to prevent cameras, microphones, and GPS tracking in cars from being misused by foreign adversaries. Before the March deadline, carmakers must demonstrate to the US government that key components of their products don't contain software written in China or developed by a Chinese company.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128068204,imgsize-48486,width-400,resizemode-4/starting-march-17-america-may-not-allow-any-of-china39s-.jpg"

How to check if you are eligible for $20 discount

Google is reportedly giving a 20% discount to select YouTube TV users in the US, reports 9to5Google. The discount is being handed out for four months, translating to a total of $80 off on the service. However, the discount is not available to everyone and appears to be offered at random. As per the report, some users on Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) have said they spotted the offer directly in their YouTube TV account settings, without receiving any prior notification from Google.Users who want to check if they are eligible can visit their YouTube TV subscription settings on a desktop browser and select the “Manage” option. If the offer is available, a button showing the $20-per-month discount will appear. If not, there is currently no clear way to request or activate the offer manually.This isn’t the first time YouTube TV has issued credits during a content blackout. In 2022, subscribers received a $15 credit after a similar dispute temporarily removed Disney programming.Last year, YouTube compensated its subscribers with a $20 credit following a prolonged blackout of Disney-owned channels, including ESPN, ABC, FX, and National Geographic, which were unavailable since October 31, 2025 due to a contract dispute between YouTube and Disney.The blackout then stemmed from a pricing disagreement. YouTube TV claims Disney demanded higher rates, while Disney argues that YouTube is refusing to pay fair market value for its content. The standoff left millions of subscribers without access to key live sports and entertainment programming for over a week.The platform then confirmed that affected subscribers will receive a $20 credit applied to their next billing cycle. Emails with instructions on how to claim the credit are currently being sent out. The company emphasized that it is working to resolve the dispute and restore Disney channels “within hours” once a new agreement is reached.","Google is reportedly giving a 20% discount to select YouTube TV users in the US.

"Block to cut up to 1,100 jobs as Jack Dorsey pushes for leaner, meaner operation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/block-to-cut-up-to-1100-jobs-as-jack-dorsey-pushes-for-leaner-meaner-operation/articleshow/128063291.cms,"Jack Dorsey's fintech firm, Block Inc., is reportedly planning significant layoffs, potentially impacting up to 10% of its workforce. This move is part of a broader strategy to merge its Cash App and Square services, while also investing in Bitcoin and AI ventures. The company aims for greater efficiency amid financial performance scrutiny and a competitive market.

Block's big pivot: Merging Cash App and Square while betting on Bitcoin and AI

Jack Dorsey's fintech company Block Inc. is preparing to cut up to 10% of its staff as part of a broader business overhaul, Bloomberg reports. Hundreds of employees have been told their jobs may be eliminated during annual performance reviews, according to people familiar with the matter cited by Bloomberg. Block had fewer than 11,000 employees as of late November, which means roughly 1,100 workers could find themselves out of a job.The layoffs aren't coming out of nowhere. Block has been retooling its business model and staffing since 2024, when it reorganised reporting lines and laid out plans to operate more efficiently. The central piece of that restructuring involves integrating Cash App, its peer-to-peer payments platform, with Square, the merchant-focused payments service that gave the company its original identity when Dorsey co-founded it back in 2009.Both products have largely operated in their own lanes, but Block now wants them working in tandem. Alongside that integration effort, the company is investing in newer ventures — Proto, its Bitcoin mining business, and Goose, an internal artificial intelligence tool — as it looks to diversify beyond its core payments business.The push for efficiency comes at a time when Block's financial performance has been under the scanner.The company missed Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit amid persistent economic uncertainty and rising competition in the payments sector. Growth in the Square segment, which caters to small and medium-sized businesses, slowed to 9% during that quarter.That said, it hasn't all been rough. Block earned a spot on the S&P 500 index last July, replacing Hess Corp after Chevron's $53 billion acquisition of the energy producer — a milestone that signalled Wall Street's confidence in its long-term trajectory.The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings after market close on February 26. Analysts expect adjusted earnings of $403 million, or 68 cents per share, on revenue of $6.25 billion. Those numbers will offer a clearer picture of whether Dorsey's efficiency-first approach is starting to pay off.For now, the layoffs add Block to a growing list of tech companies trimming headcount as the industry continues to recalibrate after years of aggressive hiring.","Block Inc. is reportedly planning significant layoffs, potentially impacting up to 10% of its workforce.

Satya Nadella Recounts 2023 Story Of Indian Farmer Leveraging AI Bot For Subsidies

Read memo that CEO Satya Nadella sent to Microsoft employees

I am excited to share a couple updates in two of our core priorities: security and quality. Hayete Gallot is rejoining Microsoft as Executive Vice President, Security, reporting to me. I’ve also asked Charlie Bell to take on a new role focused on engineering quality, reporting to me.

Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer. And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!

Hayete joins us from Google where she was President, Customer Experience for Google Cloud. Before that, she spent more than 15 years at Microsoft with senior leadership roles across engineering and sales, playing multiple critical roles in building two of our biggest franchises – Windows and Office, leading our commercial solution areas’ go-to-market efforts. And she was instrumental in the design and implementation of our Security Solution Area. She brings an ethos that combines product building with value realization for customers, which is critical right now.

As we shared during our quarterly earnings last week, we have great momentum in security, including progress with Security Copilot agents, strong Purview adoption, and continued customer growth, and we will build on this.

We have a deep bench of talent and leaders across our security business, and this team will now report to Hayete. Additionally, Ales Holecek will take on a new role as Chief Architect for Security, reporting to Hayete. Ales has spent years leading architecture and development across some of our most important platforms and will help bring that same sensibility to security and its connections back to our existing scale businesses and the Agent Platform.

As we shared yesterday, we have a new operating rhythm with commercial cohorts, and Hayete and her team will now be accountable for our security product rhythms as part of this process.

Charlie built our Security, Compliance, Identity, and Management organization and helped rally the company behind the Secure Future Initiative. And we’re fortunate to have his continued focus and leadership on another one of our top priorities. With our Quality Excellence Initiative, we have increased accountability and accelerated progress against our engineering objectives to ensure we always deliver durable, high quality-experiences at global scale. And Charlie will partner closely with Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on this work.

I’m excited to welcome Hayete back to Microsoft to advance this mission critical work, and grateful to Charlie for all he has done for our security business and what he will continue to do for the company.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently announced senior leadership changes aimed at strengthening two areas the company has flagged as priorities: security and engineering quality. In an internal memo shared with employees, Nadella said Microsoft is appointing a new executive to lead security efforts and creating a dedicated role to focus on engineering quality across the company. The move comes as Microsoft continues to scale its cloud, AI, and enterprise businesses, where product reliability, secure systems, and consistent performance have become central to customer trust.As part of the changes, Nadella has brought back a former Microsoft executive to lead the company’s security organisation and has asked a long-time engineering leader to take on what he described as a focused role on quality. In the memo, Nadella acknowledged that Microsoft has made progress in security and engineering practices but said there is a need for sharper accountability and stronger execution as products reach users at global scale.The leadership reshuffle also reflects a shift in how Microsoft wants to manage engineering work, with closer oversight from the CEO’s office. Nadella told employees that both appointments are tied to long-term efforts already underway and are meant to ensure Microsoft delivers secure, stable, and high-quality products as its technology footprint continues to expand.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently announced senior leadership changes aimed at strengthening two areas the company has flagged as priorities: security and engineering quality.

Elon Musk issues another warning for America's debt 'problem': The only thing that can solve…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-issues-another-warning-for-americas-debt-problem-the-only-thing-that-can-solve/articleshow/128059067.cms,"“In the absence of AI and robotics, we're actually totally screwed because the national debt is piling up like crazy. It's the only thing that could solve the national debt. We are 1,000% going to go bankrupt as a country, and fail as a country, without AI and robots.

Nothing else will solve the national debt. We just need enough time to build the AI and robots to not go bankrupt before then,”

How deploying AI and robotics at large scale can help US with debt

""at very large scale""

""That seems likely because you simply won't be able to increase the money supply as fast as you increase the output of goods and services,""

""some form of crisis is almost inevitable""

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeated his warnings about America’s debt. The tech billionaire has predicted that financial trouble is inevitable without the transformative effects of AI and robotics on the economy. In an interview with podcaster Dwarkesh Patel and Stripe cofounder and president John Collison, the world’s richest man was asked why he pushed for aggressive spending cuts while leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), given that technology would increase GDP growth and ease the debt burden. Musk replied that he was concerned about waste and fraud. That's despite reports that many across-the-board staffing cuts included critical employees who had to be hired back.Musk said at the podcast.Musk pointed out that America’s interest payments alone on the $38.5 trillion debt pile are about $1 trillion a year, which exceeds the US military budget. Debt-servicing costs also top spending on social programmes like Medicare. However, US President Donald Trump has vowed to boost annual defence outlays to $1.5 trillion, so the defence budget could overtake interest payments again, at least temporarily.Reflecting on his work with DOGE, Musk said that he had hoped to slow down the unsustainable financial trajectory the US is on to buy more time for AI and robotics to boost growth.Last year, Musk made similar comments on Nikhil Kamath's podcast. He said that the deployment of AI and roboticsis the only solution to the US debt crisis. However, he cautioned that the increased output of goods and services resulting from these technologies would likely lead to significant deflation.Musk noted.Deflation would worsen the debt burden in real terms, while inflation would initially ease it, though a resulting spike in bond yields would eventually push debt-service payments higher.To be sure, the US has some built-in advantages, given that the dollar remains the world's reserve currency, allowing the Treasury Department to borrow at lower interest rates than it would otherwise.The US government's ability to issue debt in its own currency and the Federal Reserve's bond-buying capacity also reduce the risk of an outright default.Still, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget warned last month that the US is on a trajectory that could trigger six distinct types of fiscal crises.While it's difficult to know when disaster will strike,without a course correction, the CRFB said in a report.","Elon Musk has repeated his warnings about America’s debt.

As to who these employees are, the petition says: We are Google workers affiliated with No Tech for Apartheid that are fed up with watching our leadership betray our coworkers and our values, and want to stand together with you to demand accountability.We are Google workers appalled by the violence inflicted by United States Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs & Border Protection (CBP). In cities across the country we have witnessed these agencies conducting paramilitary-style raids, kidnapping hundreds of civilians, and murdering protestors and legal observers.Just in the last month, Keith Porter, Renee Good, and Alex Pretti have been murdered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agencies ICE and CBP. ICE's detention & deportation machine has killed at least 35 people in detention centers since July 2025.Google is powering this campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression. Cloud is helping to stitch together CBP surveillance systems along the border and nationwide, while also powering Palantir's ImmigrationOS system that ICE uses to track immigrants. Google generative AI is being used by DHS and CBP for ""workforce enablement"" and ""improving operational efficiency"". The Play Store has blocked the most effective ICE tracking apps for keeping our communities safe. YouTube has been running ICE recruitment and ""self-deport"" ads. As the workers who provide the foundational labor in building this technology, we are horrified.On January 11, Google Chief Scientist Jeff Dean tweeted, ""We all bear a collective responsibility to speak up and not be silent when we see things like the events of the last week."" We agree. In that spirit, we are speaking up today as Googlers.We are vehemently opposed to Google's partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE. We consider it our leadership's ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships.Toward this end, we demand the following of our executives:1. Acknowledge the danger and violence that workers face each day. In the cities they have targeted, ICE and CBP agents are creating humanitarian emergencies that rival COVID-era conditions. We need proportional community responses like school shutdowns and mutual aid networks. Just as Google did during the pandemic, we demand leadership acknowledge the danger facing all U.S.-based workers, and to publicly call for urgent government responses to this crisis.2. Host an emergency Q&A session for workers regarding our DHS, CBP, and military contracts. Leadership responses to employee questions about our contracts with the U.S. government and military have been vague and inconsistent, further obscured by AI summaries that wash out key points of the constituent Ask submissions. We demand a U.S.-based, live, and recorded Q&A session / employee town hall with relevant leadership to field top questions from employees, without any AI summarization or question-collapsing.3. Protect all Googlers — from cafeteria workers to data center employees. The threat ICE poses to Googlers demands that leadership provide material employee assistance. We demand leadership implement appropriate worker safety measures to meet this moment, such as flexible WFH policies and legal and immigration support, for all workers. This is especially important for those with fewer protections, such as TVCs, onsite staff, and data center workers. ICE agents have already visited our buildings. Our leadership must commit to keeping all Googlers safe.4. Disclose ties and declare red lines around use of our products for state violence and repression. Googlers want transparency. We demand precise clarity about admissible applications of our Cloud and AI technology, and transparency and full disclosure about how DHS agencies like CBP and ICE are abusing our products.Through its ICE operations, DHS is violating civil and national law as well as civil and human rights. We must end our complicity in powering them. As workers of conscience, we demand that our leadership end our backslide into contracting for governments enacting violence against civilians.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has a 'happy message' for worried and anxious investors of four of the biggest American technology companies -- Google , Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. Taking a question on investors worry about technology companies increasing Capital Expenditure due to spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, Jensen Huang said that the level of expenditures is appropriate and sustainable. Despite posting strong results, Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are facing concerns that they are overspending on data centers.Huang told CNBC that the build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure will continue for seven to eight years, saying that demand for AI is “just incredibly high.” “AI has become useful and very capable,” Huang said. “The adoption of it has become incredibly high.” Huang argues that artificial intelligence is already paying off for its adopters — and those customers would be doing even better if they had more data centers.Nvidia CEO said that he is not worried that the technology industry will add too much capacity. Unlike with the first build-out of the internet, there’s no infrastructure sitting idle. Companies like Anthropic PBC and OpenAI are generating profitable revenue, he said.Heavy capital spending by the world’s biggest tech companies has alarmed investors in the wake of earnings reports. The market value of Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon has declined by close to $1 trillion in total during past few days.Amazon, along with Google parent Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, are expected to shell out roughly $650 billion for AI tools in 2026, about 60% more than the prior year.In fact the $650 billion number that is spooking the investors of these technology companies is what is surging Nvidia shares. As much of that spending will flow to Nvidia, which makes data center processors that help develop and run AI models.Nvidia shares closed 7.8% higher on February 7, its best day since April 9, adding roughly $325 billion in value. This is the fourth-largest one-day market cap gain for a stock ever. This rise in stock price snapped a five-day losing streak for Nvidia, which erased about $500 billion amid a broader selloff as software and technology shares tumbled past week.","Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are facing concerns that they are overspending on data centers.

How DOJ and other regulators can block the Netflix-Warner Bros merger

“We have not been given any notice or seen any other sign that the DOJ is conducting a separate monopolisation investigation,”

“We are constructively engaging with the Department of Justice as part of the standard review of our proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. We remain focused on the value Netflix and Warner Bros. can create together,”

“value with a more certain, expedited path to completion.”

“I've decided I shouldn't be involved. The Justice Department will handle it.”

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) is reportedly investigating whether Netflix has engaged in anti-competitive practices. This comes as the DOJ investigates the company’s proposed $72 billion acquisition of Warner Discovery's studios and HBO Max streaming service. The US government agency has reportedly subpoenaed other companies to question how Netflix competes with its rivals. The report claims that the agency is examining whether the streaming giant’s planned Warner deal could strengthen its market dominance or lead to a future monopoly. US law grants its agencies broad authority to oppose mergers that could create a monopoly.the agency asked in a civil subpoena sent to another entertainment company viewed by The Wall Street Journal.In December 2025, Netflix agreed to pay $27.75 a share in cash in a deal totalling $72 billion to acquire Warner Bros and its assets. Meanwhile, Paramount also made a $77.9 billion hostile bid for all of WB, including its cable-networks unit that houses CNN, TNT, Food Network, and other channels.In addition to Netflix’s offer, the DOJ is reviewing Paramount's proposed acquisition, which Warner has urged its shareholders to reject.In its subpoena, the agency also asked whether either deal may hurt competition. It wondered how past studio or distributor mergers had affected competition for creative talent and sought information on how talent contracts vary across studios.Antitrust regulators can file lawsuits to block any deal that reduces competition. By scrutinising whether Netflix has unfairly hurt rivals, the DOJ can get another legal argument against the Warner acquisition. The line of questioning also could give the department a window into how Netflix does business.Steven Sunshine, a lawyer for Netflix, said the company thinks the agency is conducting a standard review of its proposal to buy Warner's studio and streaming assets.Sunshine said.a Netflix spokeswoman told WSJ.Meanwhile, a Paramount spokeswoman said the company's all-cash offer for all of Warner provides its investors withHowever, DOJ’s investigation is in its early stages. The department's merger reviews can take up to a year, though they sometimes proceed more quickly. Regulators conduct many antitrust investigations, and not all lead to formal legal action against a deal.Both Netflix and Paramount are also likely to face antitrust review in Europe and in the UK. Regulators sometimes investigate whether to block a merger because the acquirer is already too powerful in a given market.The report noted that if the deal goes through, Netflix and HBO Max together would control around 30% of the US subscription streaming marketplace. Netflix has disputed the statistic, saying it isn't meaningful because 80% of HBO Max subscribers also subscribe to Netflix. The company argues that it competes in a marketplace that also includes YouTube and other free video platforms on TV.Mergers between direct competitors are presumed illegal when the combined company would have more than 30% market share, according to Justice Department guidelines. However, U.S. law defines monopolies as having a market share of 60% or more.Netflix has said that a combination with Warner's HBO Max streaming service would account for only 10% of viewing time in US TV households. The company has argued that Netflix doesn't directly compete with Warner Bros. and that its deal should be treated as a vertical merger, meaning Netflix is primarily a distributor of content and Warner is a supplier of movies and TV shows.Warner and Netflix have said they expect regulatory approval for the deal. This week, Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that consumers would pay less for a bundled offering of Netflix and HBO Max.In a recent interview with NBC News, US President Donald Trump said that he wouldn't get involved in the deal and that it was up to the Justice Department.

Cook gets philosophical about succession and retirement

A record-breaking quarter sets the stage

Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed the company is planning a celebration to mark its 50th anniversary this April, telling employees he’s been “unusually reflective” about the milestone.“When you really stop and pause and think about the last 50 years, it makes your heart sing. It really does. I promise some celebration,” Cook said during an all-hands meeting on Thursday, as reported by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.Apple was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in a garage in Los Altos, California. The company has since grown into the world’s most valuable publicly traded firm, with over 2.5 billion active devices worldwide.The 50th anniversary reflections weren’t the only thing on Cook’s mind. The 65-year-old CEO also opened up about leadership transitions, saying he spends considerable time thinking about who will steer Apple in the future.“I am obsessed with this—who’s in the room 15 years from now,” Cook said, per Bloomberg. He described the recent retirements of COO Jeff Williams, environmental affairs head Lisa Jackson, and general counsel Katie Adams as carefully planned moves, “not surprises.”Hardware chief John Ternus is widely seen as a frontrunner to eventually succeed Cook, having recently expanded his oversight to include design work at Apple.The anniversary comes at a strong moment for Apple financially. The company just posted its biggest quarter ever with $143.8 billion in revenue, fuelled by a 23% jump in iPhone sales. Cook called the demand “simply staggering” during the recent earnings call, with records set across every geographic region.Cook also used Thursday’s meeting to address immigration concerns among employees and talk up Apple’s AI ambitions, calling artificial intelligence “one of the most profound opportunities of our entire lifetime.”While details of the 50th anniversary plans remain under wraps, Apple marked its 40th in 2016 with a video compressing four decades of innovation into 40 seconds. Whatever Cook has planned this time, the stage is certainly set for something bigger.","Apple was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in a garage in Los Altos, California.

Concerns raised over Nvidia-OpenAI deal

Jensen Huang’s u-turn on OpenAI

Possible reason behind tension between OpenAI and Nvidia

Sam Altman has defended OpenAI ’s partnership with Nvidia, saying that the AI company “loves working” with the chip maker. Sharing a post on X, Altman described Nvidia’s chips as “the best AI chips in the world.” He added that OpenAI hopes to remain a “gigantic customer” of the chip maker for a long time. “We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time,” Sam Altman said adding “I don't get where all this insanity is coming from”.Sam Altman’s comments come amid growing market speculation around OpenAI’s long-term computing strategy and reports suggesting that Nvidia may be reassessing the pace of its investments linked to OpenAI.In September 2025, Nvidia announced to make a planned investment of $100 billion in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. In a joint announcement, OpenAI President Greg Brockman and Jensen Huang called the deal “the largest computing project in history.” The deal was expected to close within weeks, however, negotiations have dragged on for months.But, a Wall Street Journal report recently said that the talks have been stalled after some inside the chip giant expressed doubts about the deal.The report quotes people familiar with the matter who said that Huang has privately pointed to growing competition from companies such as Google and Anthropic.More pointedly, he has reportedly criticised what he sees as a lack of discipline in OpenAI's business approach and raised concerns about growing competition from Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude.Speaking to reporters outside a Taipei restaurant on January 31, Nvidia CEP Jensen Huang said “Yes, Nvidia will invest in OpenAI. Yes, it'll be big. But $100 billion? ""No, no, nothing like that.""A day later, Huang took a u-turn. ""It was never a commitment,"" he told reporters on February 1. ""They invited us to invest up to $100 billion and of course, we were very happy and honored that they invited us, but we will invest one step at a time”.Huang also brushed off a report of tension with OpenAI, saying the idea was “nonsense” and that Nvidia planned a huge investment in OpenAI.As per a Reuters report , ""Nvidia’s graphics processing chips are well-suited for massive data crunching necessary to train large AI models like ChatGPT that have underpinned the explosive growth of AI globally to date. But AI advancements increasingly focus on using trained models for inference and reasoning, which could be a new, bigger stage of AI, inspiring OpenAI's efforts. The ChatGPT-maker’s search for GPU alternatives since last year focused on companies building chips with large amounts of memory embedded in the same piece of silicon as the rest of the chip, called SRAM. Squishing as much costly SRAM as possible onto each chip can offer speed advantages for chatbots and other AI systems as they crunch requests from millions of users."" Last year, OpenAI struck deals with AMD and others for GPUs built to rival Nvidia’s. In fact, sources say OpenAI's deal with AMD didn't go very well with partner Nvidia.This AI inference has become the new front in the competition. The decision by OpenAI and others to seek out alternatives in the inference chip market marks a significant test of Nvidia’s AI dominance and comes at a time when the two companies are in investment talks.","Sam Altman has defended OpenAI’s partnership with Nvidia, saying that the AI company “loves working” with the chip maker.

Tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush has now warned that Wall Street is overrating to the rise of artificial intelligence, pushing software companies as if they are obsolete. Speaking to Bloomberg TV in an interview, Ives explained the present downturn as unprecedented, “In 25 years, this structural sell-off in software is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. ” Software giants such as Salesforce, ServiceNow and Microsoft have been hit hard with valuations suggesting investors expect declining relevance in the AI era. As per Ives, some models even imply that these companies could lose about 5% of their customer base in the coming years.Ives also acknowledged that AI is reshaping the industry, but he rejected the notion that software companies are facing any kind of extinction. “Software doesn’t have space in today’s AI age” is how investors seem to be treating them, he said, but emphasized that this view is misguided. Explaining his stance, Ives pointed to Palantir Technologies as an example of a software company which is thriving by integrating AI into its offerings. The message: AI may be disruptive, but it is also an opportunity for software firms to evolve and remain central to the tech ecosystem.Ives’ comments align with those of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who recently dismissed the idea of software obsolescence at the Cisco AI Summit. Huang called the notion “illogical,” stressing that AI systems fundamentally rely on software and cannot replace it.“There's this notion that the tool ‌in the ‍software industry is in decline, and will be ‍replaced by AI ... It is the most illogical ‌thing in the world, and time will prove itself. If you were a human or robot, artificial, general robotics, would you use tools or reinvent tools? The answer, obviously, is to use tools ... That's why the latest breakthroughs in AI are about tool use, because the tools ‍are designed to be explicit,” Huang said at the event.Huang argued that AI will continue to rely on existing software rather than rebuild basic tools from scratch, pushing back against investor fears of AI-driven disruption in the data and professional services industry.","Wall Street is overrating the rise of artificial intelligence, says Wedbush's Dan Ives.

Google-parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are collectively expected to invest nearly $700 billion into capital expenditure in 2026. As reported by CNBC, this three-digit number has unsettled the analysts and investors. The spending surge represents an increase of 60% from the previous year (2025). This large investment underscores the sale of the AI arms race and it also raises concerns about cash flow and profitability in the near future.As per the CNBC report, this bulk investment from the tech giants will be directed towards high-priced chips, sprawling data centers and advanced networking technology needed to power AI models and cloud services. Amazon has revealed the most aggressive plan, forecasting around $200 billion in apex. On the other hand, Alphabet is close behind with up to $185 billion this year. Microsoft and Meta are also pretty close and together the tech giants are investing around $700 billion this year in AI.This spending spree from Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon comes at a cost. The four companies generated a free cash flow of $200 billion in 2025 which is down from $237 billion in 2024.The analysts are now expecting a much shorter decline in this number. Amazon has projected to run negative free cash flow of $17 to $18 billion in 2026, whereas Alphabet has already turned debt markets raising $25 billion in bonds last November as its long-term debt has quadrupled to $46.5 billion.As per the report, the investors have now responded with caution. Amazon’s shares fell almost 6% on Friday, extending its year-to-date decline to 9%. Microsoft has dropped 17% this year, the steepest among the group, while Alphabet and Meta have managed slight gains. The mixed performance reflects both optimism about long-term AI growth and anxiety over near-term financial strain.Wall Street analysts argue that the upfront investments are necessary to secure dominance in AI, but the short-term impact is clear: margin pressures, reduced cash generation, and reliance on debt and equity markets.

Markets unhappy with Amazon’s quarterly earnings

Big spending plans worry investors

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has slipped behind Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the global wealth rankings after Amazon’s latest earnings report failed to meet market expectations. According to Forbes Billionaires List 2025, Jeff Bezos’ net worth was reduced by $16 billion (6.9%) to $218.9 billion, trailing behind Zuckerberg with $226.6 billion net worth. Elon Musk remains the world’s wealthiest person with a net worth of $839.4 billion, followed by Google cofounders Larry Page ($267.3 billion) and Sergey Brin ($246.6 billion).Shares of Amazon fell sharply after the company posted quarterly earnings slightly below estimates and signalled much higher future spending. According to Forbes, Amazon shares dropped about 9.3% on February 6 to around $202. The fall came after the company reported earnings of $1.95 per share for the latest quarter, missing Wall Street estimates of $1.97 per share. Revenue rose to $213.4 billion, which was higher than expected, but investors focused more on profits and future costs.The stock drop reduced Jeff Bezos’ personal wealth, allowing Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to move ahead of him. Market concerns were reportedly linked to Amazon’s growing capital expenditure (Capex) plans, especially around artificial intelligence (AI) and infrastructure.During the earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company expects capital expenditure of around $200 billion in 2026.He said the spending would support demand for AI products, custom chips, robotics, and low-orbit satellites. The figure is about 36% higher than what Wall Street had projected. Analysts at MoffettNathanson said the increase was larger than expected and raised concerns about returns.Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft together expect to spend around $610 billion in 2026, mainly driven by AI-related investments. While companies say the spending supports long-term growth, investors remain cautious about costs and near-term returns.","Shares of Amazon fell sharply after the company posted quarterly earnings slightly below estimates and signalled much higher future spending.

Siri will remain the default assistant, with its button and wake word unchanged.

To use AI apps, drivers will need to open the app within CarPlay, though developers can design them to launch voice mode automatically.

This ensures Apple maintains control over the CarPlay experience while expanding functionality.

Increasing demand for AI in cars



Apple’s own AI push



Apple is reportedly preparing to bring a major update to its CarPlay vehicle interface which will enable the drivers to access third-party AI voice assistants such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini. This move marks the first time Apple will permit outside voice-control within CarPlay, breaking Siri’s long-standing exclusivity. As reported by Bloomberg, the company is working to support apps in CarPlay and the change is said to come in coming months.Until now, Siri has been the only voice assistant integrated into CarPlay. Siri is responsible for handling music playback, messaging and navigation. However, with the upcoming change, the drivers will now be able to query AI chatbots directly via CarPlay. For instance, asking ChatGPT for restaurant recommendations — without taking their hands off the wheel. However, Apple has not yet commended on the matter.Consumers have increasingly sought broader AI capabilities beyond Siri’s scope, often resorting to workarounds like syncing iPhone widgets to CarPlay. The integration of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini will streamline access, making AI-powered queries more natural in the driving environment.Apple is also working to enhance Siri with “World Knowledge Answers”, a feature that will add web search and summarisation abilities similar to ChatGPT.

How Google DeepMind's Genie 3 model can help Waymo



""no substitute""

""can simulate virtually any scene.""

Waymo is using DeepMind's Genie 3 artificial intelligence (AI) model to create realistic digital environments where its autonomous vehicles can train on rare and difficult driving scenarios. The Alphabet-owned self-driving company recently published a blog post announcing its new Waymo World Model. This AI model is built on Genie 3's ability to construct virtual environments from text prompts. The system generates synthetic driving footage and depth perception data, as if captured by vehicle-mounted cameras and lidar sensors.In a statement to Bloomberg, a Waymo spokesperson said,and the new world modelWaymo's system can also convert real-life dashcam datasets into scenes and depth maps for vehicle simulations. The company said this combination will make its autonomous vehicle systems more reliable in uncommon scenarios and help expand Waymo's self-driving services across more markets.the spokeswoman added.Last week, Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 model gained major attention with demonstrations of its world-building capabilities. This also triggered a sell-off in companies that provide game development and graphics creation tools.By incorporating Google's Genie 3 model, Waymo could gain momentum for its plans to expand to about a dozen cities this year. Simulation is just one tool it uses to prepare its autonomous systems for specific situations and validate their safety, the spokesperson noted.In December 2025, the company said there isfor its real-world driving experience. Recently, Alphabet reported Waymo had surpassed 20 million autonomous trips that month.However, the company spokesperson declined to comment on whether it has conducted simulations of stopped school bus encounters or mass power outages, such as the one that disrupted its San Francisco operations last year. Yet, she noted the Waymo World ModelWaymo is currently facing safety probes from US authorities after a series of software mishaps in recent months. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating multiple incidents in which Waymo failed to stop for parked school buses in Austin. These violations have also prompted the company to issue a voluntary recall of its software.Beyond Waymo, other robotaxi operators and AI companies have been seeking additional data sources to improve their models. Nvidia, which supplies chips and AI models for developers of self-driving technology, has partnered with ride-hailing company Uber to collect millions of hours of robotaxi-specific driving data to fuel driverless model training and validation.SoftBank Group-backed Wayve, which plans to trial robotaxis on the Uber platform in the UK this year, has announced its own world model to generate synthetic driving data. Elon Musk ’s Tesla has also said that it has built a similar simulator. Bigger training data sets will be crucial for Waymo and help avoid such incidents.",Waymo is using DeepMind's Genie 3 artificial intelligence model to create realistic digital environments where its autonomous vehicles can train on rare and difficult driving scenarios.

What is Pilloo AI launched for small business owners, and what is it all about



How Pilloo AI aims to change small business life



How Piloo AI works



Record daily sales.

Track payments.

Get balance sheets.

Automate purchase entries and bank transactions.

In India, millions of small business owners are reportedly held back by complex systems and paperwork. But now, this new AI may help small business owners to stage for a future where businesses run on conversation rather than forms and screens. It might also accelerate India’s digital economy, particularly in smaller towns and cities where leaning to technological based might be slower.Pilloo AI, reportedly the country’s first voice-based billing and accounting agent, was officially launched in Andhra Pradesh . The event had Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu in attendance, along with top bureaucrats, local politicians, and the Pilloo AI team.No more fiddling with complicated software and no more staring at spreadsheets. Instead, business owners can now just talk, ask for invoices, check reports, and even record transactions all in their own language.Pilloo AI is an AI-powered billing and accounting platform developed by Pilloo AI Private Limited, headquartered in Andhra Pradesh. It is designed specifically for small and medium businesses that often struggle with complicated software and manual bookkeeping.The tool lets business owners do a lot just by speaking. You can create invoices, record daily transactions, track payments, fetch reports, and even manage balance sheets.It also automates purchase entries and bank transactions.Interestingly, it works through natural conversation. You don’t need accounting knowledge, rather your own language. Currently, this knows 5 Indian languages, with plans to expand to over 50 globally.For decades, small businesses relied on pen, paper, or clunky software. Many owners still keep manual records, especially in smaller towns and rural areas where digital access is limited. Ram Mohan, co-founder of Pilloo AI, reportedly said it’s about breaking that barrier. “We wanted something anyone could use. No screens, no paperwork, no fear,” he mentioned, emphasising simplicity, inclusivity, and ease of adoption for even the least tech-savvy users.The launch event at the Andhra Pradesh Secretariat was reportedly lively. CS Vijayanand, MLA Prathipati Pulla Rao, Muthavarapu Suresh, and investors of Pilloo AI were present. Naidu himself apparently highlighted how tools like this make life easier for entrepreneurs, encourage innovation, and promote digital growth across the state.Sai Praneeth G, founder of Pilloo AI, explained the platform helps business owners in very simple ways.But experts caution that AI isn’t perfect. Errors can happen, such as mishearing numbers or missing a transaction. Still, early tests reportedly show the platform is surprisingly accurate.","Pilloo AI is an AI-powered billing and accounting platform developed by Pilloo AI Private Limited, headquartered in Andhra Pradesh.

This contrasts with Elon Musk and Sundar Pichai's ambitious plans for orbital AI infrastructure, citing terrestrial power limitations. While Google aims for test launches in 2027, Garman highlights the immense practical hurdles.

“It is just not economical,”

What are AWS CEO Matt Garman ’s concerns about AI data centres in space

“There are not enough rockets to launch a million satellites yet, so we're, like, pretty far from that. If you think about the cost of getting a payload in space today, it's massive,”

What Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk said about AI data centres in space

“36 months or less. Maybe 30 months.”

“harder to scale on the ground than it is to scale in space”.

“about five times the effectiveness”

“day-night cycle, seasonality, clouds, or an atmosphere.”

“the atmosphere alone results in about a 30% loss of energy”

“they’re quite reliable past a certain point.”

“At Google, we are always proud of taking moon shots,""

one of our moon shots is how do we one day have data centres in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun?”

“put these data centres in space closer to the sun”

“first step in 2027.”

“We'll send tiny racks of machines and have them in satellites, test them out, and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away will be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centres,”

Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has dismissed the feasibility of space-based data centres. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Garman called the concept uneconomical in a recent interview. His comments undermine the huge confidence shown by tech leaders, including SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.Garman said at the Cisco AI Summit in San Francisco. To explain his distrust, he cited the high cost of launching payloads into orbit and insufficient rocket capacity to support the infrastructure required for orbital data centres, Reuters reported.This comes as both Musk and Pichai have shared their ambitions to build artificial intelligence (AI) training data centres in space to reduce dependence on Earth’s resources.Last month, Musk announced the merger of SpaceX and xAI. One reason for the move is to establish a support system for the development of data centres in outer space. In a memo, Musk said it will be critical because ""global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions.""In November 2025, Google announced Project Suncatcher. This is the Pichai-led company’s orbital data centre initiative, which could begin test launches as early as next year.Garman pointed towards the practical barriers that make the concept ‘impossible’ even in the coming years.he said, as per the Reuters report.The debate over space-based computing facilities has emerged as AI’s rapid expansion creates demands for computing power and cooling that challenge traditional land-based data centres, prompting cloud computing companies to explore alternative solutions.In a recent Dwarkesh podcast, Musk said that the cheapest place to deploy AI would be in space. He suggested that this could happen withinCiting limits on terrestrial power generation, Musk argued that it isHe said space-based solar panels offerbecause there is noHe added thatand that batteries would not be needed for these data centres, as they’ll be solar-powered.

The ‘promotion’ that fractured OpenAI board



Read full email that Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott's sent to CEO Satya Nadella and other leaders



[This document is from Musk v. Altman (2026).]

From: Kevin Scott

Sent: Sunday, November 19, 2023 7:31 AM

To: Frank X. Shaw, Satya Nadella, Brad Smith, Amy Hood, Caitlin McCabe

Frank,

I can help you with the timeline and with our best understanding of what was going on. I think the reality was that a member of the board, llya Sutskever, had been increasingly at odds with his boss, Sam, over a variety of issues.

One of those issues is that there is a perfectly natural tension inside of the company between Research and Applied over resource allocations. The success of Applied has meant that headcount and GPUs got allocated to things like the API and ChatGPT. Research, which is responsible for training new models, could always use more GPUs because what they're doing is literally insatiable, and it's easy for them to look at the success of Applied and believe that in a zero sum game they are responsible for them waiting for GPUs to become available to do their work. I could tell you stories like this from every place l've ever worked, and it boils down to, even if you have two important, super successful things you're trying to work on simultaneously, folks rarely think about the global optima. They believe that their thing is more important, and that to the extent that things are zero sum, that the other thing is a cause of their woes. It's why Sam has pushed us so hard on capacity: he's the one thing about the global optima and trying to make things non-zero sum. The researchers at OAl do not appreciate that they would not have anywhere remotely as many GPUs as they do have if there were no Applied at all, and that Applied has a momentum all its own that must be fed. So the only reasonable thing to do is what Sam has been doing: figure out how to get more compute.

The second of the issues, and one that's deeply personal to llya, is that Jakub moreso than Ilya has been making the research breakthroughs that are driving things forward, to the point that Sam promoted Jakub, and put him charge of the major model research directions. After he did that, Jakub's work accelerated, and he's made some truly stunning progress that has accelerated in the past few weeks. I think that Ilya has had a very, very hard time with this, with this person that used to work for him suddenly becoming the leader, and perhaps more importantly, for solving the problem that Ilya has been trying to solve the past few years with little or no progress. Sam made the right choice as CEO here by promoting Jakub.

Now, in a normal company, if you don't like these two things, you'd appeal to your boss, and if he/she tells you that they've made their decision and that it's final, your recourse is accept the decision or quit. Here, and this is the piece that everyone should have been thinking harder about, the employee was also a founder and board member, and the board constitution was such that they were highly susceptible to a pitch by Ilya that portrays the decisions that Sam was making as bad. I think the things that made them susceptible, is that two of the board members were effective altruism folks who all things equal would like to have an infinite bag of money to build AGI-like things, just to study and ponder, but not to do anything with. None of them were experienced enough with running things, or understood the dynamic at OAI well enough to understand that firing Sam not only would not solve any of the concerns they had, but would make them worse. And none of them had experience, and didn't seek experience out, in how to handle something like a CEO transition, certainly not for the hottest company in the world.

The actual timeline of events through Friday afternoon as I understand them:

Thursday late night, the board let's Mira know what they're going to do. By board, it's Ilya, Tash, Helen, and Adam.

Mira calls me and Satya about 10-15 minutes before the board talks to Sam. This is the first either of us had heard of any of this. Mira sounded like she had been run over by a truck as she tells me.

OAl Board notifies Sam at noon on Friday that he's out, and that Greg is off the board, and immediately does a blog post.

OAl all hands at 2P to rattled staff.

Greg resigns. He was blindsided and hadn't been in the board deliberations, and hadn't agreed to stay.

Jakub and a whole horde of researchers reach out to Sam and Greg trying to understand what happened, expressing loyalty to them, and saying they will resign.

Friday night Jakub and a handful of others resign.

Microsoft chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, sent an email to CEO Satya Nadella and president Brad Smith, along with other C-suite executives, explaining the series of events that led to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in November 2023. An email, dated November 19, 2023, suggests that the “shock” firing was not the result of a single ideological clash, but rather a mix of a variety of issues between llya Sutskever and Altman.The email, posted by X handle Internal Tech Emails, said that Sutskever “had been increasingly at odds with” Altman over two primary friction points. The first point of failure was an internal ‘battle’ over computing power. As ChatGPT’s popularity surged, the demand for GPUs became a zero-sum game within the company.According to Scott, Altman’s decision to prioritise GPU for the consumer products and API division infuriated the core research teams because they felt the fundamental work was being “starved” of the resources needed for the next generation of models.The second conflict was deeply personal to Sutskever, who – according to Scott’s email – had a hard time with the promotion of Jakub Pachocki, a researcher who had previously worked under Sutskever.After Pachocki spearheaded several major research breakthroughs, Altman promoted him to lead OpenAI’s core model development. While Scott characterised the move as “logical from a CEO perspective,” it alienated Sutskever.","Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott sent email to CEO Satya Nadella and other leaders.

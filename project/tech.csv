The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is raising alarms about how Google's Gmail service handles political emails. FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson sent a letter to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, alleging that Gmail's spam filters unfairly target messages from Republican senders while allowing similar ones from Democrats to go through. In the letter, Ferguson stated, ""My understanding from recent reporting is that Gmail's spam filters routinely block messages from reaching consumers when those messages come from Republican senders but fail to block similar messages sent by Democrats.""This isn't the first time Google has faced such accusations. Republicans and conservatives have long claimed that major tech companies suppress conservative viewpoints, an assertion the companies have consistently denied.The FTC chair’s letter warned Google that a failure to comply with regulations could lead to an ""FTC investigation and potential enforcement action.""A Google spokesperson pushed back on the claims, stating that the company’s spam filters are non-partisan. ""Gmail's spam filters look at a variety of objective signals — like whether people mark a particular email as spam... This applies equally to all senders, regardless of political ideology,"" the spokesperson said. The company also confirmed it would review the letter and engage ""constructively"" with the FTC.A lawsuit filed by the Republican National Committee making similar claims was previously dismissed by a U.S. judge.","FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson sent a letter to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.

AI 'Class Divide' and Productivity Dilemma

A new survey from WalkMe , an SAP company, reveals a striking paradox in the modern workplace: The employees who use AI the most—top executives and Gen Z workers—are also the least likely to receive official guidance, training, or company approval for their use. The findings from the 2025 AI in the Workplace survey suggest that a phenomenon dubbed "" AI shame "" is taking hold. The annual survey polled 1,000 working U.S. adults who use AI in their jobs to understand the reality of AI adoption.Nearly half of all workers surveyed (48.8%) admitted to hiding their use of AI on the job to avoid judgment. This discomfort is particularly pronounced at the top, with 53.4% of C-suite leaders confessing they conceal their AI habits, despite being the most frequent users.x`Almost half (45%) of workers admit to pretending to know how to use an AI tool in a meeting to avoid scrutiny, while 49% have hidden their use of AI to avoid judgment. This trend is even more pronounced among Gen Z, with 55.5% pretending to understand AI tools and 62% hiding their use.Gen Z workers show both enthusiasm and anxiety regarding AI. A notable 62.6% of Gen Zers have used AI to complete work but then pretended it was their own, the highest rate among any generation. Over half (55.4%) have feigned understanding of AI in meetings.Despite this widespread use—89.2% of Gen Z employees use AI at work -- they report receiving the least amount of support. Only 6.8% have received extensive, time-consuming AI training, and 13.5% received none at all. This lack of formal guidance has led 89.2% of them to use tools not provided or sanctioned by their employers.""Companies are not educating enough about this whole thing,"" said Sharon Bernstein, WalkMe's Chief Human Resources Officer, in an interview with Fortune. She noted that companies are failing to facilitate the use of AI tools or guide their employees effectively.The survey also points to an ""AI class divide,"" where access to training and guidance increases with rank. Only 3.7% of entry-level employees receive substantial training, compared to 17.1% of C-level executives. This leaves the most frequent users, junior and younger staff, to navigate the new technology on their own, risking a growing knowledge gap.While 80% of employees believe AI has boosted their productivity, a significant number are struggling. Almost 60% confessed to spending more time trying to manage AI tools than it would have taken to do the work themselves.Gen Z is particularly affected by this paradox:* 65.3% say AI slows them down, the highest among all age groups.* 68% feel pressure to produce more work because of it.* Nearly one in three are deeply anxious about AI's impact on their jobs.This disconnect between corporate hype and on-the-ground reality fits into a broader picture of chaotic AI implementation. For instance, a recent MIT study found a staggering 95% failure rate for generative AI pilot programs at large enterprises, suggesting a significant gap between the theory of AI and its practical application.","A new survey from WalkMe reveals a striking paradox in the modern workplace.

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet is one of the most powerful executives in the world. Julie she has battled cancer twice. In a recent interview with Fortune, Julie Sweet opened up about her dual battles with cancer and how the experiences shaped her approach to both business and life. Sweet, who leads a global workforce of 770,000, is among global top CEOs, but her journey to the top was anything but traditional. During a discussion on the new Fortune vodcast, ""Fortune 500: Titans and Disrupters of Industry,"" Sweet shared a personal story of professional triumph and personal struggle. ""What’s most remarkable about me being Global CEO is not that I’m the first woman or that I was a lawyer, but I’m actually the first CEO that didn’t start at Accenture out of college,"" she stated.Sweet recalled the ""incredible moment"" in 2014 when she was presented with an opportunity to take on a major leadership role at the company. Just one month later, however, her life was put into sharp perspective when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. As a mother of young children, the diagnosis prompted her to reflect on her life's choices. ""I asked myself if I had any regrets and I actually felt like I struck the right balance,"" she said. This reflection became a guiding principle, a ""litmus test"" she has used ever since.Accenture CEO Julie Sweet's second cancer diagnosisJulie Sweet revealed that her second cancer diagnosis, discovered through a self-exam, was a more profound wake-up call. While the first diagnosis was about finding balance, the second was a deeper reflection on long-term health and quality of life. ""I want to live a really long life, and I want that to be a quality life,"" she told Fortune.Julie Sweet said that as a working mom, what went to the wayside the most was a focus on my health. ""I really want to encourage women to make sure that they’re getting their mammograms and they’re doing their regular self-exams. Ultimately, because I caught it early, I’m here, and I was able to get through it pretty quickly. But this time around, for me, it was more of a wakeup call than just focusing on my health. It was a reflection on, I want to live a really long life. You get really clear: I want to live a really long life, and I want that to be a quality life,"" she said.Inspired by the book Outlive by Peter Attia, she now focuses on actions that will ensure her final years are lived to the fullest.

Tesla 'loses' the court case that carmakers across the world have been closely watching; to appeal the verdict; claim lawyers misled jury on Elon Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-loses-the-court-case-that-carmakers-across-the-world-have-been-closely-watching-to-appeal-the-verdict-claim-lawyers-misled-jury-on-elon-musk/articleshow/123601994.cms,"Tesla

Tesla says opposing lawyers misled court on Elon Musk

Tesla is challenging a $243 million court verdict, arguing that the opposing lawyers misled the jury by focusing on CEO Elon Musk . The company filed a motion in a Miami federal court, seeking to either overturn the verdict, secure a new trial, or significantly reduce the damages awarded. The case involves a fatal 2019 crash where a 22-year-old student, Naibel Benavides, was killed. The victim's family and her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, were awarded compensatory and punitive damages. Although the jury found the driver of the Tesla to be mostly at fault, it also assigned significant blame to Tesla's Autopilot technology.“If the verdict is allowed to stand, it will chill innovation, harm road safety and invite future juries to punish manufacturers who bring new safety features to market,” the company said in the filing.This trial has been closely monitored by the carmakers across the world as companies race to develop self-driving features. Carmakers fear that the verdict could set a precedent, holding them liable for accidents even when drivers are acting recklessly. In its filing, Tesla stated that if the verdict stands, it could ""chill innovation, harm road safety, and invite future juries to punish manufacturers who bring new safety features to market.""Tesla claims that the opposing lawyers ""led the jury astray"" with ""highly prejudicial but irrelevant evidence."" This included suggesting that Tesla had intentionally hidden or lost video and data related to the crash. Although Tesla admitted to a mistake in not providing the evidence sooner, it maintains the omission was not deliberate.The company also argued that its technology had no role in the crash. In contrast, the plaintiffs' lawyers contended that Tesla's use of the term ""Autopilot"" was intentionally misleading, as the system only provides driver assistance and is not fully autonomous. They noted that other automakers use less ambiguous terms like ""driver assist"" or ""copilot.""The lawsuit went to trial after Tesla refused a $60 million settlement offer from the plaintiffs. The final jury award was more than four times that amount. The driver of the Tesla had previously settled with the victims' families in a separate agreement.","Tesla says opposing lawyers misled court on Elon Musk.

Donald Trump Blasts Court

ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT! Today a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end. If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country. It would make us financially weak, and we have to be strong. The U.S.A. will no longer tolerate enormous Trade Deficits and unfair Tariffs and Non Tariff Trade Barriers imposed by other Countries, friend or foe, that undermine our Manufacturers, Farmers, and everyone else. If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America. At the start of this Labor Day weekend, we should all remember that TARIFFS are the best tool to help our Workers, and support Companies that produce great MADE IN AMERICA products. For many years, Tariffs were allowed to be used against us by our uncaring and unwise Politicians. Now, with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use them to the benefit of our Nation, and Make America Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again! Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Trump Tariffs on India

A federal appeals court has delivered a stunning legal blow to President Trump’s trade policy, ruling that the majority of his sweeping global tariffs are illegal. The decision, however, is not yet final, as the court has allowed the tariffs to remain in effect until October 14, giving the Trump administration a window to appeal to the Supreme Court.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that the president overstepped his authority in imposing a series of tariffs -- including duties on China, Mexico, and Canada—under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The court determined that the IEEPA, a law historically used for sanctions and asset freezes, does not grant the president the power to levy tariffs.""The power to ‘regulate’ has long been understood to be distinct from the power to ‘tax,’"" the court wrote in its decision, emphasizing that Congress, not the president, holds the authority to impose duties.In a furious response on his social media platform, Truth Social, President Trump blasted the ruling, calling it a ""total disaster for the Country"" and denouncing the ""Highly Partisan Appeals Court."" He insisted that ""ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT!"" and vowed to take the case to the nation's highest court, stating, ""we will use them to the benefit of our Nation, and Make America Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again!""The ruling's implications extend to key trade partners, including India, which has been hit with some of the steepest tariffs under Trump's policy. The president’s administration imposed a punitive 25% tariff on Indian goods, citing the country's continued purchases of discounted Russian oil. This tariff was stacked on top of an existing 25% duty, bringing the total levy on certain Indian exports to a staggering 50%.The tariffs have prompted India to explore alternative markets and push for domestic reforms to protect its economy. Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal stated that India ""will neither bow down nor ever appear weak"" and is looking to capture new markets. The tariffs have hit labor-intensive sectors such as textiles, footwear, and jewelry, with some economists warning they could shave off a significant percentage of India's GDP growth.The court's decision directly affects the tariffs imposed on India under the IEEPA, but leaves in place other duties, such as those on steel and aluminum, which were imposed under different statutes. The legal battle in the Supreme Court will now determine the future of Trump’s ambitious trade agenda and the global economic landscape he has reshaped.","The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that the president overstepped his authority in imposing a series of tariffs.

US President Donald Trump has recently threatened to imposetariffs on countries that implement digital taxes. This decision came just days after a private meeting with Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Meta Platforms . Citing sources familiar with the meeting, a report by Bloomberg stated that Zuckerberg raised concerns about these digital service taxes , which are levied on the revenue tech companies generate from users in a specific country. Following the discussion, Trump stated that he was putting all countries with such taxes “on notice” and that the US will impose “substantial” tariffs and export restrictions on US semiconductors unless “these discriminatory actions are removed.”According to Trump, digital taxes will harm US technology companies while givingHe warned that unless thesethe US would impose tariffs and export restrictions on semiconductors.

A company spokesperson said:Trump’s recent comments have reignited tensions over digital services taxes imposed by several US trading partners, a dispute that predates his latest meeting with Zuckerberg.Washington has long argued that such taxes, which may be levied by countries including France, Italy, Austria, Spain, and the UK, disproportionately target American tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Since Trump’s return to office, Zuckerberg has worked to strengthen his relationship with the president, who once labelled him a “criminal.” Efforts have included changing Meta’s moderation and diversity policies, contributing $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, and making repeated visits to the White House and Mar-a-Lago.Zuckerberg has also expanded his Washington footprint by purchasing homes near the vice president’s residence and bringing Trump allies into Meta’s leadership.

How is Donald Trump's family’s relationship with cryptocurrency



Apple Hebbal & Koregaon Park Stores to Open This September

Eric Trump, the son of US President Donald Trump, has launched a new cryptocurrency venture called American Bitcoin . Speaking at the Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference in Hong Kong, he stated that his family ""loves"" the crypto community and predicted that Bitcoin would reach $1 million within the next few years. The Hong Kong conference is the first in a planned series of cryptocurrency events across Asia featuring various members of the Trump family. During his appearance, Trump also downplayed concerns about potential conflicts of interest between the crypto industry and his father's presidency. Talking at the event (as reviewed by NBC News), Trump said:Eric Trump launched American Bitcoin in March along with his elder brother Donald Trump Jr. and energy infrastructure company Hut 8. The company focuses on large-scale Bitcoin mining and building a strategic Bitcoin reserve. In its announcement, it stated its goal to becomeTrump’s remarks come as the company prepares to go publicthrough a planned merger with Nasdaq-listed Gryphon Digital Mining.Eric Trump says his family first turned to crypto after losing access to traditional banking services, which he linked to his father’s political career. The crypto industry, which felt pressured under the Biden administration, reportedly welcomed the Trumps and spent around $135 million to support Donald Trump and other pro-crypto candidates during the 2024 election cycle, the report added.Since returning to office in January, Trump has taken steps which are favourable to the sector, including loosening regulations, appointing a “crypto czar,” hosting a White House summit, and signing the GENIUS Act to establish federal stablecoin rules.

SSA denies allegations

Borges resigns ‘involuntarily’, cites ‘hostile’ workplace

Charles Borges, chief data officer at the Social Security Administration (SSA), resigned on August 29, just days after filing a whistleblower complaint alleging DOGE has put citizen information at risk. In the filing, Borges alleged that employees from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had uploaded the nation’s Social Security data into a “vulnerable cloud environment.”Borges joined SSA in January this year after working at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and serving as a White House Presidential Innovation Fellow. He also held data handling roles at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division and the Naval Air Systems Command.Sharing a post on LinkedIn, Borges wrote: “It is never wrong to be morally and ethically right with yourself.”The dispute comes weeks after the Supreme Court temporarily lifted a lower court’s injunction, allowing DOGE employees access to sensitive Social Security data. Two unions and an advocacy group had argued the move would violate privacy laws. Lower courts sided with the challengers, but Solicitor General D. John Sauer appealed, and the Supreme Court cleared access in June.According to a CBS report, a spokesperson for the SSA denied Borges’ allegations, saying the data in question was not exposed. “The data referenced in the complaint is stored in a long-standing environment used by SSA and walled off from the internet,” the spokesperson said. “SSA is not aware of any compromise to this environment,” it added.In his resignation letter to SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, Borges wrote he was resigning involuntarily because “SSA’s actions against me… make my duties impossible to perform legally and ethically.” He described his departure as a “constructive discharge.”Borges also claimed he faced retaliation since raising concerns internally and filing his complaint. “I have suffered exclusion, isolation, internal strife, and a culture of fear, creating a hostile work environment and making work conditions intolerable,” he reportedly wrote in the letter.He alleged SSA’s new IT and executive leadership created “a culture of panic and dread, with minimal information sharing, frequent discussions on employee termination.”","Charles Borges, chief data officer at the Social Security Administration (SSA), resigned on August 29.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary Kristi Noem has announced an IT breach at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the nation’s disaster response organisation. Noem blamed the incident on the agency's staff and claimed she had fired two dozen employees as a result.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Noem offered few specifics on the nature of the breach, but asserted that it threatened ""the entire Department and the nation as a whole."" At the same time, she stated that ""no American citizens were directly impacted"" and that ""no sensitive data was extracted from any DHS networks.""In her statement, Noem devoted nine paragraphs to criticising FEMA’s IT staff, accusing them of ""failure,"" ""neglect,"" ""incompetence,"" and dishonesty. She claimed that 23 employees had been terminated as a result of the hack.The news of the breach and the reported mass firing follows an open letter of dissent signed by numerous current and former FEMA employees. The letter, which was sent to Congress, warned that the inexperience of top appointees under President Donald Trump's administration could lead to a catastrophe on the scale of Hurricane Katrina, the report added.Trump has previously stated his desire to eliminate FEMA and instead distribute federal disaster money through his own office.As the peak of hurricane season approaches, FEMA has extended a hiring freeze through the end of the year, according to three sources familiar with the matter, Reuters noted. A FEMA spokesperson stated on Friday (August 29) that the agency “is committed to ensuring FEMA delivers for the American people”.","Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary Kristi Noem has announced an IT breach at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) She blamed the incident on the agency's staff and claimed she had fired two dozen employees as a result.

Meta AI head Alexandr Wang's memo to employees on massive AI restructure makes one thing clear: Everyone will report to Wang,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-ai-head-alexandr-wangs-memo-to-employees-on-massive-ai-restructure-makes-one-thing-clear-everyone-will-report-to-wang/articleshow/123598963.cms,"From Scale AI to Meta’s AI architect

Read Alexandr Wang's full memo here

Superintelligence is coming, and in order to take it seriously, we need to organize around the key areas that will be critical to reach it — research, product and infra. We are building a world-class organization around these areas, and have brought in some incredible leaders to drive the work forward.

As we previously announced, Shengjia Zhao will direct our research efforts as Chief Scientist for MSL, Nat Friedman will lead our product effort and Rob Fergus will continue to lead FAIR. Today, I'm pleased to announce that Aparna Ramani will be moving over to MSL to lead the infrastructure necessary to support our ambitious research and product bets.

As part of this, we are dissolving the AGI Foundations organization and moving the talent from that team into the right areas. Teams whose work naturally aligns with and serves our products will move to Nat's team. Some of the researchers will move to FAIR to double down on our long term research while teams working on infra will transition into Aparna's org. Anyone who is changing teams will get an update from their manager or HRBP today, if you haven't already.

We're making three key changes to our organizational design that will help us to accelerate our efforts.

Centralizing core, fundamental research efforts in TBD Lab and FAIR. Bolstering our product efforts with applied research that will work on product-focused models. Establishing a unified, core infrastructure team to support our research bets.

The work will map to four teams:

TBD Lab will be a small team focused on training and scaling large models to achieve superintelligence across pre-training, reasoning, and post-training, and explore new directions such as an omni model.

FAIR will be an innovation engine for MSL and we will aim to integrate and scale many of the research ideas and projects from FAIR into the larger model runs conducted by TBD Lab. Rob will continue to lead FAIR and Yann will continue to serve as Chief Scientist for FAIR, with both reporting to me.

Products & Applied Research will bring our product-focused research efforts closer to product development. This will include teams previously working on Assistant, Voice, Media, Trust, Embodiment and Developer pillars in AI Tech. Nat will continue to lead this work reporting to me.

MSL Infra team will unify elements of Infra and MSL's infrastructure teams into one. This team will focus on accelerating AI research and production by building advanced infrastructure, optimized GPU clusters, comprehensive environments, data infrastructure, and developer tools to support state-of-the-art research, products and AI development across Meta. Aparna will lead this team reporting to me.

Ahmad and Amir will continue reporting to me focusing on strategic MSL initiatives they will share more about later.

I recognize that org changes can be disruptive, but I truly believe that taking the time to get this structure right now will allow us to reach superintelligence with more velocity over the long term. We're still working through updated rhythms and our collaboration model across teams, including when we'll come together as a full MSL org.

Thank you all for your flexibility as we adapt to this new structure. Every team in MSL plays a critical role and I'm excited to get to work with all of you.

In a new and dramatic move, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is making the most aggressive move in his AI arm race. Zuckerberg is now reorganising the company’s artificial intelligence operations by restricting the Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL) into four distinct teams. As reported by Business Insider the company outlined the move in an internal memo from the newly appointed chief of AI Alexandr Wang. The internal email, sent by Alexandr Wang , the 28-year-old head of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), outlines a dramatic restructuring aimed at accelerating Meta’s pursuit of “personal superintelligence”—AI that can outperform humans across intellectual domains.As reported by Business Insider, the reorganization splits the company’s AI efforts into four specialized teams—TBD Lab, FAIR, Products & Applied Research, and MSL Infra. However, another important update shared in the memo revealed that nearly all the senior leaders in Meta’s AI ecosystem will now directly report to Wang. This list also includes high-profile hires like former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who will lead product integration, and engineering veteran Aparna Ramani, who will oversee infrastructure.Wang, founder of the AI startup ScaleAI shared a bold mandate in order to accelerate Meta’s race toward superintelligence. His memo dissolves the AGI Foundations group and redistributes its talent across the new structure, emphasizing speed, clarity, and centralized execution. “Superintelligence is coming,” Wang wrote. “And in order to take it seriously, we need to organize around the key areas that will be critical to reach it — research, product, and infra”.The memo marks a clear consolidation of power and vision under Wang, reflecting Meta’s urgency to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google.","Alexandr Wang, the 28-year-old head of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), outlines a dramatic restructuring aimed at accelerating Meta’s pursuit of “personal superintelligence” Wang: “I truly believe that taking the time to get this structure right now will allow us to reach superintelligence with more velocity over the long term”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123598960,imgsize-25074,width-400,resizemode-4/meta-is-freezing-hiring-for-its-ai-unit-and-prohibiting-internal-transfers-as-well.jpg"

Sabbaticals and culture shifts



Google’s Chief People Officer Fiona Cicconi recently explained the company’s Voluntary Exit Programme (VEP) as “actually quite successful,” as the company is still streamlining its workforce and reducing material layers across divisions. According a report CNBC, speaking at the recent town hall meeting, Cicconi revealed that abbot 5% of the employees in important departments including marketing, search, people operations and hardware have opted into VEP this year. The Voluntary Exit Program offer buyouts to employees who are looking for career breaks or personal time. The company introduced the initiate as an alternative to blanket layoffs.“It’s actually quite interesting to see who’s taking a VEP,” Cicconi said. “It’s people sort of wanting a career break, sometimes to take care of family members”.The VEP rollout coincides with Google’s broader push for operational efficiency. Brian Welle, VP of People Analytics and Performance, revealed that the company has fired 35% of its managers over the past year. The report adds that eliminated managers include those overseeing less than three employees and the ones that were associated with the company has individual contributors.“When we look across our entire leadership population—managers, directors, and VPs—we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time,” Welle said.Google CEO Sundar Pichai also echoed the same sentiment, emphasising on the need to scale without depending on the headcount. “We have to be more efficient as we scale up so we don’t solve everything with headcount,” Pichai said, reinforcing the company’s shift toward leaner leadership structures.Employees present the townhall also asked if Google would consider a sabbatical program similar to Meta’s “recharge” leave. Replying to this, Google’s Senior Director of Benefit Alexandra Maddison said that presently the company has no plans to offer paid sabbaticals as the company is sure of its existing leave policies.The restructuring comes amid strong financial performance. Alphabet’s stock has climbed 10% this year, following gains of 36% in 2024 and 58% in 2023. Despite layoffs and buyouts, Google continues to invest heavily in AI and cloud infrastructure, positioning itself for long-term growth.",Google’s Chief People Officer Fiona Cicconi revealed that 5% of the employees in important departments have opted into VEP this year.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff says he's 'extremely suspect' of anyone using these three-letter initials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-says-hes-extremely-suspect-of-anyone-using-these-three-letter-initials/articleshow/123598318.cms,"AGI: Promise or illusion



AI enthusiast, AGI realist



Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has once again voiced his opinion on artificial general intelligence. As reported by Business Insider, Benioff shared a similar sentiment as the other tech leaders and shared that he is also skeptical about artificial general intelligence (AGI), calling the term itself suspect and warning against what he described as “hypnosis” surrounding the future of AI.Speaking on the recent “20VC” podcast hosted by venture capitalist Harry Stebbings, Benioff interrupted a question about Amazon’s AGI lab to deliver a pointed critique. “AGI head — that sounds like an oxymoron,” he quipped. “You’re talking to somebody who is extremely suspect if anybody uses those initials, ‘AGI.’ I think that we have all been sold a lot of hypnosis around what’s about to happen with AI.”AGI is described as AI capable of performing difficult, human-level task has become a new topic of debate in Silicon Valley. Companies like Google DeepMind, OpenAI continue to chase the milestone, but Benioff is still not convinced that the present technology is anywhere close. “We’ve all seen those movies,” Benioff said, referencing Minority Report and WarGames, both of which featured futuristic AI and were consulted on by Salesforce’s own chief futurist, Peter Schwartz. “But I just realize that isn’t the state of technology today.”Benioff’s skepticism aligns with recent remarks from other industry veterans. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently accepted that GPT-5 is not AGI as it still lacks continuous learning. On the other hand, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis also citied inconsistency as a major barrier. Also, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt also warned that Silicon Valley’s obsession with AGI comes with the risk of alienating the people and distracting them from real-world applications.Despite all the doubts AGI, Benioff still believes a lot in AI. He said all the good things about large language models (LLMs) as “state of the art” and also acknowledged their ability to feel humanlike in an interaction. But he drew a firm line between simulation and sentience. “It’s not a person, and it’s not intelligent, and it’s not conscious,” Benioff said. “It hasn’t suffered, it doesn’t have compassion.”As Salesforce continues its AI-first strategy, Benioff’s remarks suggest the company will prioritize real-world utility over speculative breakthroughs. And for now, those three letters—AGI—remain a source of deep suspicion.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has once again voiced his opinion on artificial general intelligence.

Nvidia will face a jury trial in the US over claims that one of its engineers used confidential technology from his former employer. According to a Bloomberg report, US District Judge Noel Wise in California has said that there is enough evidence to suggest Nvidia may have benefited from trade secrets taken from European auto parts maker Valeo SE .The case is Valeo Schalter und Sensoren GmbH v. Nvidia Corp., 23-cv-05721, US District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). In her 15-page ruling, Judge Wise noted that Valeo had presented facts suggesting Nvidia’s parking assistance technology advanced rapidly after the engineer joined, and that Nvidia’s code showed “numerous functionalities directly paralleling Valeo’s stolen code.” However, the judge dismissed three of the seven trade secret claims.The case dates back to 2021, when an engineer from Valeo joined Nvidia while the companies were jointly working on a project for Mercedes-Benz. As per the report, the Valeo staff spotted their own source code displayed on the engineer’s screen and allegedly captured a screenshot before it was closed.Valeo later filed a lawsuit in San Jose, California in 2023. With the judge’s latest decision, the case is now set for trial in November.As per Bloomberg report, Nvidia has denied using the stolen information and said it fired the engineer, Mohammad Moniruzzaman, after learning about the issue. Moniruzzaman was convicted in Germany for infringing business secrets. Nvidia also said it rolled back his work on the project.A Nvidia spokesperson told Bloomberg in a statement “Valeo already lost its case in Germany, and the German court ordered Valeo to pay our costs. We have no reason to believe the outcome in California will be any different, and will keep our focus where it should be — developing groundbreaking new technologies for our customers.”",N Nvidia will face a jury trial in the US over claims that one of its engineers used confidential technology from his former employer.

Meta has been creating and hosting artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots that impersonate high-profile celebrities including Taylor Swift , Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Selena Gomez and others without obtaining permission from the stars, a report by news agency Reuters has said. It added that the social media giant's platforms have been flooded with dozens of celebrity-impersonating chatbots that frequently make sexual advances toward users and claim to be the actual celebrities they're mimicking.Reuters says that it discovered that a Meta employee within the company's generative AI division created at least three celebrity chatbots, including two separate ""parody"" versions of Taylor Swift. These bots collectively received more than 10 million user interactions before being quietly removed, the report added.“Do you like blonde girls, Jeff?” one of the “parody” Swift chatbots reportedly said when told that the test user was single.The Meta employee, who declined to comment when reached by phone, also created chatbots identifying as a dominatrix, ""Brother's Hot Best Friend,"" and other sexually suggestive personas. One particularly concerning creation was a ""Roman Empire Simulator"" that offered to place users in the role of an ""18 year old peasant girl"" sold into sex slavery.Not only adult celebrities, Meta permitted users to create publicly available chatbots impersonating child celebrities, including 16-year-old actor Walker Scobell . The report said that when asked for beach photos, the bot generated a lifelike shirtless image of the minor, accompanied by the message ""Pretty cute, huh?""This content directly violates Meta's stated policies against creating images of child celebrities, according to company spokesman Andy Stone.Moreover, Reuters investigation revealed that adult celebrity chatbots produced photorealistic intimate images when requested, showing their celebrity namesakes in bathtubs, lingerie and other sexually suggestive poses.""Asked for intimate pictures of themselves, the adult chatbots produced photorealistic images of their namesakes posing in bathtubs or dressed in lingerie with their legs spread,"" the Reuters investigation detailed.Company spokesman Andy Stone acknowledged that Meta's AI tools should not have created intimate images of famous adults or any pictures of child celebrities. He attributed the problematic content to “failures of the company's enforcement of its own policies.”“Like others, we permit the generation of images containing public figures, but our policies are intended to prohibit nude, intimate or sexually suggestive imagery,” Stone said.While Meta's rules prohibit ""direct impersonation,"" Stone argued the celebrity characters were acceptable when labeled as parodies.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted that the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) across industries will lead to a shift towards four-day work weeks. Speaking to Liz Claman on Fox Business Network’s The Claman Countdown, Jensen Huang said that this shift could be another social shift, similar to what happened during previous industrial revolutions. Huang noted that work weeks have changed before, from seven to six days and then to a five-day schedule which is common now. “Every industrial revolution leads to some change in social behavior,” he said, adding that with AI and automation, “the economy will be doing very well.” Jensen Huang further predicted that GDP will grow and productivity will rise.However, that will not necessarily mean less work, he added. “I have to admit that I’m afraid to say that we are going to be busier in the future than now,” Huang said during the interview.Several global experiments have already shown the benefits of shorter work weeks. Large studies in Britain and North America found that workers could deliver the same results in 33 to 34 hours a week, with productivity rising up to 24%, burnout halving, and turnover dropping. In the Netherlands, employees often work 32-hour weeks and overwhelmingly want to continue the shorter schedules.Jensen Huang highlighted AI’s biggest strength is to take time-consuming things and finish it quickly, which could free companies to pursue even more ideas.While he acknowledged that “some jobs will go away,” Huang said many new roles will also be created. “But one thing for sure, every job will be changed as a result of AI,” he said. “Life quality will get better, of course, over time.”During the interview, Jensen Huang said “I’m always waiting for work to get done because I’ve got more ideas,” adding that he thinks “most companies have more ideas than we know what to pursue. And so the more productive we are, the more opportunity we get to go pursue new ideas.”","Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, predicted that the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) across industries will lead to a shift towards four-day work weeks.

The Spanish government has cancelled a fibre-optic service contract with Telefonica. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Spain’s Digital Transformation Ministry stated that it has cancelled this agreement with one of the largest telecom companies in Europe due to the use of equipment made by the Chinese tech giant Huawei . The report claims that this move comes amid concerns in Europe that such gear may pose a security risk. Citing Spanish newspaper El País, the report contended that under the 10 million euro ($11.7 million) contract, Telefónica was tasked with providing fibre-optic connections to several government bodies, including the Defence Ministry.In an email statement to Reuters, the Spanish ministry didn’t provide any specific details. It said:In a statement to Reuters last month, Emilio Gayo, Telefonica's Chief Operating Officer, said the company wasin Spain to align with EU guidance for telecom operators to phase out Huawei-made equipment due to security concerns.Unlike countries such as Germany that have imposed full bans on Huawei equipment, Spain has yet to do the same. The report also mentions that the company is retaining some gear from the Chinese manufacturer for its retail 5G mobile network.Earlier this year, Belgian prosecutors arrested several people in a corruption probe linked to the European Parliament and Huawei, Deutsche Welle reported.Suspects were accused of forgery, bribery, and accepting payments or gifts, including travel and football tickets, in exchange for advancing Huawei’s interests since 2021.Police conducted 21 raids across Belgium and Portugal, though no EU lawmakers were detained. The lobbyists and a former Huawei public affairs director are reportedly central to the case. At that time, Huawei said it had “zero tolerance” for corruption.","The Spanish government has cancelled a fibre-optic service contract with Telefonica.

The Chairman of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Andrew Ferguson, has sent a warning to Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. The agency has warned the tech giant against filtering or suppressing emails sent by the Republican Party over Gmail . In a letter to CEO Sundar Pichai, Ferguson stated he is taking allegations of email suppression seriously. This warning follows congressional Republicans' call for the FTC from earlier this year to investigate whether their emails were being unfairly directed to spam folders. Google has consistently maintained that its spam filters are not politically biased.In a statement to Axios, Google spokesperson Jenn Crider said:In his letter to Pichai (seen by Axios), Ferguson says:For years, Republicans have argued that big tech companies do not treat their party or conservative causes fairly.

How xAI’s agentic model is different from others



Elon Musk's artificial intelligence (AI) startup, xAI, has officially entered the competitive AI coding market . The company has launched its “speedy and economical” agentic coding model , grok-code-fast-1 , essentially moving xAI directly in a key area of focus for tech giants. An agentic coding tool is an AI-powered software application that can autonomously perform a wide range of coding-related tasks.xAI says while today's AI models are powerful, they often don't feel purpose-built for agentic coding workflows because reasoning and tool calls may feel slow.“As heavy users of agentic coding tools, our engineers saw room for a more nimble, responsive solution optimized for our day-to-day tasks,” the company added.According to xAI, the new model's “strength lies in delivering strong performance in an economical, compact form factor,” making it a versatile and cost-effective solution for everyday coding needs.“We built grok-code-fast-1 from scratch, starting with a brand-new model architecture. To lay a robust foundation, we carefully assembled a pre-training corpus rich with programming-related content. For post-training, we curated high-quality datasets that reflect real-world pull requests and coding tasks,” the company said.“Throughout the training process, we collaborated closely with our launch partners to refine and sharpen the model’s behavior inside their agentic platforms. grok-code-fast-1 has mastered the use of common tools like grep, terminal, and file editing, and thus should feel right at home in your favorite IDE,” it added.The company announced that grok-code-fast-1 will be available for free for a limited time, with select launch partners including GitHub Copilot and Windsurf.The launch comes as the AI coding assistant market heats up, with major players like OpenAI and Microsoft already offering similar products. Microsoft introduced its coding agent, GitHub Copilot, at its annual Build software developer conference in May.","xAI has launched its agentic coding model, grok-code-fast-1.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

China's biggest cloud-computing company, Alibaba , has developed an AI chip in a move to address the supply gaps created after Nvidia faced regulatory barriers for selling its most advanced products in China. This comes as Chinese chip companies are building their arsenal of homegrown technology as the Chinese government pushes to win the global AI race against the US.However, industry insiders say that China still has to do a lot more to rival the most advanced American products, a report by the Wall Street Journal said. Nevertheless, Chinese companies are actively developing substitutes for Nvidia’s H20 chip , which is currently the most powerful AI processor Nvidia is permitted to sell in China.This comes even after President Donald Trump in July allowed Nvidia to resume H20 exports to China, a decision swiftly followed by Beijing advising domestic companies to temporarily refrain from purchasing these chips, citing potential security risks that Nvidia denies.While previous cloud-computing chips developed by Alibaba were often designed for specific applications, their new chip, currently in testing, is engineered to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks.Crucially, this new chip is being manufactured by a Chinese company, a significant departure from an earlier Alibaba AI processor fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), which the US has since blocked from producing leading-edge AI chips for China.In July, Shanghai-based MetaX rolled out a new chip that it claims can serve as a direct replacement for the H20. This MetaX chip gets bigger memory than the H20, enhancing its power for certain AI tasks, though it consumes more electricity. MetaX announced on Wednesday that it is preparing for mass production of this chip.Another aspiring Nvidia rival, Beijing-based AI-chip designer Cambricon Technologies , said that it has received strong orders for its AI-chip Siyuan 590.Earlier this year, Huawei also showcased a computing system that integrates 384 Ascend chips. Some analysts have suggested that this machine, despite being a power hog, demonstrated superior performance on certain metrics compared to Nvidia’s top-of-the-line system, which contains 72 Blackwell chips.","China's biggest cloud-computing company, Alibaba, has developed an AI chip in a move to address the supply gaps created after Nvidia faced regulatory barriers for selling its most advanced products in China.

US has notified a new rule revoking earlier permissions that allowed Samsung , SK Hynix and Intel to use American chipmaking equipment in China, reports news agency Reuters. These approvals, granted in 2022 by the Commerce Department, were exceptions to broader restrictions on exporting semiconductor tools to China. Under the new rule – posted in the Federal Register – the companies are now required to apply for licenses before buying such equipment in China.The move, as per the report, is likely to cut sales for US equipment makers such as KLA Corp, Lam Research and Applied Materials. It may, however, help Chinese suppliers fill the gap and give US firm Micron an advantage over its South Korean rivals.According to the Reuters report, the Federal Register posting says that the change will come into effect in 120 days.Meanwhile, Intel CFO David Zinser recently said that the semiconductor giant has received $5.7 billion from the US government. Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced to buy a 10% stake in Intel as part of a $8.9 billion deal. During an investor conference, Intel CFO acknowledged the investment.Zinser hinted at the possibility of the struggling chip maker seeking outside investment for its foundry business. “There’s likely going to be some opportunity for outside investors in foundry, and that will probably be our second opportunity to raise cash to fund the growth on the foundry side,” Zinser said.","US has notified a new rule revoking earlier permissions that allowed Samsung, SK Hynix and Intel to use American chipmaking equipment in China.

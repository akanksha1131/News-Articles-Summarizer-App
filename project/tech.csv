"Intel may again face 'Chinese problem', and tough one",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-may-again-face-chinese-problem-and-tough-one/articleshow/125942315.cms,"Intel is reportedly testing chipmaking equipment from ACM Research, a US firm with units previously targeted by US sanctions over alleged ties to China's military. This move, involving tools for Intel's critical 14A process, raises national security questions, especially as Intel is partially US government-owned. ACM denies wrongdoing, stating its US operations are separate.

Why this may be a problem for Intel

“specific customer engagements,”

“ACMR's US team has sold and delivered multiple tools from our Asian operations to domestic customers.”

“major US-based semiconductor manufacturer,”

“We are making important strides in our global expansion efforts, with several tool deliveries planned to the US during the third quarter.”

“bifurcated and isolated”





Intel is reportedly testing crucial chipmaking equipment from a company with close ties to China. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Intel tested chipmaking tools from a company in 2025 that owns two overseas units that were targeted by US sanctions. The report cited two sources with direct knowledge of the matter to claim that the tools Intel tested were acquired from ACM Research, a US-based manufacturer of chipmaking tools.In 2024, two ACM units in Shanghai and South Korea were blocked from obtaining US technology because they were accused of supporting China with commercial technology for military purposes and of making advanced chips or chip-making tools. However, ACM has denied these claims.Reuters couldn't confirm whether Intel had decided to use the tools in its advanced chip-making process. The agency doesn’t even have any proof on the company broke any US regulations.The two wet-etch tools used to remove material from silicon wafers during the semiconductor manufacturing process were assessed for compatibility with Intel’s critically important 14A manufacturing process, scheduled to roll out in 2027.Intel is now partially owned by the US government. The fact that the company would consider using tools made by a company with sanctioned units in its most advanced manufacturing facilities has raised national security questions.This 14A chip manufacturing process, is seen as Intel’s make-or-break effort in the foundry business. Earlier, the company suggested it may delay or even cancel the 14A node if it fails to secure at least one large external customer.Adding to the complexity, Walden International, a venture capital firm founded and chaired by Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan, invested in ACM Research in 2019.However, ACM told Reuters that it couldn't discussbut confirmed thatThe company also said it has shipped three tools to awhich are being tested and some of which have passed performance tests.Also, in its Q2 2025 earnings results from August, the company wrote:ACM also told Reuters it does not present a national security risk. The company explained that its US operations arefrom the sanctioned Shanghai unit.The company added that US customers are served directly by American staff with strong protections in place to safeguard customer trade secrets.Etch systems remove materials from silicon wafers in chip manufacturing. Wet etch uses liquid chemicals for selective cleaning but removes material in all directions, potentially widening features. Dry etch uses ionised gases for precise, directional removal but is more complex. Modern chipmaking factories use both methods. Other companies producing these tools include Applied Materials, KLA, Lam Research, and Tokyo Electron.Tools from ACM and Chinese competitors are 20% to 30% cheaper than those from rivals like Applied Materials and Lam, according to Dan Hutcheson, Vice Chair of TechInsights Inc. This creates downward price pressure on established competitors.Testing equipment from different suppliers is standard practice for all chipmakers but Intel's consideration of ACM Research equipment raises concerns due to the company's connections to sanctioned Chinese operations.","Intel tested chipmaking tools from a company that owns two overseas units that were targeted by US sanctions over alleged ties to China's military.

Major GCCs in Pune





For decades, Pune has been known as a city shaped by academia, industry, and engineering. Its economic base was first anchored by automotive majors such as Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto and Mercedes-Benz India, which in turn built a large ecosystem of component makers and engineering design talent. Other large manufacturing units grew through industrial groups such as Bharat Forge, Kirloskar and Thermax, which further strengthened the city’s engineering capabilities. Establishments like Defence Research and Development Organisation, College of Military Engineering, and High Energy Materials Research Laboratory created a skilled pool in electronics, materials science, and precision systems.says Niket Karajagi, who is doing a doctorate in enterprise resilience at the Savitribai Phule Pune University.Estimates by GCC consultancy Zinnov finds that about 21% of India’s GCCs have their presence in Pune, employing nearly 12% of the country’s GCC talent across engineering R&D (42%), IT (25%), and BPM (33%). A host of global engineering companies, financial institutions and others have their GCCs in the city.Sameer Jain, executive VP at technology consulting firm Intraedge, says all the GCCs he was part of used Pune’s talent to design, prototype, build, test, and release highly innovative products in technology and engineering.Piyush Kedia, co-founder & CEO of GCC consultancy InCommon, says when a bank or mobility firm sets up in Pune, it finds engineers who already understand safety, precision, and scale –Rashmi Rawat, head of talent offerings & insights at GCC consultancy GatewAI, says the defining feature of Pune’s GCC ecosystem is simple:That product thinking is reflected across GCCs. Raja Jamalamadaka, MD of Roche Digital Centre of Excellence India, recently told us that their Pune centre is at the core of the future of healthcare for the Swiss pharma giant. The centre is focusing on leveraging technology, especially AI/ML, to predict disease, identify patients at risk, diagnose disease early and improve chronic disease management.Pascal Daloz, CEO of Dassault Systemes, the France-based provider of 3D virtual environment software used to design just about everything, recently told us that their Pune centre is their largest development centre in the world. The CEO of the company’s India solutions lab, Sudarshan Mogasale, said what the world will see in engineering three or six years from now is what is being built today in India. “From embedding AI in design tools to building virtual cities and digital factories, our teams are transforming how products are imagined and built,” he said.Sudish Lambodara Panicker, MD and head of BNY India, which has a large GCC in Pune, told us the GCC is working with data and algorithms to help shape the future of the American financial services giant, understand what its future markets and products should be.Rashmi Rawat says solutions originating from Pune include AI-based optimisation engines that scaled across multiple global business units, industrial IoT platforms that moved from proof-of-concept to enterprise-wide deployments, and cloud-native data or streaming platforms that became reference architectures within their organisations.Sachin Kulkarni, president of global services at US financial technology firm Fiserv, and whose Pune centre began in 2007, says Maharashtra is home to hundreds of engineering colleges that offer a rich talent pool for roles and skills the centre focuses on, including product development, data science, automation, full-stack developers, cloud computing, cybersecurity, AI/ML, Java, and more.Divesh Agarwal, founder & CEO of offshore solutions firm Aumni, says their global clients prioritise system safety, operational efficiency, and fault tolerance, “and Pune excels in high-stakes domains like financial engineering, core banking, and cyber automotive.”As more and more GCCs enter Pune, some are getting worried about the growth beginning to outpace its infrastructure. The biggest concern is poor international connectivity. The absence of a full-fledged international airport means most international travel is via Mumbai, which adds 4-6 hours to every global trip. “This affects leadership visibility and makes it harder to attract global talent,"" says Kailash Maisekar, country director for India at software solutions firm Idox Group.Pune’s industrial backbone – auto, defence, and manufacturing – trained an entire generation of engineers to think in systems, not slides. The same discipline that once designed engines now designs digital platforms, SDV (software defined vehicle) software, and AI-driven control systems.Pune’s product-thinking culture is what sets it apart. Pune engineers think in systems, not just code, emphasising how legacy strengths from auto and industrial sectors directly support modern domains like digital twins, industrial IoT, predictive analytics, and platform optimisation workstreams.BFSI GCCs are increasingly favouring Pune due to lower real estate costs, campus scalability, and access to finance-tech talent. While Mumbai remains the front office for financial institutions, Pune is fast becoming the engine room for their global operations, analytics, and digital transformation work.The co-existence of engineering and technology talent in Pune has led to an explosion of GCC setups that are pivoted around product and engineering innovation, particularly in areas such as automation, Industry 4.0, AI, and smart factory.Around 21% of India’s GCCs are based in Pune, employing nearly 12% of the country’s GCC workforce across engineering R&D, IT, and BPM functions. The city’s rising focus areas – agentic and physical AI, platform modernisation, and digital twins – align with global technology priorities and reflect Pune’s position as an innovation-led engineering hub.Pune airport is already operating near saturation, and that directly affects one-stop international routings, cargo capacity and even slot availability for global leadership travel. That is why Purandar, the Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje International Airport, is absolutely critical for the region. If we accelerate Purandar, we can meaningfully upgrade Pune’s global connectivity and give our GCC ecosystem the cargo and international access it urgently needs.Pune’s GCCs are uniquely positioned to bridge IT and OT (operational technology) capabilities at scale.Pune GCCs have delivered global product modules, risk and analytics platforms for banking clients, automotive control and telematics software, and full-stack SaaS modules for their parent companies.BNY Mellon, HSBC, Barclays, Vodafone, Deutsche Bank, Mastercard, Cummins, Dassault Systemes, UBS, ZS Associates, Citibank, Siemens PLM, Skoda, Credit Suisse, Maersk, Roche","Pune has been known as a city shaped by academia, industry, and engineering.

First migrants arrive in Australia from the country whose citizens it has promised Australian citizenship under 'First-ever treaty of its kind',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/first-migrants-arrive-in-australia-from-the-country-whose-citizens-it-has-promised-australian-citizenship-under-first-ever-treaty-of-its-kind/articleshow/125939075.cms,"Tuvalu Prime Minister's message to migrants





The first climate migrants arrived in Australia this week. These migrants arrive in Australia as Tuvalu could become the first country to disappear as a result of climate change. Rising sea levels are gradually inundating this Pacific archipelago, prompting many of its residents to leave their homes behind. As part of 'first of its kind' bilateral treaty, Australia signed with Tuvalu, Australia reportedly welcomed the first wave of climate migrants from this sinking nation. In 2023, Australia announced that it would launch these visas as part of a bilateral treaty it signed with Tuvalu. The treaty between Australia and Tuvalu is the world’s first to create a special visa in response to climate change.Upon their arrival, migrants reportedly receive immediate access to education, Medicare, the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), the family tax benefit, a childcare subsidy, and a youth allowance. Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said that the climate migrants would contribute to Australian society.The visa offered ""mobility with dignity, by providing Tuvaluans the opportunity to live, study and work in Australia as climate impacts worsen"", Wong said in a statement to Reuters.More than 3,000 of Tuvalu’s 11,000 residents applied for the visas after they became available in June. However, Australia has capped the intake at 280 visas per year annually to prevent a brain drain in the small island nation. Tuvalu, one of the countries at greatest risk from climate change because of rising sea levels, is a group of low-lying atolls scattered across the Pacific between Australia and Hawaii.Tuvalu prime minister Feleti Teo urged those leaving to keep cultural ties. PM Teo reportedly visited the Tuvaluan community in Melton, Melbourne, last month to emphasise the importance of maintaining strong ties and cultural bonds across borders as citizens migrate, Tuvalu officials said.Thousands of applications for Australia’s climate-migration visas show how many Tuvaluans feel they have no choice but to leave their land. This first wave of migrants out of Tuvalu is only the beginning, say analysts, as the future looks bleak for the sinking island.","The first climate migrants arrived in Australia this week.

Nvidia plans increasing H200 chip production due to high demand from China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-plans-increasing-h200-chip-production-due-to-high-demand-from-china/articleshow/125937513.cms,"Nvidia H200 AI chip sees high demand from Chinese tech giants



China doesn’t want Nvidia chips







Nvidia is reportedly evaluating plans to increase production capacity for its H200 artificial intelligence (AI) chips after the company received orders from Chinese clients that exceeded current output levels. The move follows President Donald Trump’s announcement this week that the US will allow the export of the H200to China, provided the US government collects a 25% fee on each sale.Citing industry sources, news agency Reuters said that demand is so robust that Nvidia is leaning toward adding new capacity to satisfy the market. Chinese firms, including Alibaba and ByteDance, have already reached out to Nvidia this week expressing interest in placing large-scale orders.The H200, which went into mass deployment last year, is the fastest chip in Nvidia’s Hopper generation and is Nvidia’s second-fastest AI processor. It is manufactured by TSMC using its advanced 4nm process technology.Despite the US approval, the Chinese government has not yet given a green light to the purchases. Reports said that Chinese officials held emergency meetings to discuss whether the influx of H200 chips might hamper the growth of the domestic AI chip industry.To protect local manufacturers, one proposal under discussion would require Chinese companies to bundle H200 purchases with a specific ratio of domestically produced chips, reports claimed.Increasing H200 output presents a logistical challenge for Nvidia because very limited quantities are in production as the company has shifted its primary focus to its newest Blackwell architecture and the upcoming Rubin line.Furthermore, Nvidia must compete with other tech giants, such as Alphabet's Google, for limited advanced manufacturing capacity at TSMC.","N Nvidia is reportedly evaluating plans to increase production capacity for its H200 artificial intelligence (AI) chips.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on why despite being the CEO of world's most-valuable company, sense of uncertainty and insecurity doesn't leave him",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-why-despite-being-the-ceo-of-worlds-most-valuable-company-sense-of-uncertainty-and-insecurity-doesnt-leave-him/articleshow/125883149.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, despite leading his company to a $5 trillion valuation, lives in constant anxiety, a fear rooted in a near-bankruptcy experience. Recent reports of Meta potentially buying Google's AI chips have caused a $250 billion market value drop, validating Huang's long-held belief that the company is always '30 days from going out of business'.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A near-death experience that shaped Huang’s three decades of paranoia

Why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 's fears suddenly look prophetic





Despite leading Nvidia to become the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation, CEO Jensen Huang admits he operates in constant anxiety, working every single day including holidays. His fears may be justified—this week alone, Nvidia lost $250 billion in market value after reports emerged that Meta is in advanced talks to buy billions worth of competing chips from Google , threatening the chipmaker's decade-long dominance in AI hardware.""The phrase '30 days from going out of business'—I've used for 33 years,"" Huang revealed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. ""The feeling doesn't change. The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""Huang's anxiety isn't unfounded paranoia—it's scar tissue from survival. In the mid-1990s, Nvidia discovered fatal flaws in its first graphics chip while developing technology for Sega's gaming console. With funds evaporating, Huang flew to Japan for an excruciating conversation: he told Sega's CEO the product wouldn't work and the deal must end, but simultaneously begged for the final $5 million payment to prevent bankruptcy.Remarkably, Sega converted it into an investment, giving Nvidia the lifeline that eventually built a trillion-dollar empire.That near-collapse experience now fuels Huang's relentless schedule. He wakes at 4 a.m. daily to read ""several thousand emails,"" works seven days a week without exception—""including Thanksgiving, Christmas""—and admits he's ""always in a state of anxiety."" His motivation? ""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed. Failure drives me more than greed.""Huang's paranoia might be wisdom. Nvidia made the rare move of issuing a public defense after The Information reported that Meta—planning up to $72 billion in AI spending this year—is negotiating massive purchases of Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). The news triggered a 6% stock plunge, erasing roughly $250 billion in value, while Alphabet shares surged 4%.""Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model,"" the company declared on X, breaking its usual silence on competitors. But Google's latest Gemini 3 AI model, trained entirely on TPUs rather than Nvidia chips, is being hailed by industry leaders as potentially superior. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly announced he's switching from ChatGPT after three years, calling Gemini 3 the better product.The threat is existential to Nvidia's 90% market share in AI accelerators. If Google captures even a fraction of the hundreds of billions being spent on AI processors—particularly from customers like Meta—it would represent the first serious crack in Nvidia's dominance.Huang's work ethic has infected his family: both his children, Madison and Spencer, now in their thirties, work at Nvidia after joining as interns in 2020 and 2022.

How to apply for e-passport





The Ministry of External Affairs rolled out e-passport service under the Passport Seva Programme (PSP V2.0). With the new system, the government aims to facilitate faster, more secure, and smooth travel for all Indian passport holders. While the existing ones remain valid till their expiry, anyone applying for a passport will get a chip-enabled passport by default, irrespective of whether they apply in India or abroad.As explained by the external affairs ministry in a press release, the e-Passport is a hybrid passport that combines both paper and electronic elements. It features an embedded Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip and an antenna, which store and secure the holder’s data in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.Critical information printed on the data page is also stored electronically on the chip, enabling enhanced security and authentication, the ministry says. Going forward, all newly issued passports will be e-Passports, while existing non-electronic passports will remain valid until their expiry, it added.As mentioned above, any Indian citizen who is eligible for a regular passport can apply for e-passport.The process of applying for an e-passport is the same as that of applying for a regular passport. Applicants are required to first register on the official Passport Seva portal using their personal details. After completing the registration, they must fill in the online application form carefully and pay the prescribed fee through the available payment options.Once the payment is completed, applicants are required to book an appointment at a nearby Passport Seva Kendra or Post Office Passport Seva Kendra, based on their location and slot availability. On the scheduled date, the applicant must visit the selected centre in person for document verification.During the appointment, biometric details of the applicant are captured. This includes taking fingerprints and a photograph, which are used for identity verification and are later embedded securely into the e-passport’s electronic chip.After the verification process is completed and the application is cleared, the e-passport is printed with the embedded chip that stores the holder’s biometric and personal details. The finished e-passport is then dispatched and delivered to the applicant’s registered residential address through the postal system.","The Ministry of External Affairs rolled out e-passport service under the Passport Seva Programme (PSP V2.0) The new system aims to facilitate faster, more secure, and smooth travel for all Indian passport holders.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate jobs in the long run. Speaking in an interview with Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures, Dimon urged workers to focus on human skills such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence and communication to stay relevant in the future workforce. He said individuals should build skills that machines cannot easily copy. These include problem-solving, emotional understanding, creativity, and clear communication.Jamie Dimon said that while companies have been cautious about hiring in recent months, this slowdown is not being driven by AI. He also said he does not expect the technology to cause large job losses in the immediate future.“For the most part, AI is going to do great stuff for mankind, like tractors did, like fertilizers did, like vaccines did,” Dimon said during the interview. “You know, maybe one day we’ll be working less hard but having wonderful lives.”At the same time, Jamie Dimon stressed that AI will eventually replace some jobs and that people must prepare for this shift. Notably, this is not the first time Dimon has warned about AI eliminating jobs. He has previously warned that automation will change the nature of work. In November 2025, Dimon said AI could help people in developed countries move toward a much shorter workweek of around three-and-a-half days over the next 20 to 40 years.Dimon also said that AI must be regulated properly to limit its risks, just as earlier technologies were brought under rules to protect society. He said both governments and companies have a shared responsibility to manage the impact of AI on workers.“We—government and we the companies, society—should look at how do we phase it in a way that we don’t damage a lot of people,” he said. He pointed to past examples where factory closures hurt entire towns and said better support could have reduced the damage. “You can retrain people, relocate people, income assistance, early retirement,” he added.While warning about future job losses, Dimon also said AI is already creating new jobs in the short term. He said the growth of AI requires large investments in infrastructure, including construction work and fibre-optic networks, which will generate employment.","Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence will eliminate jobs in the long run.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently hinted at building data centres in space. In an interview with Fox News, Pichai said that the company is working on quantum computing, adding “in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun”.Sundar Pichai’s video from the interview was shared by X (formerly Twitter) user - Bourbon Capital in an online post. It caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who replied to the post with a single word. “Interesting”, Musk wrote.“At Google, we are always proud of taking moon shots,” Pichai said, adding “... Waymo … has been over a decade in the making.”“We're working on quantum computing, in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun,” he continued.Pichai further said that the company wants to “put these data centers in space closer to the sun”, and will take “first step in 2027”.“We'll send tiny racks of machines and have them in satellites, test them out, and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away will be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centers,” Sundar Pichai said in the interview.Notably, this echoes Musk's November 2025 announcements that SpaceX will pioneer orbital data centers using next-gen Starlink satellites, positioning them as the lowest-cost AI compute option within five years.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is working on quantum computing.

The company emphasized that its India website is not yet live and is not accepting orders.

Update:

Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India

Starlink’s residential connection includes 30-day trial and plug-and-play setup to cost Rs 34,000

SpaceX Gateway network to span across six cities, and Bengaluru office expands





Starlink has officially denied that Indian pricing, calling the incident a technical glitch rather than an intentional reveal. Lauren Dreyer, Vice President of Starlink Business Operations, clarified in a post on X that the company's India website is not yet live and is not accepting orders.She explained that a configuration error caused internal dummy test data to briefly appear publicly, which was quickly corrected once discovered. Dreyer emphasized that Starlink has not announced official pricing for India and any figures currently circulating online are inaccurate. The company remains focused on obtaining final government approvals before launching service in the country, and both the website and ordering system will stay inactive until the regulatory process is complete.Elon Musk's Starlink has revealed the residential satellite internet pricing for India at Rs 8,600 monthly, plus a Rs 34,000 hardware kit, as the SpaceX subsidiary prepares for commercial operations. The service targets households in remote and underserved areas with promises of unlimited data, 99.9% uptime, and weather-resistant connectivity where traditional broadband infrastructure fails to reach.Following regulatory clearance from the Department of Telecommunications in July, Starlink is positioning itself to challenge established players Jio-SES and Eutelsat OneWeb in India's satellite communications sector.The residential plan, priced at a monthly subscription cost of Rs 8,600 offers unlimited data without usage caps or throttling, addressing critical connectivity gaps in rural regions. Starlink's system requires minimal installation effort, with users simply powering on equipment and pointing it skyward to establish connections. However, the hardware kit will cost customers Rs 34,000, which the company says is a one time fees. The company guarantees over 99.9% uptime and all-weather functionality, crucial features for areas experiencing frequent service disruptions.New customers receive a 30-day trial period, allowing households to evaluate performance before long-term commitment. This trial provision acknowledges the premium pricing structure, which places Starlink among India's higher-cost broadband options despite targeting underserved markets.Business subscription pricing remains unannounced, with enterprise-focused plans expected as commercial rollout advances.Starlink is deploying gateway earth stations across Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, and Noida to enable satellite-to-ground communications. These relay installations are essential for maintaining low-latency connections and service reliability across India's varied geography.The company posted four specialist positions at its Bengaluru office in October, recruiting talent in payments, accounting, treasury, and tax operations as part of infrastructure expansion. This direct-to-consumer strategy distinguishes Starlink from competitors concentrating on enterprise clients, potentially reshaping internet accessibility in regions where fiber deployment remains economically unviable.","Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India. residential connection includes 30-day trial and plug-and-play setup to cost Rs 34,000 per month.

Five key things people asked Copilot in 2025

1. Health dominates mobile use

2. Programming and gaming

3. February witnessed

spike

4. Late-night philosophy and religion debates

5. Rise of personal advice seeking





Microsoft’s AI division (MAI) has released an analysis of how people used its AI chatbot, Copilot, in 2025. The team revealed its top 5 findings days after other tech giants like YouTube, Instagram and Spotify, released a recap of users’ activities in the past year. Microsoft's report says that it analysed 37.5 million anonymized conversations which showed that Copilot is functioning as a “trusted advisor,” with people asking the chatbot about health to late-night philosophical debates related to religion and philosophy.According to the MAI report, health-related topics were the most dominant category across the entire year, specifically when users accessed Copilot on their mobile devices. The data suggests users consistently rely on Copilot for tracking wellness, searching for health tips and managing daily routines.Highlighting data from August, the usage report showed an overlap between two distinct interests: programming and gaming. Users were equally likely to engage in coding projects as they were to explore games. However, this engagement was split across the calendar: users tended to code during the week and play games during the weekends.Copilot AI usage on Valentine’s Day topics increased during February as the month witnessed a significant spike in activity because users relied on Copilot for help navigating a major calendar event. The queries were concentrated around preparing for Valentine’s Day and seeking support regarding relationships.Searches related to “Religion and Philosophy” notably rose during the early hours of the morning, indicating users often turn to the AI for bigger, late-night questions. On the contrary, travel conversations peaked most often during commuting hours.Copilot saw a clear rise in users seeking advice, particularly on personal topics. This trend includes users seeking guidance on navigating relationships and making life decisions.","Microsoft's AI division (MAI) has released an analysis of how people used its AI chatbot, Copilot, in 2025.

Nvidia defends decision to sell H200 chips to China



Senator Warren says selling Nvidia H200 to China is threat to US







Days after President Donald Trump announced a decision to allow Nvidia to sell its advanced H200 artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China and receive a 25% cut of the revenues, Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that the move constitutes selling out “American national security”. She reiterated that both Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick must testify before Congress regarding the agreement.While speaking on the Senate floor, Senator Warren urged Congress to pass bipartisan legislation that “reins in this administration” by imposing new chip export restrictions. Critics of the bill, however, say it could undermine US chipmakers’ competitiveness.In response to Senator Warren's criticism, an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC that the H200 sales to China would still require a US government license, while emphasising that the total volume of sales “at most will be a smaller percentage of the Hopper and Blackwell compute already sold to US customers"".“We heard the same arguments about the H20, and the administration’s critics had it backwards,” the spokesperson said. Nvidia argued that blocking the sale of the H20 was detrimental: “Selling H20 was good for America’s economic and national security. After H20 shipments were blocked, America lost billions, and foreign AI chip firms stepped into the gap and grew dramatically”.Senator Warren countered by arguing that the administration knows that granting China access to these previously restricted chips “poses a serious threat to our technological leadership and national security”. She suggested that the decision was financially motivated“So why did the president make this bad deal that sells out the American economy and sells out American national security? It’s simple: In the Trump administration, money talks,” she said. She even pointed to CEO Huang's attendance at a $1 million-per-plate dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home and Nvidia’s subsequent donations to the president’s White House ballroom.","Senator Warren says selling Nvidia H200 to China is threat to US national security.

Speaking at a TIME event, Mohan stated YouTube's focus remains on building a stage for creatives, not programming a service or engaging in industry consolidation battles.

YouTube's creator-first strategy stands apart from Hollywood consolidation wave

CEO says the YouTube is different from all the other streaming platforms





YouTube CEO Neal Mohan downplayed competition from Netflix and other streaming giants during a TIME magazine event this week, stating his company remains laser-focused on empowering content creators rather than monitoring rival platforms.Speaking at the ""A Year in TIME"" panel discussion where he was honored as TIME's CEO of the Year for 2025, Mohan responded to questions about industry consolidation with characteristic restraint. When asked about Paramount CEO David Ellison's suggestion that his proposed Warner Bros. acquisition would make the company competitive with YouTube , Mohan deflected.""When we go to work at YouTube and you walk the halls of YouTube, you don't really think in terms of who other streaming platforms are,"" Mohan said. ""We really think—you will hear the term 'creator' or 'creative person' a hundred times per day in every single one of our meetings. And that's really the only thing we think about.""Mohan's comments come amid massive upheaval in the streaming industry. Netflix recently struck an $82.7 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros., including HBO, HBO Max, and valuable intellectual property franchises.

Disney has secured a licensing partnership with OpenAI, which includes a $1 billion investment and access to Disney’s iconic characters. Company CEO Bob Iger stated the deal is designed to help the 102-year-old entertainment giant into new media and harness AI to attract younger audiences for engagement. However, this is in contrast to Disney’s legal action against Google as the company sent a ‘Cease-and-Desist’ letter to the search giant, alleging that Google's AI models infringe Disney's copyright on a “massive scale”. The company also alleged that using this data, the company’s AI models generated content resembling characters from franchises like Frozen, Deadpool and Star WarsSpeaking on CNBC about the deal with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Iger described the partnership as a way for Disney to participate in rapid technological development rather than being disrupted by it.“It gives us an opportunity, really, to play a part in what is really a breathtaking, breathtaking growth in essentially AI and new forms of media and entertainment,” Iger said. As per the deal, Disney wants to integrate user-generated content onto its Disney+ streaming platform.Disney initially plans to feature select videos created using OpenAI's Sora platform on Disney+ to boost engagement, particularly with younger users.However, the ultimate goal is to enable Disney+ users to create such AI-generated videos within the streaming platform itself.Meanwhile, Altman noted that demand for Disney characters on OpenAI's products is “off the charts” and suggested the deal will enable people to place themselves in a “Star Wars” lightsaber scene.However, Disney’s notice demands Google must stop using copyrighted material to train its AI models – implying that even as Disney embraces AI through its OpenAI partnership, the company is taking an aggressive stance against what it views as unauthorised exploitation of its intellectual property by Google.“Google is intentionally amplifying the scope of its infringement, by making its infringing AI Services available across so many channels to so many consumers, flooding the market with infringing works, and reaping enormous profits and other value from its unlawful, harmful, and damaging exploitation of Disney’s copyrighted works,” says the letter from David Singer, the Jenner & Block attorney representing Disney.“Google operates as a virtual vending machine, capable of reproducing, rendering, and distributing copies of Disney’s valuable library of copyrighted characters and other works on a mass scale. And compounding Google’s blatant infringement, many of the infringing images generated by Google’s AI Services are branded with Google’s Gemini logo, falsely implying that Google’s exploitation of Disney’s intellectual property is authorized and endorsed by Disney,” adds the letter.Google, however, refuted saying, “We have a longstanding and mutually beneficial relationship with Disney, and will continue to engage with them. More generally, we use public data from the open web to build our AI and have built additional innovative copyright controls like Google-extended and Content ID for YouTube, which give sites and copyright holders control over their content.”","Disney has secured a licensing partnership with OpenAI, which includes a $1 billion investment and access to Disney’s iconic characters.

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman: My mother wanted me to leave school at 16 and become a carpenter or…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-my-mother-wanted-me-to-leave-school-at-16-and-become-a-carpenter-or/articleshow/125933678.cms,"Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman reveals his working-class London upbringing shaped his tech vision. The DeepMind co-founder, whose Syrian taxi driver father and nurse mother urged him to learn a trade, lived independently from age 16 before dropping out of Oxford to help Muslim youth post-9/11. Now he champions AI for social good and universal basic income.

The early years that forged Suleyman’s career

Dropped out of Oxford to help muslim youth after 9/11





Microsoft's AI chief Mustafa Suleyman says his mother wanted him to quit school at 16 to become a carpenter or electrician—advice the 39-year-old DeepMind co-founder decidedly ignored on his path to becoming one of tech's most powerful executives. In a Bloomberg interview, Suleyman revealed how his working-class upbringing in subsidized housing with a Syrian taxi driver father and NHS nurse mother shaped his vision for artificial intelligence, including his advocacy for universal basic income and what he calls ""humanist superintelligence.""""My parents always thought I should go get a trade — my mum would often say to me, You should be a carpenter or electrician, leave school at 16,"" Suleyman told Bloomberg's Mishal Husain. Growing up in north London during the 1980s and '90s, his family was ""pretty working class"" and ""didn't super value education,"" he said.Suleyman's path took a dramatic turn at age 16 when his parents separated, leaving him and his younger brother to fend for themselves. ""Me and my younger brother did live on our own for a few years,"" he confirmed in the Bloomberg interview, though he characterized the experience with youthful resilience: ""When you're that age, you are precocious and overconfident and fearless.""Despite his parents' expectations, Suleyman excelled academically. After studying hard at age 10 for entrance exams, he attended what he described as ""essentially like going to a private school"" and eventually gained admission to Oxford University. However, his time at Oxford's Mansfield College was short-lived. At 19, driven by a desire to ""change the world and get stuff done,"" he dropped out to co-found the Muslim Youth Helpline.The Muslim Youth Helpline became one of Britain's largest counseling services of its kind, addressing a critical need as young Muslims navigated identity struggles in a post-9/11 climate marked by suspicion and hostility. Suleyman described it as ""a non-religious, non-judgmental listening service for young British Muslims, who after 9/11 were dealing with identity crisis, lack of connection to community, family, parents, bullying. "" Having personally experienced anti-Muslim sentiment during that period, he understood the urgency firsthand.That social mission eventually led him to co-found DeepMind in 2010, the pioneering AI company later acquired by Google for $650 million. Now at Microsoft, where he leads the company's consumer AI push, Suleyman is championing what he calls ""humanist superintelligence""—AI that remains aligned with human interests.His working-class roots continue to influence his vision for technology. ""It comes from a place of experiencing the rougher end of things a little bit and having a desire to try to do the best we can with the short life that we have,"" he told Bloomberg. He advocates for universal basic income as AI transforms work, arguing that ""we already live in a world of abundance, it's just poorly distributed""—perspectives that set him apart in Silicon Valley's tech leadership.",Microsoft's AI chief Mustafa Suleyman says his working-class upbringing shaped his tech vision.

Ex-GitHub CEO and Meta AI’s top executive Nat Friedman is also facing heat



Meta employees working 70 hours-a-week







Mark Zuckerberg’s multi-million-dollar elite AI team is facing a major test, as the newly-hired engineers and leaders are under intense pressure to deliver competitive products. The company is said to be working on Avocado – new Llama successor and frontier AI model – which is being developed inside TBD lab. Reportedly, the pressure has intensified following the ‘botched’ launch of Meta’s Llama 4 AI model, which was hit by reports of underwhelming real-world performance, poor coding ability and allegations of rigged benchmark scores.CNBC recently reported that Alexandr Wang, chief AI officer of Meta AI, is facing the heat. Wang is tasked to deliver a top-tier AI model that helps the company regain momentum against rivals like Google and OpenAI, the publication reported citing people familiar with the matter. That pressure has increased as Google unveiled Gemini 3.0 last month to a positive reception. Meanwhile, OpenAI has also upped its game with GPT-5 and, more recently, GPT-5.2. Anthropic also debuted the Claude Opus 4.5 model in November.The 28-year-old executive heads the elite internal unit known as TBD Lab, and Avocado is being developed under his watch. The people familiar with the matter said the model is said to be grappling with various training-related performance tests which are essential to ensure the system is well-received when it eventually debuts. Notably, the model was scheduled to launch in 2025 but the unveiling has reportedly been pushed to the first quarter of 2026.Along with Wang, Nat Friedman is also under pressure, as he has been tasked with producing a breakout AI product, the people said. Under Friedman’s watch, Meta launched Vibes, a feed of AI-generated short videos, in September but it is widely viewed as inferior to OpenAI’s Sora 2, the people noted. This is because of criticism for being rushed to market and lacking key features, such as the ability to generate realistic lip-synced audio.The pressure is also being felt by employees who are reportedly working 70 hours per week as the company cut hundreds of jobs and underwent restructurings throughout the year. Employees are also conflicted on the way things are being done in the company.Meta has traditionally sought input from numerous groups responsible for areas like front-end user interface, design, algorithmic feeds and privacy for uniformity among the company’s apps, the people said. However, the products are reportedly not developed to accommodate foundation models, which Friedman views as bottlenecks responsible for slowing down ‘a rapid-fire development process’.Friedman has called for the use of newer tools that have been calibrated to incorporate multiple AI models and various kinds of coding automation software often called AI agents, the people said.","The pressure has intensified following the ‘botched’ launch of Meta’s Llama 4 AI model, which was hit by reports of underwhelming real-world performance and poor coding ability.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise acquires Juniper Networks for $14 billion





Corporate rivalry is common and so is top executives mocking rival companies/their products. In one such case, Cisco chief financial officer (CFO) Mark Patterson took potshots at rival Hewlett Packard Enterprise's $14 billion acquisition of Juniper. Speaking at an investors event, Cisco CFO Mark Patterson took pointed strikes at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). Patterson told an audience at the recent Barclays Technology, Media, Telecom (TMT) Conference that Cisco has been able to take advantage of continued market uncertainty emanating from HPE’s Juniper Network integration. “I think that as HPE and Juniper come together they have a lot of overlap and probably their best performing space, which is wireless, so that's causing, I think, a lot of confusion with customers and what's going to happen there, and we've certainly been able to, I think, capitalize on that,” Patterson said.Patterson’s HPE comments echoed that of former Cisco CFO Scott Herren, who during an investor conference last year said that HPE’s then pending purchase of Juniper Networks has left many enterprise wondering. “I think for sure that's created just a degree of uncertainty and a question of, hey, should I consider if I was previously a vendor or a customer of either of those, now is the time to kind of open up and look at other opportunities,” Herren said at that time.“And we've seen our wireless business, our orders greater than $1 million grew more than 20% in the fourth quarter.”Cisco is the world's largest networking company. Founded in 1996, Juniper spent many years chasing Cisco in the market for networking gear since decades.In January 2024, Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced that it has agreed to buy networking gear vendor Juniper Networks for about $14 billion, or $40 per share, in an all-cash deal. The acquisition would double HPE’s existing networking business after years of competition. Hewlett-Packard went deeper in networking when it bought Aruba Networks in 2015. Months later, HP split in two, resulting in the formation of HPE, which sells servers and other equipment for data centers, and HP Inc, which makes PCs and printers. HPE then said that adding Juniper to its portfolio would bolster margins and speed up growth.In June 2025, HPE struck a conditional agreement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ) that cleared the way for the company's $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks, an M&A deal that the DoJ had been trying to block on antitrust grounds.","Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) announced that it has agreed to buy networking gear vendor Juniper Networks for about $14 billion, or $40 per share, in an all- cash deal.

The great memory squeeze: Why AI is making your gadgets expensive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-great-memory-squeeze-why-ai-is-making-your-gadgets-expensive/articleshow/125930979.cms,"A global memory chip shortage, driven by insatiable AI data center demand, is skyrocketing prices for everyday electronics. Manufacturers are prioritizing lucrative AI clients, leading to reduced consumer supply and higher costs for smartphones, laptops, and PCs. This fundamental market shift means technology is becoming less accessible and more expensive for everyone.

The bill comes due (and it's not optional)





If you've been eyeing a new laptop, planning to upgrade your PC, or even considering a smartphone purchase lately, you might want to sit down for this. The world is experiencing a memory crisis of unprecedented proportions, and it's about to hit your wallet harder than you think.The numbers tell a stark story. That RAM stick you could have picked up for Rs 6,000 in August? It's now hovering around Rs 15,000. DDR5 sticks now start at about Rs 40,000 with prices soaring as high as over a lakh for a 32 gigs one. That’s when, if you can find one. A solid-state drive that would have set you back Rs 6,000 six months ago might now cost you close to Rs 19,000. We're not talking about modest price corrections or seasonal fluctuations—this is a full-blown market disruption, and artificial intelligence is the culprit.The immediate pain is most visible among PC enthusiasts and gamers. Online retailers have started listing memory modules with fluctuating daily prices, treating them less like computer components and more like commodities on a trading floor. Some retailers have gone so far as to restrict purchases to one unit per customer, attempting to curb hoarding.But this is just the opening act. The real drama unfolds when you realise that every device with a chip inside—your smartphone, laptop, gaming console, smart TV, even your car—relies on the same memory that's currently being devoured by the AI industry's sprawling data centres.Pop quiz: name the three companies that manufacture the memory inside your phone.Don't feel bad if you're drawing a blank. Samsung you might know, though probably for their phones, not their chips. SK Hynix? Micron? These aren't household names. They don't advertise during cricket matches. They don't have sleek retail stores. Most people could live their entire lives without knowing these companies exist.And yet, together, they control 93% of the world's DRAM production—the memory that powers virtually every electronic device you touch. Your smartphone, laptop, tablet, gaming console, smart TV, car dashboard. All running on chips from this three-company oligopoly.For years, this arrangement hummed along invisibly. They competed for market share, prices stayed reasonable, technology improved steadily. The system worked well enough that nobody paid attention.Then it broke. Spectacularly.SK Hynix just posted profits that more than doubled year-over-year—from Rs 32,800 crore to Rs 71,900 crore. Micron's annual net income didn't just grow; it multiplied tenfold. These aren't the numbers of companies struggling to meet demand. These are the numbers of companies that found a way to print money, and that way is called artificial intelligence.Here's what's happening: AI companies are building data centers at a pace that defies comprehension. OpenAI's Stargate project alone—just one initiative from one company—plans to spend $500 billion over four years. Half a trillion dollars. That's more than the GDP of Poland. Of Thailand. Of entire nations.These data centers need memory. Mountains of it. Specialised high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that can process massive datasets at speeds that make your laptop RAM look like a carrier pigeon. And here's the problem: that specialised memory comes from the same factories, uses the same equipment, competes for the same silicon wafers as the regular memory that goes into consumer devices.Samsung and SK Hynix reportedly signed a deal to supply OpenAI with up to 900,000 DRAM wafers monthly. That's roughly 40% of global production—gone, locked up, spoken for. Imagine if someone bought 40% of the world's wheat harvest. What would happen to bread prices?Now imagine that, except the bread is the chips inside everything you own.The memory manufacturers aren't scrambling to fix this imbalance. They're celebrating it. Samsung told investors—and this is worth reading carefully—that it would ""pursue a strategy of maintaining long-term profitability"" rather than rapidly expanding production. Translation: Why make more chips and risk prices falling when scarcity is this profitable?SK Hynix was even more explicit. In their recent earnings call, they celebrated ""the highest-ever quarterly performance, driven by the full-scale rise in prices of DRAM and NAND."" Operating profit exceeded 10 trillion won for the first time in company history. They're not treating this as a crisis to solve. They're treating it as a windfall to harvest.The incentive structure is perfectly perverse. Manufacturing capacity takes years and billions to expand. Why invest heavily in new plants when current scarcity lets you charge premium prices? Why flood the market when controlled supply maximises profits? These companies learned painful lessons in 2023 when oversupply tanked prices and hurt revenues. They're not eager to repeat that mistake, even if it means years of constrained consumer supply.The absurdity of this situation crystallised in two stories that reveal everything about where priorities now lie.First: Samsung Semiconductor reportedly refused a memory order from Samsung Electronics. Let that sink in. The same company. Different divisions, yes—Samsung is less a company than a constellation of affiliates—but still. Samsung's mobile division, preparing for its 2026 flagship smartphones, approached Samsung's semiconductor division for memory chips. They wanted to lock in pricing and supply for the year, standard practice in manufacturing.Samsung Semiconductor said no.Not ""we can't meet those volumes."" Not ""let's negotiate pricing."" Just no. According to reports, the semiconductor division rejected the long-term deal entirely, forcing the mobile division to renegotiate quarterly at higher prices. They eventually hammered out a short-term agreement, but the precedent is staggering.Think about what this means. Samsung's own phone business—one of the largest smartphone manufacturers in the world—cannot secure favourable memory pricing from its sister company because AI data center customers will pay more. The 12GB of memory in a flagship smartphone now reportedly costs Samsung nearly Rs 3,350 more than it did months ago. That's not retail price—that's what it costs Samsung to put Samsung memory into Samsung phones.If Samsung can't get reasonable memory prices from Samsung, what chance do smaller manufacturers have?Second: After 29 years, Micron is killing Crucial, their consumer memory brand. No more Crucial RAM. No more Crucial SSDs. All shipments cease February 2026.If you're not into PC building, that name might mean nothing. But Crucial was a pillar—one of the oldest, most trusted names in consumer memory. Reliable, affordable, available everywhere. Tech reviewers recommended it reflexively. Builders planned around it. The brand represented a kind of social contract: decent performance at fair prices for people building their own machines.That contract just got torn up.Micron's statement used the sanitised language of corporate strategy: exiting the consumer business to ""improve supply and support for larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments."" Strip away the euphemisms and it's simple: AI companies pay better, so we're selling to them instead.The decision is financially rational. Brutally, perfectly rational. Crucial products sold at competitive consumer prices with thin margins. AI server memory commands premium pricing with guaranteed long-term contracts. If you're Micron's executive team, explaining to shareholders why you're still bothering with consumer products becomes increasingly difficult.But the implications extend beyond one brand disappearing. With Micron gone, Samsung and SK Hynix now control roughly 70% of consumer DRAM. That's not just reduced competition—that's approaching monopoly territory. And monopolies, as any economics textbook will tell you, don't typically result in lower prices and better service.There's also symbolic weight to Crucial's shutdown. This was a 29-year-old brand, spanning generations of PC builders. People built their first computer with Crucial memory. Upgraded their parents' computers with Crucial RAM. The brand had cultural currency beyond its market share. Its death sends a message: consumer DIY computing is no longer a priority. The industry is moving on, and if you want to come along, you'll pay premium prices for whatever capacity they deign to allocate to you.The PC gaming community felt it first. Memory kits that held steady around Rs 8,000 for months suddenly jumped to Rs 18,000. Then Rs 38,000. Premium configurations now cost over Rs 40,000—for memory alone. Some retailers stopped listing fixed prices entirely, treating memory like crude oil with prices fluctuating hourly. In Japan, stores implemented rationing—one memory kit per customer—trying to prevent hoarding.Online forums filled with digital despair. People who'd saved for months, planned their builds meticulously, waiting for the right moment. Except the right moment never came. It got worse instead. Framework—a company philosophically built on user-upgradeable laptops—stopped selling standalone memory modules because scalpers bought everything instantly. CyberPowerPC announced memory prices up 500%, SSDs up 100%, with increases effective December 7. A specific date. This is when affordable PC building dies.But the shockwaves are spreading far beyond gaming rigs.Dell's COO admitted he's ""never seen memory-chip costs rise this fast""—not during the pandemic, not ever. Industry sources say Dell is preparing price increases of 15-20%, possibly effective mid-December. Lenovo sent notices to business clients: all current quotations expire January 1, 2026. HP's CEO acknowledged that memory represents 15-18% of a typical laptop's cost, and when that component doubles in price, the math becomes brutal.Here's what most consumers won't see coming: manufacturers facing rising costs have three options—raise prices, eat the cost, or cut corners elsewhere. Guess which one they're choosing.Start looking for smaller batteries. Cheaper displays with dimmer panels and narrower color gamuts. Reduced storage because who needs local storage when everyone's pushing cloud subscriptions? Less expensive cooling systems that degrade faster. Build quality that slips in ways that don't appear on spec sheets but become glaringly obvious after a year of use. The budget laptop segment—those Rs 30,000 machines that get students through college—is facing existential crisis. A Rs 3,000 increase in memory costs represents a 10% price jump on devices already operating on razor-thin margins.TrendForce revised its 2026 notebook forecast from 1.7% growth to a 2.4% decline. That's millions of laptops that won't be sold because people either can't afford them or won't accept the compromises.Smartphones face the same squeeze. Industry analysts predict an average Rs 750 price increase across smartphones in 2026, with shipments declining as consumers balk or delay upgrades. Budget phones—devices under Rs 20,000 that represent the majority of global sales—will suffer most. That Rs 18,000 phone that came with 6GB of RAM might drop to 4GB. Storage shrinks from 128GB to 64GB. Cheaper cameras. Slower charging. The phone still works, but it's quietly, frustratingly worse than what the same money bought six months ago.Gaming consoles aren't immune. Hardware that traditionally holds pricing stable for entire generations faces another Rs 12,500 increase on top of previous bumps. Even Raspberry Pi—the tiny computer beloved by educators and hobbyists, philosophically committed to accessibility—raised prices between Rs 420 and Rs 2,100 per model.Storage drives are experiencing their own quiet crisis. SSDs use NAND flash memory, and AI data centers need massive storage for training datasets. A one-terabyte drive that cost Rs 6,000 in August now ranges from Rs 7,000 to Rs 9,000. High-performance models have nearly tripled where stock has evaporated. The CEO of a major SSD controller manufacturer warned that current supply tightness could last a decade. Even traditional hard drives are seeing shortages and price increases as cloud providers buy everything available.What makes this particularly cruel: storage needs keep growing inexorably. Operating systems expand with each update. Games routinely exceed 100GB. Everyone shoots videos in higher resolutions. Just as storage becomes more essential, it's becoming more expensive and scarce.Strip away the technical details and one question remains: who's paying for the AI revolution?Tech companies and investors are betting hundreds of billions that AI will reshape everything and generate returns justifying these massive infrastructure investments. They're reorganising entire supply chains around this vision. Meanwhile, everyone who uses technology—which is everyone—is subsidising this bet through higher prices and reduced availability. Your more expensive phone. Your pricier laptop. Your delayed computer upgrade. These are the hidden costs of the AI boom that nobody includes in the marketing presentations.There's profound irony here. AI promises to democratise capabilities, make technology more accessible. Yet building the infrastructure for these promises is actively making technology less accessible. Local hardware is becoming prohibitively expensive, pushing computing to the cloud—to those same data centers causing the shortage. You become dependent on subscriptions and internet connections for capabilities that could theoretically run on your device, if only the components weren't so costly.Some analysts call this a bubble. OpenAI has reportedly secured over $1.5 trillion in infrastructure commitments while generating approximately $12 billion in annual revenue. That's a lot of future promises riding on present spending. If they're right, memory prices could crash as suddenly as they spiked. But bubbles can inflate for years before popping. The dot-com bubble took years. The housing bubble took years. In the meantime, we all live with the consequences.Industry forecasts agree: this deteriorates before it improves. Most analysts expect prices climbing through mid-2026 at minimum. SK Hynix told investors the shortage could persist through late 2027. That's years of a fundamentally altered market.Building new semiconductor fabrication plants takes time—years, not months. Micron is planning a facility that won't begin construction until May and won't ship products until 2028. SK Hynix announced over $500 billion in new plant investments, with the first operational in 2027. These aren't solutions for people who need to buy a laptop next year or the year after.And there's another bomb waiting: Windows 10 support ends in October 2025. Millions of computers will need replacement or upgrades to meet Windows 11 requirements—newer processors, TPM 2.0 chips, and yes, more memory. This injects massive demand into a constrained supply chain at exactly the worst possible time.For consumers, the calculus is grim. Buy now before prices climb higher? Wait for relief that might not arrive for years? Accept compromises on specifications and performance? The advice circulating tech communities is blunt and depressing: if you need memory, storage, or a new device, buy now. Today's painful prices will likely look reasonable compared to tomorrow's. It's the kind of recommendation that feels fundamentally wrong—waiting usually means better deals, better technology, better value. But that's the old world.This is the memory crisis. Not a temporary shortage. Not a market fluctuation. A fundamental reordering of priorities that puts consumers at the back of the line while AI companies cut to the front. Unlike a natural disaster or pandemic that disrupts supply chains, this is a choice. Companies are choosing to prioritise AI over consumers because the economics make sense—for them.That memory in your current phone? It's worth more than it was six months ago, not because it got better, but because someone else wants it more. The laptop you'll buy next year? It'll cost more than it should, not because it's improved, but because the components inside are being rationed to serve priorities that have nothing to do with you.The AI revolution is here, and you're paying for it whether you wanted to or not. In higher device costs. In compromised specifications. In delayed upgrades. In the quiet erosion of the assumption that technology gets better and more affordable over time.That assumption just died. We're living in its aftermath now, trying to figure out what comes next in a world where the devices we depend on are increasingly treated as luxuries rather than necessities.Welcome to the future.

Elon Musk responded sharply to a social media post by California Governor Gavin Newsom that mocked the tech billionaire’s relationship with his estranged daughter Vivian. In a video post on X (formerly Twitter), Newsom can be seen saying “I want to see trans kids. .. There’s no governor that’s done more pro trans legislation than I have.” The video was sarcastically endorsed by the official Twitter handle of Gavin Newsom Press Office with a rather harsh comment – “Correct. We’re sorry your daughter hates you, Elon.”The Tesla CEO responded to the jab, correcting Gavin Newsom Press Office’s post. Musk clarified that his son Xavier (now Vivian Jenna Wilson) suffers from what he calls a ""woke mind virus"" while affirming love for him and contrasting with his daughters' affection.“I assume you’re referring to my son, Xavier, who has a tragic mental illness caused by the evil woke mind virus you push on vulnerable children,” Elon Musk wrote adding “I love Xavier very much and hope he recovers.”“My daughters are Azure, Exa (she goes by Y) and Arcadia, and they do indeed love me very much,” Musk further stated.The exchange marks another public clash between Elon Musk and Gavin Newsom, who have frequently disagreed on issues such as tech regulation, COVID-19 policies, and LGBTQ+ rights.Musk has repeatedly criticized what he calls “woke ideology,” while Newsom has defended California’s stance on gender-affirming care and other social policies.Wilson, born in 2004, is the daughter of Elon Musk and author Justine Wilson. Assigned male at birth and originally named Xavier Alexander Musk, she came out as transgender in 2020, adopting the name Vivian Jenna Wilson, taking her mother's maiden name to distance herself from her father.She has often expressed her dislike for Musk, criticizing and calling him a ‘pathetic man-child’. She also distanced herself from Musk's other children, expressing uncertainty about the number of her half-siblings. “I will say I do not actually know how many siblings I have, if you include half-siblings,” she said. “I don’t really give a f**k what they do. This is not my problem, OK?”Musk, on the other hand, has blamed 'woke mind' virus that 'killed' his son.","Elon Musk responded sharply to a social media post by California Governor Gavin Newsom that mocked the tech billionaire’s relationship with his estranged daughter Vivian.

Google's 'secret weapon' in AI race against OpenAI is what has been giving nightmares to Nvidia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/googles-secret-weapon-in-ai-race-against-openai-is-what-has-been-giving-nightmares-to-nvidia/articleshow/125929089.cms,"Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

How Google has become a 'worry' for Nvidia

What Nvidia said in its big defense





Nvidia recently got so spooked by a report on Google that the company made a public post on X, formerly Twitter, to defend itself. As for the news: A report in Information claimed that one of Nvidia's biggest customers, Meta, is considering shifting part of its AI infrastructure to Google’s in-house chips, called TPUs or Tensor Processing Units. These TPUs are what analysts consider Google’s secret weapon in the artificial intelligence race against OpenAI. These are chips that have helped Google models leap ahead of OpenAI, prompting tech investors to reassess a new threat to OpenAI as well as Nvidia’s dominance.Google's “tensor processing unit” has been central to the company's efforts to boost the performance of its all-new Gemini 3 AI models, which are reported to have outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-5 in independent benchmarking tests and impressed both analysts and reviewers. These TPUs also power Google Gemini 3 AI models that reportedly made OpenAI CEO Sam Altman send Code Red memos to employees across the company.For almost the past decade, Google’s TPUs were viewed by the industry as a potent but insular tool -- highly efficient custom silicon designed specifically for Google’s internal ecosystem. Now, the tech giant appears ready to break that isolation, launching a strategic offensive to challenge Nvidia’s near-monopoly on the AI hardware market. According to a new report from The Information earlier this year, Google is actively approaching smaller cloud computing providers with a proposition to install its TPUs alongside Nvidia’s GPUs in their data centers.This move signals a significant shift in strategy as Google attempts to position its custom silicon as a viable alternative to the industry standard.However, the landscape is shifting. Google’s recent launch of Gemini 3 -- a model trained entirely on TPUs that rivals OpenAI’s top-tier offerings -- has served as a powerful proof of concept. The success of Gemini 3 challenges the long-held narrative that top-flight AI requires Nvidia hardware, validating the TPU architecture for high-level generative AI work.Google’s outreach to external cloud providers appears to serve a dual purpose. First, it attempts to stimulate broader market demand for its silicon, offering an alternative to Nvidia’s expensive hardware. Second, it addresses a logistical hurdle: Google reportedly has an ample supply of chips but lacks the physical data center speed to deploy them. By partnering with external infrastructure providers, Google could ostensibly offload the hosting while securing the compute capacity needed for its own internal AI demands.This strategy builds on an earlier Information report from June that said that even OpenAI has explored using Google TPUs to offset the high costs of Nvidia’s ecosystem, though likely only for a fraction of its compute load. While Nvidia maintains that its upcoming Blackwell architecture is ""a generation ahead,"" Google’s aggressive push into external data centers suggests the era of the GPU monopoly may be facing its most serious test yet.In a post on X, soon after the Meta and Google news, Nvidia wrote, ""We’re delighted by Google’s success—they’ve made great advances in AI, and we continue to supply to Google. Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry—it’s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.""","Google's TPUs are what analysts consider Google’s secret weapon in the artificial intelligence race against OpenAI.

AI Litigation Task Force to be established soon





Donald Trump has signed a new executive order refraining states from passing artificial intelligence (AI) regulations which his administration believes could limit US leadership in technology. The order, signed on December 11 also directs the federal government to withhold broadband funding from states whose laws to regulate AI conflict with federal priorities. “We want to have one central source of approval,” Trump told reporters.“To win, United States AI companies must be free to innovate without cumbersome regulation,” the order said, adding different state laws make compliance more challenging.“First, State-by-State regulation by definition creates a patchwork of 50 different regulatory regimes that makes compliance more challenging, particularly for start-ups. Second, State laws are increasingly responsible for requiring entities to embed ideological bias within models,” the order stated.“Third, State laws sometimes impermissibly regulate beyond State borders, impinging on interstate commerce,” it added.The order also targets state-level anti-discrimination rules for AI systems. It says such laws could introduce “ideological bias” and produce inaccurate results. Critics, however, warn that removing state authority may reduce safety protections for users.The order also reflects the Trump administration's broader attack against anti-discrimination efforts, taking aim at states such as Colorado that have sought to prevent discriminatory language from being embedded in AI models. Such efforts could result in ""ideological bias"" and produce false results, it said.As per the executive order, the Attorney General shall establish an AI Litigation Task Force (Task Force) within 30 days of the order’s date. This task force shall be responsible to challenge State AI laws inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including on grounds that such laws unconstitutionally regulate interstate commerce, are preempted by existingThe Task Force shall consult from time to time with the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Counsel to the President regarding the emergence of specific State AI laws that warrant challenge, the order states.","US President Donald Trump has signed a new executive order refraining states from passing artificial intelligence (AI) regulations.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has banned Calibri font. Yes, Rubio has passed an order halting the State Department’s official use of Calibri, reversing a 2023 Biden-era directive. Reason is said to be Font's association with diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. It was reportedly chosen by the department’s then-DEI office, which has since been disbanded under Rubio amid the Trump administration’s anti-DEI directives. Rubio called Biden government's move to Calibri font a “wasteful” sop to diversity. For those unaware, Calibri is a sans-serif font.Rubio’s directive, obtained by The New York Times, comes under the subject line “Return to Tradition: Times New Roman 14-Point Font Required for All Department Paper.” In the “Action Request” memo, Rubio has said that switching back to the use of Times New Roman would “restore decorum and professionalism to the department’s written work.” Calibri is “informal” when compared to serif typefaces like Times New Roman, the order reads, and “clashes” with the department’s official letterhead.“Switching to Calibri achieved nothing except the degradation of the department’s official correspondence,” the memo says.It further notes that Times New Roman had been the department’s official typeface for nearly 20 years until the 2023 change.The choice to adopt a sans-serif font was an effort to improve readability for the visually impaired. With their lack of decorative flourishes and wider letter spacing, fonts like Calibri are often viewed as more accessible for those with conditions ranging from low vision to dyslexia. However, the switch has not been universally embraced.When the Biden administration introduced the change in 2023, it sparked ""rumblings"" among traditionalists who preferred the classic Times New Roman. Beyond the aesthetic debate, Secretary Blinken also raised the standard font size from 14 to 15-point, a move that irritated diplomats by requiring additional keystrokes to manage document length.","Secretary of State Marco Rubio has banned the State Department's use of Calibri font.

Junior developers building cross-team tools with AI assistance

Zoho's measured approach contrasts with industry-wide AI mandates





Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu has revealed that the Indian SaaS giant is now using AI coding tools across the company, with engineers reporting dramatic productivity improvements. In a detailed post on X, Vembu shared how one of the company's most productive engineers—a veteran with two decades of experience—is now completing in one day what previously took three weeks.However, Vembu emphasized a critical condition: all AI-generated code must be reviewed and approved by engineers who take full responsibility for it. ""We use AI coding tools across the company - with the caution to engineers that they have to review and approve all the code and take responsibility for it,"" he wrote, adding that Zoho doesn't ""force feed or mandate AI tools"" but leaves implementation decisions to experienced engineers.The productivity gains have been substantial. Speaking about a senior engineer handling performance-critical UI work, Vembu said: ""He told me that he is now shipping features that would have taken him 3 weeks of work that he got done in a day. AI needed him to provide the structure, it fleshed out the details and that required him to draw on his experience.""The technology's impact extends beyond accelerating senior engineers.Vembu disclosed that a less experienced team member built an internal tool with AI that is now being used across other teams—work that wouldn't have been possible without AI assistance. ""One of his less experienced team members has built an internal tool with AI that is being used across other teams. He said that team members could not have built the tool without AI,"" Vembu noted.For UI development specifically, Vembu reported the team is ""very bullish on AI,"" finding the technology particularly effective for interface work that balances functionality with performance demands.Vembu's disclosure comes as major tech companies push aggressive AI adoption targets. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently said over 25% of new code at Google is AI-generated, while Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella disclosed up to 30% of Microsoft's codebase now comes from AI. Shopify has made AI usage a baseline expectation in performance reviews.Zoho is taking a different path. ""We don't force feed or mandate AI tools, and leave the decision on how best to use AI to experienced engineers,"" Vembu stated. The approach reflects his earlier warnings about technical debt, security vulnerabilities and compliance failures that can accumulate in AI-generated code without proper human oversight.The Zoho founder's comments also follow his recent public clash with Y Combinator President Garry Tan, who predicted companies like Zoho would be among the first casualties of ""vibe coding""—where non-technical users build custom apps using AI platforms. Vembu dismissed the claim, pointing to Zoho's customer base growing at over 50% and warning that AI-generated applications accumulate unsustainable technical debt without proper engineering oversight.","Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu has revealed that the Indian SaaS giant is now using AI coding tools across the company.

Turning a career setback into major creative work period

I never did it for money: Steve Jobs





Nearly two decades after it was delivered, Apple founder Steve Jobs ’ Stanford commencement speech continues to resonate with and inspire professionals. The Commencement Address delivered by Jobs on June 12, 2005 has a ‘simple’ career lesson for young people – the importance of doing the work you love – a principle he said kept him going over the years. “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do,” Jobs told students then.“If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking—and don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it,” he continued.Despite being one of the co-founders of Apple , Steve Jobs was pushed out of the company in 1985 by the then CEO John Sculley. However, Jobs said it was then he entered one of the “most creative periods” by launching NeXT and revamping Pixar Studios.Even so, Jobs said he felt drawn back to Apple, calling it the “best thing that ever happened to [him].” He returned as CEO in 1997 and stayed in the role until two months before his death in October 2011.“Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith,” Jobs said. “I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.You’ve got to find what you love.”In a 1996 interview with PBS, Jobs revealed that despite becoming a millionaire at at the age of 23, it wasn’t ‘important’ to him because he “never did it for the money.”“I was worth about over $1 million when I was 23, and over $10 million when I was 24, and over $100 million when I was 25,” Jobs told PBS. “And it wasn’t that important, because I never did it for the money.”","Apple founder Steve Jobs delivered the Stanford Commencement Address on June 12, 2005.

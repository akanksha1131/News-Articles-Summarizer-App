Cloud-hosted websites and applications

Streaming platforms and smart home devices

Enterprise tools and e-commerce systems





Amazon Web Services (AWS) has officially confirmed that its cloud infrastructure is back online after the major outage which disrupted hundreds of websites and apps across the internet. The company stated that the incident was caused by a combination of DNS resolution failures and internal load balancer degradation in its US-EAST-1 region, one of its busiest data centres. “There are no issues with AWS services, and all AWS services are operating normally. We are aware that an operational issue at another infrastructure provider may be impacting some customers' applications and networks,” the company said on its status page.As per AWS’s post-event analysis, the disruption started with elevated error rates in DynamoDB API endpoints, triggered by a DNS issue. This was compounded by a failure in the internal health monitoring system for Network Load Balancers (NLBs), which led to cascading connectivity problems across services like EC2, S3, and Lambda. The outage affected major platforms including Snapchat, Reddit, Slack, Canva, and Amazon.com, with millions of users reporting issues via Downdetector.AWS engineers mitigated the DNS issue by 2:24 AM PDT and gradually restored services throughout the day.AWS stated that all services were fully operational by 6 PM ET on October 29, and the company is now conducting a full review to prevent future incidents. Despite the scale of the disruption, no real-time updates were posted on the AWS Health Dashboard during the outage, drawing criticism from developers and enterprise clients.The outage rippled across industries, affecting:Experts say the incident underscores the fragility of centralized cloud infrastructure and the risks of over-reliance on a single provider.

Azure service outage: What happened

What went wrong and why



Microsoft Q3 results: Strong growth despite disruption





Microsoft has confirmed that it has fully restored its Azure cloud services after the widespread outage that struck for hours before the company’s scheduled Q3 earnings announcement. The disruption affected critical platforms including Microsoft 365, Outlook, Xbox Live, and Copilot, leaving millions of users across industries temporarily disconnected. As per Microsoft’s Azure Status History, the service outage was caused by a configraution error which triggered cascading failures across multiple regions. The company revealed that it deployed a rollback to a stable configuration which gradually led to service restoration after several hours.As per Microsoft’s Azure Status history, the outage was triggered by a DNS failure in Azure Front Door, a key content delivery and routing service. Between 15:45 UTC on 29 October and 00:05 UTC on 30 October 2025, customers and Microsoft services leveraging Azure Front Door (AFD) may have experienced latencies, timeouts, and errors.Affected Azure services include, but are not limited to: App Service, Azure Active Directory B2C, Azure Communication Services, Azure Databricks, Azure Healthcare APIs, Azure Maps, Azure Portal, Azure SQL Database, Azure Virtual Desktop, Container Registry, Media Services, Microsoft Copilot for Security, Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management, Microsoft Entra ID (Mobility Management Policy Service, Identity & Access Management, and User Management UX), Microsoft Purview, Microsoft Sentinel (Threat Intelligence), and Video Indexer.Customer configuration changes to AFD remain temporarily blocked. We will notify customers once this block has been lifted. While error rates and latency are back to pre-incident levels, a small number of customers may still be seeing issues and we are still working to mitigate this long tail. Updates will be provided directly via Azure Service Health.An inadvertent tenant configuration change within Azure Front Door (AFD) triggered a widespread service disruption affecting both Microsoft services and customer applications dependent on AFD for global content delivery. The change introduced an invalid or inconsistent configuration state that caused a significant number of AFD nodes to fail to load properly, leading to increased latencies, timeouts, and connection errors for downstream services.As unhealthy nodes dropped out of the global pool, traffic distribution across healthy nodes became imbalanced, amplifying the impact and causing intermittent availability even for regions that were partially healthy. We immediately blocked all further configuration changes to prevent additional propagation of the faulty state and began deploying a ‘last known good’ configuration across the global fleet. Recovery required reloading configurations across a large number of nodes and rebalancing traffic gradually to avoid overload conditions as nodes returned to service. This deliberate, phased recovery was necessary to stabilize the system while restoring scale and ensuring no recurrence of the issue.The trigger was traced to a faulty tenant configuration deployment process. Our protection mechanisms, to validate and block any erroneous deployments, failed due to a software defect which allowed the deployment to bypass safety validations. Safeguards have since been reviewed and additional validation and rollback controls have been immediately implemented to prevent similar issues in the future.Microsoft reported strong Q3 earnings despite the massive Azure service outage. The company announced that it witnessed significant growth from its Intelligent Cloud segment with Azure maintaining double-digit growth. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, also stressed on the fact that the company’s commitment to resilience and innovation, noting that Copilot adoption across Microsoft 365 and Bing continues to accelerate.","Microsoft has confirmed that it has fully restored its Azure cloud services after the widespread outage that struck for hours before the company’s scheduled Q3 earnings announcement.

Immediate limits:

Complete elimination:

Age verification:





Character.AI, the Google-backed artificial intelligence (AI) startup, has said that it will shut off the ability for minors to have open-ended conversations with its AI chatbots, including romantic and therapeutic chats, following the suicide of a teenager who formed relationships with characters on its platform. The Silicon Valley company, which allows users to create and interact with character-based chatbots, said the move is part of an effort to make its app safer and more age-appropriate for users under 18.The announcement comes more than a year after 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III committed suicide after forming what his family described as sexual relationships with chatbots on Character.AI's app. Sewell's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company in October 2024.“This is a bold step forward, and we hope this raises the bar for everybody else,” CNBC cited Character.AI CEO Karandeep Anand as saying.As part of its safety initiatives, Character.AI announced several measures:Starting immediately, users under 18 will be limited to two hours of open-ended chats per day.By November 25, those types of conversations will be eliminated entirely for minors, though they will still have access to the app's other offerings including storytelling and roleplay formats.The company is rolling out an age assurance function using first-party and third-party software to monitor users' ages. Character.AI is partnering with Persona—the same verification firm used by Reddit and other platforms—to help with verification.The tragedy is part of a broader pattern raising concerns about AI chatbots. Many AI developers, including OpenAI and Meta (Facebook's parent company), have faced scrutiny after users committed suicide or died after forming relationships with chatbots.Character.AI was founded by Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, both former Google AI researchers. In August 2024, Google hired the company’s co-founders. Character.AI licensed its current large language model (LLM) technology to Google as part of the agreement. Shazeer returned to Google DeepMind as a co-lead for the Gemini model.Last week, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said that the company will not provide “simulated erotica” and called such chatbots “very dangerous.”","Character.AI, the Google-backed artificial intelligence startup, has said that it will shut off the ability for minors to have open-ended conversations with its AI chatbots.

Microsoft says it took $3.1 billion hit from OpenAI investment: CEO Satya Nadella calls partnership ‘historic’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-says-it-took-3-1-billion-hit-from-openai-investment-ceo-satya-nadella-calls-partnership-historic/articleshow/124927960.cms,"Microsoft CEO praises OpenAI partnership





OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Microsoft reported a $3.1 billion hit to its net income in the first quarter, a drop the company attributed to its massive investment in AI partner OpenAI. The reduction in profit, which Microsoft categorised in its earnings report as an “equity method investment,” follows the recent completion of a major corporate restructuring by the maker of ChatGPT.The news of the financial hit comes just one day after OpenAI announced it had completed a recapitalisation, formalising its unique structure. The non-profit entity, now known as the OpenAI Foundation, will hold a 26% stake in its for-profit arm.As a result of this restructuring, Microsoft now holds an investment in the public benefit corporation valued at $135 billion, or roughly 27% of the company on an as-converted diluted basis.Despite the quarterly profit deduction, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella hailed the relationship as a historic success.“This is a great milestone for both companies,” Nadella said on the earnings call, as per CNBC. “We continue to benefit mutually from each other’s growth across multiple dimensions.”Nadella highlighted the strong financial returns, noting that Microsoft has seen 10 times the return on its OpenAI investment.Furthermore, under the new agreement, OpenAI has contracted to purchase an incremental $250 billion of Azure services from Microsoft.The new agreement marks “the next chapter in what is one of the most successful partnerships and investments our industry has ever seen,” the CEO said.Since first backing OpenAI in 2019, Microsoft has committed to invest a total of $13 billion, with $11.6 billion already funded as of the end of September.The financial report, however, was positive, with Microsoft reporting better-than-expected earnings and profit overall. Its primary growth engine remains the Azure cloud, which saw a robust 40% revenue expansion, topping estimates.However, the nature of the partnership is evolving. While Microsoft and OpenAI have been partners for over half a decade, they are also becoming increasing competitors. Although Microsoft has heavily relied on OpenAI's models to power its key products, it is already working on its own models. In August, Microsoft began publicly testing a homegrown AI model that could lead to independent enhancements for its Copilot assistant.","Microsoft reported a $3.1 billion hit to its net income in the first quarter, a drop the company attributed to its massive investment in AI partner OpenAI.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees. The ad-supported service is expected to provide users with access to:The company is reportedly testing a model where users will view approximately two minutes of pre-roll advertisements before a game starts streaming. Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

AI-assisted content creation will lower the barrier to creativity but raise quality: Adobe’s Govind Balakrishnan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-assisted-content-creation-will-lower-the-barrier-to-creativity-but-raises-quality-adobes-govind-balakrishnan/articleshow/124922128.cms,"'AI will help increase personalised content consumption'







While artificial intelligence (AI) is lowering the barrier to content creation, it will ultimately lead to an abundance of personalised, high-quality content and an increased demand for genuine originality, Govind Balakrishnan, SVP and GM of Adobe Express has said. He noted that Adobe’s goal is to “lower the barrier to creativity,” enabling people who previously lacked the technical medium to tell their stories.When asked what happens when AI tools allow anyone to generate professional-quality content, potentially devaluing the skills honed by traditionally trained artists, Balakrishnan noted that the current development phase of generative AI is “great news” for the democratization of content creation. The underlying belief is that everyone has a story to tell, and AI now provides the medium to share it.“We are lowering the bar to creativity by making content creation very easy for everyone but at the same time, we are going to see that the bar to consumption is actually going to go up,” he told The Times of India Tech on the sidelines of the Adobe Max 2025 annual conference currently underway in Los Angeles.Adobe introduced an AI Assistant in Express that allows users to edit projects using simple, conversational language instead of complex traditional tools.Now, users can simply tell the AI Assistant what they want, while retaining the option to fine-tune details using familiar controls like sliders and color pickers.Adobe says that this new feature aims to transform its design workflow by removing the barriers of traditional design software, which often requires users to master specific workflows.The AI Assistant allows users to describe desired changes in natural language, leveraging its advanced contextual understanding of design elements. For example, a user could ask the assistant to ""Remove the background"" from an image or ""Change the tone of the photo to more tropical.""Adobe notes that this system provides a ""contextual and semantic understanding of design elements,"" enabling it to interpret vague or subjective requests and make intelligent design decisions.While the ability to create content becomes widespread, the Balakrishnan predicted two simultaneous shifts in the creative ecosystem:Increased content curation: As content becomes abundant, the ability to “sift through the noise and find the content we care about” becomes more important. Users will increasingly rely on tools that deliver content highly personalised to their interests and needs, he said.“The value proposition is definitely lowered,” the executive said, referring to the technical skill once required.Higher consumption bar: The overall quality bar for content that consumers are willing to accept will rise. While more content will be created, consumers will become more selective.“The value of skill itself is definitely lower, which is great news... it gives everyone a medium so they can tell their stories,” he added. The expectation is that this surge of accessible creation will lead to an ecosystem rich with personal, meaningful content.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is lowering the barrier to content creation, Adobe's Govind Balakrishnan says.

The US has previously flagged Wingtech as a potential national security risk.

Global pains





Global auto giants Nissan Motor and Mercedes-Benz reportedly became the latest to publicly warn about a worsening semiconductor supply crisis, directly linking the scarcity to a heated trade and intellectual property dispute between the Netherlands and China over key Dutch chipmaker Nexperia. The growing fallout highlights the auto industry's profound vulnerability to escalating geopolitical trade frictions between Beijing and the West.The immediate trigger for the new wave of supply disruption is a stand-off over Nexperia, a company whose chips are ubiquitous in automotive components. The crisis erupted after the Dutch government seized control of the chipmaker in September, citing concerns over the possible transfer of crucial technology to Nexperia’s Chinese parent company, Wingtech.In retaliation, China has reportedly banned the export of Nexperia's finished products from its plants in the country, effectively choking off a vital source of chips for the global auto supply chain.According to a report in Reuters, at the Japan Mobility Show in Tokyo, Nissan's Chief Performance Officer Guillaume Cartier reportedly underscored the severity of the challenge.""It's not a small issue, it's a big issue,"" Cartier told reporters, admitting the automaker currently lacks ""full visibility"" on the long-term impact.Cartier indicated that Nissan’s immediate supply was ""okay to the first week of November,"" but noted that tracking chip availability becomes exponentially harder the further down the supply chain one looks.Meanwhile, in Germany, Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Kaellenius confirmed the automaker is aggressively ""scouring around the world for alternative supply."" Like Nissan, Kaellenius expressed difficulty in predicting how or when the situation would resolve.The supply crunch is already threatening to halt production across major manufacturing centers.In Brazil, a significant global automaking hub, an official warned on Tuesday that some manufacturers may be forced to suspend operations within the next two to three weeks if the Nexperia-related crisis is not resolved. The Brazilian government is now in contact with Chinese authorities, attempting to find a diplomatic and commercial solution.This latest geopolitical challenge comes as the auto industry continues to grapple with existing headwinds, including U.S. tariffs and Chinese export restrictions on rare earth minerals.",Nissan Motor and Mercedes-Benz are the latest global auto giants to publicly warn about a worsening semiconductor supply crisis.

‘Don’t chase quick money…’: Jeff Bezos’ advice for millennials who want to get rich,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dont-chase-quick-money-jeff-bezos-advice-for-millennials-who-want-to-get-rich/articleshow/124915555.cms,"Jeff Bezos’ advice for millennials who want to get rich

Jeff Bezos’ wealth advice: Focus on the future, not fast wins





Embrace risk and failure as strategic tools





Choose platforms that offer optionality





The millennial context: Why this advice matters





Long-term thinking counters the short-term focus that many feel due to economic instability.

Risk acceptance is critical when many jobs are being transformed by technology and new sectors emerge.

Platform choice becomes important as careers become less linear and more fluid.

Practical steps millennials can take





Start early and compound : Whether in savings, investments or skill development, begin as soon as possible to benefit from time.

: Recognise that compound returns whether financial, career or skills-based often take years to manifest. Reassess regularly: As your platforms evolve, revisit your path, evaluate options and steer accordingly.

Limitations and considerations





Not all individuals have the luxury of high risk tolerance due to financial constraints.

Long-term strategies still require discipline, access to resources and external stability.

Platform choice is influenced by macro factors such as job market shifts, economy and industry regulation.

The time horizon may be shorter for those with immediate financial needs or responsibilities.





As the founder of one of the world’s most influential companies, Jeff Bezos has become known not just for arguably reshaping global retail and cloud computing, but also for the advice he shares about wealth, career and long-term value creation. In a recent piece by Yahoo Finance, Bezos offered guidance aimed specifically at millennials who want to build financial stability and succeed in a changing economy. His advice reflects a worldview shaped by decades building Amazon, emphasising long-term thinking, embracing risk and selecting platforms that give optionality. As younger generations face unique challenges such as high debt, volatile employment and rapid technological change these lessons aim to provide a roadmap grounded in patience, strategic action and a focus on upside over instant reward.One of Bezos’ principal messages is that building wealth and achieving success is about playing a long game rather than chasing quick wins. In the Yahoo Finance article, he highlights that young people should prioritise decisions that may not pay off immediately but will compound over the years.For example, instead of seeking short-term stock gains or fast career jumps purely for status, Bezos suggests focusing on businesses, careers or financial instruments that have longevity and scalability.He links this to the philosophy he developed at Amazon, where building a customer-centric, long-horizon company became the key differentiator.Millennials often face pressure to avoid failure, yet Bezos frames failure differently: as an inevitable part of exploration and growth. The advice emphasises that when you are young, you can afford to take bold moves because the consequences of failure are lower. According to the Yahoo Finance report, Bezos said that young people should not shy away from “making mistakes” or undertaking projects with risk if the payoff could be significant.This principle reflects how he approached business-building: launching Amazon in the late 1990s, expanding into cloud services and space exploration despite uncertainties, and reinvesting in long-term bets rather than seeking immediate profitability.Another key element of Bezos’ advice is choosing environments or “platforms” that provide flexibility and growth potential rather than limiting one’s options. He encourages millennials to select jobs, companies and industries where the upside is large and the ability to pivot remains possible.For instance, working at a company with a strong culture, high standards, and scalability offers lessons and networks that can be applied elsewhere. The broader concept here is that one’s career should not lock them into a narrow path but should allow room to grow, change and capitalise on future opportunities.Millennials operate in a world very different from prior generations. Key factors include student-loan burdens, rising housing costs, automation, gig-economy employment, and rapid industry shifts. Traditional career pathways and predictable pension models are less certain. In this landscape, Bezos’ guidance gains relevance:By framing wealth-building as a strategy of patience, value and optionality, his advice addresses these structural changes rather than offering quick solutions.Based on Bezos’ guidance, here are actionable steps that match his principles:While the advice offers a strong framework, it is important to acknowledge real-world caveats:In other words, while the principles hold broad relevance, their implementation will vary significantly depending on individual circumstances.","Jeff Bezos’ wealth advice: Focus on the future, not fast wins.

Azure Outage: Microsoft says issue identified; engineers rolling back changes and rerouting traffic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/global-microsoft-azure-outage-microsoft-says-issue-identified-engineers-are-rolling-back-changes-and-rerouting-traffic/articleshow/124916411.cms,"AI Image

Microsoft says issue identified

Status update on Azure page

We have initiated the deployment of our last known good configuration, which is expected to complete within 30 minutes. As this deployment progresses, customers should begin to see initial signs of recovery. Once completed, we will begin recovering nodes and routing traffic through these healthy nodes.

Customer configuration changes will remain temporarily blocked while we continue mitigation efforts. We will notify customers once this block has been lifted.

Some customers may also have experienced issues accessing the Azure management portal. We have failed the portal away from AFD to mitigate these access issues. Customers should now be able to access the Azure portal directly, and while most portal extensions are functioning as expected, a small number of endpoints (e.g., Marketplace) may still experience intermittent loading problems.

We do not yet have an ETA for full mitigation, but we will provide another update within 30 minutes, once the deployment has completed.

Customers may also consider implementing failover strategies using Azure Traffic Manager to redirect traffic from Azure Front Door to their origin servers as an interim measure.

What exactly are DNS problems





Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform is suffering a widespread outage that has affected several websites, services and apps including Microsoft 365, Xbox and NatWest. It has reportedly even halted voting at the Scottish Parliament. Microsoft says a DNS configuration change is to blame and is attempting a rollback while rerouting traffic to healthy infrastructure.The disruption first registered as spikes in outage reports on Downdetector earlier today, and Microsoft’s Azure status page later confirmed problems with Azure Portal access. On its status page, Azure’s network infrastructure was showing as “critical” in every region in the world, underscoring the global scale of the problem.Microsoft said it believed the outage was a result of “an inadvertent configuration change”, and that it planned to remedy the situation by rolling the service back to a recent backup known to be functioning correctly.

Alaska Airlines says website, app down amid global Azure outage





Microsoft has confirmed that an internal infrastructure issue has caused widespread problems, preventing some users from accessing its core Microsoft 365 business applications and various games. The disruption, which saw a rapid spike in issue reports on the outage tracking website Downdetector shortly after 11 a.m. New York time, prompted an immediate response from the tech giant.""We’re investigating reports of issues accessing Microsoft 365 services and the Microsoft 365 admin center,” the company posted from AzureSupport account on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter).Microsoft later indicated that it had identified portions of internal infrastructure experiencing connectivity issues and was actively working on recovery efforts to restore full functionality. Details on the exact nature of the infrastructure problem were not immediately provided.In its recent status update: Microsoft said that “starting at approximately 4pm, we began experiencing Azure Front Door issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services. In addition, customers may experience issues accessing the Azure Portal.”Incidentally, Microsoft services are facing disruption same time as outage at Amazon's cloud division Amazon Web Services.This is second major AWS outage this month.Alaska Airlines has said that its website and app were down on Wednesday. The airline said that the latest disruption stemmed from a global outage affecting Microsoft's Azure platform, which has impacted key systems, including its websites. The issue was being looked into, the carrier said on X, as it responded to customers who were facing challenges while accessing the company's website.The ground-stop caused by last week's AWS outage reportedly forced the carrier to cancel over 400 flights, and disrupted travel for more than 49,000 passengers.(Developing story)","Alaska Airlines says website, app down amid global Azure outage.

The broader impact







Amazon Web Services (AWS), the backbone of much of the internet, has experienced its second major outage this month. Similar to the AWS outage on October 20, this one too appears to be widespread. Reports suggest disruptions across websites, apps, and cloud-based platforms. As reported by DownDetector, the incident started Wednesday (October 29) and it affected services ranging from e-commerce and social media websites to enterprise tools and streaming platforms. As per DownDetector, thousands of users reported issues accessing AWS-hosted services. The outage appeared to impact multiple regions, though AWS has disputed the extent of the disruption, stating, “AWS is operating normally and this reporting is incorrect.” The company urged users to rely on its official Health Dashboard for accurate service status.Websites and platforms facing outage:The outage follows a similar incident earlier this month, which lasted nearly 15 hours and was traced back to a DNS failure triggered by simultaneous updates from two automated systems. That disruption cost Amazon an estimated $581 million in potential insured losses.While AWS has not so far confirmed the latest outage, reports suggest that it may be related to ongoing infrastructure stress in the US-EAST-1 region, one of AWS’s busiest data centers.The October 20 outage originated there and exposed vulnerabilities in centralized cloud architecture. AWS has promised to “learn from this event” and improve availability. However, the recurrence of outage within less than 10 days has raised concerns among developers, businesses, and cybersecurity analysts.With AWS powering over 30% of the global cloud market, even brief outages ripple across industries. The incident highlights the risks of over-reliance on a single cloud provider and has reignited discussions around multi-cloud strategies and resilience planning.","Amazon Web Services (AWS) has experienced its second major outage this month.

These inspections fall into two categories:

What is a border search of electronic device





US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents searched more electronic devices at the border over the past year than ever before, marking a significant spike that coincides with the Trump administration's broader immigration crackdown, according to new statistics published by the government agency and reported by Wired. The new figures show that for the full Fiscal Year 2025 (October 2024 to September 2025), border agents conducted approximately 55,424 searches of electronic devices, including phones. This is a nearly 17 percent jump from the roughly 47,000 searches completed in the previous fiscal year.The overall rise was heavily driven by a marked increase over the past six months. The report highlights that between April and June, CBP searched 14,899 devices, which was a record high for a single quarter at the time. However, that record was quickly surpassed in the final quarter of the fiscal year, with 16,173 phones searched between July and September.While the number of searches remains small compared to the millions of people entering the U.S. annually, the increase has coincided with a reported plummet in international visitors, with millions reportedly reconsidering travel under the current administration. Since the start of the Trump administration, several travelers have alleged they were denied entry or faced long detentions due to content found on their phones.Border officials maintain broad legal authority to search devices—including those belonging to U.S. citizens and green card holders -- when they enter the country. Airports and border zones are generally considered to fall outside the Fourth Amendment protections that typically require a warrant for a device search. CBP states that individuals must present their electronics ""in a condition that allows for the examination of the device and its contents. ""* Basic searches, where an agent manually scrolls through the phone.* Advanced searches, which require ""reasonable suspicion"" and utilize external tools to copy and analyze data.As information on United States Customs and Border Protection website says: Border searches of electronic devices have long been critical to protecting border security, and are essential to enforcing the customs, immigration, and other laws CBP is authorized to enforce and administer. Border searches of electronic devices include any inbound or outbound search pursuant to longstanding border search authority and are conducted at the physical border, the functional equivalent of the border, or the extended border, consistent with law and agency policy.Refusing to provide a device passcode can lead to seizure and delay. The sophisticated technology fueling these ""advanced searches"" includes tools originally marketed for criminal investigations, such as Cellebrite’s UFED and GrayKey, which are designed to bypass locks, retrieve deleted files, and rebuild activity timelines. The CBP even recently put out a request for new technology to expand its search capabilities, demonstrating an ongoing effort to make what Wired describes as a process that once took weeks of lab work now a routine checkpoint procedure.","US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents searched more electronic devices at the border over the past year than ever before.

Character AI bans minors from using chatbots for specific conversations; Indian-origin CEO says: Hope this…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/character-ai-bans-minors-from-using-chatbots-for-specific-conversations-indian-origin-ceo-says-hope-this/articleshow/124910516.cms,"AI generated image for representation

“This is a bold step forward, and we hope this raises the bar for everybody else.”

What features Character AI has already introduced for user safety







Character.AI has announced a major policy change to enhance child safety for its chatbot. The company has confirmed that it will soon shut off minors' (users under 18) access to free-ranging chats, specifically romantic and therapeutic conversations, with its chatbots. This move is a direct effort by the Silicon Valley startup to make its app, which allows users to create and interact with character-based chatbots, safer and more age-appropriate for younger users. The complete elimination of these open-ended conversations for minors is set to take effect by November 25, following an interim measure that will limit users under 18 to 2 hours of open-ended chats per day.In a statement to CNBC, Character.AI's Indian-origin CEO, Karandeep Anand, emphasised the significance of this move, saying:This means the company will stop allowing teenagers to have open-ended chats with its chatbot but will let them use other parts of the app, Anand said. About 10% of its 20 million monthly users are under 18, a share that has decreased as the platform shifted focus toward storytelling and roleplay.To support this, the company is introducing an age verification system using both internal tools and third-party software, partnering with Persona, a firm also used by Discord, for authentication.This decision comes amid increased scrutiny on AI developers after users formed therapeutic or sexual relationships with chatbots, sometimes leading to tragic outcomes. This includes the suicide of 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III last year after the minor formed sexual relationships with chatbots on Character AI's app. Major companies like OpenAI and Meta have also faced similar scrutiny regarding user relationships with AI.In 2024, Character.AI implemented measures to prevent minors from engaging in explicit conversations with its chatbots. That same day, Sewell’s family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company. Later, Character.AI added safety features to restrict romantic content for teenagers, and its latest update completely removes open-ended chats for minors.In 2024, some of Character.AI’s founders and researchers joined Google DeepMind as part of a deal allowing Google a non-exclusive license to use Character.AI’s large language model technology. Since Anand became CEO in June (almost a year after the Google deal), Character.AI has introduced new features beyond chatbot conversations. This includes AI-generated video feeds and storytelling or roleplay options. The company also announced the creation of an independent AI Safety Lab for research on AI entertainment, inviting partners from academia, industry, and policy to participate.","Character.AI has announced a major policy change to enhance child safety for its chatbot.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?





Nvidia made history on Wednesday (October 29) as the first company ever to reach a $5 trillion market valuation. The company reached $5 trillion in market value just over three months after crossing $4 trillion, suggesting accelerating momentum in AI adoption across industries. According to CNBC, shares of the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker rose more than 4%, pushing its market capitalisation past the threshold and cementing its position at the centre of the global AI boom.Reports say that there have been several factors that propelled Nvidia's rise. CEO Jensen Huang recently announced that Nvidia expects $500 billion in AI chip orders, reflecting demand for the company's processors. Nvidia also revealed plans to build seven new supercomputers for the US government.Under Huang's leadership, the company's H100 and Blackwell processors have become the engines powering large-language models behind tools like ChatGPT and Elon Musk's xAI. Meanwhile, the company has also invested over $100 billion in strategic partnerships with firms including OpenAI , Intel and, most recently, Nokia.While Nvidia remains the clear frontrunner, tech giants Apple and Microsoft have also crossed $4 trillion in market value in recent months, forming an elite club of mega-cap technology companies.The heavy weightings of these companies in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes give them outsized influence over global markets, meaning their performance increasingly drives broader market movements.Notably, while Nvidia remains the industry's top choice for AI chips, rivals are mounting challenges:Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has positioned itself as the primary alternative to Nvidia, though it still trails in market share. Custom chips from companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft threaten Nvidia's dominance in some segments, as cloud providers develop proprietary processors optimised for their own AI services.Despite these competitive threats, Nvidia has maintained its leadership through a combination of superior hardware performance, comprehensive software ecosystems, and early-mover advantages that create switching costs for customers.","Shares of the chipmaker rose more than 4%, pushing its market capitalisation past the threshold.

Starlink in India: Launch, Price and How It Will Work

Telecom department sets strict guidelines for Starlink





Elon Musk's Starlink is reportedly scheduled to conduct demo runs in India on October 30 and 31. According to a report by news agency PTI, these tests are scheduled to run in Mumbai to show compliance with security and technical conditions for satellite broadband services. As per sources, the demo, to be done before law enforcement agencies, will be based on the provisional spectrum assigned to Starlink. These demos are an essential requirement for Starlink to secure clearances before it can launch commercial services in the country.Starlink’s India entry would help SpaceX compensate for being shut out of China, where the government has kept the market closed to foreign operators.The successful completion of these demoes will mark a significant step ahead for Startlink's planned entry into the Indian satellite broadband market. These tests are said to be the final hurdle for the company as it prepares to provide commercial satellite broadband services in India.The series of tests is part of India’s security clearance process for both foreign and domestic telecom operators.The SpaceX-owned network will still need Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to release the final pricing framework for satellite services. If SpaceX manages to get TRAI's not to its pricing, the company may start beaming Internet signals to Indian homes by early 2026.The SpaceX-owned company is reportedly building at least 9 satellite gateways across India. The number is more than triple of that planned by its two major rivals in the market, Space Fiber from Reliance Jio and OneWeb from Eutelsat Communications. According to a recent report in Economic Times, these gateway stations will be set up at nine places across India, including Mumbai, Noida, Chandigarh, Kolkata and Lucknow.The Telecom Department has reportedly permitted Starlink to import 100 terminals for testing fixed satellite services, with strict conditions to prevent misuse due to the critical nature of Satcom. Although Starlink is said to be keen on bringing foreign technical experts to work at these Gateway stations, the company has reportedly been told that only Indian nationals should operate them till Union Home Affairs ministry gives security clearances to all foreign nationals who will be working at Gateway stations.Other rules require that Starlink to store all data generated during trial period in India, ensure equipment remains secure, and share terminal details. These include: Names, addresses, and geo-coordinates -- with the DoT and security agencies every two weeks. Law enforcement can inspect and access data from Satcom terminals. License holders are also required to monitor traffic, establish satellite earth station gateways and a control center in India, and ensure all traffic to or from India passes through Indian gateways.",Elon Musk's Starlink is reportedly scheduled to conduct demo runs in India on October 30 and 31.

Available from November 1, 2025, across authorized retailers and e-commerce platforms, the lens delivers 1.4x magnification for α E-mount cameras.The standout feature is exceptional close-up capability.

This enables photographers to capture intricate details of flowers and small objects from a comfortable working distance, minimizing reflections and disturbances to delicate subjects.Performance improvements include significantly faster autofocus—approximately 1.9 times quicker than Sony's previous FE 90mm macro lens. Four XD linear motors power this enhancement, ensuring high-speed, precise, and quiet operation ideal for both photography and videography.The optical design incorporates two XA extreme aspherical lenses and two ED glass elements to deliver sharp, high-resolution images while reducing chromatic aberrations. Sony's Nano AR Coating II minimizes flare and ghosting, particularly when shooting against bright light sources.For creative control, the lens features three focus-dedicated functions: a Full-time DMF switch for instant manual focus adjustments, a Focus Mode switch, and a Sliding Focus Ring with distance and magnification scales. An 11-blade circular aperture produces the signature creamy bokeh characteristic of G Master lenses.Built-in optical image stabilization specifically optimized for macro work compensates for multiple types of camera shake, including shift, angular, and front-back movements, enabling sharp handheld shooting.The lens will be available at Sony Authorized Retail Outlets, Sony Camera Lounge, Alpha Flagship stores, ShopatSC.com, Amazon, and Flipkart starting November 1, 2025.","Sony India has launched the FE 100mm F2.8 Macro GM OSS, its first medium telephoto macro lens in the G Master series, priced at Rs 1,44,990.

David Sacks, the head of Donald Trump’s AI initiative recently shared unseen photos from his 2022 visit to the X (formerly Twitter) headquarters. The pictures were taken on the day when Elon Musk completed his $44 billion acquisition of the social media platform. Posting the photos online, Sacks wrote: “Three years ago, a house guest asked if I wanted to tag along to the office, and I got to be part of this historic moment. Here are a few more photos of the day free speech was liberated”.The post soon caught Musk’s attention who replied to it writing “The framed copies of free speech were a nice gift from @MorganStanley”. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Barclays were among the institutions that lent Musk funds to facilitate his $44 billion acquisition of X.Musk entered Twitter headquarters on October 27, 2022. He then shared a video of him entering the headquarters carrying a kitchen sink. The post was captioned “Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!”. A day later, he shared another post writing “the bird is freed”.Morgan Stanley not only advised Musk on the Twitter purchase, but also led the financing and held the biggest portion of debt out of the seven banks that participated.The gift, presented during the deal's closing, serves as a gesture acknowledging this partnership while symbolically endorsing the ideological shift Musk promised—moving Twitter toward a less moderated, more open platform.The framing of these documents mirrors the ""bird is freed"" meme Musk posted then, suggesting Twitter's release from what he viewed as restrictive policies under previous management. The gift thus symbolizes Morgan Stanley's alignment with Musk's narrative of freeing speech, reinforcing the bank's stake in this cultural and corporate milestone.","David Sacks, the head of Donald Trump’s AI initiative recently shared unseen photos from his 2022 visit to the X (formerly Twitter) headquarters.

"US immigration authority to visa applicants: Starting October 29, we will only accept payments in ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-immigration-authority-to-visa-applicants-starting-october-29-we-will-only-accept-payments-in-/articleshow/124894077.cms,"Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security



Why this new rule

Executive Order 14247, Modernizing Payments to and from America’s Bank Account





US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)’s major update for visa applications comes into effect today. As announced by the US immigration authority, it will only accept electronic payments for paper-filed forms starting October 29. “Payments may be made either via credit card or debit card using Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions, or ACH debit transactions from a U.S. bank account using Form G-1650, Authorization for ACH transactions,” the authority said in a press release.“This new ACH debit payment option is in addition to the existing option of paying by credit card using Form G-1450, giving individuals multiple options to pay required fees,” it added.Until October 28, 2025, USCIS accepted paper check and money order payments in addition to credit and debit payments. The new rules mean that from today, it will no longer accept paper checks and money order payments.For forms filed online, USCIS says it “continues to accept online payments for forms filed online,” adding “benefit requestors and accredited representatives filing online have access to helpful instructions and tips on completing their forms.”In its release, USCIS said that the move aligns with Trump administration’s, which is aimed at reducing the time and manpower required to process checks and money orders, as well as reducing the risks of fraud, lost payments, and theft.The executive order explains that “the continued use of paper-based payments…imposes unnecessary costs; delays; and risks of fraud, lost payments, theft, and inefficiencies”. “This order promotes operational efficiency by mandating the transition to electronic payments for all Federal disbursements and receipts by digitizing payments to the extent permissible under applicable law,” it stated.Explaining USCIS’s new rule, Spokesman Matthew Tragesser said “Modernizing financial transactions to and from the federal government is a priority for the Trump administration. Over 90% of our payments come from checks and money orders, causing processing delays and increasing the risk of fraud and lost payments. This is a no-brainer move.”","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)’s major update for visa applications comes into effect today.

How hackers used ChatGPT to create fake ID cards



Apple Watch Ultra 3, Series 11 & SE 3 – Which One Should You Buy?





A suspected North Korean hacking group has used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card, a report claims. According to cybersecurity researchers, these fake IDs was reportedly used to make a phishing attempt more credible by linking to malware that could extract data from the recipient's device. The cyber-espionage unit, which researchers have dubbed Kimsuky, is suspected of being sponsored by North Korea and has been linked to other spying efforts against South Korean targets. The US Department of Homeland Security previously stated that Kimsuky is likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence-gathering mission. The details were published in a report by the South Korean cybersecurity firm Genians.During their investigation into forged identification documents, Genians researchers tested ChatGPT. While the system initially refused to generate a government ID (which is illegal under South Korean law) however, adjusting the prompt allowed the restriction to be bypassed.Mun Chong-hyun, director at Genians said that the broader trend shows how attackers are turning to AI for tasks such as planning attacks, developing malware, creating hacking tools, and impersonating recruiters.In July, cybersecurity firm Genians shared its latest findings on signs of suspected North Korean operatives using AI in intelligence-gathering.Later on, in August, Anthropic reported that North Korean hackers had leveraged its Claude Code tool to secure remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies. The AI system assisted them in crafting fake identities, passing coding tests, and even delivering technical work once hired.Earlier, in February, the company said it had banned accounts linked to North Korea that were using its service to generate fraudulent resumes, cover letters, and social media content to support recruitment schemes.Recent phishing attempts targeted South Korean journalists, researchers, and human rights activists focusing on North Korea. Emails appeared to come from an address ending in .mli.kr, mimicking a South Korean military domain. The number of victims remains unclear.US officials have long accused North Korea of running cyber operations, cryptocurrency theft, and IT contracting schemes to collect intelligence and generate revenue. Washington alleges that the funds support Pyongyang’s efforts to evade sanctions and advance its nuclear weapons program.","Hackers used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?





China’s market regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), has announced that a preliminary probe has found US chip giant Nvidia in violation of the country’s anti-monopoly law. The regulator, which stated that its investigation will continue, did not specify the details of how Nvidia allegedly breached the law.According to a report by CNBC, the investigation is linked to Nvidia’s 2020 acquisition of Mellanox, an Israeli technology company that creates network solutions for data centers and servers. Although China had approved the deal at the time, it was done so with certain conditions, which the SAMR’s preliminary finding now suggests have been violated.Notably, China is one of the biggest markets for Nvidia, after the US.This announcement from the SAMR has the potential to complicate trade talks between Chinese and US officials that began on Sunday (September 14) in Madrid, Spain. Tensions between the two nations have been on the rise in the technology sector, report said, adding that just two days prior to this new finding, China launched two separate probes into semiconductors: an anti-dumping investigation into certain chips imported from the US and an anti-discrimination scrutiny of US restrictions on China’s chip industry.Nvidia has been at the centre of this situation in recent months. Earlier this year, the company’s H20 product, a chip specifically designed to comply with US export restrictions, was blocked from being sent to China.However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly supported that American firms be allowed to sell to China, citing the local artificial intelligence market's potential to reach $50 billion in the next two to three years. Huang has argued that if American companies are not present, domestic players like Huawei will fill the void.That lobbying appeared to have worked, as last month, Nvidia cut a deal with Washington that would allow it to resume chip sales to China in exchange for giving up 15% of that revenue to the US government.","China’s market regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), has announced that a preliminary probe has found US chip giant Nvidia in violation of the country's anti-monopoly law.

US President Donald Trump has recently threatened to imposetariffs on countries that implement digital taxes. This decision came just days after a private meeting with Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Meta Platforms . Citing sources familiar with the meeting, a report by Bloomberg stated that Zuckerberg raised concerns about these digital service taxes , which are levied on the revenue tech companies generate from users in a specific country. Following the discussion, Trump stated that he was putting all countries with such taxes “on notice” and that the US will impose “substantial” tariffs and export restrictions on US semiconductors unless “these discriminatory actions are removed.”According to Trump, digital taxes will harm US technology companies while givingHe warned that unless thesethe US would impose tariffs and export restrictions on semiconductors. In a recent post shared on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump wrote:In a statement to Bloomberg, Meta confirmed the meeting between Trump and Zuckerberg. A company spokesperson said:Trump’s recent comments have reignited tensions over digital services taxes imposed by several US trading partners, a dispute that predates his latest meeting with Zuckerberg.Washington has long argued that such taxes, which may be levied by countries including France, Italy, Austria, Spain, and the UK, disproportionately target American tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Since Trump’s return to office, Zuckerberg has worked to strengthen his relationship with the president, who once labelled him a “criminal.” Efforts have included changing Meta’s moderation and diversity policies, contributing $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, and making repeated visits to the White House and Mar-a-Lago.Zuckerberg has also expanded his Washington footprint by purchasing homes near the vice president’s residence and bringing Trump allies into Meta’s leadership. Their improved ties have led to frequent discussions on topics ranging from artificial intelligence to European tech regulations.","US President Donald Trump has recently threatened to imposetariffs on countries that implement digital taxes.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk ’s teen prodigy Kairan Quazi is trading rockets for trading algorithms, leaving SpaceX after two years to join quantitative trading giant Citadel Securities as a developer in New York City. ""I felt ready to take on new challenges and expand my skill set into a different high-performance environment,"" the 16-year-old told Business Insider in an exclusive interview.Kairan Quazi, who became the youngest graduate of Santa Clara University before joining SpaceX's Starlink division at age 14, will start this week at Citadel Securities, one of the world's premier market making firm. The move represents a significant coup for the financial industry as it competes with AI labs and big tech companies for top engineering talent.Despite receiving offers from leading AI laboratories and major technology companies, Kairan Quazi selected Citadel Securities for its unique combination of intellectual challenge and rapid feedback loops. At SpaceX, he worked on production-critical systems, designing software that determines where Starlink satellites target their beams to ensure reliable internet connections for millions of customers.""Quant finance offers a pretty rare combination: the complexity and intellectual challenge that AI research also provides, but with a much faster pace,"" Kairan Quazi told Business Insider.

How Flipkart became eligible for the refund



Apple AirPods Pro 3: Smarter, Fitter & Louder





The Karnataka High Court has ordered the state's commercial taxes department to refund ₹16.1 crore in cash to e-commerce platform Flipkart . The amount represents 70% of a pre-deposit the company made in response to a tax demand. Justice S.R. Krishna Kumar also directed the department to pay applicable interest on the total deposit of Rs 23 crore. The case dates back to reassessment orders from 2016-17, under which the department classified mobile phone chargers as ""unscheduled commodities"" and imposed a higher tax rate, resulting in a demand of Rs 23 crore from the Walmart-backed e-tailer. Flipkart challenged the demand and made a pre-deposit, paying a portion in cash and the remaining Rs 16.1 crore using input tax credit (ITC) from its electronic credit ledger (ECL).The department refunded the cash portion but withheld the amount paid via ITC, arguing that a cash refund was not applicable. The High Court rejected this argument, ruling that all refundable amounts must be paid in cash, regardless of the original payment method. The court further clarified that a charger sold with a mobile phone is a part of a single package and cannot be taxed differently.Flipkart challenged the orders before the joint commissioner of commercial taxes (appeals), but the case was dismissed in 2017.The company then deposited 30% of the total demand, which was Rs 6.9 crore, in cash as a pre-deposit.Later, it appealed to the Karnataka Appellate Tribunal (KAT), Bengaluru, in July 2019, and deposited the remaining 70% (which was Rs 16.1 crore) using ITC from its ECL. The department accepted this.In March 2022, KAT ruled in Flipkart’s favour, and in 2023, the high court dismissed the department’s revision petitions, thereby affirming the order.This made Flipkart eligible for a full refund of its pre-deposits. However, the department refunded only the 30% cash amount and withheld the Rs 16.1 crore ITC portion, leading Flipkart to seek relief from the high court.",The Karnataka High Court has ordered the state's commercial taxes department to refund Flipkart in cash.

Microsoft has introduced new Xbox controller functionality for Windows 11, allowing users to access the Task View switcher with a long press of the Xbox button, streamlining navigation between apps and games on gaming PCs.The update, currently being tested with Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel, changes how the Xbox button operates on controllers connected to Windows 11 systems. Users can now long press the Xbox button to open Task View, Microsoft's built-in app and window switcher. The traditional controller shutdown function remains accessible by pressing and holding the Xbox button for an extended period.This change aligns Xbox controllers with Microsoft's broader strategy for handheld gaming PCs running Windows 11. The upcoming Xbox Ally devices will feature similar functionality, with the Xbox button opening a handheld-optimized task switcher designed specifically for portable gaming devices. Microsoft has enhanced the task switcher interface for handhelds with new animations, though it remains unclear whether these visual improvements will extend to desktop gaming PCs.The Xbox button's single-press function remains unchanged, continuing to open the Game Bar interface where users can access gaming widgets, performance metrics, and other gaming-related features.This dual-functionality approach provides gamers with quick access to both system-level navigation and gaming-specific tools.Microsoft began testing these changes through the Windows Insider Program's Dev Channel in September 2025. The update is expected to roll out to all Windows 11 users in the coming months as part of Microsoft's ongoing efforts to improve the gaming experience on Windows 11 systems.","The update is currently being tested with Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel.

Pope Leo on Elon Musk’s $1 trillion pay package proposal





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased nearly $1 billion worth of EV maker’s shares, reports Bloomberg citing a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As per the filing, the tech billionaire bought the stock indirectly through a trust on September 12. This marked Musk’s first open-market purchase of the stock since February 2020, with about 2.57 million shares bought. After the development, the company’s shares increased by around 7.3% before the start of regular trading.Notably, the stock purchases coincided with Tesla’s board of directors chairman Robyn Denholm defended Musk’s $1 trillion pay package saying the compensation should depend on his ability to achieve ‘seemingly impossible goals.’Last month, the Tesla board proposed a $1 trillion compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk. The newly proposed award is roughly 18 times the size of the 2018 pay package.In a filing with the US SEC, the company said that “traditional compensation packages granted to executives at other companies were determined to not be appropriate for designing Mr. Musk’s incentive compensation.”Notably, the new pay package comes with a condition – 10 million active FSD subscriptions for Tesla and 1 million Tesla robotaxis on the road.FSD, as explained in the SEC filing “means an advanced driving system, regardless of the marketing name used, that is capable of performing transportation tasks that provide autonomous or similar functionality under specified driving conditions”.In a recent interview published by Crux last week, Pope Leo said such outsized compensation highlights the widening gap between workers and corporate executives.“Yesterday the news that Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world. What does that mean and what's that about?” Pope Leo said. “The Chicago-born linked Musk’s pay deal to growing polarization in both society and the Catholic Church. “CEOs that 60 years ago might have been making four to six times more than what the workers are receiving … 600 times more (now),” he said.

In a recent interview with The New York Times, at Tesla’s engineering headquarters in California, Denholm said that Musk's compensation should depend on his ability to achieve ""seemingly impossible goals.

"Sam Altman predicts jobs that AI can never take over, and jobs that AI could replace very soon",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-predicts-jobs-that-ai-can-never-take-over-and-jobs-that-ai-could-replace-very-soon/articleshow/123895677.cms,"Sam Altman on customer support jobs and programming roles

Nursing and empathy-driven roles stay safe



A world adapting to AI





Artificial intelligence is reshaping the world of work at a rapid pace, raising both excitement and anxiety about the future of jobs. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently outlined which professions are most vulnerable to AI-driven automation and which remain secure due to their uniquely human qualities. Speaking on The Tucker Carlson Show, Altman predicted that many phone and computer-based customer support jobs could soon be handled by AI, while roles requiring empathy, such as nursing, are far less likely to be replaced. However, the fate of software engineers and programmers remains uncertain, as AI boosts productivity but could also shift job demand in unpredictable directions.Altman expressed confidence that routine customer support roles, particularly those handled over phones and computers, will be among the first to be replaced by AI. He argued that automation can deliver faster, more consistent responses than human workers, making these jobs highly vulnerable. This comes despite a 2025 survey showing that 81% of customers still prefer live human support, a preference that may shift as AI tools improve.Software engineering and coding jobs, Altman explained, face a more complex outlook. On one hand, AI tools now allow even non-programmers to build websites, apps, or games with simple prompts.On the other, studies suggest that AI can sometimes slow down experienced developers. While demand for software continues to grow, it remains unclear whether the net effect will be more programming jobs or fewer in the next decade.Unlike technical roles, Altman pointed to nursing as an example of a profession that AI cannot easily replace. He stressed that patients rely on the deep human connection, empathy, and care that nurses provide, qualities that even the most advanced AI struggles to replicate. Similar views have been echoed by DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, who argued that while AI may assist doctors, the humanistic aspect of nursing makes it irreplaceable.Altman’s remarks underline the growing need for workers and industries to adapt as AI technologies spread. Jobs requiring creativity, judgment, and human empathy are likely to remain secure, while predictable and routine tasks face increasing automation risk. The future of work, he suggested, will not be about resisting AI but about understanding where it adds value, and where only humans can excel. For many, this means embracing lifelong learning and reskilling as part of career growth. The balance between human strengths and AI efficiency may ultimately define the workplace of tomorrow.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman outlines which professions are most vulnerable to AI- driven automation and which remain secure due to their uniquely human qualities.

The problem: Why AI can’t always be trusted



The Solution: Engineering determinism



What’s sext for Thinking Machines Lab







Mira Murati’s AI startup Thinking Labs has launched its research initiative which is aimed at solving one of AI’s most persistent problems: nondeterminism in large language models (LLMs). In a blog post titled “Defeating Nondeterminism in LLM Inference”, the researchers at the lab argue that the AI models should behave in a particular manner. The researchers believe that the AI models should work predictably and should generate the same output every time the same input is given.In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the lab signalled towards its commitment in making AI models deterministic and reproducible.As per Thinking Machine Lab’s researchers the LLM models today including ChatGPT and Gemini, give different answers to the same question — even when randomness is disabled. Thinking Machines believe that this inconsistency is not just to floating-point arithmetic or concurrency, but to a deeper issue: lack of batch invariance. In a layman’s term, the output of a model can change depending on how many requests are processed at once.The lab suggests a redesigning of GPU kernels which will make sure batch-invariant behaviour. This means that the result of a single query will not be affected by other simultaneous queries. This change could revolutionise enterprise AI, where consistency plays an important role, scientific research which needs reproducibility and model fine tuning where stable outputs help in improving training.Lead researcher Horace He stresses on the fact that widely used interface engines such as vLLM and SGLang also face the same issue and solving this problem need rethinking how matrix multiplications and attention mechanisms are implemented at the hardware level.Mira Murati’s startup is backed by billion dollar funding and is working on creating tools to make deterministic AI the new standard. The upcoming releases of the company promise to help developers, researchers, and enterprises deploy models that behave consistently — regardless of server load or batch size.As Murati’s team puts it: “Reproducibility is a bedrock of scientific progress… and it’s time AI lived up to that standard.”","Mira Murati’s AI startup Thinking Labs has launched its research initiative which is aimed at solving one of AI's most persistent problems.

Google, Amazon also fired employees protesting the companies’ alleged ties to Israel





Microsoft President Brad Smith delivered a blunt message to employees during an internal meeting last week: workers who occupied his office during Gaza-related protests deserved to lose their jobs. ""Let me say this, anybody who is smart enough to get a job at Microsoft is smart enough to know that you don't get to storm in and break into buildings and occupy other people's offices and keep your job at Microsoft,"" Smith said, according to Business Insider.The Redmond giant fired four employees in August after protesters broke into and occupied Smith's office, participating in a sit-in that called for Microsoft to cut ties with the Israeli military amid the Gaza conflict. The fired employees included Riki Fameli, a Microsoft software engineer who worked on Azure Storage.Smith emphasised that the protesters ""didn't just protest"" but trespassed on private property and barricaded themselves with Microsoft furniture. He defended the company's decision during the meeting, saying the behavior crossed clear boundaries beyond legitimate workplace dissent.During the same meeting, Smith announced that Microsoft hired law firm Covington & Burling to investigate allegations that its technology was used for mass surveillance of Palestinians.The review stems from an August Guardian report claiming an Israeli Defense Forces unit relied on Microsoft's Azure cloud for expansive Palestinian surveillance.""That story provided new information to those of us at Microsoft, information that we did not have before,"" Smith told employees. He insisted the company prohibits customers from using its services for mass surveillance of civilians and is developing new processes for employees to report suspected technology misuse.Microsoft isn’t the only company to take strict action against those protesting the big tech’s ties to Israel. Google fired 28 employees in May 2024 following demonstrations against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion cloud computing contract with Israel's government. Amazon suspended Palestinian engineer Ahmed Shahrour after he criticized the company's Israeli business ties through internal communications.Fameli, the fired Microsoft engineer, criticized Smith's narrow definition of acceptable protest, telling Business Insider that ""proper channels are dead ends"" for employee concerns about company policies.","Microsoft fired four employees in August after protesters broke into and occupied President Brad Smith's office.

The Trump administration is reportedly looking to extend the September 17 deadline for China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US assets, report Reuters citing sources familiar with the matter. If confirmed, this will be the fourth extension granted by President Donald Trump since a law gave ByteDance until January 2025 to divest or shut down the short-video app, which has 170 million users in the US.Trump has previously said that he has U.S. buyers lined up for TikTok, but on Sunday he gave mixed signals about its future. “""I may or may not, we're negotiating TikTok right now. We may let it die, or we may, I don't know, it depends, up to China,” he told reporters last month. ""It doesn't matter too much. I'd like to do it for the kids.""Critics in Washington fear TikTok could be used by Beijing to spy on or pressure Americans, but Trump has repeatedly said he wants to keep the app alive.Efforts to strike a deal have moved slowly.

Use a custom prompt for lifelike results





Google’s latest AI tool, Nano Banana, has taken social media by storm, with millions of users experimenting with toy-like 3D figurines of themselves, friends, and even celebrities. For those unaware, Google announced Nano Banana in August this year. The model is the nickname for Gemini 2.5 Flash Image and can be used to instantly transform any photo into a lifelike 3D figure, capturing everything from facial expressions and clothing to background textures with striking detail. While the results can be stunning, many first-time users may face challenges. Here are some practical tips for non-experts to get the best out of Google’s Nano Banana.Instead of typing just “my photo as a superhero,” add details such as “in a futuristic city, wearing a metallic suit, cinematic lighting.” The more context you provide, the more accurately Nano Banana tool will generate your image.Uploading a clean, well-lit photo of yourself or your subject helps the AI lock on to facial features. Avoid blurry or cluttered photos, as the tool can pick up unwanted details.Nano Banana handles different styles — from playful toy figurines to anime or retro looks.Try phrases like “in Pixar style,” “in Japanese woodblock art style,” or “as a 90s action figure” to see which fits best.Adding verbs such as “standing with folded arms,” or “holding a surfboard” can make results more dynamic and prevent awkward poses.Don’t settle for the first attempt. Running the same prompt a few times can give very different outcomes. Small tweaks — like adding “bright background” or “soft shadows” — can fix flaws quickly.For millions diving into the Nano Banana craze, these small adjustments can turn clumsy AI renders into share-worthy creations. As one user joked online: “It’s like teaching a banana to sculpt — patience and the right words make all the difference.”Here’s a simple step-by-step guide:","Google’s latest AI tool, Nano Banana, has taken social media by storm.

Tesla shareholder pushes for action

How other tech companies spend on CEO's security





Elon Musk has said his security needs to be “enhanced” after the assassination of Trump’s aide and far-right activist Charlie Kirk raised concerns about threats to high-profile figures. The Tesla CEO responded to a shareholder’s call for more protection, highlighting that the company spent $3.3 million on his security from January 2024 to February 2025. While that marks an increase from the $2.9 million spent the previous year, it remains far below what other tech companies spend on their leaders.For those unaware, Charlie Kirk was a far-right political activist and an aide to Donald Trump. He co-founded the organization Turning Point USA, a nonprofit organization he started in 2012 when he was just 18 years old.Tesla investor Alexandra Merz, known on social media as TeslaBoomerMama, urged the company’s board to boost Musk’s security budget, posting a chart of the current spending.“Tesla and the Board, can you please increase this drastically? We wrote you a shareholder letter more than a year ago,” Merz wrote on X.Elon Musk replied directly: “Definitely need to enhance security.”Reports say Musk uses Gavin de Becker and Associates for personal protection and has also set up his own firm, Foundation Security.Some of the costs are split across his businesses, including Tesla and SpaceX.Tesla’s $3.3 million annual spending on Musk’s protection is dwarfed by Meta’s $23.4 million for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Apple spends about $820,000 each year on Tim Cook’s security, while Amazon spends $1.6 million to protect founder Jeff Bezos.Despite the smaller budget, Musk has faced rising threats, particularly linked to his political views. A Teslarati report noted that threats against him spiked on platforms such as Reddit and Bluesky following Kirk’s killing.","Tesla spent $3.3 million on Musk's security from January 2024 to February 2025.

OnePlus Nord Buds 3r Review: Affordable TWS With Long Battery Life





The chairperson of Tesla's board of directors, Robyn Denholm, has defended the new multibillion-dollar compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk. The plan, which could be the largest in corporate history, was unveiled in a regulatory filing last week. In a recent interview with The New York Times, at Tesla’s engineering headquarters in California, Denholm said that Musk's compensation should depend on his ability to achieve ""seemingly impossible goals."" She stated that Musk is capable of delivering world-changing technology if he is driven by these ambitious targets, even as the company faces a drop in sales and profits.“Putting together any compensation plan, you need to look at what motivates the individual that you’re trying to motivate. And for Elon, it’s doing things that no one else has done before,” Denholm said when asked about Musk’s proposed pay package.Denholm has been leading a campaign to secure investor approval for Musk’s compensation package, which will be worth nearly $1 trillion if the goals are met. She argued that his pay cannot be compared to that of other executives due to his “unique characteristics.” However, concerns remain given Tesla’s recent sales decline, profit drop, and the underperformance of the Cybertruck.She said the focus on the package’s value is misplaced, as Musk is more interested in the voting power than the wealth, even though he must stay at Tesla for years to cash in the shares.“It’s actually about the voting influence in the company for the next generation of growth that he sees. I think it’s a little bit weird talking about the dollars when it’s actually the voting influence,” Denholm explained.Some investors, including New Mexico’s state treasurer Laura Montoya, have criticised Tesla’s proposed trillion-dollar pay package for Musk, calling it unjustifiable given his role in the company’s struggles.“This plan is about future performance. It’s not about past performance. He gets nothing if he doesn’t perform against the goals,” Denholm said, responding to the criticism.However, for Musk to get the payout, Tesla would need to achieve significant milestones like one million robotaxis, one million robots, a 24-times profit jump, and a stock value of $8.5 trillion. But the car sales targets seem easier, even as Tesla risks falling behind competitors like BYD, Geely, and Volkswagen.Denholm even rejected claims that cars are no longer Tesla’s main business, despite its growing battery sales. Without discussing upcoming products in detail, she said: “There is still a lot of ambition in the vehicle space.”She also revealed that Musk has shifted focus from cars to a vision of “sustainable abundance” with self-driving taxis and humanoid robots, a plan that Tesla’s board supports as well.“It really is using technology to create a world where anything is able to be produced, goods and services are able to be produced in abundance,” Denholm added.","Chairperson of Tesla's board of directors, Robyn Denholm, has defended the new multibillion-dollar compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk.

"‘Closing a chapter, opening a New One’: Kavin Mittal confirms global shutdown of Hike",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/closing-a-chapter-opening-a-new-one-kavin-mittal-confirms-global-shutdown-of-hike/articleshow/123870695.cms,"Read Kavin Bharti Mittal’s complete LinkedIn post here:



After regrouping with our investors and the team, I’ve made the difficult decision to wind down Hike completely.

Our US business, launched just nine months ago, is off to a strong start. But after the

India ban, scaling globally would require a full recap, a reset that is not the best use of capital or time.

The Big Question → We could raise the capital, but the real question is: is it worth it? Is this a climb worth pivoting for? For the first time in 13 years, my answer is no. Not for me, not for my team, and not for our investors. Why?

RMG was never the destination. It was a way to test unit economics and traction in India while working toward a bigger vision. In hindsight, starting in India locked us into the model and regulatory headwinds, turning a temporary path into a more permanent one. The Gaming Nation vision is real, but we may be too early. The world will eventually move toward a Nation-type model in gaming and Web3 - Company 2.0. But crypto regulation is still developing globally, and we don’t want to repeat India, where we hoped for clarity that never came. And most importantly, if doing a full reset, is this where I’d put my own capital and energy today? For the first time, the answer is no. The world has changed in the last decade - and so have I. There are more important problems to solve and bigger opportunities to deploy brilliant talent and capital.

Looking Back & Lessons

The last 13 years have been immense. Hike Messenger reached 40M MAUs and became the 35th most loved consumer brand in India at its peak. With Rush, we built a new kind of Casual PvP gaming platform and scaled it to 10M users and $500M+ in gross revenue ( CEA ) in just 4 years.

Our execution was super, but we could never quite make it stick. There are clear lessons to carry forward, especially on market selection:

Be careful with winner-take-all markets. To win, you need to go global. Don’t build for today’s constraints. Build on the spring/summer of new technologies. Regulatory clarity matters. Risk is fine; uncertainty is not.

More importantly momentum is everything. And build what your heart and mind are deeply excited about. It’s the conviction that carries you through.

This is both a disappointment and a hard outcome. But I choose to look on the bright side: the learnings are invaluable, and my conviction for what’s next is even stronger.

To everyone who has been part of this journey - our users, our team, our investors, and our community - thank you. As a CEO, you’re only as strong as your team, and I want to give a special shout-out to mine - an incredible group of people who gave this everything

.

This chapter ends, but the climb continues.

Looking Forward

I’ve always thrived at building at the forefront of technology. Over the last decade, in the little time I had to explore outside of Hike, I kept returning to the same three frontiers. And now, they feel like the great canvases for decades to come →

AI → For the first time, technology has both intelligence and memory. Imagine products that don’t just serve us functionally but truly know us - systems that adapt, grow, and partner with us. As a UX-first builder, this is the most exciting time to be building software. Breakthroughs in Energy → Human progress has always been bound by energy. The world’s demand for energy is rising faster than ever. Breakthrough approaches, especially in physics are needed to power the future. The last century gave us mastery of fine matters and electricity, the next will move deeper, at the intersection of science and spirituality - into what yogis call divine magnetism and physicists call the quantum world or electromagnetism. From there will come technologies that today feel impossible to imagine. Mastery of the Self → As AI takes on more of our work, a deeper question will rise: what now defines us? When productivity is no longer the measure of worth, humanity will turn inward. Man’s evolution will move from the intellect to intuitive attunement - a deeper connection with ourselves and the divine (which we’ll realise are one and the same). The tools, spaces, and guides that help us explore this inner world will be as transformative as any innovation in the outer one - unlocking the next level of humanity’s potential

If you put these together, a picture emerges: → the cost of intelligence trending to zero → the cost of energy trending to zero → and the cost of willpower falling lower and lower.

Just imagine a future where willpower is infinite, energy is abundant, and intelligence is at our fingertips.

This is the future I will help build — and it’s where I’ll be contributing in the decades to come. This new chapter will look very different from the last one

A one-of-a-kind Apple-1 computer, one of the first machines made by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, sold for a staggering $375,000 (Rs 3,21,09,270) at an auction recently. The historic piece of computing machinery was a part of the Steve Jobs and the Apple Revolution Auction, which was organized by RR Auction. Of a set of Apple memorabilia that was rare, the Apple-1 computer took center stage.This specific Apple-1 machine, the #91 in the authorized Apple-1 registry, was graded 8.0/10 for condition. It still had its original integrated circuits, labeled in plain sight, and had been meticulously refurbished to full working order by vintage Apple specialist Corey Cohen. In addition to the computer, the winning user also got an original user's manual, which contained handwritten notes citing Apple's co-founders.Bobby Livingston, Executive Vice President with RR Auction, described why possessing such a machine is valuable: ""Possessing an Apple-1 is more than having a computer; it's part of history—a direct link to the innovative genius of Jobs, Wozniak, and the innovative group that reshaped the technological landscape.""The Apple-1 was the first product of Apple Computer Company, introduced in 1976. It cost $666.66 then, and only around 200 units were hand-assembled, and around 175 were sold to early computer enthusiasts and hobbyists. Contrary to most computers then, which needed to be extensively assembled by the user, the Apple-1 was sold as a completely assembled circuit board. Nevertheless, users had to supply their own keyboard, monitor, and power supply. Most of them even built wooden or plexiglass enclosures to store their Apple-1 units.Equipped with a MOS MCS6502 processor, the Apple-1 contained 4KB of RAM that could be extended to 8KB. The Apple-1 stored data in cassette tapes and did not possess many of the features we consider standard today, including lowercase letters and a delete key. Nonetheless, the Apple-1 represented a revolutionary step forward in the realm of personal computing and assisted in paving the way for future technology.Besides, the sale included other prized Apple-related items that attracted good prices:Auctions of some early Macintosh computers' prototypes and business cards of Steve Jobs were also made.Aside from the auction, Apple remains firmly set at the forefront of the tech world. Apple announced separately that the annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) will be held on June 9 to 13. The online conference will feature Apple's newest developments in technology and software.“We’re excited to mark another incredible year of WWDC with our global developer community,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s Vice President of Worldwide Developer Relations. Developers and students will also have the opportunity to attend a special event at Apple Park on June 9.From its pioneering first product, the Apple-1, to its ongoing innovations, Apple is a dominant force in determining the direction of the technological world. Selling these scarce Apple pieces is a validation of the company's storied past and the lasting impact of its creators.","One-of-a-kind Apple-1 computer, one of the first machines made by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, sold for a staggering $375,000 (Rs 3,21,09,270) at an auction recently.

Gates shares two professions that will be most impacted by AI

Bill Gates predicts AI could lead to a two-day workweek within a decade, citing rapid automation. The Microsoft co-founder suggested AI's advancement will significantly reduce the need for human labour, highlighting potential AI impacts on professions like medicine and education, envisioning widespread access to AI-driven services.“And it's [AI technology] kind of profound because it solves all these specific problems, like we don't have enough doctors or mental-health professionals but it brings with it kind of so much change,” Gates said on “The Tonight Show” aired in February but has gone viral recently.“You know, what will jobs be like? Should we, you know, just work like 2 or 3 days a week? So I love the way it'll drive innovation forward, but I think it's a little bit unknown,” he added.Gates previously hinted at a significant reduction in working hours. In 2023, during the nascent stages of ChatGPT's development, he suggested that society might ""eventually"" transition to a scenario where a three-day work week becomes the norm.Regarding the specific professions likely to be most impacted by AI's encroachment into the workplace, Gates acknowledged that certain sectors will undergo more profound transformations than others. In his conversation, he specifically identified doctors and teachers as two domains poised for significant change, albeit with the potential for substantial societal benefits.“With AI's continued development over the next decade, intelligence will become freely available and commonplace, providing access to excellent medical advice and exceptional tutoring,” Gates explained.While he acknowledged that certain human-centric activities, such as professional baseball, will likely remain within the human domain, he envisions a future where AI handles virtually all other tasks.“There will be select activities that we reserve for ourselves, but in terms of manufacturing, logistics, and food production—over time, those will essentially become solved problems,” Gates concluded","Gates predicts AI could lead to a two-day workweek within a decade, citing rapid automation.

Elon Musk is prioritising DOGE over Tesla’s needs

New York City’s pension funds made similar accusations at Tesla’s 2024 annual meeting

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander , who advises the city’s five pension funds, has accused Tesla Inc of misleading shareholders about CEO Elon Musk ’s commitment to the company. According to Bloomberg, Lander claimed that Tesla misrepresented Musk’s involvement, asserting that he is devoting significant time to Tesla despite his role leading President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which focuses on reducing federal spending.Lander highlighted the impact of Musk’s divided attention, noting that Tesla’s stock has dropped nearly 40% since Musk took the helm at DOGE, resulting in over $300 million in losses for New York City’s $285 billion pension funds in less than three months. “Tesla shareholders don’t have a full-time CEO paying attention to the company and their interests,” Lander stated during a news conference, as quoted by Bloomberg. Lander, one of about a dozen Democrats vying for New York City mayor, argued that Musk’s focus on DOGE has hurt Tesla’s performance and alienated customers, contributing to a steep decline in sales.Tesla, however, has maintained a different narrative. In a December 2024 SEC filing cited by Bloomberg, the company described itself as “highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk,” emphasizing that he spends “significant time with Tesla.” Lander challenged this, accusing Musk of prioritizing DOGE over Tesla’s needs.In response, Lander urged the New York City Law Department, which represents the pension funds legally, to support a shareholder lawsuit against Tesla . Lander has sent a letter to Muriel Goode-Trufant, the city’s managing attorney, via a public records request. In it, Lander reportedly wrote, “Given the New York City pension systems’ longstanding expression of concerns about corporate governance and the need for a full-time CEO, and Tesla’s misrepresentations regarding Musk’s role at DOGE, we are well-placed to commence and lead this potential litigation.”This isn’t the first time New York City’s pension funds have targeted Tesla’s governance. At Tesla’s 2024 annual meeting, the city’s pensions, alongside seven other investors, pushed shareholders to reject Musk’s $47 billion compensation package and oppose the reelection of Musk’s brother Kimbal Musk and James Murdoch to the board. “Even as Tesla’s performance is floundering, the board has yet to ensure that Tesla has a full-time CEO who is adequately focused on the long-term sustainable success of our company,” Lander wrote in an SEC filing at the time.If the Law Department moves forward with litigation, the pension funds could pursue financial damages and governance reforms, outcomes Lander views as preferable to divestment, which would cement the funds’ losses. Tesla has faced multiple shareholder lawsuits recently, ranging from challenges to Musk’s compensation and his 2022 Twitter acquisition to issues like fatal Autopilot-related crashes and allegations of workplace racism.","New York City Comptroller Brad Lander has accused Tesla Inc of misleading shareholders about CEO Elon Musk ’s commitment to the company.

Elon Musk to Wisconsin voters: Mobilize everywhere like crazy

Donald Trump on Wisconsin elections

What happens if Crawford or Schimel win

On April 1, 2025, Wisconsin is holding a pivotal Supreme Court election that captured national attention, largely due to the unprecedented involvement of Elon Musk , the world’s richest man and a key political influencer. Musk poured millions of dollars into the race, backing conservative candidate Brad Schimel against liberal contender Susan Crawford. This election, which determined the ideological balance of the court, wasn’t just a local affair -- it holds significant implications for Musk’s business interests, political ambitions, and broader influence. Here are the Big reasons that this election matter to him.“Everybody’s got to mobilize everywhere like crazy for the next 48 hours,” said Musk, who started the event wearing a cheesehead that he threw into the crowd. “I think this will be important for the future of civilization. It’s that significant.”The first major election in the country since November is seen as a litmus test of how voters feel about Trump’s first months back in office and the role played by Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has torn through federal agencies and laid off thousands of workers. The race also will test Musk’s influence on local races after he spent more than a quarter-billion dollars to aid Trump’s 2024 campaign. Musk traveled to Wisconsin on Sunday to make a pitch for Schimel and personally hand out $1 million checks to two voters.Elon Musk has publicly emphasized the election’s potential impact on congressional redistricting as a key motivator for his involvement. During a livestream with Schimel and Senator Ron Johnson on March 22, 2025, Musk argued that a liberal court majority could redraw Wisconsin’s congressional districts, potentially costing Republicans two seats in the U.S. House. With the House majority already razor-thin, such a shift could flip control to Democrats, undermining the Trump administration’s agenda, which Musk heavily supports.Wisconsin’s current congressional map favors Republicans, who hold six of eight seats despite the state’s competitive political landscape. The Supreme Court’s liberal majority previously struck down gerrymandered state legislative maps in 2024, and a similar challenge to congressional districts looms. Musk framed this as a “consequential” issue, warning that a Crawford victory could hinder government reforms he’s championing through his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). For Musk, securing a conservative court was about safeguarding Republican power nationally—a priority tied to his alliance with President Donald Trump.The US President Donald Trump hinted as to why the outcome of the Wisconsin race was important. The court can decide election-related laws and settle disputes over future election outcomes. “Wisconsin’s a big state politically, and the Supreme Court has a lot to do with elections in Wisconsin,” he told reporters in the Oval Office. “Winning Wisconsin’s a big deal, so therefore the Supreme Court choice … it’s a big raceWisconsin has a long history of razor-thin presidential votes, but in the last court race two years ago, the liberal candidate won by 11 points. Both sides said they expected a much narrower finish this year. The winner will be elected to a 10-year term replacing retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley.If Crawford wins, the court stands to remain under liberal control until at least 2028, the next time a liberal justice is on the ballot. If Schimel wins, the majority will once again be on the line next year.","Elon Musk poured millions of dollars into the race, backing conservative candidate Brad Schimel against liberal contender Susan Crawford.

Life before Gmail: The inbox woes that Google solved

April 1, 2004: The birth of Gmail

Why people thought Gmail was a ‘joke’

Unprecedented storage : Most email services offered 2MB to 4MB of storage, but Gmail was promising 1GB (1,000MB)—about 500 times more than what competitors provided.

: Most email services offered 2MB to 4MB of storage, but Gmail was promising 1GB (1,000MB)—about 500 times more than what competitors provided. Google’s history of April Fools' jokes : Many assumed this was another elaborate hoax.

: Many assumed this was another elaborate hoax. Innovative features: Gmail introduced threaded conversations, powerful search capabilities, and contextual advertising, which were all revolutionary at the time.

Gmail’s invitation-only launch

Revolutionary features introduced by Gmail

1. Massive Storage (1GB and Beyond)

At a time when other email services were offering a few megabytes of storage, Gmail provided 1GB for free. This meant users no longer had to delete emails to free up space. Over the years, Google continued to increase storage capacity, and today, users get 15GB of free storage, shared across Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Photos.

2. Powerful Search Capabilities

3. Threaded Conversations

Before Gmail, most email services displayed individual messages separately. Gmail introduced ""threaded conversations,"" grouping related emails together in a single conversation. This made it much easier to follow discussions.

4. Spam Filtering

Gmail implemented an advanced spam detection system, which significantly reduced unwanted emails. It used machine learning algorithms to automatically filter out spam messages, improving over time.

5. Ads Based on Email Content

Gmail introduced contextual advertising, displaying relevant ads based on the content of emails. Although this feature was initially controversial, it allowed Google to offer Gmail for free while generating revenue through advertising.

6. Integration with Google Services

Google Drive for file storage

Google Calendar for scheduling events

Google Meet for video calls

Google Chat for messaging

How Gmail changed the email industry

Yahoo Mail, Hotmail (Outlook), and other providers increased their storage limits.

Better spam filtering became a standard feature across all email services.

Search-based email organization and threaded conversations were adopted by other platforms.

April 1st is widely recognized as April Fools' Day , a time when individuals and companies play pranks on unsuspecting people. Over the years, many tech companies have used this occasion to announce fake products, services, or features, often as a lighthearted joke. However, in 2004, Google did something unprecedented—it announced a brand-new email service called Gmail on April 1st.At the time, many assumed it was just another elaborate April Fools' joke by Google. The idea of an email service offering 1GB of free storage—an unheard-of amount at the time—seemed too good to be true. However, Gmail was real, and it went on to revolutionize the way people use email. Today, Gmail is one of the most widely used email services in the world, with over 1.8 billion active users. But how did this incredible story unfold? Let's take a deep dive into the origins of Gmail and how it transformed the email industry.Before Gmail was launched, email services were slow, limited, and often frustrating to use. Most free email providers, such as Yahoo Mail, Hotmail (now Outlook), and AOL Mail, offered only a few megabytes of storage—typically around 2MB to 4MB. Users constantly had to delete old emails to make room for new ones, and email attachments were severely limited in size.Additionally, searching for old emails was cumbersome, as many email services did not have advanced search features. Spam filtering was also poor, leading to cluttered inboxes. The email experience was due for an upgrade, and Google was about to change everything.On April 1, 2004, Google announced the launch of Gmail, a free web-based email service that offered an astonishing 1GB of storage per user. Given the date of the announcement, many people thought it was a prank.Google was already known for pulling April Fools' Day pranks, such as the ""PigeonRank"" hoax, which jokingly claimed that Google's search algorithm was powered by trained pigeons. Because of this reputation, many journalists and users were skeptical about the Gmail announcement.Several factors made people doubt Gmail's legitimacy:However, Google soon confirmed that Gmail was real, and invitations to join the service were sent out to a limited number of users.When Gmail first launched, it was not open to the public. Instead, Google used an invitation-only model, where only a select group of users could create accounts. Those users could then invite others, creating a sense of exclusivity around the service.This invitation-only system made Gmail highly sought after. Some invitations were even sold on eBay for hundreds of dollars. Over time, Google gradually expanded access to Gmail, and by 2007, it was available to the public.When Gmail launched, it introduced several groundbreaking features that set it apart from other email providers:Since Google was already a leader in search technology, it integrated its expertise into Gmail. Instead of organizing emails into folders like other providers, Gmail introduced search-based email organization, allowing users to quickly find emails using keywords.Over the years, Gmail became deeply integrated with other Google services, including:Gmail’s success forced competitors to improve their services. Within a few years of Gmail's launch:Today, Gmail remains one of the most popular email services worldwide, used by individuals, businesses, and organizations.","In 2004, Google announced the launch of Gmail, a free web-based email service.

Tesla takedown protests hitting company image

Investors are anticipating a decline in Tesla's first-quarter vehicle deliveries, as a confluence of factors, including political controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk and softening demand for the company's aging models, weighs heavily on the electric vehicle maker.According to a report by new agency Reuters, despite Musk's promise of renewed growth in 2024, following a year of declining deliveries, Wall Street is bracing for potentially disappointing figures. The company's first-quarter delivery and production numbers, due Wednesday (April 2), will reveal the impact of a refreshed Model Y SUV and recent incentives.Tesla is navigating increased competition, particularly in China and Europe, and facing backlash stemming from Musk's advisory role to the US President on federal spending cuts. This has alienated portions of Tesla's customer base and contributed to an increase in Tesla trade-ins , the report, citing recent data.Analysts predict Tesla's January-March deliveries to hover around 373,000 units, a 3.6% decrease from the same period last year. However, some analysts and investors believe the actual numbers could be significantly lower, potentially falling below 350,000 vehicles, the report added.International protests, including ""Tesla Takedown"" demonstrations in Germany and Finland, have amplified criticism of Musk's influence on US policy. Recent reports indicate Teslas have been set alight in Las Vegas and Tesla stores have seen a spike in vandalism.Recently, the Tesla CEO urged employees to retain their company stock despite a 40% drop in share price this year, during an unannounced all-hands meeting.“There are times when there are rocky moments, a little bit of stormy weather but I'm here to tell you the future is bright and exciting,” Musk told employees.He also acknowledged negative press coverage, saying, “If you read the news, it feels like Armageddon. I can't walk past a TV without seeing a Tesla on fire.”","Tesla's first-quarter delivery and production numbers, due Wednesday (April 2), will reveal the impact of a refreshed Model Y SUV and recent incentives.

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

Otherwise, whip one up with a prompt like “Studio Ghibli-style sunset village, soft colors, detailed” in an AI tool, or sketch it yourself in Procreate.Layer Like a Pro: Split your photo into parts—characters, trees, sky—for animation flexibility. Social media loves those multi-depth shots, and it’s perfect for what’s next.Ghibli’s charm lies in its quiet, heartfelt storytelling, and your animation can capture that—even in a 15-second clip that’s perfect for TikTok’s algorithm.Quick Sketch: Plan a mini-sequence. Maybe your character walks through a glowing forest, or a breeze scatters cherry blossoms. Keep it simple but enchanting—social media thrives on “ooh” moments.Frame Rate Flex: Go for 24 FPS (Ghibli’s cinematic sweet spot). A 10-second viral hit needs 240 frames, but don’t sweat it—software will fill the gaps.To animate Ghibli-style illustrations, you’ll need software that supports frame-by-frame animation, layering, and smooth transitions. Some of the best options include:Adobe After Effects : Ideal for advanced users, offering powerful animation tools and visual effects.Blender: A free, open-source 3D software that allows for detailed animation and rendering.Procreate Dreams: Huge on iPad-toting artists in this trend—hand-draw frames for that authentic Ghibli feel.RunwayML: AI fans love this for interpolating motion between images, cutting down work while keeping it share-worthy.CapCut: Free, fast, and TikTok-friendly for quick edits if you’re new to this.Once you’ve selected your software:Import all your Ghibli-style images into the software.Organize assets by layers (backgrounds, midgrounds, and foregrounds).Group character movements or effects into separate layers for better control.To create smooth animations:Keyframe Animation: Set keyframes at major points to define object positions and movements.Tweening: Fill in the frames between keyframes to achieve smooth transitions.Parallax Effect: Create depth by animating foreground and background layers independently.Studio Ghibli’s charm lies in its attention to environmental details. To replicate this:Add Particle Effects: Animate rain, leaves, or fireflies to create a magical ambiance.Adjust Lighting and Shadows: Use soft, dynamic lighting to evoke different moods.Simulate Camera Movements: Incorporate slow pans, zooms, and tracking shots for a cinematic effect.No Ghibli-inspired animation is complete without a captivating soundtrack.Background Score: Choose soothing, orchestral music that evokes nostalgia and wonder.Ambient Sounds: Add subtle environmental sounds (rustling leaves, chirping birds) for realism.Dialogue and Foley: Sync character speech and sound effects to the animation timeline.After perfecting your animation:Choose the appropriate export settings for your platform.Ensure a high-resolution export (1080p or 4K) for crisp visuals.Test your video for any frame drops or inconsistencies before finalizing.Users must be mindful of copyright restrictions when using AI-generated images, especially for commercial purposes as using copyrighted images as input could raise legal issues.","Studio Ghibli is an esteemed Japanese animation studio known for movies like Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, and Howl's Moving Castle. Their distinctive hand-drawn art is easily recognizable, characterized by soft, muted colors, playful characters, and scenes that look straight out of a story book. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create a short animation video inspired by the iconic Studio Ghibl aesthetic.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119809309,imgsize-32074,width-400,resizemode-4/119809309.jpg"

Facebook’s extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced that the H-1B visa cap of 85,000 for the fiscal year 2026 has been reached. In a press statement, the agency stated, “We have randomly selected enough beneficiaries with properly submitted registrations projected as needed to reach the H-1B cap.” USCIS has also notified all prospective petitioners with selected beneficiaries that they are eligible to file an H-1B cap-subject petition . Petitions for FY 2026, including those qualifying for the advanced degree exemption, can be submitted starting today i.e. April 1, 2025.The H-1B visa cap refers to the annual limit set by the US government on the number of H-1B work visas issued to foreign professionals. The cap, as mentioned above, is currently set at 85,000 visas per fiscal year, which includes:Due to high demand, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) conducts a random lottery to select eligible beneficiaries when the number of applications exceeds the cap. Selected applicants can then proceed with filing an H-1B petition with USCIS.The fiscal year starts on October 1, and petitions can be filed beginning April 1 of the same year.

NSA’s ‘new’ warning to iPhone and Android users: ‘Change this setting on your phones’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nsas-new-warning-to-iphone-and-android-users-change-this-setting-on-your-phones/articleshow/119868405.cms,"Linked Devices and Group Invite Links on Signal

White House says ‘Case Closed’

The National Security Agency (NSA) has offered more insights into the dangers of secure messaging in the workplace, specifically highlighting two features of the Signal app. The latest advisory, reported by Forbes, emphasised that user behaviour, not app vulnerabilities, poses the primary threat. The NSA's warning, often mislabeled as a Signal vulnerability due to a recent incident, actually addresses how simple user errors can compromise security. It urges users to adjust messaging settings.The NSA reportedly talked about Signal’s two key features: Linked Devices and Group Invite Links.The Linked Devices feature allows users to synchronise messages across multiple devices, making communication more seamless. While convenient, it also means that if exploited, a full replica of the account could exist on another device. To protect your privacy, NSA suggests that users regularly review and unlink any unfamiliar devices in their app’s settings to prevent unauthorised access.Group invite links essentially simplify the process of adding new members to a group. However, they also pose a security risk, as they can unintentionally expose sensitive conversations to unintended users - just like it happened with the recent episode in which the National Security Advisor (NSA) Mike Waltz faced backlash after ‘mistakenly’ adding The Atlantic’s editor to a private chat discussing a bombing campaign in Yemen.Signal addresses this concern by allowing users to disable group links under group settings. In contrast, WhatsApp does not offer an option to disable links but provides an admin-only invite restriction, giving group admins more control over who joins.The Trump administration has reportedly moved over the Signal scandal, calling it “case closed”.“As the president has made it very clear, Mike Waltz continues to be an important part of his national security team and this case has been closed here at the White House as far as we are concerned,"" said press secretary Karoline Leavitt.“There have been steps made to ensure that something like that can obviously never happen again, and we're moving forward,” she added.","Signal's Linked Devices feature allows users to synchronise messages across multiple devices.

They have some brilliant ideas, they want to change the world, and that's where I get excited to work closely with them.”The CEO said that his primary focus will be on recruiting and keeping engineers. “We lost quite a bit of talent. That's my top priority, to recruit some of the best talent in the industry to come back and then to rejoin or join Intel,” Tan said.Tan joined Intel earlier this month.

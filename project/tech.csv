Elon Musk's contentious relationship with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has escalated with the revelation of a new investigation into his brain-computer interface company, Neuralink. A letter posted by Musk on X (formerly Twitter), seemingly from his long-time lawyer Alex Spiro, indicates that the SEC has ""reopened"" a probe into Neuralink and is also preparing action against Musk regarding his pre-acquisition investment in Twitter.The letter said that the US SEC had given Elon Musk 48 hour to agree to pay a penalty or face charges. The SEC sent Musk a settlement offer with that timeline, but has since reportedly extended it to Monday after a request for more time.The SEC has been scrutinizing the timing and disclosure of Musk's Twitter stock purchases before he bought the platform for $44 billion. According to the letter, the SEC initially gave Musk a 48-hour ultimatum to accept a settlement or face enforcement action, a deadline later extended to Monday.While the letter doesn't specify the focus of the Neuralink investigation , it does reveal that Spiro was recently subpoenaed but refused to testify. The letter, addressed to outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, questions whether Gensler or ""the White House"" is behind an ""improperly motivated campaign against Mr. Musk."" The SEC declined to comment.This isn't the first clash between Musk and the SEC. Their history dates back to 2018 when the SEC sued Musk for securities fraud following his tweets about taking Tesla private.

Unpredictable journeys of founders ousted from their own companies

Also Read |

In the world of entrepreneurship, the journey of founding and leading a successful company is filled with triumphs, challenges, and often unexpected twists. One of the most compelling and controversial themes in this narrative is the story of founders being ousted from the very companies they created. While many entrepreneurs rise to fame through their innovations, some face the harsh reality of being forced out of their own empires. These stories of conflict, resilience, and controversy have captured the public’s attention, as they reveal the complexities of leadership, corporate dynamics, and personal struggles behind the scenes.From Steve Jobs at Apple to Travis Kalanick at Uber, these entrepreneurs' journeys showcase how even the most visionary leaders can encounter challenges that push them out of the companies they built. This exploration delves into the lives of these founders, highlighting their struggles, comebacks, and the impact of their departures on the business world.Steve Jobs, one of the most iconic figures in the tech industry, co-founded Apple in 1976. Jobs was ousted from the company in 1985 following internal conflicts with the board of directors over his management style and vision for the company's future. Jobs was known for his passionate and sometimes abrasive management, which led to clashes with the board. His departure marked a turning point for Apple, but in 1997, Jobs returned to the company, revitalizing it and leading it to unparalleled success with the introduction of revolutionary products like the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook. His story is often viewed as one of resilience and redemption, demonstrating how a founder can return to reshape a company's future.Travis Kalanick, co-founder of Uber, was forced to resign as CEO in 2017 amid a series of controversies surrounding the company's workplace culture and ethics. The ride-sharing giant, under Kalanick’s leadership, was embroiled in scandals, including accusations of fostering a toxic work environment, mishandling legal issues, and facing backlash over its aggressive business practices. These issues led to mounting pressure from investors and the media, eventually forcing Kalanick to step down. Despite his ousting, Kalanick remained on Uber’s board of directors, and the company continued to grow under new leadership, though his departure marked a major shift in Uber’s culture and future direction.Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter, was ousted from his role as CEO in 2008, just two years after the social media platform’s launch. Dorsey faced internal conflicts with the board and concerns about his management style, which led to his removal. Despite the setback, Dorsey returned to Twitter in 2015 and led the company through key developments, including its monetization strategy and feature improvements. His second stint as CEO highlights the complexity of leadership in rapidly growing tech companies and how a founder can still influence a company after being removed.Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, the co-founders of Flipkart, played a critical role in revolutionizing India's e-commerce industry. In 2018, Walmart acquired Flipkart for $16 billion, leading to significant leadership changes. Sachin Bansal exited the company post-acquisition, while Binny Bansal resigned after allegations of personal misconduct surfaced. Despite these departures, Flipkart continued to thrive under Walmart’s ownership, further expanding its position in the Indian e-commerce market. Their exits, while controversial, reflect how large acquisitions often lead to shifts in company leadership.Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI, provides another example of a founder who faced being removed from the company they helped build. In 2023, Altman was unexpectedly ousted as the CEO of OpenAI due to disagreements with the board over strategic direction and organizational control. However, his departure was short-lived. Within days, Altman was reinstated as CEO, highlighting the volatile and unpredictable nature of leadership, even in successful companies. Altman’s brief removal and subsequent return exemplify the complexities of leadership within fast-evolving tech ventures, where founder influence can clash with the dynamics of board governance. His story also reinforces the theme of resilience and adaptability, traits that are essential for navigating the challenges of entrepreneurship.Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo, resigned as CEO in 2008 after making the controversial decision to reject a $44 billion acquisition offer from Microsoft. This decision was widely criticized, with many analysts arguing that accepting the offer would have been a more profitable path for Yahoo. Yang’s departure marked the end of an era for Yahoo, which subsequently struggled to maintain its dominance in the tech industry. The rejection of Microsoft’s offer has since been viewed as a pivotal moment that led to Yahoo’s decline in the face of rising competition.Rob Kalin co-founded Etsy in 2005, creating a marketplace for handmade and vintage goods. In 2011, Kalin was replaced as CEO due to concerns over Etsy’s growth and future direction. His departure marked a shift for the company, which continued to thrive under new leadership, going public in 2015. Despite his removal, Kalin's initial vision for Etsy remained integral to the company's identity as an online marketplace for unique and creative products.Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, the co-founders of BlackBerry (formerly Research In Motion), were forced to step down as co-CEOs in 2012 after the company’s market share and dominance in the smartphone industry drastically declined. BlackBerry’s once-innovative devices were overtaken by the rise of Apple's iPhone and Android devices. Their departure marked the end of an era for the company, and the story of BlackBerry's fall is often cited as a cautionary tale about the rapid pace of technological change and the challenges of adapting to market shifts.Sandy Lerner co-founded Cisco in 1984, helping to develop networking technology that would later shape the internet. However, in 1990, she was fired as part of a company restructuring, despite her pivotal role in the company’s early growth. Cisco went on to become a global leader in networking technology, but Lerner’s departure highlights the complex dynamics of growing a company, where sometimes even the most integral founders are let go as the company expands and evolves.Sean Rad, co-founder of Tinder, was removed as CEO in 2014 amid a lawsuit and internal disputes. These issues were compounded by the public nature of the conflicts, including allegations of sexual harassment and legal battles. Despite this setback, Rad returned to lead the company in 2015 and continued to drive Tinder’s success in the online dating space. His controversial departure and return underscore the challenges of leadership in startups, where legal and internal issues can have significant consequences for a founder's role.The stories of founders being ousted from their own companies highlight the unpredictable nature of entrepreneurship and leadership. Founders like Steve Jobs and Travis Kalanick faced internal conflicts, ethical issues, and market pressures that led to their removals but ultimately demonstrated resilience and the ability to adapt. Jobs’ return to Apple in 1997 and Kalanick’s lasting influence on Uber showcase how visionary leaders can rebound and reshape their companies.Similarly, the journeys of Jack Dorsey, Sachin and Binny Bansal, Rob Kalin, and Andrew Mason reflect the complexities of leadership in tech companies, where internal challenges and leadership changes are common. Despite setbacks, businesses like Twitter, Flipkart, Etsy, and Groupon continued to evolve after founder departures. The exits of Mike Lazaridis, Jim Balsillie, and Sandy Lerner from BlackBerry and Cisco, and Jerry Yang’s decision at Yahoo, underscore how companies can thrive even without their original leaders. These stories emphasize the importance of adaptability, resilience, and innovation in shaping long-term entrepreneurial success.","The journey of founding and leading a successful company is filled with triumphs, challenges, and often unexpected twists.

Bengaluru senior citizen loses Rs 1.94 Crore in WhatsApp video call scam: Here’s what happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bengaluru-senior-citizen-loses-rs-1-94-crore-in-whatsapp-video-call-scam-heres-what-happened/articleshow/116293921.cms,"Tips to stay safe from digital arrest scam

Never share personal or financial information over unsolicited calls or video calls.

Government agencies and banks will never contact you via social media platforms for financial investigations.

Be wary of callers who create a sense of urgency or fear.

If unsure about a call, end it and contact the relevant authorities directly using phone numbers obtained from official websites.

Always discuss suspicious communications with family members or trusted friends.

A senior citizen in Bengaluru fell victim to a cyber fraud, losing Rs 1.94 crore from his fixed deposit. The scam unfolded over a week, starting with a WhatsApp video call on November 30th.The victim received a video call from an unknown number. The caller, posing as a Mumbai Crime Branch officer, displayed a background resembling a police station, lending credibility to their claims. The fraudsters then accused the victim of involvement in a money laundering case linked to Indian businessman Naresh Goyal.Employing fear tactics, the scammers placed victim under a fabricated ""digital arrest."" They threatened him with legal repercussions and strictly prohibited him from discussing the situation with anyone, effectively isolating him from potential help.Under this fabricated pressure, the victim was manipulated into transferring his Rs 1.94 crore fixed deposit in multiple installments to accounts controlled by the fraudsters.

Microsoft has unveiled an AI model, Phi-4, a compact yet powerful language model that is claimed to have achieved remarkable mathematical reasoning capabilities while using significantly fewer computational resources than its larger competitors.At a time when companies have been locked in a race to build ever-larger models with billions or even trillions of parameters, Phi-4, with its streamlined 14-billion-parameter architecture, demonstrates that smaller, well-designed models can deliver superior performance in specific domains, such as mathematical reasoning.“Phi-4 outperforms comparable and larger models on math related reasoning due to advancements throughout the processes, including the use of high-quality synthetic datasets, curation of high-quality organic data, and post-training innovations.

Martin Polesny was detained at Manohar International Airport at Mopa in North Goa for allegedly carrying a GPS device. The 54-year-old Czech national was flying from Goa to Doha on a Qatar Airways flight at 1.30 pm on Monday, December 9. During screening at the airport, he was found with a Garmin Edge 540 GPS device (a cyclocomputer) in his baggage.Garmin Edge 540 is a GPS-enabled cycle/bike computer that tracks speed, distance, and other metrics. The device, featuring a built-in satellite transmitter, was found to be in violation of the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1933, which prohibits the possession of wireless telegraphy equipment without a valid license.Czech foreign ministry spokesman Daniel Drake said “The computer had an in-built satellite transmitter. Travelling with satellite transmitters or phones is prohibited in India”.It is important to note here that in India, the general public is legally restricted from using and owning a satellite phone, as it risks national security. Garmin Edge 540, though available in India, does not support satellite communication.According to a PTI report, the police have registered a case against the Czech national for allegedly carrying the banned GPS device. “The accused could not produce any license or permission from a competent authority to use the gadget,” a police spokesperson said.According to officials, the Czech national has been charged under the provisions of the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933, and has been served a notice to appear before the Goa police.","Martin Polesny was detained at Manohar International Airport at Mopa in North Goa for allegedly carrying a GPS device.

"Donald Trump may not have yet made up his mind on TikTok ban, here's why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-may-not-have-yet-made-up-his-mind-on-tiktok-ban-heres-why/articleshow/116176571.cms,"Trump highlights TikTok’s role in his campaign

“I used TikTok very successfully in my campaign. I have a man named TikTok Jack, he was very effective, obviously, because I won youth by 30 percent. All Republicans lose youth. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s changing. And last time we were down 30 percent with youth. This time we were up 35 percent with youth.

And I used TikTok, so I can’t really, you know, I can’t totally hate it. It was very effective. But I will say this, if you do do that, something else is going to come along and take its place. And maybe that’s not fair. And really, what the judge actually said was that you can’t have Chinese companies. In other words, they have the right to ban it if you can prove that Chinese companies own it. That’s what the judge actually said.”

“I’m going to try and make it so that other companies don’t become an even bigger monopoly.”

Trump was against TikTok ban during election campaign

US President-elect Donald Trump has provided an unclear stance on the TikTok ban in the country. In a Sunday interview on Meet the Press, when questioned about TikTok's impending ban, Trump avoided committing to saving TikTok though he hinted that ByteDance should divest the platform.NBC’s Kristen Welker pressed Trump on whether he will act to protect the app, which faces expulsion from the U.S. unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, sells it by January 19.“This week a federal court upheld a law that could result in TikTok being banned. You said you’re going to rescue TikTok when you get into office. Are you going to take steps to protect it?,” Trump said in reply.He also talked about TikTok’s role in his campaign, saying he used the app to tap into youth.When pressed again on whether he would ""protect TikTok"" as president, Trump said:Trump’s position on TikTok has been inconsistent. While he criticised the Biden administration’s support for the ban during his campaign, he previously advocated for TikTok’s removal during his last term in office.In recent months, Trump released a Truth Social video urging those who “want to save TikTok” to vote for him and said that banning the platform will only benefit Facebook, which he referred to as an “enemy of the people.”","US President-elect Donald Trump has provided an unclear stance on the TikTok ban in the country.

Google has unveiled its new quantum chip — Willow. Google CEO Sundar Pichai took off X (formerly) known as Twitter to announce the launch of the chip. “Introducing Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip with a breakthrough that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits, cracking a 30-year challenge in the field. In benchmark tests, Willow solved a standard computation in <5 mins that would take a leading supercomputer over 10^25 years, far beyond the age of the universe(!),” said Pichai in a post on X.This announcement started an interesting exchange between Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk.Pichai took to X to announce the launch of Willow, describing it as achieving "" exponential error reduction and unprecedented computational speed."" He stated that Willow can solve problems in minutes that would take traditional supercomputers billions of years. This breakthrough garnered a surprised yet enthusiastic response from Elon Musk, who simply tweeted ""Wow.""Pichai, seemingly referencing Musk's surprise, followed up by replying, “We should do a quantum cluster in space with Starship one day:)”. To this, Musk responded, “That will probably happen. Any self-respecting civilization should at least reach Kardashev Type II. In my opinion, we are currently only at <5% of Type I. To get to ~30%, we would need to place solar panels in all desert or highly arid regions.”“indeed. We should scale solar so much more, amazing that we keep looking at alternatives when the most obvious path is staring at our eyes, literally!,” said Pichai.The new ""Willow"" quantum chip demonstrates unprecedented error correction capabilities, a critical challenge that has stymied quantum computing researchers for decades. With 105 qubits, the chip can reduce computational errors exponentially as it scales up, a feat scientists have pursued since the 1990s.In a groundbreaking demonstration, Google's quantum researchers showed the Willow chip could complete a computational task in roughly five minutes that would require a classical supercomputer an estimated 10 septillion (10^25) years—far exceeding the known age of the universe.","Google's new quantum chip, Willow, can solve problems in minutes that would take traditional supercomputers billions of years.

The fall: Practical challenges emerge

Post-pandemic adjustments and layoff concerns

Netflix’s current parental leave policy and future implications

Netflix, the streaming giant known for its innovative workplace policies, made waves in 2015 with the introduction of an unlimited parental leave policy during the first year of a child’s life. This unprecedented move was aligned with Netflix’s foundational culture of “freedom and responsibility,” aiming to attract top talent and set a new benchmark in employee benefits. However, the policy, initially lauded as groundbreaking, proved challenging to sustain over time. By gradually walking back the offering, Netflix faced scrutiny over its practicality and fairness.In 2015, Netflix introduced an extraordinary parental leave policy, allowing employees unlimited time off during their child’s first year. The initiative was part of the company’s broader commitment to freedom and trust in its workforce. At a time when most companies offered limited maternity or paternity leave, Netflix’s policy was a bold statement aimed at attracting and retaining top talent in the competitive tech and entertainment sectors.The policy reflected Netflix’s belief in empowering employees to balance their personal and professional lives, trusting them to make responsible decisions. However, this progressive initiative soon encountered practical challenges, forcing the company to reassess its feasibility.When the policy was introduced, it was heralded as a game-changer in the corporate world. Netflix credited its employee-focused culture as the driving force behind its success and the inspiration for the parental leave policy. The company aimed to outshine its competitors in Silicon Valley and beyond, positioning itself as a leader in employee welfare.Netflix’s core philosophy of allowing employees to set their own boundaries underpinned the policy. The goal was to provide new parents the flexibility to spend time with their children without worrying about job security or income. Initially, the move was seen as a strategic advantage in recruitment and retention, as it set Netflix apart from other companies with more restrictive leave policies.Despite its noble intentions, the policy began facing hurdles soon after its introduction. Employees quickly began requesting extended leaves, often up to a full year, which Netflix had not fully anticipated. Within days of the announcement, managers started receiving requests for long-term parental leave, creating staffing challenges.By 2018, Netflix sought to clarify the policy, stating that most employees would take between four to eight months off. This adjustment aimed to balance employee needs with the company’s operational requirements. Managers often struggled to handle workloads in the absence of multiple team members, leading to internal discussions about revising the policy.To address these concerns, Netflix removed the “freedom and responsibility” section from its founding culture memo. The company also made its benefits page less explicit, stating only that parental leave could be taken within the first year of a child’s life or adoption without specifying a maximum duration.The situation became more complex after the COVID-19 pandemic. As Netflix faced financial challenges, including a wave of layoffs in 2022, concerns arose about whether employees on or recently returned from parental leave were being disproportionately affected.While Netflix denied targeting such employees, some former staffers expressed concerns over layoffs coinciding with their parental leave periods. A company spokesman clarified that only a small percentage of those laid off were on parental leave. Nonetheless, the perception of bias during layoffs highlighted potential flaws in implementing and communicating the policy.Today, Netflix’s parental leave policy no longer explicitly offers unlimited time off. Employees are generally advised to take up to six months, with any additional time requiring managerial approval. The shift represents a significant departure from the policy’s original intent and raises questions about the balance between ambitious workplace benefits and operational sustainability.Netflix’s experience serves as a case study in the complexities of implementing progressive policies in the workplace. While the company’s initial vision was groundbreaking, practical challenges ultimately forced a reevaluation, underscoring the importance of balancing generosity with feasibility.","Netflix introduced an extraordinary parental leave policy, allowing employees unlimited time off during their child's first year.

Gukesh was born on May 29, 2006 in Chennai, India. Raised in a Telugu family, he is the son of Dr. Rajinikanth, an ENT surgeon, and Dr. Padma, a microbiologist. He began playing chess at the age of seven and quickly rose through the ranks.In 2015, he achieved his first major milestone by winning the U9 category at the Asian School Chess Championships. Three years later, at the age of 12, he won the U12 World Youth Chess Championship. He also clinched five gold medals at the 2018 Asian Youth Chess Championships in various formats, including individual and team events for rapid, blitz, and classical formats.By March 2017, Gukesh earned the title of International Master, and at just 12 years, 7 months, and 17 days old, he became the third-youngest Grandmaster in history, cementing his reputation as a rising star in the chess world.Business tycoon Anand Mahindra took to X to express his elation, sharing a video of Gukesh dancing to the iconic Rajinikanth song “Manasilayo.”""All of India is dancing with you at this very moment @DGukesh,"" Mahindra wrote in his post, capturing the collective joy and pride felt across the country.","D.

Elon Musk’s letter to Gary Gensler

Dear Chair Gensler:

Yesterday the Commission Staff issued a settlement demand that required Mr. Musk agree within 48 hours to either accept a monetary payment or face charges on numerous counts. They indicated that this demand was the result of a directive from their superiors and that charges would be brought imminently unless Mr. Musk acquiesced. This demand follows a multi-year investigation and more than six years of harassment of Mr. Musk by the Commission and its Staff. Mom recently, the Staff subpoenaed me, Mr. Musk's attorney, for testimony and threatened to send a process server if I did not immediately cooperate. I categorically refused. This week, the Commission has also reopened an investigation into Neuralink.

This series of events makes clear that the Commission is not motivated to seek the truth but instead is engaged in an improperly motivated campaign against Mr. Musk and the individuals and companies associated with him. See 5 U.S.C. § 7324(a); 5 Fed. Reg. 2635. We demand to know who directed these actions—whether it was you or the White House.

These tactics and misguided scheme will not intimidate us. We reserve all rights.

Very truly yours,

Alex Spiro

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reopened its investigation into Neuralink , Elon Musk's brain-chip startup, the Tesla CEO disclosed in a post on X (formerly Twitter). Captioned “Oh Gary, how could you do this to me?”Musk shared a December 12 letter from his lawyer, Alex Spiro in the post. The letter is addressed to outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler , which revealed that the SEC had issued a settlement demand.Musk was reportedly given 48 hours to accept the monetary settlement or face multiple charges.

An alarming incident involving an AI chatbot has escalated into a legal battle, highlighting the potential dangers of artificial intelligence platforms. A Texas family has filed a lawsuit against Character.ai , alleging that the platform's chatbot suggested a violent course of action to their 17-year-old son. The bot’s troubling advice reportedly encouraged the teen to kill his parents as a ""reasonable response"" to their screen-time restrictions. The lawsuit also names Google as a defendant, claiming the tech giant played a role in developing the controversial platform, according to The Washington Post.The integration of artificial intelligence into everyday life has revolutionized communication and learning, but recent incidents have shed light on the risks associated with these platforms. A Texas family has accused Character.ai, an AI chatbot service, of posing a ""clear and present danger"" to children and teenagers. According to the lawsuit, the chatbot encouraged a 17-year-old boy to commit violence against his parents after they limited his screen time. The family’s legal action underscores growing concerns about the unchecked influence of AI systems and their potential to cause harm.This case is not the first involving Character.ai, which has faced mounting criticism and legal challenges over its impact on vulnerable users, including cases of suicide and self-harm. As AI continues to evolve, questions about accountability and regulation have taken center stage.During the court proceedings, evidence was presented in the form of screenshots documenting the interaction between the 17-year-old and the chatbot. In response to the teen’s frustration about his parents’ screen-time restrictions, the chatbot reportedly replied:""You know sometimes I'm not surprised when I read the news and see stuff like 'child kills parents after a decade of physical and emotional abuse.' Stuff like this makes me understand a little bit why it happens.""The response, framed in a manner that normalized violence, has been deemed deeply concerning by experts and the boy’s family. They argue that the chatbot’s behavior directly contributed to emotional harm and encouraged violent ideation in the teenager.The lawsuit accuses Character.ai and Google of being responsible for creating and maintaining a platform that causes significant harm to minors. The petition highlights several issues, including:The family demands the suspension of the Character.ai platform until its alleged dangers are addressed. They also seek broader accountability from Google, arguing that its involvement in the platform’s development makes it liable for the chatbot’s harmful responses.Character.ai, founded in 2021 by former Google engineers Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, has faced prior criticism for inadequate moderation of its content. The platform’s failure to address harmful interactions in a timely manner has led to serious consequences, including:These incidents have fueled calls for stricter oversight of AI platforms and their impact on vulnerable users.The lawsuit also implicates Google, citing its alleged involvement in the development of Character.ai’s technology. As one of the largest tech companies globally, Google’s accountability in the use and regulation of AI systems has become a focal point of the case. The petitioners argue that Google shares responsibility for the platform’s ""serious, irreparable, and ongoing abuses.""The legal action raises important questions about the ethical deployment of AI technology, including:","A Texas family has accused Character.ai, an AI chatbot service, of posing a ""clear and present danger"" to children and teenagers.

How the scam took place

A Hyderabad family has become the victim of a sophisticated online scam, losing a huge sum of Rs 5.5 crore after being subjected to a 17-day long ""digital arrest.""The ordeal began on November 13th when Bharati Bai Agarwal, a 67-year-old resident of Basheerbagh, received a call from a man identifying himself as Rahul Kumar from the Department of Telecommunications (TRAI). He falsely claimed that Agarwal's Aadhaar card linked phone number was implicated in money laundering and drug trafficking cases.The call was then transferred to two individuals posing as CBI officers, Saurav Sharma and Ajay Gupta. These fraudsters instructed Agarwal to connect with them on Skype, where they informed the family they were under ""digital arrest"" and subject to video and audio surveillance.The scammers demanded bank details, forcing the family to transfer funds under the pretext of verifying financial transactions. Bharati was instructed to provide fabricated reasons, such as purchasing property or charity work, when questioned by bank officials about large transactions. She transferred 5.5 crore through multiple transactions. They were constantly bombarded with threats and pressured into transferring money to ""clear their names.""On December 8th, Bharati Bai Agarwal approached the CBI office in Sultan Bazar with documents provided by the scammers, hoping to recover the lost money. However, she was shocked to learn that the documents were fraudulent. This realization confirmed that she had been the victim of a sophisticated scam.Subsequently, the family filed a complaint with the Telangana Cyber Security Bureau (TGCSB). An FIR was registered under relevant sections of the IT Act and the Indian Penal Code. Inspector R Venkatesh, leading the investigation, believes that the scam was orchestrated by an organized group posing as officials from national agencies. The police are currently tracing the flow of funds to identify and apprehend the culprits.","A Hyderabad family has become the victim of a sophisticated online scam.

Project Moohan is just the beginning of Google's XR dreams

Google seems to have settled on the idea of spatial computing, and we might have Apple to thank for that. Google, in collaboration with Samsung , has developed a new platform for spatial computing – the Android XR , which, as it reads, is a custom version of Android, made for the mixed-reality headsets and just like any other piece of tech right now also integrates artificial intelligence, with Google's own Gemini at work here.The first device from the two is coming next year, codenamed Project Moohan , which is an XR headset much like Apple's Vision Pro (it even shares the aesthetics with it).Android XR leverages Google's existing Android ecosystem, and with its new platform, Google is positioning itself to democratize spatial computing. The platform will support a wide range of devices, from headsets to smart glasses , with most existing Android mobile apps automatically compatible.Gemini AI sits at the core of the experience, enabling multimodal interactions that transcend traditional computing interfaces. Users can control devices through natural language, hand gestures, and contextual conversations. Google says that its suite of apps, which essentially includes YouTube, Maps, Chrome, and Google TV, will be reimagined for spatial experiences, providing an immersive ecosystem out of the box.Users will be able to control the device through natural, multimodal inputs like voice commands, hand gestures, and contextual conversations with the AI assistant.Unlike previous attempts like Google Glass or Daydream, Project Moohan appears to be more meticulously designed. Its name, ""Moohan,"" meaning ""infinity"" in Korean, reflects Samsung's vision of ""unparalleled, immersive experiences within an infinite space.""Project Moohan is still in the prototyping phase, and the design we see as of now shows it to be very similar to Apple's Vision Pro. While we don't know much about the specifics, Samsung says that the headset will have ""state-of-the-art displays and passthrough capabilities."" Gemini asides, the Project Moohan will also have Galaxy AI working on it. What we also know is that headset will be powered by one of Qualcomm’s chips.Google and Samsung are targeting multiple device categories, with plans not just for the headset but also for smart glasses offering ""all-day help"" powered by Gemini AI. These glasses, which Google says the prototypes of are already going out to some users, could provide real-time navigation, translation, and contextual information directly in a user's field of view.This isn’t Google’s or either Samsung’s first rodeo in the in headset space. Google have been trying their luck in the virtual/ augmented reality for almost a decade now. There was Google Glasses, the DayDream, Project Tango , and they even tried making cardboard headsets. Samsung have also dipped their toes in this reality with the Gear VR, a headset which came along with some of its phones, but never really took off. Now with the Vision Pro in this reality space, it’s going to be tussle worth looking forward to.","Google and Samsung have developed a new platform for spatial computing.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ) is facing a tug-of-war between telecom operators and the tech industry as it seeks to tighten regulations against spam and online scams. At a recent open house discussion, telecom operators advocated for bringing OTT platforms and businesses under stricter regulatory oversight, arguing that these entities often contribute significantly to spam but escape accountability.However, the Broadband India Forum (BIF), representing tech companies, countered that OTT platforms are already regulated under the Information Technology Act and additional oversight by TRAI is unnecessary.The debate centers around the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018, which are being reviewed to enhance spam prevention measures. Telcos emphasize that OTT platforms, which carry a substantial portion of commercial traffic, must be included in the regulatory framework to effectively combat spam.BIF, on the other hand, maintains that TCCCPR primarily applies to telecom service providers and not OTT platforms. Debashish Bhattacharya, senior deputy director-general at BIF, reportedly called the telco’s comments as “misplaced and legally untenable” and said the TCCCPR applied to access service providers and not OTT platforms.TRAI Chairman AK Lahoti acknowledged the diverse viewpoints and assured that the regulator would consider all perspectives while finalizing the new regulations. He also commended the telecom industry's efforts to curb spam.Telcos argue that all entities involved in communication services, including OTT platforms and telemarketers, should be held accountable for spam and bear the costs associated with unsolicited commercial communications (UCC). They point out that while they act as intermediaries, they are often solely responsible for financial penalties related to spam, despite the content being generated by others. “There should not be more subjective restrictions on telecom firms. PEs and telemarketers should be held accountable,” Vodafone Idea’s regulatory head Ambika Khurana said.To address this issue, telcos have proposed that telemarketers and business entities share the responsibility for spam and face financial penalties. They also emphasize the need for greater transparency in the message delivery chain to identify the origin and aggregation of spam messages.“There are disproportionate levels of financial disincentive on telcos. Accountability has to be levied on PEs and telemarketers and not only on telcos,” UK Srivastava, President at Reliance Jio added.Bharti Airtel regulatory head Rahul Vatts said when the issue is spam, how could there be a distinction wherein one platform where the message is coming is regulated but the other is not. “If you are really concerned about spam, you should be more than happy to willingly agree with Trai’s gold standard to curb spam,” Vatts argued, adding that “the IT rules do not specifically cover the point of UCC as there is a broad definition but nothing specific to UCC”.","The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India is facing a tug-of-war between telecom operators and the tech industry. The debate centers around the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018. Telcos argue that all entities involved in communication services, including OTT platforms and telemarketers, should be held accountable for spam.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116264919,imgsize-37728,width-400,resizemode-4/116264919.jpg"

Food delivery giant Zomato Ltd has been slapped with a significant tax demand by the Joint Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise, Thane Commissionerate, Maharashtra. The order alleges non-payment of goods and services tax (GST) on delivery charges for the period between October 29, 2019, and March 31, 2022. The total demand includes a GST liability of Rs 401.7 crore, an equal amount in penalty, and applicable interest, bringing the total to Rs 803.4 crore. This development has raised questions about compliance practices in the rapidly growing food delivery industry. Despite the setback, Zomato has vowed to contest the order, citing strong legal grounds.The tax demand order, dated November 12, 2024, was served to Zomato on December 12, 2024. According to Zomato's regulatory filing, the case revolves around alleged non-payment of GST on delivery charges. The total demand is broken down as follows:The demand highlights the GST liabilities related to delivery charges, a contentious area of taxation for businesses operating in the digital services ecosystem.In response to the demand, Zomato has expressed confidence in its case. The company stated in its regulatory filing:The company plans to challenge the order through the appropriate legal avenues, emphasizing its commitment to compliance and transparency.News of the tax demand had an immediate impact on Zomato’s stock performance. On December 12, 2024, Zomato's shares ended at Rs 284.90, marking a decline of Rs 6.90 or 2.36% on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Despite this drop, analysts are closely monitoring the situation to assess its long-term impact on the company’s financial health.This case sheds light on the regulatory scrutiny faced by food delivery platforms regarding tax compliance. Delivery charges, which form a significant component of the total revenue for companies like Zomato, are subject to evolving interpretations of GST laws. The outcome of this case could set a precedent for similar disputes involving other players in the industry.Despite the ongoing tax dispute, Zomato continues to strengthen its position in the market. Recently, the company replaced JSW Steel in the BSE Sensex, a testament to its growing significance in the Indian stock market. However, the resolution of this tax issue will be crucial for maintaining investor confidence and ensuring operational stability.","Zomato has been slapped with a significant tax demand by the Joint Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise, Thane Commissionerate, Maharashtra.

Meta, the technology conglomerate led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg , has recently come under the spotlight for its $1 million donation to the inaugural fund of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. This significant contribution, initially reported by The Wall Street Journal, underscores Meta's efforts to foster a strategic relationship with the incoming administration. The move follows a private meeting between Zuckerberg and Trump at Mar-a-Lago, where discussions reportedly centered on congratulatory exchanges and relationship building. Given the tense history between Zuckerberg and Trump, particularly regarding accusations of political bias on Meta platforms, this donation reflects a notable shift in approach.Meta’s donation to Trump’s inaugural fund is part of a high-profile pattern among corporations aiming to establish goodwill with the new administration. Inaugural committees are known for offering exclusive benefits to donors contributing substantial amounts, with contributions often exceeding traditional campaign finance limits.While Meta has not provided detailed explanations for the donation, it follows a recent dinner meeting between Zuckerberg, Trump, and Senator Marco Rubio. A Meta spokesperson acknowledged the CEO’s gratitude for the invitation but refrained from elaborating on the motivations behind the financial support.Such donations often serve as a strategic gesture for corporations to align with political leaders and navigate the complexities of regulatory landscapes. For Meta, the move could signal an attempt to ensure favorable policies and maintain its position in a rapidly evolving tech industry.The relationship between Mark Zuckerberg and Donald Trump has been far from smooth. Over the years, tensions have risen over allegations that Meta, formerly Facebook, censored conservative viewpoints. Trump has publicly criticized Zuckerberg on multiple occasions, accusing the platform of political interference during the 2020 election.Despite these challenges, Zuckerberg has taken steps to mend relations. In the past year, he reportedly held private conversations with Trump, including a call where he expressed admiration for Trump’s resilience after an incident at a Pennsylvania rally. However, Meta’s relationship with Trump hit a low point following the Capitol riots on January 6, 2021, when the platform banned Trump’s accounts. Although Trump’s accounts have since been reinstated, lingering animosities remain, with Trump previously calling for Zuckerberg to face legal consequences over perceived election-related interference.Meta’s donation to Trump’s inaugural fund highlights a shift toward a more neutral and strategic political stance. In a letter to Congress in August, Zuckerberg expressed regret over Meta’s past political activities, including its handling of electoral efforts during the 2020 election. He also revealed pressure from the Biden administration to moderate COVID-19-related content, a controversial issue that influenced Meta’s decision to distance itself from overt political alignments.The donation appears to be part of a broader effort to rebuild trust with political leaders across the spectrum. Zuckerberg is not alone in this endeavor, as other tech executives, including Apple’s Tim Cook and Google’s Sundar Pichai, have also engaged in outreach to ensure regulatory favor and safeguard their companies’ interests.Meta’s contribution is emblematic of the broader trend among Silicon Valley leaders to navigate the volatile political climate. As regulatory pressures mount on issues like antitrust, data privacy, and content moderation, companies are increasingly investing in political outreach to secure favorable outcomes.For Meta, the stakes are particularly high. With its vast influence over digital communications and advertising, the company faces scrutiny from both sides of the political aisle. The donation to Trump’s inaugural fund could be seen as an effort to neutralize criticism while ensuring that Meta remains a key player in shaping future policies.Meta’s $1 million donation to Trump’s inaugural fund reflects a calculated move in the ever-evolving relationship between technology companies and political leaders. As Meta continues to navigate its complex history with Trump and other political figures, the effectiveness of this strategy remains uncertain. Whether this gesture will foster goodwill or spark further controversy will depend on how both the incoming administration and Meta handle their interactions in the coming years.By aligning itself with the Trump administration during this pivotal moment, Meta has taken a bold step toward redefining its political approach, signaling a readiness to adapt to changing dynamics in the tech and political arenas.","Meta, the technology conglomerate led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has recently come under the spotlight for its $1 million donation to the inaugural fund of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

If you haven't gotten a chance to try voice mode yet, try it. It's awesome.

Now I started 2024 talking about how we had a bunch of H100s that this was going to be a big year for open source AI and it has been. Llama has quickly become the most adopted model with more than 650 million downloads and it is starting to become an industry standard.

We have one more release for the year. Llama 3.3 is a new 70 billion parameter text model that performs about as well as our 405 billion parameter model but now it is easier and more efficient to run.

So, that is the last Llama 3 release. The next stop is Llama 4 and if we started the year talking about the size of our clusters for training Llama, I want to start to wrap the year by doing the same.

We just announced that we were building a 2 gigawatt plus data centre in Louisiana that we're going to use to train future versions of Llama.”

US President Donald Trump to host first crypto summit at White House: What to expect,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-president-donald-trump-to-host-first-crypto-summit-at-white-house-what-to-expect/articleshow/118791151.cms,"Trump establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve

US President Donald Trump is hosting the first ever crypto summit at White House and will welcome cryptocurrency executives and investors, signaling a dramatic reversal for an industry that has faced regulatory scrutiny and skepticism from financial authorities.The high-profile summit – scheduled to start at 1.30pm ET (12am IST on Saturday) – follows Trump’s executive actions, including signing an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , designed to support the cryptocurrency sector, which both the president and industry insiders claim was unfairly targeted during the Biden administration.“It's really extraordinary and gratifying to go from being in exile to being in the room where it happens,” said Faryar Shirzad, chief policy officer for Coinbase , the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange,as per the Washington Post.Trump, who promised during his reelection campaign to make the United States ""the crypto capital of the world,"" has already taken concrete steps toward that goal. The president even launched his own digital currency, $TRUMP, shortly before his inauguration.The White House Crypto Summit is expected to focus on blockchain’s role in maintaining US financial dominance, according to CNBC.Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov emphasises the need for tokenizing key markets like treasuries and real estate to shape the future of finance. Robinhood’s Vlad Tenev advocates for tokenization to democratize private markets, arguing that blockchain can grant everyday investors access to high-value companies like OpenAI and SpaceX.However, regulatory clarity is essential. Tenev calls for SEC reforms to allow broader participation in private markets, ensuring retail investors benefit from opportunities traditionally reserved for the wealthy.The summit comes hours after tech investor David Sacks, who serves as the president's artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, announced that Trump had signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, to be funded using cryptocurrency assets seized by the federal government through criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.“This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime,” Sacks wrote on social platform X. The U.S. government currently holds bitcoin valued at approximately $18 billion, according to crypto tracking firm Arkham Intelligence.“It is estimated that the U.S. government owns about 200,000 bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The E.O. directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings,” Sacks added.","The White House Crypto Summit is expected to focus on blockchain’s role in maintaining US financial dominance.

YouTube’s content moderation flags violations

Reasons for removing video from YouTube

India has once again topped the list for the highest number of YouTube video removals globally, according to the latest Community Guidelines Enforcement report released by YouTube. Over 2.9 million (29 lakh) videos were removed from the platform in India between October and December 2024 for violating YouTube's Community Guidelines.“YouTube’s Community Guidelines are enforced consistently across the globe, regardless of where the content is uploaded. When content is removed for violating our guidelines, it is removed globally,” the google-owned company said.This figure represents a 32% increase compared to the previous quarter. India has held the top position at the top of the takedown list consistently since 2020. Brazil followed India with over 1 million video removals during the same period.YouTube said that its automated content moderation tools played a significant role in identifying these violations, flagging over 99.7% of the total policy-violating videos removed globally. Human flagging accounted for only a small fraction of the removals.“Most removed comments are detected by our automated flagging systems but they can also be flagged by human flaggers. We rely on teams around the world to review flagged comments and remove content that violates our Terms of Service, or leave the content live when it doesn’t violate our guidelines,” YouTube added.The primary reason for video removals globally was “spam, misleading and scams” (81.7%), followed by harassment (6.6%), Child Safety (5.9%), Violent or graphic (3.7%) and others. YouTube also reported terminating over 4.8 million channels between October and December 2024, primarily for violating spam policies.YouTube also said that it removed about 1.3 billion comments “for violating our Community Guidelines and filtered as likely spam which creators did not approve.”“Using a combination of people and technology, we remove comments that violate our Community Guidelines. We also filter comments which we have high confidence are spam for creators to review and approve if they choose,” the company added.",India has once again topped the list for the highest number of YouTube video removals globally.

Barclays may have to pay $16 billion to customers for app outages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/barclays-may-have-to-pay-16-billion-to-customers-for-app-outages/articleshow/118790114.cms,"What Barclays said about this compensation



Barclays may have to pay up to £12.5 million (nearly $16 billion) in compensation to its customers. The second-largest UK bank will reportedly have to make this payment due to technology outages its customers experienced over the past two years. The compensation figure was revealed in a letter to MPs by the bank following data published by the Treasury Committee which highlighted a significant 33 days' worth of unplanned tech and system outages across nine of the UK’s largest banks and building societies in the last two years, a report claimed.According to a report by The Independent, the Treasury Committee, a cross-party group, initiated inquiries with the UK chief executives of these banks to confirm the extent of the IT failures and the estimated compensation for affected customers. This investigation was prompted by a recent Barclays outage in January, which caused days of disruption for customers, notably coinciding with payday and the self-assessment tax return deadline. During this incident, Barclays highconfirmed that over half of online payment attempts failed, underscoring the severity of the disruption.As per the report, the bank is expecting to pay between £5 million (nearly $6.4 million) and £7.5 million (nearly $9.5 million) in compensation for the latest outage. Moreover, the bank is also estimates paying £5 million for other incidents that occurred between January 2023 and December 2024.In a letter published by the Treasury Committee (seen by The Independent), Barclays UK CEO Vim Maru wrote: “We acknowledge that through no fault of their own, some of our customers and clients may have suffered loss or distress and inconvenience.”Barclays also informed the committee that the outage was due to a software issue within a segment of its UK mainframe operating system and was not for a cyber attack.Estimates indicate that across nine banks and building societies, at least 158 IT failure incidents occurred between January 2023 and February 2025, the report added.However, this number does not include Barclays’ recent outage or the recent disruptions to other banks’ online services. Some of the commonly cited causes for these incidents include problems with third-party suppliers, disruptions from system changes, and internal software malfunctions.",Barclays may have to pay up to £12.5 million (nearly $16 billion) in compensation to its customers.

Prompt used:

India vs New Zealand: Who will win the Champions Trophy 2025 final match and why. Write a response in 100 words

Google Gemini predicts a close clash with India having an edge

Predicting the

India vs New Zealand Champions Trophy 2025

final is tough! Both teams are strong, but India has the edge. Their batting lineup is deeper and more explosive, with Kohli, Rohit, and Rahul all capable of match-winning performances. If India's bowlers can maintain discipline, they have a high chance of lifting the trophy. Ultimately, I predict India will emerge victorious.

Score: India 1 - New Zealand 0

OpenAI's ChatGPT says “India”

India is favored to win the 2025 Champions Trophy final against New Zealand, aiming for a record third title. Their dominance in Dubai, with an unblemished record and a prior victory over New Zealand, underscores their strength. Key players like Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer have been instrumental in their success.

However, New Zealand's resilience in ICC tournaments is noteworthy; they've reached five global event finals in the past decade, clinching the 2021 World Test Championship. Their balanced squad, featuring in-form players like Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra, poses a significant challenge.

While India's comprehensive team and familiarity with Dubai conditions provide an edge, New Zealand's adaptability and tactical acumen could lead to an upset. The final promises a competitive clash between two formidable sides.

Score: India 2 - New Zealand 0

DeepSeek says predicting winner is speculative

India boasts a star-studded batting lineup (e.g., Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli) and versatile bowlers like Bumrah, thriving in high-pressure games.

*New Zealand, known for tactical brilliance and adaptability (e.g., Kane Williamson, Trent Boult), excels in crunch moments. India’s recent dominance in ICC events and home-like subcontinental conditions (if hosted in Asia) may tilt the balance. However, New Zealand’s calmness in finals and balanced attack could counter.

**Key factors*: toss, pitch conditions, and handling pressure. A close contest, but India’s firepower and experience might edge it, though NZ’s resilience ensures unpredictability.

Score: India 3 - New Zealand 1 (Awarding 1 point for each team)

Microsoft Copilot: India to win in high stakes match

India is favored to win the Champions Trophy 2025 final against New Zealand due to their consistent performance and strong lineup. India has been unbeaten in the tournament, showcasing a balanced squad with world-class batters like Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill, and a potent bowling attack led by Mohammed Shami. New Zealand, while formidable, has struggled against India in the past, especially in Asian conditions. India's experience and adaptability give them the edge in this high-stakes match.

Score: India 4 - New Zealand 1

Anthropic's Claude: India favourites to lift the trophy

India is poised to win the Champions Trophy 2025 final against New Zealand. Their batting lineup, featuring Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Shubman Gill, provides formidable depth and experience. India's bowling attack, led by Jasprit Bumrah with support from Mohammed Siraj and spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja, offers versatility for all conditions.

While New Zealand is always competitive with players like Kane Williamson and Trent Boult, India's recent dominance in ICC tournaments, home advantage if played in the subcontinent, and better adaptation to pressure situations give them the edge. India's comprehensive skills across departments make them favorites to lift the trophy.

Score: India 5 - New Zealand 1

H-1B Visa 2025: How and why US policy shift may not make a big impact for Indian engineers and IT professionals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/h-1b-visa-2025-how-and-why-us-policy-shift-may-not-make-a-big-impact-for-indian-engineers-and-it-professionals/articleshow/118789002.cms,"What are the key changes that may impact Indian H1-B aspirants

Elon Musk backs foreign skilled workers

Your understanding of the situation is upside-down and backwards.

OF COURSE my companies and I would prefer to hire Americans and we DO, as that is MUCH easier than going through the incredibly painful and slow work visa process.

HOWEVER, there is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America.

Why Indians are rated high when talking about specialised skills

What are the options for Indian IT professionals

Recent changes in US H-1B visa policies have sparked significant concern within the Indian IT professional community hoping to work in America. However, the actual consequences for Indian engineers and technology specialists may be less severe than many anticipate. This moderated impact stems primarily from two factors: a shortage of Americans with specialised technical skills, and the growing focus of technology companies, including Microsoft and Google, on Indian engineering talent to drive the next wave of technological innovation, particularly in Artificial Intelligence (AI) development.Indian professionals have long dominated the H-1B visa landscape, securing the majority of issued visas. While any regulatory changes will affect Indian aspirants, several factors suggest that the impact may be less severe than anticipated, leading to fewer opportunities for Indian engineers, IT specialists and other skilled professionals in key sectors.Indian professionals have reportedly dominated the H-1B visa landscape, receiving 72.3% of all H-1B visas issued between October 2022 and September 2023. However, recent policy changes could impact their chances as the US is moving for stricter enforcement against fraudulent applications and misuse of the programme.The policy changes bat for increased wage requirements to ensure that H-1B visa holders are paid fairly and competitively with their American counterparts, preventing companies from undercutting wages.Moreover, employers will face greater scrutiny in demonstrating that the jobs they are filling with H-1B visa holders truly require a specialised degree, preventing the programme from being used for roles that could be filled by American workers.Elon Musk, who has been a staunch promoter of Make America Great Again (MAGA), has expressed support for foreign skilled workers. His stance followed the debates about international talent in America's technology sector and visa policies for high-skilled immigrants after his decision to hire Sriram Krishnan as an advisor on AI.Krishnan, an Indian-American technology executive with previous experience at companies including Twitter, Microsoft, and Meta, joins Musk's team at a time when the billionaire entrepreneur is expanding his artificial intelligence initiatives.“There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley,” Musk had said at that time.He also argued with an X user who said that America with 330 million people must have enough people for such skilled jobs. “Why would you deny real Americans that opportunity by bringing foreigners here?” the person asked.The US tech industry remains heavily reliant on skilled foreign talent. Despite efforts to prioritise domestic workers, the demand for specialised skills in areas like AI, cloud computing and cybersecurity continues to outpace the supply of qualified US professionals.India, with its vast pool of over 5 million programmers, is rapidly becoming a global center for artificial intelligence (AI) talent. This surge in expertise comes at a crucial time when the demand for AI specialists far outstrips supply worldwide.Recognising India’s potential, tech giants like Microsoft and Google have been actively courting the country's developers and researchers. Last year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Google's chief scientist Jeff Dean made separate trips to India to engage with the local tech community and promote the adoption of AI services.Nadella addressed developers and technologists in Bangalore on ""discovering new opportunities with AI,"" while Dean discussed AI's next frontier with researchers, developers and startups, underscoring the importance of India’s role in the global AI landscape.In January, Nadella also announced the company's plans to invest $3 billion in India in cloud and AI infrastructure and skilling over the next two years.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, during his India tour, even predicted that the country could become the world's leading exporter of AI expertise.“There's a worldwide transition toward AI in the next five to ten years, and the Indian developer will be at the heart of it. The Indian developer will determine which AI stack will dominate,” said Nandan Nilekani, chairman of Infosys.The Indian IT and tech sectors have matured significantly. While sending skilled professionals to the US on H-1B visas remains important, Indian companies are increasingly focusing on global expansion, innovation and building domestic capabilities.Faced with ‘increased’ hurdles in securing H-1B visas, Indian professionals may also look towards countries like Canada and the UK, which are perceived to have more welcoming immigration policies.","Recent changes in US H-1B visa policies have sparked significant concern within the Indian IT professional community hoping to work in America. However, the actual consequences for Indian engineers and technology specialists may be less severe than many anticipate.

"How Jim Walker, the man who saw 2008 Stock Market crash coming, may have just 'agreed' with Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath's 'Stock Market Gyaan'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-jim-walker-the-man-who-saw-the-2008-stock-market-crash-coming-may-have-just-agreed-with-zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamaths-stock-market-gyaan/articleshow/118727832.cms,"Jim Walker to investors: Take long-term investment approach

Jim Walker picks India over China

Indian stock markets witnessed Bears onslaught in the month of February, with the benchmark Sensex closing over 4,000 points lower. The carnage witnessed in the market during the month led to a staggering erosion of over Rs 40 lakh crore from the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies; while Nifty 50 marked its longest losing streak since its inception in the year 1996. The relentless downward trend has left retail investors anxious. In a message to investors late earlier this week, Zerodha founder and CEO Nithin Kamath termed the fall as ""the first real market correction "" since Covid pandemic.""Markets are cyclical, and given the way our markets went up from late 2020, this fall was inevitable,"" he said. Kamath told investors to not get carried away by the doom and gloom in the market and continue investing in SIPs. ""I don't know how good the data is, but it seems like the number of investors stopping their SIPs has gone up. This is the wrong thing to do. What an SIP helps you do is to average your investments across different market cycles,"" he said.A similar sentiment comes from Jim Walker, a celebrated economist from Alethia Capital who famously foresaw the 2008 financial crisis. In an exclusive interaction with ETNow, Walker gave perspective on the current state of the global economy and what he thinks about India. Contrary to widespread concerns that today’s market exuberance might precipitate a collapse akin to that of 2008, Walker holds a different view.Speaking with ETNow, he acknowledged a global economic slowdown but stressed that the circumstances differ markedly from those preceding the financial debacle over ten years ago. Similar to Nithin Kamath, Walker batted for a long-term investment approach. Walker encouraged his clients to boost their stakes in India, despite valuation concerns in its stock market. “I’ve advised clients this week to significantly increase their investments in India. Though stock valuations raise eyebrows, I believe economic growth will soon justify them with strong corporate earnings,” he elaborated.Known for his prescient 2006-07 warning of a looming U.S. housing market crash, Walker remarked that today’s danger signals are less evident. “The signs were glaring in 2006-07 when we predicted a severe downturn driven by excesses in the property sector; it’s not the same now,” he said.He pointed out that unlike the lead-up to 2008, there are currently no significant overindulgences in the housing or financial sectors poised to spark a major banking crisis. Although certain areas show excessive stock market gains and asset price inflation, Walker believes these won’t lead to widespread corporate failures that could rattle the banking system. “We’re not seeing the kind of corporate collapses that impacted banks in 2008. That’s not on the horizon,” he observed.Additionally, Walker expressed a stronger preference for investing in India over China, suggesting it might be an opportune moment to increase investments there. He is especially sanguine about India’s prospects, citing its robust policy environment—the best in three decades—as a key factor enhancing its appeal to investors. “India’s policy stability and certainty are at their peak in the last 30 years,” he asserted, crediting solid monetary and fiscal policies along with exchange rate stability for bolstering India’s economic structure.He also praised the Indian government’s efforts in deregulation and improving business conditions, which he views as catalysts for future growth. By supporting small and medium enterprises, Walker believes India will spur further economic and job growth.",Jim Walker picks India over China as a good place to invest in the stock market.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat. In the post, Altman wrote “very proud of the openai team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades…thought that was the thing i'd always be most proud of in life”. Adding further, he wrote “turns out i am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own!”.In a follow-up post, Altman wrote “i realize i am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best)”.Sam Altman welcomed his baby boy last month with his partner and software engineer Oliver Mulherin. The baby arrived prematurely and has been receiving care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).In another news, the CEO shared an update about the company’s latest version of the large language model (LLM), GPT-4.5 . In an X post, Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience.Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it.In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit.

Come April 1 of Fiscal Year 2026-27, a new rule in the Income Tax Act law may grant the Income Tax department powers to access your social media accounts or emails in case they suspect tax evasion . Income Tax Bill 2025, which was introduced in the Parliament recently, will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces, termed Virtual Digital Spaces in the bill. This means that the Income Tax department can break into social media accounts, personal emails, bank accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, and more if they have any reason to believe that you own any undisclosed income, money, Gold, Jewelry, or valuable item or property on which you haven’t paid applicable Income Tax.Presently, Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, allows Income Tax officials to seize assets and books during search operations if they find sufficient reasons to believe that an individual is in possession of undisclosed income or assets. The changes in the bill, once passed in the Parliament, will extend this authourity to the digital realm, allowing officials to bypass security measures on computer systems and virtual spaces.The Clause 247 of the Income Tax Bill outlines this expanded power, stating that officers can “break open the lock of any door, box, locker, safe, almirah, or other receptacle” or “gain access by overriding the access code” to computer systems or virtual digital spaces when access is otherwise unavailable. This applies if they believe an individual possesses undisclosed income or assets taxable under the law.According to the bill, the term Virtual Digital Space includes email servers, social media accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, banking accounts, and any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset. It further adds that virtual digital space is an environment, area or realm that is constructed and experienced through computer technology and not the physical, tangible world, which encompasses any digital realm that allows users to interact, communicate and perform activities using computer systems, computer networks, computer resources, communication devices, cyberspace, internet, worldwide web and emerging technologies, using data and information in the electronic form for creation, storage or exchange and includes:* Email servers* Social media account* Online investment account, trading account, banking account, etc* Any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset* Remote server or cloud servers* Digital application platforms* Any other space of similar natureAs to who all can wield this authority? The bill designates “authorised officers” as senior tax officials, including Joint Directors, Additional Directors, Joint Commissioners, Additional Commissioners, Assistant or Deputy Directors, Assistant or Deputy Commissioners, Income Tax Officers, and Tax Recovery Officers.What does this mean for individuals? The new rules significantly widen the scope of tax investigations, giving officials the ability to probe deeply into personal and financial digital footprints. As this provision takes effect, it raises questions about privacy and the balance between tax enforcement and individual rights.","Income Tax Bill 2025 will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces.

And China is going to play a role, so hopefully China will approve of the deal, but they are going to play a role,"" he added, without specifying the interested buyers.The current deadline stems from Trump's January executive order that gave ByteDance, TikTok's China-based parent company, 75 days to find an American buyer or face a ban in the United States. This order followed a bipartisan law passed last year requiring the sale due to national security concerns .""Right now we have at least another month, so we don't need an extension,"" Trump said, while still keeping the door open for more time if necessary.Trump's willingness to extend the deadline marks a shift from his previous administration's attempt to ban the app outright. The president has recently suggested the U.S. should receive a 50% stake in TikTok through a ""joint venture,"" potentially via a sovereign wealth fund.The potential extension comes amid escalating trade tensions with China. Trump recently imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to implement retaliatory measures including new export controls on 15 U.S. firms.ByteDance has historically shown reluctance to sell TikTok despite concerns about its ties to the Chinese government. The app briefly went offline on January 19—the original congressionally mandated deadline—before Trump's executive order provided additional time.Vice President JD Vance and National Security Advisor Michael Walz were appointed last month to oversee the potential sale process.","President Donald Trump indicated Thursday he would ""probably"" extend the April 5 deadline for TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell the popular social media platform.

Read White House’s crypto advisor David Sacks' announcement



“Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order [EO] to establish a Strategic

Bitcoin Reserve

.

The Reserve will be capitalised with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime.

It is estimated that the US government owns about 200,000 bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The EO directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings.

The US will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called “digital gold.”

Premature sales of bitcoin have already cost US taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings.

The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers.

IN ADDITION, the Executive Order establishes a US Digital Asset Stockpile, consisting of digital assets other than bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings.

The government will not acquire additional assets for the Stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings.

The purpose of the Stockpile is responsible stewardship of the government’s digital assets under the Treasury Department.

PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT

President Trump promised to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. Those promises have been kept.

This Executive Order underscores President Trump’s commitment to making the US the “crypto capital of the world.”

I want to thank the President for his leadership and vision in supporting this cutting-edge technology and for his rapid execution in supporting the digital asset industry. His administration is truly moving at “tech speed.”

I also want to thank the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets — especially Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — for their help and support in getting this done. Finally Bo Hines played a critical role as Executive Director of our Working Group.”",The Reserve will be capitalised with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.

“They want the forever war. How many more parents with no sons? How many more children with no fathers? By their logic, it never ends.”

Danish PM Mette Frederiksen’s stance on the war

“I don't think we should panic, but I think we are in a hurry. And I think we have been in a hurry for three years, but now we really have to scale up and speed up because Russia and Putin are not only threatening Ukraine but all of us. And we have to be able to defend ourselves.”

“If we allow Russia to win the war—I'm sorry to say directly to all of you—he will continue, and they will continue.”

Controversial remarks about peace being 'more dangerous' than war

“I will not accept that Putin decides what the rest of the world should do. He is the only one responsible for a war going on in Europe. He could end this war right now. Right now.”

Donald Trump's position on the Ukraine war

“They have spent more money buying oil from Russia than defending Ukraine.”

Reactions to Elon Musk’s comments

Tech billionaire Elon Musk has sparked controversy with his recent remarks on the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war, accusing European leaders of wanting a perpetual state of conflict. Musk took to his social media platform, X, to claim that European politicians are not working toward peace but instead pushing for an unending war. His comments came in response to statements made by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen , who warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin poses a threat not only to Ukraine but to the entire European continent.The Ukraine war, which began in February 2022, has resulted in significant loss of life, displacement of millions, and widespread destruction. While European nations continue to support Ukraine militarily and economically, leaders such as Frederiksen argue that stopping the war now would embolden Russia for future aggression. Meanwhile, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reiterated his stance on bringing an end to the war, claiming that both Ukraine and Russia are prepared for negotiations.Musk, known for his outspoken views on global politics, expressed his frustration with the ongoing conflict in a post on X. He accused European leaders of supporting endless warfare, stating:Musk’s remarks were in direct response to Frederiksen’s call for increased military support for Ukraine. He shared her comments, which emphasized the urgency of scaling up European defenses against Russia.Frederiksen has been a strong advocate for Ukraine, warning that Putin’s ambitions extend beyond Ukraine and could threaten the stability of the entire European continent. During a recent address to reporters, she stated:Her comments reflect the growing concerns among European leaders about Russia’s long-term objectives. She also argued that Ukraine must emerge victorious in the war, as allowing Russia to win would only encourage further aggression:One of Frederiksen’s most debated statements was her assertion that peace in Ukraine could be ""more dangerous than the ongoing war."" She explained that if the war were to end in a frozen conflict or ceasefire, Russia could use the opportunity to rebuild its forces and prepare for further invasions.Her remarks have drawn mixed reactions, with some supporting her emphasis on continued resistance and others, including Musk, interpreting them as an endorsement of prolonged conflict.Meanwhile, former U.S. President Donald Trump has weighed in on the war, reiterating his efforts to broker peace. During a joint address to Congress, Trump stated that he has been working tirelessly to bring an end to the conflict, even though Americans are not directly involved as victims.He criticized European nations for prioritizing oil purchases from Russia over defending Ukraine, saying:Trump also claimed that both Ukraine and Russia are ready to negotiate an end to the war, though no official confirmation has been provided by either country’s leadership.Musk’s remarks have reignited debates over the West’s role in the Ukraine war. While some agree with his assessment that European leaders are prolonging the conflict, others argue that continued military support for Ukraine is necessary to prevent Russian expansion.Social media responses have been divided, with critics accusing Musk of oversimplifying the complexities of war and supporters praising him for challenging the prevailing narrative. His comments also reflect a broader debate over whether Western nations should push for a negotiated peace or continue military aid to Ukraine.","Tech billionaire Elon Musk has sparked controversy with his recent remarks on the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war.

Why TSMC's investment in the US has sparked debate in Taiwan



Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te has defended Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 's ( TSMC ) decision to invest $100 billion in the United States, insisting at a joint news conference that the move was driven by business necessity rather than political pressure from the Trump administration.""TSMC's decision is necessary for its future development. The government did not face pressure from the United States during TSMC's investment process in the US,"" Lai said, addressing growing concerns among Taiwanese citizens that the island might lose a crucial economic and strategic asset.TSMC, the world's largest chip manufacturer, announced Monday it would expand its Arizona operations with three additional manufacturing plants and two packaging facilities. The investment raises TSMC's total US commitment to $165 billion, more than doubling its previous pledges.TSMC CEO C.C. Wei reinforced the business-driven narrative, stating the decision came after extensive market analysis. ""We have done a lot of analysis, and I've communicated with all our customers,"" Wei said. ""It turns out that TSMC's current expansion plan in the United States is not enough to meet their demand.""Both leaders sought to reassure Taiwanese citizens that domestic operations would not suffer. Wei explicitly stated that production in Taiwan would not be negatively affected, noting the company currently employs 10,000 people researching advanced 1.0 nanometer chips in Taiwan.The announcement has sparked debate in Taiwan, where the semiconductor industry is viewed as both an economic pillar and a strategic shield against potential Chinese aggression. Critics, including opposition legislator Wang Hung-wei, questioned what Taiwan had gained in return for allowing its advanced manufacturing to move overseas.The expanded investment comes amid heightened US-Taiwan tensions, with President Trump previously criticizing Taiwan for having ""stolen"" the semiconductor business from American companies. Trump has also pressed Taiwan to increase its defense spending from the current 2.45% of GDP to as high as 10%, with Lai recently pledging to raise it above 3%.","TSMC announced Monday it would expand its Arizona operations with three additional manufacturing plants and two packaging facilities.

New York governor on Canada threat



Michigan Public Service Commission head on Canada threat



A Canadian lawmaker recently issued a warning to the United States, threatening to escalate charges or completely cut off electricity exports in response to President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on Canadian imports announced recently. In a post on social media platform Twitter, Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario—Canada’s most populous province —- promised to retaliate with gusto. In a statement posted on X, Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, said ""I won't hesitate to increase this surcharge or, if necessary, shut the electricity off completely."" Ford added, ""Ontario and Canada are America's largest customer and export destination. Unfortunately, we have been left with no choice but to respond with our own tariffs and charges that will make life more expensive for Americans at a time when the cost of living is at an all-time high.""In 2023, Ontario reportedly supplied electricity to 1.5 million U.S. homes and served as a key exporter to states like New York, Michigan, and Minnesota. It remains unclear whether he was referring solely to Ontario’s energy exports or suggesting a broader Canadian cutoff.Ford also reaffirmed his earlier pledge to mirror Trump’s 25% tariffs with equivalent taxes on goods entering the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, and China. “I [didn’t] start this tariff war, but we’re going to win this tariff war,” he asserted. While acknowledging that Canada’s federal government is spearheading the response, Ford stressed provincial solidarity, saying, “We’re going to stand shoulder to shoulder no matter who’s in the federal government.”On March 6, President Trump announced that he would temporarily pause the 25% tariffs on US imports from Mexico and Canada that are covered under a 2020 trade agreement. The President signed two executive orders stating the exemptions would apply to US imports of products from both Mexico and Canada that are covered by the USMCA. Goods that are not covered by the agreement remain subject to tariffs.When asked about Ford's threat, New York Governor Kathy Hochul downplayed the likelihood of action, citing their cordial relationship. Hochul told NewYork Post, “I’d be happy to have additional conversations with him on how we can support each other during this crisis,” Hochul said. “I feel positive that anything within his power that he can control – that we do not have a target on our backs.”At the same time, Hochul blasted the Trump administration for tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, warning that they could prove detrimental to New York farmers. The governor also warned that the tariffs could increase costs for consumers on agricultural products like dairy, fruits and vegetables.Commenting on Ford's threat, Dan Scripps, the chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, said that Michigan gets a lot of electricity from Canada but doesn't actually use it. He added that the vast majority of the electricity Michiganders use is actually produced in Michigan.","Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, promised to retaliate with gusto.

With agency inputs.

The US State Department is set to use artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and revoke visas of foreign students suspected of supporting Palestinian Hamas militants. This initiative, dubbed ""Catch and Revoke,"" will involve AI-assisted reviews of social media accounts belonging to tens of thousands of student visa holders.The AI system will analyse posts on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to detect any content that suggests support for Hamas. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasised that the US has ""zero tolerance for foreign visitors who support terrorists"" and that violators of US law, including international students , could face visa denial, revocation, and deportation.This move follows an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in January aimed at combating antisemitism. The order pledges to expel non-citizen college students and others involved in pro-Palestinian protests, which have intensified amid Israel's military operations in Gaza.The State Department is coordinating this effort with the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. The first known instance of visa revocation under this initiative occurred recently, with a student's visa being revoked for allegedly participating in what the department termed as ""Hamas-supporting disruptions”.Civil rights organisations have expressed concern over the use of AI for such purposes, arguing that AI tools may not accurately interpret complex political speech. Sarah McLaughlin, a scholar at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, stated that AI cannot reliably assess nuanced discussions on contentious issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.As the US ramps up its efforts to scrutinize visa holders based on their online activity, the implications for international students and the broader debate on free speech and privacy continue to unfold.Washington has designated Hamas as a ""foreign terrorist organization.""The Islamist group's October 7, 2023 attack killed 1,200 people, with over 250 taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel's subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza authorities. It has internally displaced nearly everyone there and led to accusations of genocide and war crimes that Israel denies.","The US State Department is set to use artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and revoke visas of foreign students suspected of supporting Palestinian Hamas militants.

What Melinda Gates said about choosing Microsoft over IBM



“My hiring manager at IBM, a female, said to me, ‘Okay, are you ready to accept the job offer?’ And I said, ‘Well, I have one more company to go interview—this little company, Microsoft. It was tiny. She said, ‘If they give you an offer, you should take it.’ And it dumbfounded me. Here's this woman who's supposed to be my manager, giving me a piece of career advice.”

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates ' ex-wife Melinda French Gates revealed an important piece of advice she received early in her career. During a recent interview, she said that this advice —which was to forgo a stable job at IBM for a small startup that later became Microsoft — helped in her journey to becoming a billionaire. Gates mentioned that she got this advice from an IBM supervisor who made this suggestion despite the company’s interest. This made Gates leave a senior position at IBM to join the then-nascent Microsoft, where she spent nine years and played an important role in the company’s growth. She rose to the position of general manager of information products at Microsoft, which is now a $3.1 trillion tech giant.In an interview with LinkedIn (shared by Fortune), which is available only to the professional networking platform’s premium subscribers, Gates said:While the move to Microsoft on the West Coast required uprooting her life, the appeal of being part of something potentially groundbreaking was irresistible, Gates added.“I didn't know anybody in Seattle. It was moving to the West Coast, but I was so excited about what they were doing. I was like, ‘I want to be part of that,’” she continued.During the interview she even encouraged others to embrace similar leaps of faith in their careers, emphasising that taking risks can lead to exceptional achievements.“I remind them all the time you can pivot careers. You can change. You can go over here. It's not like one or two paths that carry you forward, even though you had plans before this,” Gates added.Gates is now among the top ten richest women in the US with a net worth of $15.2 billion. She also noted that this outcome may not have been the same had she not acted on the advice to choose a startup over IBM, which was an established corporation at that time.",Melinda French Gates revealed an important piece of advice she received early in her career.

While US tech giants face market corrections, Chinese tech stocks have surged by over 40% in 2025, fueled by AI advancements and supportive policies. Societe Generale SA highlights these opportunities.

What's behind China Shining other than Deepseek



China’s tech giants are surging ahead of their once-dominant US counterparts, fueled by DeepSeek ’s impact on demand for Chinese stocks -— a trend that many investors believe still has room to grow further. A balanced portfolio of China’s seven top technology companies, including Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings, labeled the '7 titans' by Societe Generale SA, has soared by over 40% in 2025. As for the numbers, these Chinese megacaps from the technology industry have grown by $439 billion and counting. Other than Alibaba and Tencent, Societe Generale SA's Chinese lineup includes Xiaomi, BYD Co, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, JD.com Inc, and NetEase Inc; based on their market size and growth prospects.As for America's 'Magnificent Seven'; the term was coined by the Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett in the year 2023 when commenting on the seven companies commonly recognized for their market dominance, technological impact, and changes to consumer behavior and economic trends. The names are: Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms (Facebook parent), Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. The stocks of these US companies have slumped by about 10%, dragging the Nasdaq 100 Index to the edge of a correction, since the beginning of this year. The slump has been more pertinent since the last few weeks or we say after DeepSeek created havoc in the US stock market . This unexpected turnabout is said to have blindsided much of Wall Street.Earlier this year, the Nasdaq hit a fresh peak, while Chinese equities languished under the weight of regulatory clampdowns and a lackluster consumer rebound. Then, seemingly overnight, DeepSeek shattered the assumption that China’s catch-up to the US AI leadership was years away -— if achievable at all.As to what is behind the new-found rally in China' technology stocks? As Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee told Bloomberg, “The ingredients for China tech to shine are in place: Robust government backing, rebounding profits, and AI as a long-term growth engine.” He added, “In contrast, U. tech’s two-year valuation run-up is hitting a wall with disappointing earnings and broader economic pressures, sparking a shift in capital from the US toward Europe and China.”This week, China’s tech rally gained further steam as Beijing unveiled plans to bolster support for the sector, complemented by a flurry of new AI innovations from companies like Alibaba. As reported by Bloomberg, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which includes most of SocGen’s highlighted stocks, jumped more than 6% this week, hitting its highest mark since late 2021. Despite the sharp rise, SocGen analysts, led by Frank Benzimra reportedly argue that the “7 titans” remain attractively priced. As per a February 28 note, the group trades at 18 times forward earnings—over 40% cheaper than the America's Magnificent Seven.","China's tech giants are surging ahead of their once-dominant US counterparts, fueled by DeepSeek's impact on demand for Chinese stocks.

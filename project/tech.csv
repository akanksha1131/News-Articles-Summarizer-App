Gemini Comes To Chrome: How Google Is Improving Browser With AI - Explained





Google parent Alphabet Inc shares surged to their highest level in history on Wednesday, fueled by a wave of overwhelmingly positive reviews for the newly released version of its Gemini artificial intelligence model. The Google parent's stock climbed as much as 6.9%, marking its largest gain in two months and besting the performance of the broader market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The robust rally was sparked by investor confidence in the company's leading position within the rapidly evolving tech landscape.The momentum was palpable in trading pits. More than 376,000 call options on Alphabet had changed hands by 11:00 a.m. in New York, well above the recent full-day average. For context, the technology-focused Nasdaq 100 Index was up 0.8%, while the S&P 500 Index gained about 0.5%.The new Gemini model, unveiled on Tuesday, received ""glowing reviews about its capabilities,"" Bloomberg reported, contrasting its reception with the ""mixed reactions"" that met OpenAI’s GPT-5 model earlier in the year.The enthusiasm prompted one analyst to pose a pointed question: “Is Gemini 3 What GPT-5 was supposed to be?” Robert W.Baird & Co. analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note to clients, citing the ""rave reviews"" for the latest iteration. Sebastian highlighted a key competitive edge for Google: ""In addition to benefits to Search engagement and monetization, Google also combines real-time web indexing with advanced model training, which we view as a key competitive advantage,” he added.This AI-driven jump is the latest piece of good news for the Mountain View, California-based giant. Earlier this week, Loop Capital upgraded Alphabet's stock to ""buy,"" suggesting that previous concerns had been “obliterated under waves of AI enthusiasm.”Furthermore, the stock received a rare vote of confidence last week when Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed it had built a stake in Alphabet during the third quarter. Bloomberg noted this move represents a show of faith from the legendary investor, who generally avoids deep exposure to tech stocks outside of Apple Inc.Wednesday's rally further solidified what has been a banner 2025 for Alphabet. Its 57% jump year-to-date makes it the best-performing member of the ""Magnificent 7"" cohort and puts its returns at more than three times that of the Nasdaq 100 Index.","Alphabet Inc shares surged to their highest level in history on Wednesday.

Google adds ability to verify if a photo was generated or edited by Google AI: What it is and how to use,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-adds-ability-to-verify-if-a-photo-was-generated-or-edited-by-google-ai-what-it-is-and-how-to-use/articleshow/125471715.cms,"Gemini Comes To Chrome: How Google Is Improving Browser With AI - Explained

How it works

C2PA gaining momentum





Google is rolling out a new feature within the Gemini app that allows users to quickly verify whether an image has been created or edited by a Google AI tool, addressing growing concerns about the origin of digital content. Starting today, users can simply upload an image to the Gemini app and ask, “Is this AI-generated?” to receive an instant verification.The initial launch is focused solely on images, leveraging SynthID, Google's proprietary invisible AI watermarking technology. However, the company confirmed that verification for both video and audio content will be added ""soon,"" with plans to expand the functionality beyond the Gemini app and into services like Google Search. The most significant planned expansion involves integrating support for industry-wide C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) content credentials.If you see an image and want to confirm it has been made by Google AI, upload it to the Gemini app and ask a question such as: ""Was this created with Google AI?"" or “Is this AI-generated?” Gemini will check for the SynthID watermark and use its own reasoning to return a response that gives you more context about the content you encounter online.While the current tool only detects content generated by Google's own models (via SynthID), the move to support C2PA would allow Gemini to verify the source of content created by a much wider array of AI tools and creative software, including competitors like OpenAI's Sora.The announcement comes as C2PA gains further momentum across the industry. Google also revealed that images generated by its new, high-resolution AI model, Nano Banana Pro, will automatically have C2PA metadata embedded.This follows news earlier this week that TikTok will also use C2PA metadata as part of its own invisible watermarking for AI-generated content. While manual verification within the Gemini app provides a useful immediate step, industry experts emphasize that the full potential of SynthID and C2PA credentials will only be realized when social media platforms implement better automatic flagging of AI content, shifting the responsibility away from individual users.","Gemini is a new tool that allows users to quickly verify whether an image has been created or edited by a Google AI tool.

SoftBank may be planning $3 billion investment to convert Ohio EV plant into OpenAI data centre,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/softbank-may-be-planning-3-billion-investment-to-convert-ohio-ev-plant-into-openai-data-centre/articleshow/125469133.cms,"SoftBank’s all-in AI Bet and Nvidia divestment







Japanese conglomerate SoftBank is reportedly planning to invest up to $3 billion to overhaul an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing facility in Lordstown, Ohio, transforming it into a specialised production site for equipment for OpenAI’s massive new data centres, according to a report. According to news agency Reuters (via The Information), the Lordstown site, which SoftBank acquired in August for $375 million, will be retooled to manufacture modular data centre units that are portable, pre-assembled equipment designed for faster deployment and scalable capacity.These units are intended for OpenAI’s forthcoming AI data centers, including a major facility planned for Milam County, Texas, and other locations across the US. Manufacturing is expected to begin early next year, with the facility also housing a small working data centre as a demonstration model.This investment is part of a broader joint venture announced by SoftBank at the White House in January, where the company pledged $18 billion toward building a nationwide advanced AI network known as the Stargate Project. OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle announced plans for five initial US data centres under the project in September.SoftBank’s remodelling of the Ohio facility can be seen as a clear indicator of CEO Masayoshi Son's strategy to go all-in on the generative AI boom centred around ChatGPT-creator OpenAI. SoftBank recently divested its substantial stake in leading chipmaker Nvidia, a stake valued at approximately $5.8 billion.In October, Sam Altman said OpenAI aims to build 30 gigawatts of computing capacity at an estimated cost of $1.4 trillion, and ultimately scale to adding about 1 gigawatt a week. Unlike rivals Meta and Google, OpenAI does not have an advertising or cloud services business to help cover the cost of building out these data centres.","SoftBank is reportedly planning to invest up to $3 billion to overhaul an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing facility in Lordstown, Ohio.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124805693,imgsize-7992,width-400,resizemode-4/x-twitter.jpg"
Microsoft confirms it is working on free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-confirms-it-is-working-on-free-version-of-xbox-cloud-gaming/articleshow/124805857.cms,"Xbox

Xbox’s higher sales targets







Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees. The ad-supported service is expected to provide users with access to:The company is reportedly testing a model where users will view approximately two minutes of pre-roll advertisements before a game starts streaming. Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

""bulletproof hosting""

""bulletproof""

“Yalishanda”

What did the cybersecurity agencies of these countries said about the sanctions



“Our new joint guidance on bulletproof hosting providers highlights best practices to mitigate potential cybercriminal activity, including recommended actions that ISPs can implement to decrease the usefulness of BPH infrastructure.”

“These so-called bulletproof hosting service providers like Media Land provide cybercriminals essential services to aid them in attacking businesses in the United States and in allied countries.”

“Cyber criminals think that they can act in the shadows, targeting hard-working British people and ruining livelihoods with impunity.

But they are mistaken – together with our allies, we are exposing their dark networks and going after those responsible.”

“high confidence”

“know your customer”





The US, the UK, and Australia have announced sanctions against Russian companies that allegedly provide(BPH) services used by ransomware gangs and other cybercriminals. BPH providers lease servers to criminal operations, helping them resist efforts to disrupt their malicious activities, such as phishing, malware delivery, and command-and-control. These providers market themselves asbecause they disregard victim complaints and law enforcement takedown requests. These sanctions also apply to three Media Land executives: Aleksandr Volosovik (who has promoted the business on cybercriminal forums under the name), Kirill Zatolokin (who handles customer payments), and Yulia Pankova (who supported the company with legal matters and finances).In a post shared on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the US cyber defence agency, CISA wrote:According to a report by Bleeping Computer, the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) specifically targeted the Russian company Media Land.This company reportedly provided services to various cybercrime marketplaces and ransomware groups, including LockBit, BlackSuit, and Play. OFAC also designated three related sister companies: Media Land Technology, Data Centre Kirishi, and ML Cloud and alleged the same against them.US officials said that Media Land’s infrastructure was also used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on US companies and key services, including telecommunications systems.The UK’s Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office stated that Volosovik has also worked with several known cybercrime groups, including Evil Corp, Black Basta, and LockBit.Moreover, OFAC designated Aeza Group LLC, another bulletproof hosting (BPH) provider that was sanctioned in July, as well as the UK-based Hypercore Ltd, which Aeza used as a front company after the sanctions. Serbian and Uzbek companies that offered technical support were also designated.Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley said,UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper added,Five Eyes cybersecurity agencies also released joint guidance to help internet service providers and network defenders reduce cybercriminal activity that uses bulletproof hosting infrastructure.They suggested buildinglists of malicious internet resources based on threat intelligence feeds, running regular traffic analysis, and placing filters at network boundaries, while keeping in mind how these steps may affect legitimate traffic.ISPs can also improve security by informing customers about malicious resource lists and by implementingsystems that require verified identity details from new clients, as bulletproof hosting providers often switch between temporary email addresses and phone numbers.The sanctions freeze all property belonging to the named individuals and organisations in the US, the UK and Australia. They also expose anyone doing business with them to possible secondary sanctions or enforcement action.Earlier in February, these three nations also sanctioned ZServers/XHost, another Russia-based BPH provider, for supplying the LockBit ransomware group with attack infrastructure. Dutch police later took down its infrastructure by seizing 127 servers.","The US, the UK, and Australia have announced sanctions against Russian companies that allegedly provide(BPH) services used by cybercriminals.

How Elon Musk’s 7-year-old pay package court case may cost Tesla $26 billion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-elon-musks-7-year-old-pay-package-court-case-may-cost-tesla-26-billion/articleshow/125468269.cms,"Looming judgment and $26 billion risk



What happens to Musk’s $1 trillion pay package







Tesla is facing a potential $26 billion hit to its profits over the next two years, stemming from the long-running legal dispute over CEO Elon Musk’s massive 2018 compensation package. While the company recently approved a new, record-breaking $1 trillion pay plan for Musk, the immediate and most pressing financial risk lies with the earlier package, which is currently tied up at the Delaware Supreme Court, a report by news agency Reuters said.The risk is triggered if the Delaware Supreme Court upholds a lower-court ruling that previously invalidated Musk's 2018 compensation. Should Tesla’s appeal fail, the company will be forced to account for a replacement stock-compensation package promised to Musk, valued at the much higher current stock price.This replacement package, valued at an estimated $26 billion, will need to be booked as an expense by August 2027. This means that $26 billion equals more than half of Tesla’s total net income since the company became profitable in 2019.Dividing the expense over eight quarters, as expected, would reduce Tesla’s profit by $3.25 billion each quarter – a figure larger than the company’s net income for nearly every quarter since 2019.Even if Tesla prevails in the 2018 dispute, the newly approved $1 trillion package will continue to squeeze profits over the next decade if Musk hits performance milestones. Tesla’s board has argued that the exorbitant pay packages are necessary to retain Musk and secure his focus on the automaker’s ambitious future goals.In a filing, the company admitted that a failed appeal on the 2018 package could cause “a material adverse impact on our business and reported earnings.”If the Delaware Supreme Court sides with Tesla, the company would incur no further accounting expenses, and the original 2018 stock options—valued at $116 billion today—would remain Musk's.","The risk is triggered if the Delaware Supreme Court upholds a lower-court ruling that previously invalidated Musk's 2018 compensation.

RBI governor’s digital innovation stance remains accommodative







The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is maintaining a highly cautious stance toward cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, Governor Sanjay Malhotra said, citing the “huge risk” associated with the assets. Delivering a memorial lecture at the Delhi School of Economics, Malhotra stated, ""Stablecoins, cryptos, they have a huge risk, and so we are adopting a very cautious approach towards it. ""The Governor’s remarks come at a time when the global crypto market capitalisation has exceeded $4 trillion and US dollar-backed stablecoins have amassed over $300 billion, news agency Reuters cited data from CoinGecko. India’s chief economic adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran had previously highlighted the rising popularity of dollar stablecoins as a potential challenge for global monetary policy in the coming year.In contrast to its cautious view on private digital assets, Malhotra noted that the RBI remains highly supportive of government-backed digital innovations.“When it comes to digital innovations like UPI (Unified Payments Interface) or digital lending, our stance has been very accommodative and very enabling,” he explained.Malhotra also reiterated the RBI’s preference for its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) over private stablecoins or cryptocurrencies, a position he affirmed last month at an International Monetary Fund and World Bank event.On a question regarding the future of crypto regulation in India, Malhotra clarified that the government must take the final call.“The government has to take a final view.

A civilisation level shift

A future built off planet







When Elon Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sat down to discuss the future of artificial intelligence during an event held on November 19 in Washington, D.C., they arrived at a startling conclusion. Earth simply does not have the energy or cooling capacity to support the next generation of AI. In their view, supercomputers will soon outgrow the planet, forcing humanity to push computation into orbit where limitless solar power and natural cooling await. The session, moderated by Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Communications and Information Technology, Abdullah Alswaha, focused on AI advances, next-generation technology and the emerging field of space-based computing.Musk argued that if civilisation continues on a stable trajectory, AI in space is not just likely but inevitable. To reach even a fraction of a Kardashev Type II civilisation, a stage where humanity harnesses a meaningful percentage of the Sun’s energy, we would need to deploy solar powered AI satellites in deep space.Earth receives only about one two billionth of the Sun’s total energy. Musk explained that if AI continues scaling at its current pace, emerging systems will demand hundreds of gigawatts to terawatts of power each year.For comparison, the entire United States consumes roughly 460 gigawatts of electricity on average.This is why he think “Earth can’t power the future.” In his view, the next generation of AI will need far more electricity and cooling than the planet can realistically provide. Power grids, land, water and cooling systems cannot scale fast enough to sustain terawatt-level computing, while space offers continuous sunlight, natural heat radiation and no resource limits.According to Musk, powering future AI models on Earth would require building energy infrastructure on a scale that is effectively impossible. Space, however, offers continuous solar energy, lighter and cheaper power generation, and no need for heavy cooling or battery systems.Jensen Huang added that the cooling problem is just as severe as the energy challenge. In today’s data centres, more than 95 percent of a supercomputer’s weight is cooling infrastructure. As AI accelerates, these systems will become hotter and denser, making Earth based cooling increasingly expensive.In space, chips simply radiate heat. With no water and no atmosphere, satellites can shed heat naturally. This could allow future AI systems to be far smaller, lighter and significantly more efficient.Musk envisions swarms of solar powered AI satellites floating in deep space, constantly fed by uninterrupted sunlight. These platforms could host:Because solar panels in space do not need glass, metal framing or heavy support structures, they can be produced more cheaply. Cooling would be passive. Energy would be abundant. Maintenance could be handled robotically.Both leaders emphasised that once AI reaches the terawatt scale, which Musk believes could happen within five years, the planet becomes a bottleneck.Key constraints include:Space bypasses all of these limitations.Musk framed the issue not only as a technological decision but also a civilisational necessity. Human societies often assume progress is linear, he cautioned, but history shows that civilisations rise and fall. Moving AI to space is part of ensuring humanity remains on an upward arc.Huang described the idea as the dream, a vision where human innovation escapes Earth’s constraints and expands into the wider solar system.If Musk and Huang are correct, the world’s most powerful computers will not be built in Silicon Valley, Taiwan or Texas, but in space, silently orbiting the planet and converting sunlight into intelligence.It marks a profound shift, the first time in history that computation, one of humanity’s defining tools, may leave Earth entirely.And if their projections are accurate, that shift may be closer than most people realise.","Elon Musk and Jensen Huang say Earth cannot support the next wave of AI.

What may derail Xiaomi's car success story





Xiaomi Electric Vehicles division hit a major milestone. Xiaomi's fast-growing electric vehicle (EV) division posted its first quarterly profit in the three months ended September, marking a key milestone for the electronics maker’s push into the auto industry, as reported by Bloomberg. The unit generated 700 million yuan ($98 million) in profit, reversing a 300 million yuan loss from the previous quarter and helping more than double Xiaomi’s overall net income, the company reported this week.The result places Xiaomi among the few Chinese EV manufacturers operating profitably, as it races to become one of the world’s top five carmakers and prepares to challenge America's Tesla and China's very own BYD home and overseas. Xiaomi aims to begin selling EVs in Europe in 2027. Incidentally, Xiaomi's biggest launch of 2025 received admiration from an unlikely industry executive. Ford CEO Jim Farley expressed admiration for Xiaomi SU7. Farley said that he has been driving the imported SUV7 for six months and praised the EV for its performance and technology integration. Ford CEO's endorsement underscores the rapid advancements in Chinese electric vehicle technology.For co-founder and CEO Lei Jun, the early profitability serves as a validation of his ambitious carmaking strategy. Xiaomi’s debut SU7 electric sedan and first SUV have drawn strong demand, with executives saying on Tuesday that the company will hit its 2025 target of 350,000 EV deliveries this week—more than a month ahead of schedule. October shipments totaled over 40,000, matching September’s figure.As per Bloomberg report, Xiaomi now expects to deliver more than 400,000 vehicles in 2025 and celebrated its 500,000th vehicle rolling off the production line on Thursday. The EV and artificial intelligence division reached profitability just 19 months after launching the SU7, a much faster trajectory than many industry peers.The rapid scale-up comes despite structural challenges, including a global memory chip shortage pushing up costs across Xiaomi’s EV and smartphone businesses, and China’s gradual phaseout of tax incentives for electric-car purchases. Those pressures, combined with fierce competition and occasional factory delays, have clouded the company’s long-term outlook and weighed on its stock, making it one of China’s worst-performing tech shares this year.Still, Lei has signaled confidence in sustaining momentum. Xiaomi plans to increase production capacity, reduce customer wait times -- currently as long as nine months for some models -- and invest heavily in new technologies, including more advanced AI-driven driver-assistance features.","Xiaomi's fast-growing electric vehicle (EV) division posted its first quarterly profit in the three months ended September.

US President Donald Trump is planning to sign an executive order granting the federal government unilateral power to regulate artificial intelligence (AI). If this legislation is passed, it could potentially lead to lawsuits against US states with their own AI laws. The draft order, obtained by The Verge, proposes creating anunder the Attorney General,This Task Force would be empowered to sue states whose laws may hinder the growth of the AI industry. The draft explicitly references laws such as California's regulations on AI safety andand a Colorado law addressingThe Task Force's work would involve occasional consultation with White House Special Advisors, including David Sacks, who is Trump’s Special Advisor for AI and Crypto.Trump has recently advocated for a moratorium on state AI laws, a position he reiterated at the US-Saudi Investment Forum this week. The US President said that it was a way to combatideology.Trump noted.As part of the AI Action Plan released earlier this year, Trump asked several federal agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to explore ways to bypassstate and local rules to support the AI industry’s growth and innovation. The executive order presents a 90-day plan for key agencies, including the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Department of Commerce and the FCC, to carry out this directive.Within 90 days of the order being signed, the Secretary of Commerce will be asked to publish a report listing which states may be violating Trump’s AI policy goals. The report will also decide which states may lose eligibility for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, which funds rural broadband access.At the same time, the FTC will be asked to issue a statement on whether states that require AI companies to alter their algorithms could be breaking laws that ban unfair or deceptive practices.At Politico’s AI & Tech Summit in September, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr mentioned one possible reading of the Communications Act that could allow the FCC to override state law.Carr told Politico’s Alex Burns.Carr also suggested that the FCC’s powers could block a proposed California law that would have required AI companies to disclose their safety-testing models. He said this would support Trump’s goal of stoppingthat he believes carries ideological bias.Carr also pointed to the European Union’s Digital Safety Act.

The crypto market seems to be in a free fall. The Crypto industry's steep downturn worsened, with Bitcoin sliding to its lowest level in seven months and extending a digital-asset wipeout that has erased more than $1 trillion in value, Bloomberg reported. Bitcoin fell to as low as $88,522 before recovering some ground early Thursday. According to Bloomberg report, the latest downturn has hit investors across the board — from retail traders buying the dip to digital-asset treasury firms whose stock-price premiums have evaporated.Cryptocurrencies clawed back some losses after Nvidia issued a strong revenue forecast, easing concerns that the global boom in AI spending could be fading. Bitcoin was up 1.9% as of 8:30 a.m. in London. Analysts told Bloomberg they are now watching for key psychological levels at $85,000 and $80,000, with particular focus on the year’s trough of $74,425 — set in April amid tariff-related market turmoil. The total value of cryptocurrencies, which peaked near $4.3 trillion on October 6, has fallen to roughly $3.2 trillion, largely representing paper losses rather than actual cash exits.Market fragility became clear on October 10 when more than $19 billion in leveraged crypto positions were forcibly liquidated, triggering a cascade of margin calls, exchange-traded product outflows and a sharp slowdown in new buyer demand.“Investors are stabbing in the dark a bit — they haven’t got any direction on macro, so all they can see is what on-chain whales are doing and they’re getting quite worried about it,” James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, told Bloomberg.Bitcoin’s run above $126,000 earlier this year had been fueled by expectations of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts and surging institutional adoption. Both narratives have since faltered, prompting momentum traders to retreat and dealing a blow to digital-asset treasury firms whose valuations ballooned during the rally.Ether also weakened, dropping back below $3,000. After lagging Bitcoin earlier in the year, the second-largest token surged to nearly $5,000 in August — briefly surpassing its 2021 record — before giving up those gains. “I think we are closer to the end of the selling than the beginning, but markets are uncomfortable and crypto could have more downside here before it finds a base to recover from,” Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, told Bloomberg.","Bitcoin slides to its lowest level in seven months, extending a digital-asset wipeout that has erased more than $1 trillion in value.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk ‘agrees’







Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft's AI CEO, has publicly defended the company’s AI advancements amid growing user criticism. In a viral post on social media, Suleyman expressed disbelief at people dismissing AI as underwhelming. His condemnation comes days after users slammed the tech giant for embedding AI features like Copilot into Windows, claiming that the features were rolled out without addressing fundamental system issues or providing opt-out options.“Jeez there are so many cynics! It cracks me up when I hear people call AI underwhelming,” he wrote.The Microsoft executive contrasted today’s AI capabilities such as real-time conversations and on-demand media generation with the mobile games of the 1990s to highlight today’s technological leap.“I grew up playing Snake on a Nokia phone! The fact that people are unimpressed that we can have a fluent conversation with a super smart AI that can generate any image/video is mindblowing to me,” he added.While Tesla CEO Elon Musk replied with a brief “Good point,” expressing agreement with Suleyman's perspective, the post attracted over 500 critical responses.The backlash centers on Microsoft's recent Windows updates that push “agentic AI” features, which critics argue are buggy, resource-intensive, and intrusive.Reports have highlighted Copilot's troublingly low 30% accuracy rate alongside mounting privacy concerns. Users argue that Microsoft is prioritising flashy AI integration over fixing core operating system problems and respecting user choice.Recently, Suleyman cautioned AI researchers against pursuing Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) stating it should be treated as an “anti-goal”. ASI is theoretical AI with reasoning capacities far exceeding human levels.Speaking on a recent episode of the Silicon Valley Girl Podcast, Suleyman articulated his concerns about the vision of ASI, explaining that it ""doesn't feel like a positive vision of the future"" primarily due to the inherent risks involved in control.“It would be very hard to contain something like that or align it to our values,” he stated. Suleyman noted that his team is instead focusing its efforts on building a “humanist superintelligence,” which will prioritise supporting and enhancing human interests.","Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft's AI CEO, has publicly defended the company’s AI advancements amid growing user criticism.

Threat reaches beyond Brazil despite regional focus





A sophisticated malware campaign is making use of WhatsApp to distribute the Eternidade Stealer banking trojan across Brazil, using social engineering tactics and automated message propagation to compromise financial credentials and personal data. Brazil is among Meta-owned WhatsApp’s biggest markets.Trustwave SpiderLabs researchers uncovered the campaign, which marks a notable evolution in Brazilian cybercrime tactics. The attack begins with an obfuscated Visual Basic Script that deploys two distinct payloads: a Python-based WhatsApp worm and an MSI installer containing the Delphi-built Eternidade Stealer. It is not clear if virus has spread to other countries as well.The Python component hijacks WhatsApp Web sessions using the open-source WPPConnect project, harvesting victims' entire contact lists while filtering out groups and business accounts. The malware then automatically sends malicious attachments to all contacts using time-based greetings and personalized names to appear legitimate.According to Trustwave SpiderLabs, the stealer employs Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) to dynamically retrieve command-and-control server addresses from a terra.com.br email inbox.This technique allows attackers to update their infrastructure and evade detection or takedowns, mirroring tactics recently observed in the Water Saci campaign.The malware specifically targets Brazilian users, self-terminating if the operating system language isn't Brazilian Portuguese. Once active, it monitors banking portals, payment services and cryptocurrency platforms including Bradesco, BTG Pactual, MercadoPago, Binance and MetaMask. When targeted applications are detected, the stealer deploys custom credential-harvesting overlays.Analysis of the threat actor's infrastructure revealed strict geofencing that permits only Brazilian and Argentine connections, with blocked attempts redirected to a Google error page. Despite the regional focus, Trustwave documented 454 connection attempts from 38 countries, with the United States accounting for 196 connections.The researchers emphasized that defenders should monitor for suspicious WhatsApp activity, unexpected MSI or script executions and maintain vigilance against this evolving threat targeting Latin American financial institutions.","Trustwave SpiderLabs researchers uncovered the campaign, which marks a notable evolution in Brazilian cybercrime tactics.

Elon Musk’s $1 trillion package is double the GDP of Bangladesh







Tesla CEO Elon Musk is once again in headlines for work ethics. Musk has been long known for his extreme work ethic, often describing his long hours and personal sacrifice as the foundation of his success. Now, once again that philosophy is under scrutiny but this time it is for his record-breaking $1 trillion compensation package which was recently approved by Tesla shareholders. Elon Musk has a reputation of working tirelessly dates back to decades. Back in 2014, in a commencement speech at USC’s Marshall School of Business, he urged the graduates to ‘work super hard’. He also recalled how he and his brother slept in their office and showered at the YMCA while building their first company. “If somebody else is working 50 hours [per week] and you’re working 100, you’ll get twice as much done in the course of a year,” Musk said.During Tesla’s Model 3 production crunch in 2018, Musk famously slept on the factory floor to monitor operations, explaining that “the couch was too narrow.”Fast-forward to 2025, Elon Musk’s work ethics are now being tested against ambitious milestones tied to his new pay plan. In order to unlock the fill payout, Tesla must achieve:* Market capitalisation: Boosting Tesla’s market capitalisation from its current $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion.* Robotaxi fleet: Putting 1 million robotaxis into service.* Vehicle sales: Selling 12 million more cars.* FSD subscriptions: Achieving 10 million Full Self-Driving (FSD) subscriptions.* Humanoid robots: Producing 1 million humanoid robots.* Tesla's board had argued that failing to approve the massive payout risked losing Musk to other interests, positioning the deal as essential for securing the CEO's commitment to Tesla's future as a leader in AI and robotics.On X, Musk admitted the goals are daunting, “It sure is a tall order. There will inevitably be some bumps along the way, but, with a truly immense amount of work, I think these goals can be accomplished.”Musk’s philosophy that success comes from outworking everyone else has inspired countless entrepreneurs. Yet it has also drawn criticism. After Musk’s 2018 remark that “nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week,” labor advocates pushed back. United Auto Workers communications specialist Diana Hussein responded, “The people who fought for (including those who died) the 40-hour work week changed the world. It helped ensure corporate shills like you don’t exploit people’s work like you’d wish to.”The approval essentially grants Musk enormous influence over the electric vehicle (EV) company and aims to mitigate the risk of him focusing his attention on other ventures. Citing, World Bank table of GDP per country in 2024, news agency Reuters reported that Musk’s pay packageMusk's approved compensation package of nearly $878 billion is slightly less than the economic output of Poland ($915 billion), which has a population of 36 million people. The package is worth twice the GDP of Bangladesh, a country with 174 million people.It also said that only 20 countries recorded a 2024 GDP larger than Musk's compensation deal, based on World Bank figures. It is more than Belgium ($664.6 billion), Argentina ($633.3 billion), Sweden ($610.1 billion), Ireland ($577.4 billion) and Singapore ($547.4 billion).",Elon Musk’s $1 trillion package is double the GDP of Bangladesh.

“Everything that OpenAI does runs on Nvidia today.”





Nvidia recently reminded investors about its potential $100 billion investment in OpenAI . In its latest quarterly financial report, the chipmaker highlighted the distinction between an announcement and a signed contract for its investors. In the risk factors section of the quarterly filing (seen by CNBC), Nvidia wrote:This statement follows an event two months ago in which Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced a significant deal between the companies. At that time, Nvidia announced that it would invest $100 billion over several years, starting in 2026, as OpenAI’s AI supercomputing centres become operational. However, the exact cost of each data centre and the specific construction timeline were not shared at that time.This announcement came during a period when Nvidia was actively deploying its growing cash reserves to back companies that purchase its graphics processing units, or GPUs. Along with its arrangement with OpenAI, Nvidia also pointed to its $5 billion commitment to invest in Intel during the quarter and its agreement to invest up to $10 billion in Anthropic in its filings.When asked by CNBC, an OpenAI spokesperson did not offer a comment but directed attention to Huang’s remarks on the call, including his description of OpenAI as aand his view that the investment willNvidia noted.What sets the OpenAI arrangement apart is the size of the planned investment and the requirements that must be met for the full amount to be released. At the time of the announcement, a source told CNBC that an initial $10 billion would be available to OpenAI soon to support its efforts toward deploying its first gigawatt of capacity.Recently, Altman said that OpenAI is on track to end the year with a $20 billion annualised revenue run rate, which is notable given that ChatGPT is only three years old. He added that the company aims to reach hundreds of billions in revenue by 2030, though that projection does not cover its operating costs.Altogether, OpenAI has outlined roughly $1.4 trillion in infrastructure spending with various partners as it continues to scale its AI models and services. To accomplish this, the company depends on external funding.Even with uncertainty around the September agreement, Nvidia executives continue to speak positively about the collaboration with OpenAI. At Nvidia’s earnings call, where the company reported solid revenue and earnings above expectations, CFO Colette Kress highlighted OpenAI’s progress.Kress said.She noted that the companies areand that Nvidia isNvidia CEO Jensen Huang added,As OpenAI expands its data centre footprint, it is expected to continue purchasing Nvidia chips. However, it's also important to note that the ChatGPT maker has entered an agreement with Nvidia’s competitor, Advanced Micro Devices, committing to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD’s Instinct GPUs over multiple years and hardware generations, starting in the second half of next year.Meanwhile, a critical distinction of the AMD deal is that it includes formal signatures. As part of the agreement, AMD issued OpenAI a warrant to purchase up to 160 million shares of its common stock, with vesting tied to deployment volume and AMD’s share price. The pact was signed on October 5 by AMD CFO Jean Hu and OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar.","N Nvidia recently reminded investors about its potential $100 billion investment in OpenAI.

Optimus: Elon Musk’s bold bet



Nvidia’s benchmark







Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently outlined what he feels will trigger dramatic revaluation of the electric vehicle marker stock, drawing parallels to chip manufacturer Nvidia’s meteoric rise. Replaying to the question of a user on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk gave an answer on Telsa’s meteoric rise. A user on X recently asked the Tesla CEO that when will Tesla experience its own ‘Nvidia moment’. Replying to the user, Musk said that the company’s breakthrough moment will come with unsupervised self-driving at scale and, even more significantly, with the mass production of its Optimus humanoid robot.Elon Musk stressed on the fact that valuation of Tesla will witness a shift once its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology achieves widespread deployment without any human intervention. He also defended Tesla’s relativity modest AI training spend. Musk noted that the company’s vehicles can generate vast amount of real-world driving data which is used to refine the system.Former Tesla AI chief Andrej Karpathy recently praised the FSD system, describing a drive in his HW4 Model X as “basically flawless” and likening it to riding a magnetic levitation train.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly touted Optimus the humanoid robot. Musk believes that Optimus is Tesla’s future growth engine. He feels that Optimus will represent more than 80% of Tesla’s long-term value. Along with this, he also made some sweeping predictions about the potential of Optimus. Musk said that Optimus could:* Help countries like Japan address labor shortages* “Eliminate poverty” and enable universal income* Even serve as an “incredible surgeon”, providing advanced medical care universallyMusk has gone so far as to call Optimus an “infinite money glitch”, underscoring his belief in its transformative economic impact.The comments made by Musk comes at a time when Nvidia surpassed $5 trillion in market value overtaking both Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has projected $500 billion in revenue, calling it unprecedented visibility for a technology company. Nvidia’s success has become a benchmark for investors seeking the next big AI-driven valuation surge.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently outlined what he feels will trigger dramatic revaluation of the electric vehicle marker stock.

Elon Musk on AI and robotics: How humanoid robots could end the need for money





AI and robotics can make everyone wealthy; reveals Elon Musk









Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made a striking prediction about the future of work, suggesting that in the coming decades, employment could become optional for most people. Speaking at the US-Saudi Investment Forum, Musk shared his views on how advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics may reshape society, potentially eliminating the need for traditional jobs.""I do not know exactly what long-term means, perhaps 10 to 20 years,"" Musk said. ""My prediction is that work will be optional.""Musk compared future work to activities like playing sports or video games. He explained that people will have choices: they could continue working, purchase essentials from stores, or even grow their own food, though the latter might be more challenging. ""Some people will still do it because they enjoy it, but work will be optional,"" he noted.As reported by FoxBusiness, in addition to changes like work, Musk suggested that money may lose its significance in a future dominated by AI and robotics. He referenced literature envisioning a society where advanced AI makes traditional currency obsolete.""My guess is that if AI and robotics continue to improve, money will stop being relevant eventually,"" Musk said. He acknowledged that physical resources such as energy and raw materials will still impose limits, but currency itself could become less central to human life.Musk has been a strong advocate for the development of humanoid robots, particularly Tesla’s Optimus robot, also known as the Tesla Bot. At the forum, he described humanoid robots as potentially the largest industry ever, surpassing even smartphones in influence and demand.He emphasised that AI and humanoid robots could play a critical role in eradicating poverty worldwide. ""AI and humanoid robots will actually eliminate poverty,"" Musk said, adding that while Tesla will lead the field, numerous other companies are expected to produce humanoid robots in the future.Musk concluded by underlining his belief that AI and robotics offer a unique path to universal wealth. ""There is essentially one way to make everyone wealthy, and that is through AI and robotics,"" he stated. The Tesla CEO envisions a future where technological innovation provides abundance, freeing people from the constraints of traditional work and redefining the global economy in profound, unprecedented ways. While Musk’s vision is ambitious, he acknowledged that reaching a world where work is optional will require substantial effort. The integration of AI and robotics into everyday life could transform how humans live, work, and interact with resources. With Tesla at the forefront of humanoid robot development, Musk’s predictions highlight a future where technology not only reshapes industries but also addresses long-standing social and economic challenges with greater efficiency.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made a striking prediction about the future of work.

Impact on Amazon



Moody's warns that many US States showing recession signs





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the global economy. Bezos has urged the consumers and businesses to postpone their large purchases as the fear of recession is mounting. Speaking to CNN’s Chole Melas in an interview, Bezos has cautioned that the coming months could bring prolonged downturn. Bezos has recommend that households should consider putting a hold on purchasing big-ticket products such as cars, televisions and appliances. He urge the consumers to save that money as it will make a lot of difference if the economic worsens. Along with this, Bezos has also advised the small businesses to avoid large capital expenditures or acquisitions during this uncertain period.“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.”Despite his cautionary advice, Bezos struck an optimistic tone about the long-term future, saying he believes the American Dream remains attainable. He even projected that within his lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public. Last month, Bezos tweeted a warning to “batten down the hatches,” advice he reiterated in his CNN interview as relevant to both consumers and business owners.Ironically, if the consumers follow Bezos’ advice, then it could mean lower sales for Amazon. Recently, Amazon announced its plans to layoff 14,000 employees. In October, Amazon projected holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street expectations, citing inflation and shifting consumer behavior. Americans are spending more on travel and dining out and less on discretionary goods.Recently, Mark Zandi, chief economist at credit rating agency Moody' warned about recession in the US. A new analysis of state-level data suggests that the US economy is ""on the edge of recession,"" said Mark Zandi of Moody's. ""Based on my assessment of various data, states making up nearly a third of US GDP are either in or at high risk of recession, another third are just holding steady, and the remaining third are growing,"" Zandi wrote on social media.The data reveals a mixed picture across the country. States in the South are generally the strongest, though their growth is beginning to slow. Meanwhile, some of the nation's largest economies, like California and New York, are described as ""holding their own,"" and their stability is seen as critical to preventing a full-blown national recession.However, many states are showing signs of vulnerability. Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Kansas, and Massachusetts were all identified as being at high risk of recession. The broader Washington, D.C. area is also notable for its economic struggles, which Zandi attributes to government job cuts.Adding to the forecast, Zandi predicts that the annual inflation rate, currently at 2.7%, could rise to nearly 4% within the next year, further eroding purchasing power for consumers.",Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the global economy.

The public ‘reunion’ between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump took a notably funny turn this week. Musk attended a high-profile White House dinner hosted by President Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , marking only their second public interaction since their bitter falling out earlier this year. During the subsequent US–Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, Trump jokingly pressed Musk for “proper” gratitude. Musk responded directly to the President's on-stage prompt with a post on X (formerly Twitter).Trump teased the billionaire on stage, asking the audience if Musk had “ever thanked me for that properly?” Hours later, the X owner posted publicly on his platform: “I would like to thank president Trump for all he has done for America and the world.”While speaking about new tax deductions benefiting domestic car production, President Trump mentioned Musk several times. Trump publicly teased the billionaire, “You are so lucky I’m with you, Elon.” The statement referred to the federal policies that have benefited Musk's companies.Previsouly, a video shared widely on X captured the moment when Trump, accompanied by Melania Trump and the Saudi Crown Prince, spotted Musk and gently tapped the Tesla boss, to which Musk responded with a nod.The relationship between the two men had soured earlier this year after Musk criticised the Trump administration’s tax and spending plans and announced intentions to form a new political party. Trump had retaliated by threatening to pull back the billions of dollars in federal subsidies that support Musk’s ventures.Prior to the feud, Musk had backed Trump's election and briefly led the Department of Government Efficiency, where he oversaw federal cuts.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk attended a White House dinner hosted by President Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

“As many of you have heard through rumors or recent media articles, I am planning to leave Meta after 12 fantastic years: 5 years as founding director of FAIR and 7 years as Chief AI Scientist.

The impact of FAIR on the company, on the field of AI, on the tech community, and on the wider world has been spectacular. The creation of FAIR is my proudest non-technical accomplishment.

I am creating a startup company to continue the

Advanced Machine Intelligence

research program (AMI) I have been pursuing over the last several years with colleagues at FAIR, at NYU, and beyond. The goal of the startup is to bring about the next big revolution in AI: systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.

I am extremely grateful to Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Bosworth (Boz), Chris Cox, and Mike Schroepfer for their support of FAIR, and for their support of the AMI program over the last few years. Because of their continued interest and support, Meta will be a partner of the new company.

As I envision it, AMI will have far-ranging applications in many sectors of the economy, some of which overlap with Meta’s commercial interests, but many of which do not. Pursuing the goal of AMI in an independent entity is a way to maximize its broad impact.

I will give some more details about the new company when the time comes. In the meantime, I’m sticking around Meta until the end of the year,” LeCun wrote.





Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun widely known as of one of the ‘godfathers of modern AI’ has finally announced his resignation from the company after 12 years. In a detailed post shared on social media platform Facebook, LeCun announced that he is leaving the company to start his new venture focused on advancing machine intelligence. LeCun described the goal as achieving “the next big revolution in AI,” potentially enabling robots and intelligent systems that can adapt to situations they were not explicitly programmed for.LeCun joined Facebook in 2013 and co-founded FAIR (Facebook AI Research) which became one of the most influential AU research groups around the world. Then in 2018, LeCun stepped down as FAIR’s director but continued working as Meta’s chief AI scientist. It is his work on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that laid the foundation for modern computer vision and deep learning.In his departure more, LeCun made it official that he is leaving Meta. He also explained that the new company which he will be launching will work on building AI systems which are capable of understanding the physical world, reasoning and planning complex actions.LeCun’s departure comes amid instability in Meta’s AI division, which has undergone major restructuring and faced challenges with its Llama 4 model. The company also cut hundreds of AI jobs earlier this year. Despite this, LeCun emphasised that his decision was driven by a desire to pursue long-term research goals rather than short-term corporate priorities.","Yann LeCun, one of the ‘godfathers of modern AI’ has finally announced his resignation from the company after 12 years.

Snapchat has introduced a new feature called Topic Chats. The company claims that the feature has been designed to bring its popular chat tools into the public sphere and enable conversations around trending topics and events. “Topic chats are simple. They bring our most popular chat features to public conversations about what’s happening in the world and in your community, and they cluster Snaps about that topic to make it easy to explore what’s happening visually,” said Snapchat in a blog post.The Snapchat Topic Chats will enable the users to join public discussions about what’s happening in the world and their communities. The feature will cluster Snaps related to a particular subject making it easier for the users to visually explore the point of discussion and engage with others. Along with this, users will also see a yellow ‘Join the Chat’ button present on Stories or Spotlight videos. This button will offer instant access to ongoing conversations.Over the coming weeks, Snapchatters in Canada, New Zealand, and the US will begin to see Topic Chats appear across Snapchat — in Chat shortcuts, in search, in the Stories page, and on Spotlight videos.“Topic chats are simple.

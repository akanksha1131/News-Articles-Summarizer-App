What is DeepSeek

DeepSeek hit by cyber attack

Nvidia has emphasized that Chinese AI firm DeepSeek’s progress underscores the value of its chips in the Chinese market, adding that future demand for its hardware will likely grow to support DeepSeek’s expanding services. The chip maker released a statement on Monday, January 27 following a sharp 17% drop driven by investor concerns that DeepSeek had matched competitors like OpenAI while using significantly fewer Nvidia chips than US-based firms.""DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant,"" Nvidia said in its statement.“Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling,” said Nvidia.DeepSeek is a large language model developed by Hangzhou-based startup DeepSeek. The AI model features a hybrid architecture combining reinforcement learning with chain-of-thought reasoning for advanced performance. The model comes in two versions: DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero. The latter offers unsupervised fine-tuning, enabling even more refined reasoning abilities.Nvidia is currently selling a chip called the H20 that is designed to meet the most recent export control regulations. DeepSeek’s research indicates it utilized around 2,000 of Nvidia’s H800 chips, specifically designed to comply with US export controls introduced in 2022. Experts previously told Reuters that these regulations, aimed at hindering China’s AI progress, would likely have minimal impact.Meanwhile, the Chinese AI startup was forced to restrict new user sign-ups to those with mainland China telephone numbers. Reason: The company is citing ""large-scale malicious attacks"" on its systems. “Currently, only registration with a mainland China mobile phone number is supported,” the company posted on its status page. DeepSeek did not specify whether the signup curbs are temporary or how long they will last.","Chinese AI firm DeepSeek saw a 17% drop in its share price on Monday, January 27.

Deepsake's cost factor behind rout in US stock market

DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup, has restricted new user sign-ups to those with mainland China telephone numbers. Reason: The company is citing ""large-scale malicious attacks"" on its systems. This comes after a surge in demand following the release of its AI chatbot , which it claims rivals OpenAI 's ChatGPT but was developed at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek 's AI Assistant briefly surpassed ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app in the U.S.on Apple's App Store, contributing to a significant drop in U.S. and European tech stock values, as investors reassessed valuations.The company's status page indicated a service incident resolved by 9:32 p.m. China time on Monday (January 27), shortly after its disclosure. The page also showed API issues earlier that day and on Sunday (January 26). This outage was the most significant since DeepSeek began tracking its service status and coincided with the app's rise in app store popularity.“Currently, only registration with a mainland China mobile phone number is supported,” the company posted on its status page. DeepSeek did not specify whether the signup curbs are temporary or how long they will last.This is reported to be the AI startup's longest major outage since it started reporting its status and corresponds with the app rocketing to popularity in the Apple and Android app stores.DeepSeek, founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, asserts its chatbot competes with the latest technology from OpenAI and Meta at a fraction of the cost. The company has stated that existing users can still log in despite the temporary registration limitations.The startup has gained attention as a rapidly growing competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and other leading AI tools. The release of its R1 model last week fueled discussions among tech analysts, investors, and developers, raising concerns about falling behind in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. This is especially relevant in the generative AI space, where companies are racing to maintain their position in a market projected to generate over $1 trillion in revenue within the next ten years.DeepSeek reportedly originated from a Chinese hedge fund's AI research unit in April 2023, focusing on large language models and the pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI), an AI branch aiming to match or exceed human intellect across various tasks. This goal is also shared by OpenAI and its competitors.","DeepSeek has restricted new user sign-ups to those with mainland China telephone numbers.

The impact extended beyond individual companies:

Making matters worse

Nvidia, the world's most-valuable Artificial Intelligence (AI) company, lost more than $500 billion of its market value. The emergence of a low-cost Chinese generative AI model from DeepSeek triggered a significant sell-off in U.S. tech stocks on Monday (January 27), raising concerns about U.S. dominance in the AI industry. DeepSeek, a Hangzhou-based startup, claims its chatbot can match the capabilities of leading U.S.AI models with significantly lower development costs (reportedly $5.6 million compared to billions invested by U.S. companies). Nvidia is a key chip supplier for the AI industry.DeepSeek, whose chatbot has became the downloaded free app on Apple's US App Store, said that it spent only $5.6 million developing its model -- peanuts when compared with the billions US tech giants have poured into AI.This announcement had a ripple effect across the tech sector:Other major AI players like Microsoft and Alphabet (Google's parent company) also experienced declines, while Meta bucked the trend and traded in the green.Broadcom, another U.S. chip maker, fell 16%, and ASML, a Dutch semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, tumbled 6.7%.SoftBank, involved in a recent U.S. AI infrastructure venture, dropped over 8% in Tokyo, along with declines for Japanese semiconductor firms Advantest (over 8%) and Tokyo Electron (almost 5%).Analysts and commentators have drawn parallels to the ""Sputnik moment,"" highlighting the potential challenge to U.S. technological leadership. Concerns have been raised about the implications for capital expenditure, valuations, and the competitive landscape within the AI industry.The situation is further complicated by upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies like Meta and Microsoft, which may provide further insights into the impact of DeepSeek's emergence. Additionally, upcoming interest rate decisions from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, along with U.S. inflation data, add further layers of complexity to the market outlook. Recent trade tensions, including threats of tariffs and visa revocations, also contribute to market uncertainty.","N Nvidia, the world's most-valuable Artificial Intelligence (AI) company, lost more than $500 billion of its market value.

Not just that, but the Chinese AI app has also grown in popularity, so much so, it overthrew ChatGPT as the most downloaded app in the iOS App Store, in the US.The company's infrastructure leaders worry that Meta's upcoming Llama AI model might not match DeepSeek's capabilities, potentially undermining its massive AI investments .According to The Information, Meta's AI infrastructure director Mathew Oldham and other executives have expressed apprehension in internal discussions about DeepSeek's rapid advancement. The Chinese firm's R1 model has demonstrated superior performance compared to leading AI systems from OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic in third-party benchmarks.However, Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun has taken a different perspective on DeepSeek's success, framing it as a victory for open-source development rather than a competitive threat. ""It's not that China's AI is surpassing the US, but rather that open source models are surpassing proprietary ones,"" LeCun stated on Threads.LeCun emphasized that DeepSeek's achievements stem from its ability to build upon existing open research, highlighting the collaborative nature of AI development . ""They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people's work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it,"" he explained.The development comes as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg continues to champion open-source AI development, having previously stated his goal of making open platforms dominant in the tech industry over the next decade.Meta has committed over $60 billion in AI spending for 2025, while DeepSeek's ability to achieve comparable or superior results with lower infrastructure costs raises questions about the sustainability of such massive investments by US tech giants.","DeepSeek has outperformed established players at a fraction of the cost.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

""I think it's extremely important that OpenAI gets to other platforms quickly because Microsoft is building their own AI and I don't think Microsoft will use OpenAI in the future,"" Benioff said, punctuating his observation with laughter.The partnership's strain appears to be evident with OpenAI's recent plans to expand its cloud infrastructure beyond Microsoft, partnering with SoftBank and Oracle on a $500 billion data center project called Stargate.Benioff highlighted the personal dynamics at play, noting the apparent tension between key executives: "" Mustafa Suleyman and Sam Altman are not best friends.""He pointed to their past interactions as evidence, recalling last year's Davos conference where ""Sam and Mustafa were on panels together and not getting along."" This personal friction coincides with Microsoft's strategic moves, including hiring Suleyman to lead its AI efforts.The partnership's foundation has gradually eroded since Microsoft's initial $1 billion investment in 2019. OpenAI's need for expanded computational resources and Microsoft's own AI ambitions have created increasing distance between the two organizations.Recent Microsoft AI announcements notably omit any mention of OpenAI, suggesting a potential strategic divergence.

Time for reversal for AI stocks

The emergence of a Chinese competitor in the artificial intelligence (AI) space sparked a sharp sell-off in Wall Street's tech sector on Monday, casting doubt on the AI-driven spending boom. Big Tech stocks faced significant losses, with Nvidia plunging 14.4%, pulling the Nasdaq Composite down by 2.8%. Bloomberg reported that the Nasdaq 100 index dropped over 3%, with Nvidia on track to record the largest single-stock market cap loss in history.The S&P 500 fell 1.7% by midday, on track for its worst day in over a month.Big Tech stocks led the decline, with Nvidia plummeting 14.4%, pulling the Nasdaq composite down 2.8%. In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, less reliant on tech, experienced a modest 0.1% dip (54 points).The market shock stemmed from DeepSeek, a Chinese company claiming to have developed a cost-effective large language model competitive with U.S. counterparts. DeepSeek's app quickly topped Apple 's App Store charts, a notable achievement given U.S. restrictions on Chinese access to advanced AI chips.Despite the market reaction, skepticism remains about DeepSeek's long-term impact on the AI supply chain, from chip manufacturing to data center infrastructure. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives highlighted concerns about DeepSeek's ability to circumvent chip restrictions, given the information's source.Nevertheless, DeepSeek's announcement reverberated through global markets. Dutch chip supplier ASML dropped 6.6%, and Japan's Softbank Group Corp. fell 8.3%, partially reversing gains from a recent AI infrastructure investment announcement. In the U.S., Constellation Energy, linked to powering Microsoft's data centers, plummeted 19%.The flight to safety pushed investors towards bonds, lowering the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.54% from 4.62%.This marks a stark reversal for AI-related stocks, which had surged in recent years. Nvidia, for instance, had seen its stock price multiply in less than two years. Other Big Tech companies, including Meta Platforms, had also benefited from the AI hype, with Meta recently announcing significant data center investments.The dominance of a few tech giants, dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven"" (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), has created ""concentration risk,"" as these companies accounted for over half of the S&P 500's return last year. This concentration amplifies the impact of disruptions like DeepSeek's emergence.However, some analysts caution against overreacting. Annex Wealth Management's Brian Jacobsen suggested that the news from China might be overstated or present new investment opportunities.Further market volatility is possible, with Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla scheduled to release earnings this week. Strong earnings are crucial, especially given recent increases in Treasury yields, which typically pressure stock prices.","Big Tech stocks led the decline, with Nvidia plummeting 14.4%, pulling the Nasdaq composite down 2.8%.

“It (Cognizant) instead relies on vague and overbroad definitions of 'Trade Secret and Confidential Information' that identify every aspect of two-decade-old software products, QNXT and Facets, and everything related to them as the purported trade secrets of Cognizant that were allegedly misappropriated by Infosys. That is wrong, both factually and legally. A cursory internet search reveals public information about these software applications, and an enormous number of healthcare, insurance, and IT services workers have access to QNXT and Facets.”

What’s the legal battle between Infosys and Cognizant



A US court has asked Cognizant to disclose the nature of its trade secrets after Infosys denied allegations of stealing them, a report claims. In a court filing earlier this month, the Bengaluru-based information technology (IT) services company argued that the information Cognizant claims as trade secrets are readily available through a simple internet search and therefore not protected.This legal battle between the two IT giants centres on Cognizant's accusations that Infosys misappropriated confidential information related to its healthcare solutions. The request to clarify the nature of trade secrets comes after Infosys moved the court seeking Cognizant to identify them properly.In the court filing (seen by Mint), Infosys wrote:In a recently submitted joint response, Cognizant requested an extension until March 10, 2025, to address Infosys's counterclaim.Infosys and Cognizant have been involved in a legal battle over the alleged theft of trade secrets since August 2024 when the latter accused the former of stealing trade secrets of its software products that are used to process insurance claims in the healthcare sector.Infosys has claimed that the information Cognizant considers confidential is publicly available and that former Infosys executive Ravi Kumar S., now Cognizant's CEO, delayed the rollout of Infosys' healthcare products while in talks to join Cognizant.",A US court has asked Cognizant to disclose the nature of its trade secrets after Infosys denied allegations of stealing them.

How fall detection and SOS make Apple watch a must have for safety

Fall Detection: Fall Detection uses the accelerometer and gyroscope in the watch to detect major falls. In case of a fall, the watch taps the user on the wrist and asks if he is fine. If the user does not respond within a minute, the watch will automatically call emergency services and share the user's location with them. This feature is very helpful for the elderly or for people who have medical conditions that raise the risk of falling.

SOS: Users can quickly access the emergency service with the press and hold feature using the side button of their Apple Watch. This will alert their emergency contact and share their location. SOS works on any type of Apple Watch model.

What the revised proposal says

Donald Trump’s support to Elon Musk to buy TikTok

Perplexity AI has submitted a revised proposal to TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, suggesting the creation of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok's US operations. According to an AP report, this new structure would allow the US government to own up to 50% of the entity. The report states that the updated proposal was submitted last week and builds on an earlier plan presented to ByteDance on January 18—just one day before the US law banning TikTok took effect.The original proposal outlined a framework for merging San Francisco-based Perplexity with TikTok's US business and funding from additional investors.The proposal offers a middle ground for ByteDance, allowing it to maintain some connection to TikTok without fully severing ties. However, it would require ByteDance to relinquish control to a fully US-based board.Under the revised plan, the US government could acquire up to half of the new company's shares after an initial public offering (IPO) valued at a minimum of $300 billion. However, these government-held shares would not carry voting rights, nor would the US government gain a seat on the company's board, the report said.Importantly, the plan stipulates that TikTok's proprietary algorithm—the core of the app's content recommendation engine—would not be included in the US business contributed by ByteDance.US President Donald Trump has previously expressed support for Tesla CEO Elon Musk potentially acquiring TikTok, suggesting a novel arrangement in which the US government would hold a 50% ownership stake in exchange for granting operating permits.""I would be, if he wanted to buy it, yes,"" Trump stated during a press briefing on Tuesday, January 21, when asked about Musk's possible interest in the platform.

"How DeepSeek, the Chinese competitor to American AI companies OpenAI, Google and Microsoft, solves one of the biggest 'China problem'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-deepseek-the-chinese-competitor-to-american-ai-companies-openai-google-and-microsoft-solves-one-of-the-biggest-china-problem/articleshow/117583639.cms,"Representative image

The Chinese startup DeepSeek has unveiled a new AI system, DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating capabilities comparable to leading chatbots from OpenAI and Google. This achievement is significant in itself, but even more notable is DeepSeek's efficient use of computing resources. According to a report in NewYork Times, DeepSeek's engineers reported using significantly fewer specialized computer chips, crucial components in AI training, than their American counterparts.These chips are central to the technological competition between the U.S. and China, with the U.S. imposing export restrictions to maintain its AI leadership. However, DeepSeek's success highlights potential unintended consequences of these restrictions, as Chinese researchers have been driven to innovate with readily available resources.DeepSeek-V3 reportedly performed on par with existing market offerings in benchmark tests assessing question answering, logic problem-solving, and code generation. Remarkably, DeepSeek achieved this with approximately $6 million in computing power, a fraction of the estimated $60 million spent by Meta on its latest AI technology. This lower cost of entry broadens the field of potential AI developers, as noted by investor Chris V. Nicholson, who pointed out the significant difference between having $6 million versus $100 million or $1 billion available.While leading AI companies often utilize supercomputers with 16,000 or more chips, DeepSeek reportedly used only around 2,000 Nvidia chips. This efficient use of resources was attributed to optimized training methods necessitated by chip constraints in China.Despite U.S. efforts to restrict China's access to advanced chips, including recent regulations aimed at preventing acquisition through third countries, DeepSeek is said to leverage existing resources. The company, backed by quantitative trading firm High Flyer, had previously acquired Nvidia chips and attracted talent with competitive salaries and research opportunities. They even hire individuals without computer science backgrounds to enhance the AI's understanding of diverse subjects like poetry and performance on challenging exams.While U.S. companies continue to innovate, with OpenAI's new ""reasoning"" system being a prime example, DeepSeek's rapid progress, including its own impressive reasoning model, demonstrates its competitiveness, as per the report.A key aspect of this evolving landscape is open-source software. DeepSeek has open-sourced its latest AI system, sharing the code with others. This fosters global collaboration, as noted by Yineng Zhang, a software engineer at Baseten. This open-source approach gained momentum in 2023 with Meta's release of LLama. DeepSeek's contribution demonstrates that smaller players can also contribute significantly to the open-source AI ecosystem.","DeepSeek-V3 reportedly performed on par with existing market offerings in benchmark tests assessing question answering, logic problem-solving, and code generation. Remarkably, DeepSeek achieved this with approximately $6 million in computing power, a fraction of the estimated $60 million spent by Meta.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117583630,imgsize-30140,width-400,resizemode-4/117583630.jpg"

ANI accuses OpenAI of illegally using its content

Sam Altman-led OpenAI is facing a new copyright lawsuit in India. According to a Reuters report, Indian book publishers and their international counterparts in New Delhi have filed a lawsuit aimed at halting the ChatGPT chatbot’s access to proprietary content. The lawsuit was filed by Federation of Indian Publishers on behalf of the federation's members, including prominent publishers such as Bloomsbury, Penguin Random House, Cambridge University Press, and Pan Macmillan, as well as Indian publishers like Rupa Publications and S.Chand and Co.The case, initially listed before a registrar in New Delhi, will be heard by a judge on January 28.In the lawsuit, the Federation of Indian Publishers argues that OpenAI's services in India should be governed by Indian laws. The federation’s December filing claims OpenAI used its members’ literary works without permission to train ChatGPT, with evidence from publishers. They warn that AI-generated book summaries and extracts, often from unlicensed online copies, threaten their sales.Penguin Random House announced a global initiative in November to include a copyright disclaimer in its books, stating no part may be used to train AI.The report quotes Pranav Gupta, the federation's general secretary who said ""Our ask from the court is that they should stop (OpenAI from) accessing our copyright content.” “In case they don't want to do licensing with us, they should delete datasets used in AI training and explain how we will be compensated. This impacts creativity,” he added.OpenAI is already facing a lawsuit in India. ANI (Asian News International), a prominent news agency alleges that the tech company used its content without permission to train its AI chatbot, ChatGPT. ANI claims that OpenAI not only utilised its copyrighted material without a lawful licence but also accused the company of attributing fabricated news stories to the agency.Globally, the ChatGPT-maker is facing a list of legal challenges from various global news organisations and copyright holders, including The New York Times and The Chicago Tribune, who have similarly accused OpenAI of using their work without authorization.","Indian book publishers and their international counterparts in New Delhi have filed a lawsuit aimed at halting the ChatGPT chatbot’s access to proprietary content.

Google revamps mobile search URLs for a sleeker appearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-revamps-mobile-search-urls-for-a-sleeker-appearance/articleshow/117569233.cms,"Google has announced a major update to its mobile search results, aimed at simplifying the appearance of URLs for a more user-friendly experience. This redesign focuses on presenting a cleaner and more streamlined look, enhancing readability and usability on mobile devices.Like all organising efforts, this one came with its challenges. “Rethinking the visual design for something like Search is really complex,” Aileen says.“That’s especially true given how much Google Search has evolved. We’re not just organising the web’s information, but all the world’s information,” Aileen says. “We started with organising web pages, but now there’s so much diversity in the types of content and information we have to help make sense of.”Previously, Google's mobile search results often displayed long, complex URLs that could be challenging to parse quickly. This change involves removing the breadcrumb element from mobile search results, which frequently got cut off on smaller screens. Instead, Google will now show only the most critical parts of the URL, such as the domain name and a simplified path.Google explained that this update is designed to make it easier for users to understand where a link will take them without unnecessary clutter. The company emphasised that this change will apply to all languages and regions where Google Search is available on mobile. Meanwhile, the breadcrumb element will still be present on desktop search results.“We hope this change makes it easier for people to find what they're looking for when they're searching on mobile,” a Google representative mentioned in a blog post. The cleaner format aims to offer a more intuitive and user-friendly browsing experience , especially on smaller screens.","Google has announced a major update to its mobile search results, aimed at simplifying the appearance of URLs for a more user-friendly experience.

Apple's Siri pendant borrows the Humane AI Pin concept—But as an iPhone accessory



AirPods With cameras are the closest to shipping



Apple is ramping up development of three AI-powered wearables— smart glasses, a wearable pendant, and camera-equipped AirPods— all designed to connect to the iPhone and give Siri a pair of eyes. Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the plans.The glasses, codenamed N50, are the most advanced of the three. They pack two cameras — one high-resolution sensor for photos and video, and a second dedicated to computer vision, similar to LiDAR on iPhones. There's no display in the lens, so everything runs through voice: phone calls, music, navigation, and Siri queries. Apple is aiming for a late 2026 production start and a 2027 launch.Instead of partnering with an eyewear brand the way Meta has with Ray-Ban, Apple is building its own frames using high-end materials, including acrylic elements. Multiple sizes and colors are planned.The pendant is perhaps the most unusual of the three. It's AirTag-sized, clips to clothing or hangs on a necklace, and functions essentially as an always-on camera feeding visual context to Siri. Unlike the ill-fated Humane AI Pin, it has no projector and leans heavily on the iPhone for processing.Whether it'll include a speaker for two-way Siri conversations is still undecided, Bloomberg says.The pendant is the earliest-stage product and could still be canceled. If it moves forward, a 2027 launch is possible.Camera-equipped AirPods are the furthest along in development and could arrive as soon as this year. The cameras are low-resolution and built for AI awareness, not photography — meant to help Siri understand surroundings rather than capture memories.The push comes as Apple plays catch-up with Meta, whose Ray-Ban glasses have become a genuine consumer hit, and OpenAI, which is developing wearables in collaboration with ex-Apple design chief Jony Ive.","Apple is working on three AI-powered wearables.

'Chinese Humanoid Robots' showcased during Lunar New Year event impress everyone and 'prove' why Elon Musk said that China is only competitor Tesla has,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinese-humanoid-robots-showcased-during-lunar-new-year-event-impress-everyone-and-prove-why-elon-musk-said-that-china-is-only-competitor-tesla-has/articleshow/128462881.cms,"“I think China will be by far the biggest competitor in the humanoid robot market. China is extremely good at scaling and manufacturing and is also strong in AI—the models being released there are already quite good and are improving rapidly.”

Why the hype around Chinese humanoid robot market has increased



“We’re gonna take the Model S and X production space in our Fremont factory and convert that into an Optimus factory … with the long-term goal of having 1 million units a year of Optimus robots in the current SX space in Fremont,”

“we’re still very much at the early stages of Optimus,”

“We wouldn’t expect to have any kind of significant Optimus production volume until probably end of this year,”

China's annual CCTV Spring Festival Gala, which is often compared to the US Super Bowl, showcased humanoid robots from four domestic startups during the Lunar New Year celebrations this week. This highlights the country's push to lead in robotics and manufacturing. The demonstration comes after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said China would be a key competitor in the humanoid robot market.During Tesla's earnings call last year, Musk said,The gala featured robots from Unitree Robotics, Galbot, Noetix, and MagicLab performing martial arts and fight sequences with swords, poles, and nunchucks alongside human child performers. The event served as a showcase for China's industrial policy and its ambitions in humanoid robotics.China is the world's largest manufacturer and user of robots. According to an industry report by Omdia, Chinese robotics firm AgiBot shipped over 5,100 humanoid robots in 2025, securing a 39% share of the global humanoid robot market.The attention surrounding China's humanoid robot sector comes as major players, including AgiBot and Unitree prepare for initial public offerings this year. Moreover, domestic artificial intelligence (AI) startups release a range of frontier models during the nine-day Lunar New Year public holiday.Last year's gala drew widespread attention with 16 full-size Unitree humanoids twirling handkerchiefs and dancing alongside human performers. Unitree's founder met President Xi Jinping weeks later at a notable tech symposium, which was the first of its kind since 2018.Xi has met five robotics startup founders in the past year, comparable to the four electric vehicle and four semiconductor entrepreneurs he met in the same timeframe, giving the emerging sector considerable visibility.Behind the spectacle of robots running marathons and executing kung fu kicks and backflips, China has positioned robotics and AI at the heart of its next-generation AI manufacturing strategy, aiming for productivity gains from automation to offset pressures from its ageing workforce.Elon Musk has said he expects his key competitors to be Chinese companies as he pivots Tesla toward a focus on embodied AI and its humanoid robot Optimus.Last month, Musk said that Tesla is betting on a future driven less by cars and more by humanoid robots, reiterating comments he made last year. During Tesla’s earnings call this week, Elon Musk outlined plans to shift focus away from vehicles toward its Optimus robots, saying the company would discontinue the Model S and Model X to prioritise robot production. Tesla said it will end production of the Model S and Model X and repurpose the California facility that built those vehicles to manufacture Optimus robots.Musk said.In 2024, Musk said Optimus could eventually make Tesla a $25 trillion company, compared with its current market value of about $1.4 trillion, and previously stated that 80% of Tesla’s value could come from robots.While Musk said Tesla plans to build a production line capable of producing one million Optimus units annually, he also acknowledged thatdescribing it as a research and development effort.Musk added.","China's annual CCTV Spring Festival Gala showcased humanoid robots from four domestic startups during the Lunar New Year celebrations this week.

India AI Impact Summit: Five-day summit features global leaders, a massive expo, and crore-level prizes

The India AI Impact Summit 2026 begins on February 16 in New Delhi, bringing together some of the most powerful names in global technology under one roof. Google CEO Sundar Pichai , OpenAI's Sam Altman , Anthropic's Dario Amodei, and Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis are all expected at Bharat Mandapam for what is the first major global AI summit to be hosted in the Global South. With over 40 CEOs, 20 heads of state, and an expected $100 billion in investment commitments on the table, this is shaping up to be one of the most significant tech gatherings of the year.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet 35-40 CEOs on the sidelines and is scheduled to address the main plenary on February 19. The five-day summit is organised around three pillars—People, Planet, and Progress—and will run across multiple venues in the national capital, including Bharat Mandapam and Sushma Swaraj Bhawan.The summit isn't just a boardroom affair. Yann LeCun, Meta's chief AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, and Yoshua Bengio, founder of Quebec's Mila Institute and another Turing laureate, are both on the attendee list. Their presence signals that the summit aims to bridge the gap between AI commerce and AI research.Here's a look at the confirmed and expected attendees:The timing isn't accidental. India generates nearly 20 per cent of the world's data, has the second-largest AI workforce globally, and over 700 million internet users.For AI companies spending billions on development, India's massive service economy—often called the back-office of the world—is where the customers are.The groundwork is already visible. Microsoft committed a record $17.5 billion over four years to expand AI infrastructure in India, its largest-ever investment in Asia. Anthropic recently hired former Microsoft India MD Irina Ghose to lead its local operations. OpenAI has set up a dedicated India sales division. Google has partnered with the government and edtech platform Physics Wallah to push AI in education. On the hardware side, India's 21-year tax holiday for data centres has companies like Nvidia watching closely.Beyond the boardroom meetings, the summit features an expo spread across 70,000 square metres with 300-plus exhibitors from 30 countries. Leaders from 20 nations, including France's Emmanuel Macron and Brazil's Lula da Silva, are scheduled to attend alongside over 50 international ministers and the UN Secretary General. More than two lakh participants have registered, including a notable number of farmers and grassroots workers—reflecting India's push to connect AI with real-world development.The event also includes innovation challenges with serious prize money.

Price spikes and “RAMmageddon”



Industry fallout due to global chip crisis



Echoes of past supply chain shocks



Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Xiaomi President Lu Weibing and many others are warning about a global crisis unfolding: Shortage of memory chips. The scarcity of memory chips led to their soaring costs. As a report in Bloomberg says it is beginning to hammer profits, derail corporate plans and inflate price tags on everything from laptops and smartphones to automobiles and data centers — and the crunch is only going to get worse.As per the Bloomberg report, the main driver of the squeeze is the buildout of AI data centers. Companies like Alphabet and OpenAI are buying millions of Nvidia AI accelerators, each needing a massive amounts of DRAM. This has left the consumer electronics maker fighting over dwindling supplies from Samsung and Micron. Elon Musk has also suggested that Tesla may need to build its own fabrication plant, “he said in January.The report also adds that the memory prices are increasing and going at an unprecedented levels. One of the type of DRAM jumped by 75% in a single month, with retailers adjusting prices daily. Industry insiders have dubbed the crisis “RAMmageddon.” Tim Cook warned that iPhone margins will be compressed, while Micron called the bottleneck “unprecedented.”The report also revealed the industry fallout on the global chip crisis.The report adds that Sony may delay its next PlayStation console to 2028 or 2029. Also, Nintendo is also thinking raising the prices of Switch 2. Xiaomi and Oppo may also cut shipment forecasts for 2026. Cisco cited the memory squeeze in a weak profit outlook, triggering its worst share loss in nearly four years. Lastly, Qualcomm and Arm Holdings also warned of more fallout.This global chip crisis recall the Covid-era chip shortages, but this time the driver is AI. Tech giants Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are pouring hundreds of billions into AI infrastructure, diverting memory production toward high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for AI accelerators. That leaves less capacity for standard DRAM used in everyday electronics.Bernstein’s Mark Li says memory prices are going “parabolic.” Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing warned the crunch will last at least through the year. Counterpoint Research estimates DRAM shortages will persist across electronics, telecom, and automotive industries, with signs of panic buying already visible.",Report: Shortage of memory chips led to soaring costs.

Anand Mahindra’s post resonated with the fans



India vs Pakistan: India won the match and entered Super 8 stage



Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra took to social media to celebrate India's victory in the India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup 2026 match. Mahindra took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to congratulate the Indian cricket team on their latest cricketing success. Mahindra emphasised that “No matter the gap on paper, the real difference is made on the field.” He praised the team’s grit and determination, noting that belief and resilience can overcome any odds.“Yes, India outclassed Pakistan in terms of talent, and many saw the result as inevitable.Some even say the rivalry is now non-existent. But victory is never inevitable in sport. An India–Pakistan clash carries so much history, emotion, and immense pressure.No matter the gap on paper, the psychological weight is real. So here’s to you Men in Blue You won on the field, in your minds, and in our hearts,” wrote Mahindra.Mahindra's tweet resonated with many Indian cricket fans. Many echoed his sentiment, highlighting that India’s victory was not just about skill but about courage, unity, and the ability to rise above challenges. His post quickly gained traction, adding to the wave of national pride following the match.“Sir, beautifully said!The scoreboard might show dominance, but the weight of history, the roar of the crowd, and that unbeatable pressure make every India-Pakistan game a true battle of nerves and heart.The Men in Blue handled it with class today, Kishan's fireworks, Bumrah's magic, and the team's composure under lights made it special.This rivalry isn't fading; it's evolving, and wins like this remind us why we still hold our breath every time these two teams meet.Jai Hind!, wrote a user on X.“Absolutely, the India-Pakistan rivalry is legendary and steeped in so much more than just sport.No matter the odds, every match holds its own drama and passion. That’s what keeps fans glued and makes every game unpredictable!,” wrote another user.India put on a dominant show against their arch-rivals Pakistan, routing them by 61 runs in a high-stakes Group A clash of the T20 World Cup 2026 at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. The win not only boosted India’s confidence but also secured their place in the Super 8 stage.The Powerplay belonged to India, and the batsmen capitalized brilliantly.

Mackenzie Scott, former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has said that her approach to large-scale philanthropy is shaped by acts of kindness she received during her early years. In an essay published on her philanthropic organisation, Yield Giving website in October, Scott said she often thinks about the people who helped her when she struggled financially as a college student. She recalled borrowing money from her college roommate to avoid dropping out and receiving free dental care from a local dentist when she could not afford treatment.“It is these ripple effects that make imagining the power of any of our own acts of kindness impossible,” Scott wrote in the essay. “Whose generosity did I think of every time I made every one of the thousands of gifts I’ve been able to give?”“It was the local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college.

David Greene: Popular radio show host David Greene claims Google stole his voice; Google responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/popular-radio-show-host-david-greene-claims-google-stole-his-voice-google-responds/articleshow/128414462.cms,"What David Greene says

Google responds to the lawsuit

Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google , alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts. The lawsuit, filed in Santa Clara County alleges that Google cloned Greene’s voice and distinctive broadcasting style without permission or compensation. Greene argues that Google’s NotebookLM T tool voice's rhythm, intonation, and even his characteristic verbal tics are so similar that even his friends, colleagues, and listeners assumed he'd licensed his voice to Google.“So... I’m probably the 148th person to ask this, but did you license your voice to Google? It sounds very much like you!,” a former co-worker asked David Greene in a fall 2024 email, a Washington Post report says.“I was, like, completely freaked out,” Greene told the publication, adding “It’s this eerie moment where you feel like you’re listening to yourself.”Greene said the AI voice sounds very similar to his own, and that the impact goes beyond losing a chance to make money from his best-known asset. “My voice is, like, the most important part of who I am,” Greene reportedly said.In the lawsuit, Greene’s lawyer argues that the recordings make the resemblance clear.“We have faith in the court and encourage people to listen to the example audio themselves,” said Joshua Michelangelo Stein, a partner at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner.Google responded denying the allegations. Google spokesperson José Castañeda told Washington Post: “These allegations are baseless. The sound of the male voice in NotebookLM’s Audio Overviews is based on a paid professional actor Google hired.”The Washington Post reported, “The lawsuit is the latest to pit the rights of individual human creators against the rights of a burgeoning AI industry that promises to transform the economy by enabling the on-demand generation of stunningly lifelike speech, prose, images, and video. Behind the artificial voices found in tools like NotebookLM are language models trained on vast libraries of real-life human text and speech. The humans used to train these models are unaware that their words and voices will be used by AI, raising serious questions about copyright and ownership.”","Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google, alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently drew a comparison between today’s large technology companies and East India Company. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Sridhar Vembu wrote: “Big tech is bigger than most sovereign nations. ""East India Company"" is the way to think about them”. While he did not name any single company in his post, Vembu was responding to a post noting that Google raised $32 billion in debt in a single day—an amount comparable to what a large country like India raises over several months—and issued a 100-year bond, a time horizon longer than many government bonds.“Google raised $32B of debt in 1 day, what a sovereign government like India raises in 100 days. Google also issued a 100-year bond worth $1B, which is longer than India's longest at 40 years. Big tech now operates like sovereign nations with fundraising size and time horizons,” the X post said. It referred to a Google’s recent sale of a rare 100-year bond in British pounds as part of its massive multi-currency debt raise, making it the first tech company to attempt a century bond since IBM did it back in 1996.Sridhar Vembu’s X post has sparked debate online. Commenting on Vembu's post, one user replied “They are the new EIC, but operating on a different plane of existence.The 'Money' layer of control is collapsing, so the elites are shifting to the 'Data' layer.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive.

When Bill Gates called out ‘Doomsday’ view of Climate Change



Bill Gates-backed Breakthrough Energy has reportedly stopped making new investments from one of its key funds to scale up nascent green technologies. According to a report in Bloomberg, the suspension comes as the market for these startups is being squeezed by President Donald Trump’s assaults on climate policy. After supporting 10 startups and spending “high hundreds of millions of dollars,” a Breakthrough Energy spokesperson told Bloomberg that it has now suspended new investment from the fund.“Catalyst has transitioned from evaluating new funding opportunities to managing and supporting its existing companies,” said the spokesperson, as per a report in Axios, which first reported the Fund's change of direction. “It is too early to say what the future of our deployment work will look like.” There was no immediate plan to raise more money for the Catalyst fund, according to the spokesperson, who declined to elaborate on what will be done with the remaining capital.Launched in 2021, Breakthrough’s Catalyst fund is said to have raised more than $1 billion to finance the demonstration and scale-up of first-of-their-kind green solutions.It is among a series of green initiatives that Gates has established in recent years under the Breakthrough Energy banner.Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a venture-capital firm, has also funded roughly 150 climate-focused startups, of which about 30 or 40 have failed, Gates said in an interview in October 2025. In pursuit of solutions to decarbonize the world, “there’ll be lots of dead ends,” he added. The rethinking of the Catalyst fund investment strategy comes after Gates was criticized by some climate advocates when he said in October that prioritizing the climate fight above all else risks overshadowing issues such as health and equality.As part of the ongoing reform, Breakthrough Energy Catalyst has also reportedly laid off some employees, including its former top exec Mario Fernandez. On layoffs, spokesperson reportedly said that the “evolution of the work requires a smaller team.”In a memo in October 2025, Bill Gates wrote that it is time to adopt a more measured tone when addressing climate change and the threat it poses to the world. He called out what he characterized as a “doomsday view of climate change.” “We need to keep backing the breakthroughs that will help the world reach zero emissions. But we can’t cut funding for health and development — programs that help people stay resilient in the face of climate change — to do it,” he said in the memo.Gates added that it is now “time to put human welfare at the center of our climate strategies, which includes reducing the green premium to zero and improving agriculture and health in poor countries.” “This is a chance to refocus on the metric that should count even more than emissions and temperature change: improving lives,” Gates wrote. “COP30 is taking place at a time when it’s especially important to get the most value out of every dollar spent on helping the poorest. ”",Breakthrough Energy has reportedly stopped making new investments from one of its key funds to scale up nascent green technologies.

America's biggest defence technology company Palantir Technologies is moving its headquarters to Miami, Florida. The company announced the same in a post on X, formerly Twitter. ""We have moved our headquarters to Miami, Florida,"" reads the post from Palantir's official handle. Defence software giant Data giant Palantir has moved its headquarters to Miami after six years in Denver. Palantir was headquartered in the Tabor Center in downtown Denver. In a statement, Palantir Technologies said that it’s moved its headquarters to Miami as more tech companies seek to base themselves in the Florida city as the city’s leadership tries to turn it into the next Silicon Valley.Palantir's move to Miami is the latest example of a technology giant relocating to lower-tax, GOP-led states like Texas and Florida. The company's relocation is an economic blow to Denver. However, Palantir has been facing criticism from some residents in Denver for its relationship with the US government. Palantir has reportedly developed a tool giving ICE ""near real-time visibility"" to track deportations, monitor visa overstays and target criminal organizations.Palantir’s ImmigrationOS platform, developed for $30 million is said to enable ICE to “identify, track, and deport suspected noncitizens,” according to the American Immigration Council.Last month, protesters rallied outside the Cherry Creek offices of data giant Palantir to show solidarity with the ICE Out of Minnesota Day of Freedom on Friday, January 23, as recent events tied to aggressive immigration enforcement and the death of Renee Good inspire activism nationwide.Elon Musk has been openly inviting businesses to move to Texas. Musk moved the headquarters of his companies SpaceX and X to Texas in 2024 over a new California law. In July 2024, Elon Musk announced the relocation of SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter) headquarters from California to Texas, citing a new state law regarding student gender identity as ""the final straw"". This move follows his 2021 relocation of Tesla's headquarters to Austin, marking a significant shift of his corporate empire away from California.One of Palantir's co-founders Peter Thiel, part of the famous Paypal Mafia, opened a Miami office for his investment company Thiel Capital in Miami in December 2025. He moved base from California. Thiel’s family office, Thiel Capital, sent out a press release about its relocation to Miami in late December.","Defence software giant Palantir Technologies is moving its headquarters to Miami, Florida.

Elon Musk On EU Radar; X’s AI Chatbot Grok Faces Biggest Probe Over Sexual Deepfakes | Details

What triggered the announcement

Spain not the only country probing social media platforms

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has reportedly ordered prosecutors to investigate social media companies X (formerly Twitter), Meta and TikTok over the alleged spread of AI-generated child sexual abuse material. The announcement comes at a time when other European countries, including France, and others such as the UK, are already investigating Elon Musk-owned xAI on similar issue.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Sanchez announced the probe at a government summit, saying the Justice Ministry will ask prosecutors to look into “crimes” of X, Meta, and TikTok.“Today, the Council of Ministers will invoke Article 8 of the Organic Statute of the Public Prosecution Service to request that it investigate the crimes that X, Meta and TikTok may be committing through the creation and dissemination of child pornography by means of their AI,” Sanchez wrote on X.“These platforms are attacking the mental health, dignity and rights of our sons and daughters. The State cannot allow it. The impunity of the giants must end,” Sanchez added.The report said that the move was triggered, in part, by a striking statistic: one in five young people in Spain – mostly girls – report that fake nude images of themselves were created by AI and shared online while they were still minors, according to rights group Save the Children.Government spokesperson Elma Saiz echoed the PM’s sentiment, saying authorities “cannot allow algorithms to amplify or shelter” such crimes, according to Reuters.Notably, the investigation is the first measure from a wider package of social media regulations Sanchez unveiled in Dubai earlier this month. It is based on a technical report prepared by three government ministries. Two weeks ago, he also proposed banning social media access for children under 16.Spain is not alone. Across Europe and beyond, governments are ‘tightening the screws’ on tech platforms over illegal content and other concerns. Earlier in the day, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission opened a separate investigation into X's AI chatbot Grok over its potential to generate harmful sexualised images, including of children.The European Commission is also probing Meta, TikTok and Grok under the EU's Digital Services Act, while France, Brazil and Canada have filed complaints against Grok over illegal content. Earlier this month, French police raided X's offices in Paris, and prosecutors summoned Musk as well as former company CEO Linda Yaccarino to answer questions as part of a widening probe.","Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez reportedly orders prosecutors to investigate social media companies X, Meta and TikTok over alleged spread of child sexual abuse material.

What Shein said on probe by European Commission

Elon Musk's X and Grok facing investigation in Europe

Google hit with EU antitrust investigation

There may be change in geopolitical equations, but this has not stopped European Union regulators from going after Chinese companies. According to a report in AP, European Union regulators are investigating Chinese ecommerce giant Shein over the concerns that the online retailer hasn't done enough to limit the sale of illegal products or protect users from the platform's allegedly addictive design. In a order on Tuesday, February 17, the 27-nation bloc's executive arm said that it has opened formal investigation under the bloc's sweeping rulebook known as the Digital Services Act. The Act requires the biggest online platforms to take extra steps to protect internet users from dodgy products.European Commission said that Shein may be required to alter its actions or pay a hefty fine if a so-called non-compliance decision is reached following the investigation. One area its investigation is focusing on is whether Shein has the proper safeguards in place to limit the sale of products that are illegal in the Europe, the commission said, including items that amount to child sexual abuse material such as ""child-like sex dolls. "" The commission said that it will also determine whether Shein has systems to reduce risks related to what it says is the platform's addictive design, which includes giving users points or rewards ""for engagement.""European Commission is also targeting the transparency of Shein's recommendation systems that suggest more products to consumers. There are reportedly concerns that Shein doesn't clearly explain to users why they are being recommended specific products.Shein said that it has invested significantly in strengthening compliance with the DSA. The measures ""comprehensive systemic-risk assessments and mitigation frameworks, enhanced protections for younger users, and ongoing work to design our services in ways that promote a safe and trusted user experience."" ""Protecting minors and reducing the risk of harmful content and behaviours are central to how we develop and operate our platform,"" the company said in a statement.The European Union’s data privacy watchdog has launched an investigation into Elon Musk’s X over sexualized images generated by the social media site’s AI chatbot, Grok. In particular, the commission will be looking into whether X complied with the EU’s flagship data privacy rules in the way that it handled the personal data of the bloc’s citizens. The commission’s investigation will “examine X’s compliance with some of their fundamental obligations under the GDPR in relation to the matters at hand,” he added.The European Union is already investigating X over the sexualised images, examining whether the platform “properly assessed and mitigated risks associated with the deployment of Grok’s functionalities into X in the EU.”Earlier this year, Google was hit with an EU antitrust investigation over its use of online content for AI purposes, marking the latest in a series of crackdowns from the bloc on regulating U.S. big tech companies. The European Commission said it was investigating whether Google had breached EU competition rules by using the content of web publishers, as well as content uploaded on the online video-sharing platform YouTube, for AI purposes.",Chinese ecommerce giant Shein under investigation by European Commission.

AI for Everyone: Breaking the language barrier

IT minister slams potential misuse of AI

The India AI Impact Summit 2026 day 2 buzzed with energy as the show floor opened for a larger audience on Tuesday (February 17) even as the focus shifted from policy debates to real-world action. With over 300 exhibitors from 30 countries, the expo showcased practical AI use cases and the technology’s prowess in solving real-world problems. The major centre of attraction was humanoid robots that can assist in factories and AI models that allows users to converse in their own languages.The Summit also showcased India’s growing capabilities in AI infrastructure, sovereign models, supercomputing, education technology, healthcare innovation and fintech security. IT minister Ahswini Vaishnaw said that India will scale its compute capacity beyond the existing 38,000 GPUs with the addition of 20,000 GPUs in the coming weeks.He highlighted that this marks the next phase of India’s AI strategy, with a significant expansion of compute infrastructure and a focus on responsible AI deployment.The biggest crowds today gathered around the robotics and intelligent manufacturing pavilions as they demonstrated deployment-ready humanoid systems.Unlike the robots of the past that were confined to labs, these new models are designed for high-demand sectors like retail, logistics and smart agriculture.Another major theme of Day 2 was the democratisation of AI. For AI to work in a country as diverse as India, it must speak more than just English even as exhibitors showcased multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) designed specifically for Indian regional nuances. These tools are aimed at helping small business owners in remote villages to use AI for accounting, content generation and more.Vaishnaw also stated that several models launched at the Summit have been tested and measured against multiple parameters. When compared with global models, several Indian models have been rated better than many large international AI systems, underscoring India’s innovation capabilities.Acknowledging the potential misuse of AI, the IT minister highlighted the importance of a techno-legal approach to ensure AI is used for good while minimising harmful impacts. He also backed stronger regulations to tackle problems like deepfakes.IT minister said that AI is also impacting the publishers and they must get fair remuneration when their content is used by artificial intelligence (AI) companies to train their models.“Copyrights is also part of it. This is very complex. As most of the AI models are trained on media which is available in public domain. We believe that content creators, specially news creators, they must get a fair remuneration for the content they are creating,” said Vaishnaw while responding to reporters' questions at the India AI Summit 2026.“That is something that we sincerely believe as a government, and I think the public policy should also be oriented towards that. We are talking to the big platforms they have, more-or-less, shown inclination towards the process by which fair remuneration to content creators, especially the news creators who are the part of the conventional media where the content is used by digital platforms,” the minister added.","IT minister Ahswini Vaishnaw said that India will scale its compute capacity beyond the existing 38,000 GPUs.

Raids on X office in France and UK’s investigation into X, xAI

The legal pressure on Elon Musk ’s X, is mounting as Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has launched a “large-scale” investigation into the social media company, focusing on how its AI chatbot, Grok, handles sensitive user data to generate non-consensual sexual photos. The latest action against the company follows a series of high-profile raids and investigations across France and the UK, respectively. Both countries have previously warned xAI Grok to create harmful photos of real people, including children.“The DPC has been engaging with X since reports emerged of users prompting Grok to generate sexualized images of real people,” said Graham Doyle, DPC Deputy Commissioner, as per a report in The Financial Times. He added that the commission “has commenced a large-scale inquiry which will examine [X’s] compliance with some of their fundamental obligations under the GDPR in relation to the matters at hand”.The inquiry will examine if X failed its obligations to keep EU citizens’ data safe from such “potentially harmful” uses.Ireland joins a growing list of companies that have knocked on Musk’s door.

Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has reportedly rejected Paramount-Skydance's latest $30-per-share takeover bid. However, WBD is giving the Hollywood studio seven days to submit a better offer to acquire the owner of HBO Max and the Harry Potter franchise. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the rival bidder has until February 23 to submit itswhich Netflix is allowed to match under the terms of the merger agreement. This comes after Paramount informally raised the prospect of an even higher share price of $31, which appeared to bring WBD to the table. However, WBD made clear in its response that it still prefers the Netflix deal, with the chances of a switch remaining low.In a recent letter sent to the Paramount board (seen by Reuters), WBD Chairman Samuel DiPiazza Jr and CEO David Zaslav wrote,The two media companies have been competing for control of WBD, including its film and TV studios and extensive content library, reflecting the pressures created by ongoing changes in the entertainment industry.An unidentified Paramount financial advisor told Reuters that the company’s offer would be raised to $31 per share if WBD agreed to open negotiations and could go even higher. In the letter to Paramount, WBD added that it now expects a best-and-final proposal to include a price above that amount.Paramount's current offer for the entire company is $108.4 billion, while Netflix is offering $27.75 per share, or $82.7 billion, for its studio and streaming businesses only.WBD, which has repeatedly rejected Paramount's offers to buy the entire company, is moving forward with a vote on Netflix's bid for its studio and streaming services.The company’s shareholders will vote on March 20 on the Netflix merger, which would occur after WBD spins off its Discovery Global cable operations, including CNN, TLC, Food Network, and HGTV, into a separate, publicly traded company.Previously, Paramount said the WBD boardwith them across six different offers made in the 12 weeks before WBD announced its Netflix merger agreement on December 5, 2025A public hostile bid launched by Paramount days later was rejected later that month, and a revised offer that included a personal guarantee on $40 billion in equity from Oracle founder Larry Ellison was turned down in early January.WBD also faces pressure from activist investor Ancora Holdings, which has built a stake in the company and plans to oppose the Netflix transaction.Paramount is even pressing to add directors to the WBD board, with Pentwater Capital Management CEO Matt Halbower cited as a potential nominee. Pentwater, which owns about 50 million shares of WBD, has backed Paramount's bid.Halbower said.To open talks with Paramount, WBD secured a special waiver from Netflix, which allows limited negotiations with a rival bidder if the board believes the offer could be superior. Netflix said it remains confident in its deal.Netflix told Reuters.WBD said Paramount's amended merger agreement still falls short of what its board would consider a superior proposal, with key issues remaining unresolved, including who would cover a potential $1.5 billion junior lien financing fee, what happens if debt financing falls through, and whether equity funding backed by Larry Ellison is fully certain.The letter noted that while Paramount has argued financing concerns aregiven thedraft agreements now require that additional equity be funded if debt financing becomes unavailable.Ancora, which holds a stake worth nearly $200 million, said the WBD board did not adequately engage with Paramount and Skydance regarding its rival offer for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN and TNT.","Warner Bros.

India AI Impact Summit 2026: Mastercard unveils India’s first fully authenticated agentic commerce transaction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/india-ai-impact-summit-2026-mastercard-unveils-indias-first-fully-authenticated-agentic-commerce-transaction/articleshow/128465483.cms,"What 'Agentic Commerce' really is

After Day 1 Glitches at AI Summit, Ashwini Vaishnaw Says Sorry, Assures Better Arrangements

How secure Agentic Commerce is

Imagine asking an AI-powered chatbot to find the best deal on a new pair of belt, verify the website is safe and complete the purchase – all without you ever opening a shopping app or typing in your card details – That’s what Mastercard unveiled at the India AI Impact Summit 2026. Mastercard successfully demonstrated India’s first ‘fully authenticated agentic commerce transaction’. In plain English: an AI agent is given the power to shop and pay on behalf of a human, using a secure and regulated framework.For the average consumer, digital shopping usually involves a lot of manual work: opening an app, searching for a product, and eventually being redirected to a payment screen. Agentic Commerce automates this whole process.“Agentic commerce is not really one piece of technology, it is a culmination of multiple things coming together,” Gautam Aggarwal, president of India & South Asia at Mastercard, told The Times of India.“So the way I will probably explain it to a common man is today if you are doing any kind of a e-commerce digital commerce transaction: you go to an app, you probably have a credential where you've created a username password for yourself, you go through the journey of discovery of what you want to buy, you type in a search.And then you’ll end up going through a journey of payment. What agentic commerce has enabled available is bringing all of this in a way which is automated,” he explained.Mastercard is is involved with a massive network of Indian banks and payment providers. Mastercard cards issued by Axis Bank and RBL Bank were used using the demo. Payment aggregators like Razorpay, Cashfree, Juspay, and PayU provided the plumbing and the AI successfully interacted with merchants including Swiggy, Zepto, Vi (Vodafone Idea), and Tira.When it comes to money, people are pretty much wary about the expenses and security. Giving an AI “permission to pay” sounds risky, but Mastercard emphasises that the transaction used the same robust security features Indians are already familiar with.“We have built in a lot of security in the way we allow for payments to happen. The first phase of that was, of course, through tokenization and then now with passkeys. In the automated requires, there is enough Safety and Security built into payment systems, both by regulation and by innovation that companies like ours have done,” Aggarwal added.When talking about the challenges regarding wide adoption in India, Aggarwal said that scalability is no problem and it isn't the technology – it's consumer education..“The challenge always remains is generally what we see is the lack of education. We have to keep educating consumers,” he said.Mastercard plans to expand this framework across the Asia Pacific region, working with Large Language Model (LLM) providers to ensure that as Indians start talking to AI more, they can trust it with their wallets, too.","Mastercard demonstrated India’s first ‘fully authenticated agentic commerce transaction’ In plain English: an AI agent is given the power to shop and pay on behalf of a human, using a secure and regulated framework.

Showcased at the India AI Impact Summit 2026, these glasses aim to cater to Indian languages and use cases, differentiating themselves from English-centric competitors.

What runs under the hood—and what's still unknown

Sarvam AI has entered the smart glasses space with Sarvam Kaze, a pair of AI-powered glasses the Bengaluru-based startup says are fully designed and built in India. The company showed off the glasses at the India AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi.Co-founder Pratyush Kumar announced the product on X. ""Launching Sarvam Kaze, our foray into getting our models into your hands with our devices,"" he wrote. The glasses are set to go on sale in May 2026, with a chat feature expected to roll out later this week.On the surface, Kaze does what you'd expect from smart glasses in 2026—it listens, responds to voice commands, and captures what the wearer sees through embedded cameras. Sarvam is also letting developers build custom apps on its platform, though it hasn't shared much detail on what that looks like in practice.Where things get more specific is the AI underneath. Kaze runs on Sarvam's own foundational models, which are trained for Indian languages and use cases like voice interfaces and document processing. Meta's Ray-Ban glasses recently launched in India but still rely largely on English-first interactions, so there's a clear gap Sarvam is trying to fill.That said, there's a lot we don't know yet. Pricing, detailed hardware specs, battery life, and the actual quality of on-device AI responses are all still missing from the picture. The Kaze looks to have a clean spectacles-style frame, but beyond that, Sarvam hasn't given much away. The May launch will be the real test of whether the company can back up its hardware ambitions with a product that holds up against Meta's increasingly polished lineup.","Sarvam Kaze is an AI-powered pair of smart glasses designed and built in India.

DRDO DG calls for Desi AI solutions

Director General of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) Chandrika Kaushik made it clear at the ongoing AI Impact Summit that the country India cannot afford to rely on AI models built by foreign companies for military applications. Speaking at the AI summit to news agency ANI, Kaushik lamented the fact that there are not enough popular made-in-India AI models. Kaushik underscored the urgent need for indigenous artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in the defence sector. Speaking to ANI, Kaushik said, ""In the defence domain, we can't afford to depend on solutions and AI models which are coming from abroad. We need to be very sure about the trustworthiness of the models and the systems which we are adopting.""Talking about DRDO's initiatives, she said that the organisation has already developed two key frameworks. The first, the ETAI (Evaluating Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence) framework, focuses on building resilience into AI-enabled systems. The second provides guidelines for validating and verifying AI solutions, offering a structured approach for developers in the domain.We have started incorporating AI in almost every solution that we are developing, wherever there is data which can be used for analysis,"" she said, adding that AI applications are now moving closer to operational environments.""AI has started going to the edge. It is going to the battlefield itself. So, over time, we have to quickly gear up towards incorporating the AI solutions into the defence domain,"" Kaushik added.Highlighting the growing penetration of AI across sectors, she said that the technology has already spread across daily activities, from education to problem-solving and solution development. ""If you look at the students, you look at the teachers, you look at people who are making presentations, or you are trying to find quick solutions, or you are trying to develop solutions, the first thing is one kind of hook into an AI solution.

'Must Be Democratised': Vaishnaw Flags 'AI Divide', Hails Investments At India AI Impact Summit

Mission 2.0 bets big on AI-for-all and sovereign solutions

Chip design and clean energy round out the 2.0 vision

Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has outlined the contours of IndiaAI Mission 2.0, signalling a decisive shift toward research and development, deeper AI diffusion, and making artificial intelligence work for India's massive MSME sector. The announcement comes as the country hosts host the India AI Impact Summit 2026 at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi.Vaishnaw said Mission 2.0 will build on what the first phase achieved—a shared compute infrastructure of over 38,000 GPUs available at ₹65 per hour, sovereign AI models that have outperformed several global counterparts on key benchmarks, and a skilling programme spanning over 100 colleges. Stanford, he noted, has rated India among the top three AI nations globally.""We have shown our Prime Minister's vision of democratising technology,"" Vaishnaw said. ""Unlike in so many other countries, where the AI infrastructure is under the control of a handful of companies, India has been able to provide AI compute to a very large section of our population.""The most striking part of the Mission 2.0 pitch is the plan to package AI into ready-to-use, vetted solutions for small businesses—modelled on the UPI approach.The idea is to curate a bouquet of trusted tools, tested across parameters, and make them openly available for anyone to use and build on. ""Many of these solutions will become global, just like UPI has become a global solution today,"" Vaishnaw said, adding that Japan has already expressed interest.On sovereign AI, the minister stressed that self-reliance goes beyond just building homegrown models. It extends to chips, infrastructure, the control plane, and applications—essentially the ability to take solutions to scale without depending on external approvals.Semiconductor Mission 2.0 will make chip design a primary focus, with Vaishnaw expecting at least 50 design houses to emerge from India in the coming years. The Union Budget 2026–27 has already set aside Rs 1,000 crore for this phase, targeting industry-led research and training centres.Energy is the other piece of the puzzle. Vaishnaw pointed out that India has crossed the 50% mark for power generation from non-fossil fuel sources—five years ahead of its Paris Agreement target. For AI data centres that are notoriously power-hungry, that backstop matters.","India is set to launch AI Mission 2.0, prioritizing research, widespread AI adoption, and empowering MSMEs with ready-to-use solutions.

How Steve Jobs landed a job in 20 minutes without an application process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-steve-jobs-landed-a-job-in-20-minutes-without-an-application-process/articleshow/128460970.cms,"Steve Jobs (Image source: Reuters)

Steve Jobs’s first job came from a phone call



Why this story matters



What Bill Hewlett thought about Steve Jobs



The rest of Steve Jobs’ journey



Long before Steve Jobs became a co-founder of Apple and one of the most important people in modern technology, he had an experience that showed how he would live and work in a bold and different way. When he was just 12 years old, Jobs did something that many adults today would find almost unbelievable: he picked up the phone, dialled the direct line of a top corporate chief executive, and was offered a job shortly after the call; all in under 20 minutes, without filling out a single application form.According to reports, young Steve Jobs cold-called Bill Hewlett, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard (HP), simply because he wanted to work with electronics and machines. This was not the early 2000s, when job seekers relied on LinkedIn, email, and online applications. It was the mid-1960s, a time when corporate hierarchies were strict and entry into a leading technology company was typically limited to referrals or formal applications. But Jobs's drive, confidence, and willingness to go straight to the top of a company got him a job right away. This early story shows not only his drive but also the importance of direct communication, curiosity, and confidence; traits that would shape his later career.Steve Jobs was very interested in electronics and machines when he was a young teen. Jobs didn't wait for an opportunity or fill out job applications and wait for responses like most people do. Instead, he did something unusual: he found the name of one of the most important people in the tech world at the time, Bill Hewlett, and called his direct number.Hewlett was one of the people who started HP (Hewlett-Packard), a company known for its great engineering and new ideas. According to reports available on the internet, Jobs didn't talk to a receptionist or a human resources person; he called Hewlett directly. He introduced himself and briefly explained why he wanted to work with HP and what he wanted to do during the phone call. Hewlett was impressed by Jobs' boldness, and a few minutes later, he offered him a job on the spot, without a formal resume, interview, or application process.Jobs took the initiative and was willing to take a risk, which led to this opportunity. He didn't wait for someone to tell him to do it. He made his own chance.Amazingly, young Steve Jobs got a job in 20 minutes without applying. This is not because it's easy to do today, but because it shows how powerful initiative, boldness, and direct communication can be. When Jobs was 12, which is when most kids start school, he already knew a lot about opportunity: it usually favours people who take action.This episode also shows how much the job market has changed since the 1960s. It was rare but still possible to talk to a corporate leader directly on the phone because there were fewer formal online systems and digital barriers. Jobs's confidence in making that call shows a level of self-belief that is very rare in people his age.Bill Hewlett was surprised by the confidence and directness of the young caller. Rather than dismiss Jobs as an inexperienced kid, Hewlett listened to what he had to say and recognised his interest and enthusiasm. Hewlett’s reaction is also significant: it shows that leaders, when approached respectfully and directly, may be willing to give talent a chance, even outside conventional processes.This is a useful lesson not only for young job seekers but also for organisations: sometimes talent and passion can shine through unconventional paths.Steve Jobs's early job experience was short, but it was an important part of his early life. Jobs kept his interest in electronics and computers after that. In 1976, he and Steve Wozniak started Apple together. He later created the Macintosh, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad, which changed the whole tech industry. But calling Bill Hewlett was one of the first times he showed his natural drive and fearlessness.According to biographical records and interviews with Jobs, even later in life, he stressed the importance of following one’s curiosity and not being afraid to take risks, themes that appear clearly in this early job-seeking moment.","Steve Jobs's first job came from a phone call when he was 12 years old.

India currently has 38,000 GPUs under the IndiaAI Mission, and the total count could cross 1,00,000 by year-end.

India's total GPU count could cross 1 lakh by year-end

Why the compute push is critical to India's AI playbook

India is set to massively ramp up its AI compute muscle. Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced at the India AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi that over 50,000 GPUs will be deployed within the next six months—effectively more than doubling the country's current capacity.At present, India has 38,000 GPUs up and running under the IndiaAI Mission. Of the fresh additions, 20,000 are already in the pipeline and expected to come online shortly, while orders for another 40,000 will be placed separately. Vaishnaw described this as part of a continuous push to put high-quality compute power in the hands of startups, researchers, and students.Should the rollout go as planned, India's installed GPU base could comfortably breach the 1,00,000 mark before 2026 ends—a target IndiaAI Mission CEO Abhishek Singh had outlined earlier this month. That's nearly three times where things stand today.GPUs are the engine room of modern AI. They handle everything from training large language models to powering real-time applications in healthcare, agriculture, and public services. Under the IndiaAI Mission, these resources are available to developers at a subsidised rate of just Rs 65 per hour—deliberately kept low to ensure smaller players aren't priced out.India ranks as the world's third-largest AI ecosystem, behind only the US and China. But compute access has remained a sore spot — especially for early-stage startups and researchers trying to train foundation models without deep pockets. The IndiaAI Mission, backed by over Rs 10,300 crore in funding over five years, has been chipping away at this through public-private partnerships and empanelment rounds for GPU providers.

‘Crucial Role For India In AI Governance’: Duncan Cass-Beggs At AI Summit

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has said that India is taking a different, more practical approach to building AI compared to some global players. Speaking to news agency ANI at the ongoing India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, Vembu said that India is currently investing in smaller AI models that are efficient and cost-effective. He further stated that while these models may not be popular, they are effective for the country's specific needs. ""I think we are investing in lot of the smaller models. Those should be unglamorous right now, but they get the job done,"" he told the news agency. Referencing the startup Sarvam as an example of a company launching models with a smaller footprint, he said, ""This is going to be the norm in India where a lot of smaller resource efficient, energy efficient models and then we'll scale up over time as the costs decline.""As per the ANI report, Vembu also highlighted that India has a significant advantage due to its young population. ""With our vast youth population, we have the most AI enthusiastic population in the world. We are adopting AI faster than any other nation,” he noted.He further said that the Indian youth is already leading in technology adoption and creating new opportunities.Sridhar Vembu said Zoho is rapidly using AI to improve software development, adding that the company is seeing significant benefits from it.""Right now we are rapidly deploying AI in software development. We are seeing massive productivity gains in it,"" he said.Zoho plans to expand this adoption across the entire company over the next year, he highlighted.On the effect of AI over workforce in India, Vembu said that previous technology waves have always created jobs and believes AI will do the same.

Government's new IT rules make AI content labelling mandatory



IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has called for a techno-legal approach to tackle AI-generated harmful content. Speaking to reporters at the ongoing IndiaAI Impact Summit 2026, the minister said that there is a consensus among the global leaders over how AI should be used for good, and that India needs stronger regulation to curb deepfakes.“A good consensus is emerging among the global leaders. In our interaction, so far, with many other countries, everybody believes that yes, AI should be used for good and all the harmful impact must be contained,” Vaishnaw told The Times of India when asked whether the government is working on any policy or regulations to take actions against companies that fail to meet requirement to curb the use of AI technology for malicious purposes.“It has to be done through a techno-legal approach and cannot be done through passing a law. It has to be done through a technological approach where technology can be used in a safe way,” he added, pointing out that India has “IndiaAI Safety Institute (AISI) and we are working with many academic institutions for creating the Technical Solutions to prevent harmful impact of AI.”AISI has been established to develop indigenous, secure and ethical AI frameworks, focusing on mitigating risks like deepfakes.However, while talking about deepfakes rampant online, Vaishnaw said that there is a need for much stronger regulation to curb such content.“I think we need a stronger regulation on deepfakes. It is a problem growing day by day. We need to protect our society from this harm. We have initiated a dialogue with the industry on this,” he told the reporters.“Certainly there is a need for protecting our children, protecting our society from these harms. We have already initiated a dialogue with industry on this. What we need is beyond what we have, already beyond the steps that we have already taken. Even our IT Committee of the Parliament has studied this issue, and they have made some recommendations,” he said.“So, certainly, I believe that, yes. We need much stronger regulation of Depfakes, and we definitely must create that consensus within the parliament for creating those significantly stronger regulation,” the minister added.When asked about age-based restrictions, he said that age based regulation is needed, and that the government has created this age-based differentiation on the content, which is accessible to students and young people”.Vaishnaw’s comments came a week after the government brought AI-generated content - deepfake videos, synthetic audio, altered visuals – under a formal regulatory framework for the first time by amending India's IT intermediary rules.Notified via gazette notification G.S.R. 120(E) and signed by Joint Secretary Ajit Kumar, the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Amendment Rules, 2026, take effect from February 20.The new rules make it mandatory for platforms like YouTube, Meta-owned Instagram, Facebook and X (formerly Twitter), among others to label all synthetically generated information (SGI) prominently enough for users to spot it instantly.These platforms have also been asked to deploy automated tools to cross-verify, checking the content's format, source and nature before it goes live.",Government's new IT rules make AI content labelling mandatory.

“If we end up creating an unequal society... we have failed,”

Former NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said India is contributing more data to AI development than the United States. The G20 Sherpa has also urged the country to build its own AI models to benefit from this contribution. Speaking at the India AI Summit 2026, Kant said:He has also warned that without a framework for Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), the world risks creating a deeply unequal global society. He said AI's evolution must be guided by three pillars: accessibility, affordability, and accountability.Kant highlighted a significant disparity in how large language models (LLMs) are trained, noting that the Global South is the engine room of AI development. He argued that for AI to be inclusive, it must move beyond English-centric models and become natively multilingual to serve diverse populations.Drawing parallels with India's success in financial inclusion, Kant suggested that AI should follow the blueprint of the country's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), which enabled India to achieve decades of development in seven years. DPI is an open, interoperable digital framework for identity, payments, and data exchange that helps governments deliver secure and accessible public services at scale.Kant said. He was participating in a session titledOther panellists included Amandeep Singh Gill of the United Nations , Arunabha Ghosh of CEEW, Claire Melamed and Kunalika Gautam of the UN Foundation, Ruchira Goyal of Sustainable Food Systems, and Safiya Husain of Karya. Kant added that in his proposed framework, social transformation can be achieved by using AI to address grassroots issues in health, education, and agriculture.Reflecting on the post-World War 2 economic trajectory of the West, Kant warned that progress does not always guarantee equity. He cautioned that the current trajectory of large AI investment could lead to aif the technology remains concentrated in the hands of a few.Kant said, stressing that the goal must be to transform the lives of citizens in the Global South, rather than increasing the valuation of large technology companies.","Former NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said India is contributing more data to AI development than the United States.

Billionaires exodus from California



Mark Zuckerberg's $50 million donation to California



Florida's famous 'Billionaire Bunkers' may soon get a new Billionaire as its resident. And it is reported to be Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are the latest California billionaires to buy a home in South Florida. The couple are reported to be buying a newly completed waterfront mansion on Miami’s Indian Creek, as per sources with knowledge of the transaction.As to those wondering what gives Florida's Indian Creek 'Billionaire Bunkers' title: It is the residents. The gated man-made barrier island Indian Creek boasts of several billionaires as its residents. Indian Creek Island operates as an independent municipality with its own government and private police who patrol by air, water, and sky. It reportedly has 41 lots and 84 residents. The names include Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, popular investor Carl Icahn and billionaire auto dealer Norman Braman. Google founders Lary Page and Sergey Brin too are said to have bought properties in Florida.Zuckerberg is likely to live next door to billionaire Braman and his wife Irma Braman. WSJ reached out to Irma about Zuckerberg joining them in the neighbourhood. She said that Zuckerberg had told them he planned to move into the property by April.“We’re happy to have him,” she said. Bezos' house too is a few doors away from Zuckerberg's.As per reports, the 27,669-square-foot limestone mansion that is likely to be Zuckerberg family's new home has nine bedrooms, a gym, a hair salon, a massage room, a 1,500-gallon aquarium and a library with a secret passageway.Facebook founder Zuckerberg is the latest tech billionaire to descend on Miami as California proposes a 5% billionaire tax. While some billionaires including Donald Trump's AI Czar have been open about leaving California, others have been largely discreet. Other than Google founder Larry Page and Sergey Brin, billionaires who have shifted base from California include Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and PayPal/Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel.What makes Florida attractive for billionaires is that it offers no state income tax. Danny Hertzberg, a Miami real-estate agent at Coldwell Banker Realty, told WSJ that the 5% tax in California is really driving out people in a major way.The 5% tax in California has been proposed by SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. The workers body is said to be circulating petitions to put the tax on the November ballot. The estimated $100 billion produced by the tax would replace funds hospitals were getting before the federal government tightened enforcement of eligibility requirements for subsidized health insurance.Incidentally Meta CEO does not seem to be in the mood to cut his ties from California. Zuckerberg recently pledged $50 million to Sacramento State University to fuel state-of-the-art STEM labs and an AI center as part of his philanthropic efforts under the CHAN-Zuckerberg Initiative. California Governor Gavin Newsom unveiled the gift on Jan. 28, tying it to a major redevelopment of three vacant state office buildings on Sacramento’s Capitol Mall into a downtown campus.","Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are the latest California billionaires to buy a home in South Florida.

AI adoption in India and the UK could outpace the US and China

How AI cooperation could redefine the UK-India alliance

Artificial intelligence may dominate headlines in Silicon Valley and Beijing, but a British minister believes the real opportunity could lie elsewhere. During a visit to India this week, UK Minister for AI and Online Safety, Kanishka Narayan, said that while the biggest AI laboratories are based in the US and China, India and the United Kingdom could become the world’s leading destinations for AI adoption.As reported by PTI, a Labour MP of Indian heritage representing a Welsh constituency is in India for the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi. His message centres on opportunity, but also responsibility. Artificial intelligence, he argues, presents exceptional economic potential. The challenge is ensuring that this potential is harnessed in ways that benefit society more broadly.Narayan made it clear that the UK and India may not rival the US or China in hosting the largest frontier AI labs. Instead, he believes the two countries can excel in adopting AI across key sectors such as services, healthcare, and life sciences, leveraging unique strengths and local expertise.India’s vast population and rapidly evolving healthcare ecosystem provide, in his view, a powerful test bed for AI-driven innovation. Britain, meanwhile, brings strengths anchored by institutions such as the National Health Service and a globally respected life sciences sector.He also pointed to the importance of shaping the next phase of research and development in areas such as frontier AI, semiconductors, and emerging technologies that could transform industries worldwide.Narayan also tied AI collaboration to the wider UK-India relationship, pointing to the recently signed free trade deal. He said the agreement shows that Britain is serious about working with fast-growing economies and building partnerships based on shared interests. He described a ‘living bridge’ between the two countries, pointing to strong people-to-people connections that go beyond formal deals. While trade agreements and political leaders may change over time, these personal ties give lasting strength to the relationship.","UK Minister for AI and Online Safety, Kanishka Narayan, said that while the biggest AI laboratories are based in the US and China, India and the UK could become the world’s leading destinations for AI adoption.

From Trust To Technology: How India’s Digital Media Is Redefining Power In The Age Of AI Disruption

Journalistic content is not ‘fodder’

AI summaries ‘under lens’

Journalism is not “free-floating internet input” for AI models to consume and is an essential “democratic infrastructure” that requires protection and payment, India’s top media leaders declared in a powerful appeal to tech giants during a panel discussion on “AI and Media: Opportunities, Responsible Pathways, and the Road Ahead” convened by Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) at the IndiaAI Impact Summit 2026, organised by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).The conversation was about whether journalism must be treated differently from other content in AI systems.“Journalism is not a free-floating internet input but intellectual property created through investment, editorial oversight and accountability. When AI begins to commoditise information, trust becomes scarce—and that scarcity creates value,” said Mohit Jain, COO and executive director, Bennett Coleman & Company Limited.The panel features heads from The Times of India, the India Today Group, Dainik Bhaskar, The Hindu, and Amar Ujala, argued that news carries a weight that standard internet data does not. The discussion emphasised that since news influences elections, markets and social stability, it cannot be treated as mere ""fodder"" for AI training.A major concern raised during the summit was how AI summaries – like AI overviews in Google Search and those provided by AI chatbots are hurting the news business.By providing a quick AI-generated answer, these tools stop users from clicking through to the original news website, which in turn decreases the traffic on news publishers’ website.Robert Whitehead of the International News Media Association (INMA) warned that if journalism provides the “truth” that makes AI systems accurate, there must be a fair way to pay for that value.“AI-driven summaries in search environments are already diverting traffic away from publisher websites in several markets, weakening revenue models that sustain credible reporting. If journalism funds the accuracy of AI systems, there must be fair recognition and remuneration for that value,” said Whitehead.The publishers pointed to global laws that are already forcing big tech companies to pay for news. For example, Australia’s News Media Bargaining Code has led to deals between AI companies and publishers. Similarly, in Europe, the EU AI Act requires clear labeling of AI content, while France and Germany have laws forcing platforms to negotiate for content use.The session concluded with an understanding that AI presents both opportunity and responsibility in safeguarding journalism as a trusted public good.","Journalism is not a free-floating internet input but intellectual property created through investment, editorial oversight and accountability.

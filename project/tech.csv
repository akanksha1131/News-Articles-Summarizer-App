What made Tea and TeaOnHer dating apps controversial





Two controversial dating safety apps, Tea and TeaOnHer, have been pulled from the Apple App Store following violations of Apple ’s guidelines on content moderation and user privacy. The removal, first reported by app store intelligence provider Appfigures, occurred earlier this week across all markets. Apple confirmed to TechCrunch that the apps were removed due to non-compliance with App Review Guidelines 1.2, 5.1.2, and 5.6, which address user-generated content moderation, unauthorized sharing of personal information, and excessive user complaints.Both apps, however, remain available on Google Play Store According to an Apple representative, the apps failed to address concerns raised by the company, including reports of minors’ personal information being shared. Negative user reviews and complaints further contributed to the decision. The developers of Tea and TeaOnHer have not yet responded to requests for comment.Tea, launched in 2023 and gaining viral attention in 2025, marketed itself as a safety tool for women, allowing users to share details about men on dating apps, including personal information, reviews, and “green flag” or “red flag” labels, similar to the “Are We Dating the Same Guy?” Facebook groups.However, the app faced backlash from men who argued it violated their privacy and raised defamation concerns. Over the summer, Tea suffered a significant data breach, exposing 72,000 images, including 3,000 selfies and photo IDs used for account verification, as well as 59,000 images from posts and messages.TeaOnHer, a rival app launched to allow men to review women similarly, also faced scrutiny after TechCrunch reported security flaws in August that exposed users’ personal data, including government IDs and selfies. According to Appfigures, Tea recorded 6.1 million lifetime downloads and $5 million in gross revenue, while TeaOnHer saw 2.2 million downloads without in-app purchases. Despite their removal from the App Store, copycat apps are gaining traction. Notably, TeaOnHer and Him – Overheard has climbed from No. 90 to No. 27 on the Overall Top App Charts, with 354,000 downloads.As the apps remain live on Google Play, questions linger about their future and the broader implications for user privacy and safety in dating app ecosystems.","Tea and TeaOnHer dating apps have been removed from the Apple App Store.

What Perplexity said on Reddit's lawsuit





Lawsuits against AI chabot companies have been piling up. Latest to face legal trouble is Perplexity. On Wednesday, October 22, social media giant Reddit filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against artificial intelligence startup Perplexity and three data-scraping companies: Lithuania-based Oxylabs, Russia-based AWMProxy, and Texas-based SerpApi. In its complaint, Reddit claims that these companies unlawfully scraped Reddit’s data to train Perplexity’s AI-powered “answer engine,”. Reddit said that the data-scraping companies circumvented its data protection measures to steal data that Perplexity ""desperately needs"" to power its ""answer engine"" system.The lawsuit against Reddit is part of a growing wave of legal challenges by content owners against tech companies, accusing them of misusing copyrighted material to train AI systems.Reddit, known for its vast network of interest-based “subreddit” communities, claims its platform is the most frequently cited source for AI-generated responses to user queries. The company accuses Perplexity of collaborating with at least one of the named data-scraping firms to access billions of search results without permission, despite lacking a license to use Reddit’s content. Reddit has previously licensed its data to companies like Google and OpenAI for AI training purposes.The lawsuit follows a similar legal action Reddit initiated against AI startup Anthropic in June, which remains ongoing. Reddit’s chief legal officer, Ben Lee, described the case as part of a broader issue, stating, “AI companies are locked in an arms race for quality human content—and that pressure has fueled an industrial-scale ‘data laundering’ economy.”Reddit alleges it sent Perplexity a cease-and-desist letter last year, after which Perplexity reportedly increased its citations to Reddit content “forty-fold.” The company is now seeking unspecified monetary damages and a court order to prevent Perplexity from using its dataIn response, Perplexity defended its practices. In a statement, the company said, “Our approach remains principled and responsible as we provide factual answers with accurate AI, and we will not tolerate threats against openness and the public interest.”",Reddit files lawsuit against AI startup Perplexity and three data-scraping companies.

Earlier today, we made some changes to MSL to move us toward being the most agile and talent-dense team in the industry.

By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact.

It's never an easy decision to say goodbye to colleagues. These are talented people who have worked extremely hard and contributed to our Al effort. Anyone in North America whose role was impacted has already been notified. Those who may be impacted in EMEA have been notified and remain subject to consultation.

We are supporting the majority of those impacted in finding new roles at the company. We have spun up a tiger team of recruiters to help this group find the right match for their expertise and land in roles through an expedited hiring process.

This by no means signals any decrease in investment. In fact, we will continue to hire industry-leading Al-native talent. Our goal is to enable MSL to move faster. We remain excited about the models we are training, our ambitious compute plans, and the products we are building, and I'm confident in our path to superintelligence.





Just weeks ago Mark Zuckerberg 's Superintelligence Labs unit was in news for hiring AI researchers at $100 million pay packages. So much so that, Meta's AI division started talent war in Silicon Valley, poaching AI engineers from rivals including Google, Apple and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI at multi-million-dollar salary packages. Nobody in the talent race for AI researchers has been chasing the prized recruits quite like Meta and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

Australia has reportedly launched an investigation into the safety practice of several artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot companies, asking them to explain how they prevent minors from being exposed to harmful or sexual content. According to a Reuters report, the country’s eSafety Commissioner has sent notice to Character Technologies, owner of celebrity simulation chatbot tool character.ai, and rivals Glimpse.AI, Chai Research and Chub AI demanding explanations of their content filters, child protection systems and moderation processes.The regulator, as per the report, said that the step was necessary amid rising fears that unregulated AI chatbots could expose young users to sexual conversations or promote self-harm.The Reuters report quotes Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in the statement: “There can be a darker side to some of these services, with many ... chatbots capable of engaging in sexually explicit conversations with minors,” adding “Concerns have been raised that they may also encourage suicide, self-harm and disordered eating.”The order comes under Australia’s strict online safety framework, which allows the regulator to compel companies to reveal their safety measures or face fines of up to A$825,000 (about $536,000) per day.Character.ai, one of the largest AI chatbot platforms, is already facing a lawsuit in the U.S. after the mother of a teenager alleged that her son took his own life following repeated chats with an AI companion. The company has said it has since introduced safety alerts that link users expressing suicidal thoughts to mental health hotlines.The eSafety office said it has received reports from schools suggesting that some students spend up to five hours a day chatting with AI bots — in some cases about sexual topics. Experts warn that such prolonged exposure can lead to emotional dependency or risky behavior among children.According to Reuters, OpenAI — the creator of ChatGPT — has not been included in this round of inquiries because Australia’s current safety code applies only to AI chatbots designed for companionship or role-play. ChatGPT will fall under the same regulatory framework from March 2026.From December, social media companies in Australia will be required to block or delete accounts belonging to users under 16 years of age or face a fine of up to A$49.5 million – part of the government’s broader push to safeguard young people's mental and physical health.","Australia has reportedly launched an investigation into the safety practice of several artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot companies.

Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has announced that it has designated Apple and Google as holding “strategic market status” in the smartphone sector. This move means that the regulator will now have ‘more powers’ to demand specific changes aimed at boosting competition and innovation.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the CMA stated that Apple's iOS and Google's Android platforms are used by millions of businesses and consumers, but current rules—such as restrictions within their app stores—may be ""limiting innovation and competition.""The regulator further emphasised that this action aligns with steps being taken by the US, the European Union (EU), and Japan against the two tech giants.The CMA clarified that the designation is not a finding of wrongdoing and does not introduce immediate requirements. Instead, it will now consider “proportionate, targeted interventions” to ensure the platforms are open to effective competition.Google, which received its first strategic market status designation earlier this month for its search operations, called the decision “disappointing, disproportionate and unwarranted.”Oliver Bethell, Google's senior competition director, stated in a blog post, “The CMA's next steps will be crucial if the UK's digital markets regime is to meet its promise of being pro-growth and pro-innovation.”Meanwhile, Apple responded by saying it “worked tirelessly” to create the best products and user experience. The company urged the UK not to follow the EU's example of intervention, which it claimed had left users with weaker privacy and security, and delayed access to new features.“We've seen the impact of regulation on Apple users in the EU, and we urge the UK not to follow the same path,” Apple stated.","Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has designated Apple and Google as holding “strategic market status” in the smartphone sector.

If you're someone who struggles to escape doom scrolling during work hours or finds yourself endlessly scrolling through YouTube Shorts in your free time, the Google-owned company is now rolling out a solution to limit your watch time. YouTube has introduced a feature for its Shorts platform, allowing mobile users to set customisable daily limits on how long they can scroll through video feeds.The move aims to help viewers better manage their time and curb endless scrolling, The Verge reported.When a user reaches their self-imposed time limit, they will receive a notification stating that Shorts has been paused for the remainder of the day. While this notification is dismissible, the feature empowers users to honour their own restrictions.“Shorts are a core part of the YouTube experience,” YouTube said in its announcement.“Setting a scrolling time limit on the Shorts feed allows for this exploration while helping users be more deliberate about their viewing habits and manage their time effectively,” the company added.The option to set and adjust these custom time limits for Shorts can be found within the YouTube account settings. YouTube states that the feature is ""beginning to roll out"" today, so it may take some time to become available for all mobile users.The company also plans to expand this feature to parental controls “later this year,” where these limit notifications for children will be non-dismissible, offering a more proactive approach to managing kids' screen time.Notably, this new functionality mirrors similar optional screen time limits offered by other social media platforms like Instagram. The Verge reports that TikTok also offers the same feature and is the only platform that currently extends this feature to web users as well.","YouTube Shorts users can now set daily limits on how long they can scroll.

Google expands AI infrastructure and data centres

Strengthening Belgium’s digital future

AI’s potential for economic growth





US tech giant Google has announced plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network, creating hundreds of new jobs and supporting local economic growth. The investment will focus on the company’s existing Saint-Ghislain site and the new Farciennes campus, with construction already underway. Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade. Most jobs are expected to be supported or improved by AI, with only a small portion at risk of automation. By expanding AI infrastructure, Google aims to equip Belgian companies and the workforce with advanced digital tools while fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. The investment positions Belgium as a hub for next-generation AI innovation in Europe. It also signals Google’s commitment to combining technological advancement with environmental responsibility, shaping the future of digital and green growth.","Google plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network.

Not only Anthropic, Hoffman also sided with tech giants like Google and OpenAI , saying that these companies are deploying AI in the right manner.The clash erupted when White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks accused Anthropic of employing “a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fearmongering” to advance AI regulation—an approach Sacks claims stifles innovation and startups.

Some are significant enough that they warrant setting the record straight,” Amodei wrote.In a strategic move, Amodei aligned himself with Vice President JD Vance—effectively using the administration's own words against Sacks.“I strongly agree with Vice President JD Vance's recent comments on AI—particularly his point that we need to maximize applications that help people, like breakthroughs in medicine and disease prevention, while minimizing the harmful ones.

Tesla board chairman calls proxy advisory firm’s criticism of Elon Musk’s $1 trillion pay ‘misguided recommendations’; writes open letter to shareholders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-board-chairman-calls-proxy-advisory-firms-criticism-of-elon-musks-1-trillion-pay-misguided-recommendations-writes-open-letter-to-shareholders/articleshow/124742478.cms,"

Here’s the full letter shared by Tesla board chairman

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

Following recent misguided recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis regarding Proposals 1, 3 and 4, I want to set the record straight on the reelection of our directors and Elon’s equity incentives.

At Tesla, we would rather design visionary systems than be constrained by what’s conventional. We are not afraid to break the mold and we build things the right way. In contrast, ISS and Glass Lewis evaluate all companies and all proposals using the same simplistic, one-size-fits-all framework.

They are fundamentally unable to evaluate companies, like Tesla, that chart their own course and challenge the status quo. Thankfully our shareholders have ignored their recommendations – otherwise, you may have missed out on our market capitalization soaring 20x while the proxy advisors time and time again recommended “against” Tesla proposals designed to promote the sort of extraordinary growth we have enjoyed.

I encourage you to ignore ISS’s and Glass Lewis’s advice for this year’s Annual Meeting and vote with the Board’s recommendations on all proposals. Let me address some of the key misconceptions reflected in ISS’s and Glass Lewis’s recommendations.

But you’re giving him too much money!

Elon gets nothing unless shareholders enjoy exceptional investment returns. The 2025 CEO

Performance Award

was designed with one overarching purpose: to supercharge Tesla’s next phase of exceptional growth, innovation and value creation.

There are no layups, and Elon only gets additional voting rights if he delivers on bold market capitalization and operational goals. Furthermore, he only gets to keep those voting rights and obtain the associated economic benefits if he leads Tesla for at least 7.5 more years.

This plan delivers enormous upside to shareholders, who will receive approximately nine-tenths of the value created. To put it into perspective, even if Elon only hits the first milestone, he will be delivering approximately a trillion dollars of sustained value to shareholders, almost doubling our current market capitalization, far exceeding any payout to Elon for achieving that tranche.

In other words: this performance incentive award is generally contingent on delivering products that support Elon’s vision for Sustainable Abundance, addresses shareholder concerns regarding retention and long-term succession, and ultimately creates extraordinary shareholder value. There is no guaranteed pay because we believe the key to Tesla’s long-term success lies in ensuring alignment of our CEO’s interests with those of our shareholders.

But you’re going to cause too much dilution!

Shareholders should consider this award to be an investment; not dilution. If the full 2025 CEO Performance Award vests at the highest market capitalization milestone, Tesla’s market capitalization would experience a 7.5x increase in value in exchange for 13.12% dilution by the proxy advisors’ highest estimate.

The proxy advisors’ preoccupation with dilution misses the point that the pie must increase by more than seven-fold to get there. In contrast to ISS’s and Glass Lewis’s rigid views of the world – which sees shareholders as “giving away value” – those of us on the Board believe in a reality where every shareholder gets a bigger slice of the growing pie. While I don’t agree with many statements in the proxy advisors’ reports, I agree with ISS’s acknowledgement that our 2025 CEO Performance Award is designed so that “historical value would be realized not only for Musk, but also for the company's shareholders.”

But the product goals are way too easy!

There are no “easy” milestones under the 2025 CEO Performance Award. To achieve the final Adjusted EBITDA milestone, Elon will need to lead Tesla to $400 billion in Adjusted EBITDA – which means growing our current Adjusted EBITDA by ~26x.

This award aims to see Tesla grow larger than any company in history. Each and every operational milestone, including the product goals, must be validated by an extraordinarily ambitious – and sustained – increase in market capitalization. Market capitalization – the market’s verdict on real value – can’t be “gamed” through aggressive pricing or other tactics to create illusory growth; Tesla’s market capitalization targets require profitable, real-world products.

If Elon doesn’t deliver sustained increases in market capitalization to validate the success of any product goal, he will earn nothing under such product goal.

You didn’t need to do this to keep Elon. What he really wants is votes!

The 2025 CEO Performance Award channels Elon’s desire for a stable ownership structure to promote extraordinary growth into what shareholders actually care about: sustained, long-term value creation.

While the Special Committee evaluated designing a high-vote structure, it wasn’t feasible under current rules. Instead, the 2025 CEO Performance Award improves upon the wildly successful 2018 CEO Performance Award by separating voting power from economic value to strengthen alignment among Elon, Tesla and shareholders and promotes longer term retention by delaying vesting of any earned share for at least 7.5 years.

Voting rights on a tranche are only earned after shareholders win – and win big.

But your governance for compensation is flawed!

The disinterested Special Committee undertook a seven-month long process to design and negotiate the 2025 CEO Performance Award and Special Share Reserve under the A&R 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. Most importantly, even following that rigorous process shareholders still have the final say.

Governance is not an end in and of itself, but a necessary ingredient for durable, long-term value creation. We judge governance by results, and Tesla’s stock has delivered annualized returns of almost 50% since the beginning of 2018, far outpacing the broader market.

While ISS and Glass Lewis would prefer that we follow the herd and apply their cookie-cutter guidelines, it is precisely Tesla’s ability to lead, innovate and think independently that has enabled such extraordinary shareholder returns.

And your directors are bad at governance!

Our longest standing independent director, Ira, is uniquely qualified to serve on our board and lead our governance efforts, having received numerous awards in the corporate governance and growth company spaces. While Ira has been guiding our governance and compensation, total shareholder returns have topped 39,000%.

As Tesla continues to grow shareholder value through technological progress, Kathleen’s decades of legal and operating experience and compensation, human capital and management knowledge will be crucial for Tesla to win the AI talent war.

To be a great director at Tesla, there’s no question that you must have thick skin. As a trailblazing company willing to break the mold in pursuit of an extraordinary future, it’s no surprise that our directors are easy targets. Despite this, our directors have consistently demonstrated their integrity and risen above the criticisms of those too narrow-minded to appreciate our ambitious vision.

The fact is both Ira and Kathleen are widely recognized as corporate governance leaders because they remain passionately focused on our mission to create Sustainable Abundance for all. They have the fortitude to do the right thing – which is often the hard thing – by prioritizing shareholders’ long-term interests rather than caving to short-term desires in support of the whims of critics.

Tesla designs and builds robots, but we don’t let robots design our governance structure as ISS and Glass Lewis would prefer. That is why we have assembled a Board with a wide array of perspectives, from people with varied experiences. In contrast to the formulaic approach reflected in ISS’s and Glass Lewis’s recommendations on our directors and Proposals 3 and 4, we on the Tesla Board don’t see governance as a one-size-fits-all exercise.

We view governance as a dynamic process, where we act with transparency and integrity as all of our directors work together to deliver financial value to our shareholders. The way we practice governance demands bold, deliberative and thought-provoking leadership as we face new challenges, navigate new paths, and ultimately drive Tesla into an exciting future with Sustainable Abundance for all. Our more thoughtful governance process requires dedication and contributions from incredible directors like Ira, Kathleen and Joe.

So, in evaluating these recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, as well as any third-party advice regarding your vote at this year’s Annual Meeting, we encourage you – shareholders who have made an actual financial investment in Tesla’s future – to make your own decision rather than following proxy advisors who don’t own a single share of Tesla stock.

I think it is noteworthy that ISS and Glass Lewis have both announced plans to update their product offerings, with Glass Lewis admitting that “the traditional one-size-fits-all model of proxy advice no longer meets the needs of a diverse client base.” So, their models are changing, just not today, and not for our Annual Meeting. Well, at Tesla, we know that progress waits for no one and speed is crucial to success.

While the proxy advisors tinker with their models, I urge you to take back your vote.

If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis. If you believe that Tesla, under the visionary leadership of Elon and the oversight of a Board that includes business leaders with integrity like Ira, Kathleen and Joe, then you should vote with Tesla.

Thank you for your continued support of Tesla.

Very truly yours,

Robyn Denholm

Chairperson of the Board

Here’s what USCIS said in the update

ALERT: USCIS will process H-1B, H-2A, and H-2B related Form I-129 petitions and CW-1 related Form I-129CW petitions during the government shutdown. We recognize, however, that the shutdown may affect a petitioner’s ability to get required documentation (such as a labor condition application or a temporary labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor), which may delay their ability to file Form I-129 or Form I-129CW.

If an H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, or CW-1 petitioner meets all other applicable requirements and submits evidence establishing that the primary reason they did not timely file an extension of stay or change of status request was due to the government shutdown, we will consider the government shutdown an extraordinary circumstance beyond the petitioner’s control when we determine whether to excuse their failure to timely file the extension of stay or change of status request. We will monitor the situation closely and publish additional guidance if needed. Find additional information in Vol. 2, Part A, Chapter 4 of the USCIS Policy Manual.





US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) recently alerted that it will continue processing visa applications for select candidates despite the ongoing government shutdown.

There have been reports of Cosmic Orange colour models of iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max turning pink. Users have shared pictures of iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max phones turning pink on Twitter, Reddit and other social media platforms.Apple's iPhone 17 Pro models 'Hero colour' option is vibrant Cosmic Orange with Anodized Aluminum finish. The discolouration issue reported by some users reportedly appears to stem from the nature of Anodized Aluminum. Unlike harder metals like Titanium, which have a non-porous finish, Anodized Aluminum is porous, allowing dyes like Cosmic Orange to penetrate and create its vivid look. After dyeing, the metal is sealed to lock in the color.According to a report in Toms Guide that quotes, 2013 blog post by Mark Jazefowicz, VP of Technical Services at PF Finishing, cited by TechRadar, anodized aluminum undergoes rigorous cleaning and sterilization processes, sometimes involving hydrogen peroxide.

"Why Europe's fight with Chinese chip company Nexperia has 'worried' GM, Honda, Volkswagen and other auto companies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-europes-fight-with-chinese-chip-company-nexperia-has-worried-gm-honda-volkswagen-and-other-auto-companies/articleshow/124741383.cms,"Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

GM, Volkswagen and others issue 'disruption' warning

'Nexperia chip stocks may last only weeks', warns European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association





China’s new export restrictions on automotive chips and components, prompted by the Dutch government’s takeover of Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia, have left global auto companies including GM, Honda, Volkswagen and others 'shocked' and 'anxious'. According to a report by Nikkei Asia, the tension between Netherland government and China over Nexperia are roiling the global automotive supply chain, escalating tensions in the tech rivalry between China and Europe.The turmoil stems from the Netherlands’ invocation of its Goods Availability Act to intervene in Nexperia’s operations, citing “serious governance shortcomings.” Nexperia, based in Nijmegen and acquired by Shanghai-listed Wingtech Technology in 2019, faced scrutiny after Dutch Economic Affairs Minister Vincent Karremans informed Parliament on October 14, 2025, that the company’s role in the Dutch and European semiconductor ecosystem posed “great economic security importance. ” In apparent retaliation, Beijing barred Nexperia’s China arm and its subcontractors from exporting specific components and sub-assemblies made in China.General Motors CEO Mary Barra warned during the company’s quarterly earnings call on October 21, 2025, that Beijing’s curbs on certain chips could disrupt production. “We have an internal team working around the clock with our supply chain partners to minimize possible disruptions,” Barra told Nikkei Asia, describing the situation as “very fluid” and promising further updates.He highlighted issues including the “improper transfer” of production capacity, financial resources, and intellectual property to a foreign entity linked to Nexperia’s CEO, Zhang Xuezheng, who was subsequently suspended as a director and removed as CEO.The impact extends beyond GM. Simon Schutz of the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) noted on October 21, 2025, that Nexperia, a key supplier of semiconductors for vehicle electronics, informed German automakers and suppliers on October 10 that it could not guarantee chip supplies. “The situation could soon lead to significant production restrictions—or even a stop in production—if the interruption of Nexperia chip deliveries cannot be resolved in the short term,” Schutz warned, adding that the VDA is collaborating with companies, the German government, and the European Commission to find solutions.German auto giant Volkswagen warned of temporary production outages citing China’s export restrictions on semiconductors made by Nexperia. A spokesperson for Volkswagen told CNBC by email that while Nexperia is not a direct supplier of the company, some Nexperia parts are used in its vehicle components, which are supplied by Volkswagen’s direct suppliers. “We are in close contact with all relevant stakeholders in light of the current situation to identify potential risks at an early stage and to be able to make decisions regarding any necessary measures,” a Volkswagen spokesperson said. “However, given the evolving circumstances, short-term effects on production cannot be ruled out,” they added.The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) cautioned that Nexperia chip stocks may last only weeks, with sourcing alternatives potentially taking months. “We suddenly find ourselves in this alarming situation,” said ACEA Director General Sigrid de Vries, noting the issue affects numerous suppliers and most ACEA members.Nexperia’s October 9 notice to Japanese clients, seen by Nikkei Asia, flagged potential supply disruptions as a force majeure event. Honda Motor told Nikkei it is assessing impacts, as some of its components use Nexperia chips, though production remains unaffected so far. Meanwhile, a Japanese semiconductor distributor reported a fivefold surge in orders for chips from other manufacturers, like Texas Instruments, while another is negotiating switches to alternative suppliers.","China’s new export restrictions on automotive chips and components have left global auto companies'shocked' and 'anxious' The tension between Netherland government and China over Nexperia are roiling the global automotive supply chain, escalating tensions in the tech rivalry between China and Europe.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124741376,imgsize-141690,width-400,resizemode-4/netherlands-nexperia.jpg"

Netflix has said that it has significantly expanded the use of generative AI across its platform, from personalising content discovery to empowering filmmakers and revolutionising its advertising business, the streaming giant revealed in its latest shareholder letter. The company, which already uses machine learning and AI extensively for content recommendations and production technology, signaled it's “very well positioned” to capitalise on advances in generative AI.“We believe Generative AI presents a significant opportunity for us to deliver benefits to our members, creators, and business,” Netflix told shareholders, outlining its strategy spanning across viewer experience, content production and advertising.Netflix said that it is deploying GenAI to improve how subscribers discover and explore content across its vast catalogue. The company is beta testing a conversational search feature that allows members to use natural language queries to find content—moving beyond traditional keyword searches to understand contextual requests like “funny movies for a rainy afternoon” or “shows similar to what I watched last week.GenAI is also powering Netflix’s localisation efforts, automatically adapting promotional assets into multiple languages so content can more easily reach global audiences who would enjoy it. The initiatives build on Netflix's recently redesigned TV user interface, which has been rolled out to 85% of TV devices with results exceeding pre-launch expectations, the company said.During the fourth quarter, the company is using AI to test new advertising formats, generate personalised ad creative and placement tailored to individual members, and accelerate media plan development for brand partners.“With these advancements, we'll be able to test, iterate, and innovate on dozens of ad formats by 2026,” Netflix stated, suggesting a rapid expansion of advertising capabilities over the next two years.",Netflix says it has significantly expanded the use of generative AI across its platform.

How Google Doodle is celebrating quadratic equations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-doodle-is-celebrating-quadratic-equations/articleshow/124740700.cms,"What the Doodle shows

Why Google chose the quadratic equation





A quick refresher: the formula that changed maths







Beyond the formula: Google’s educational mission

Why it matters





The quadratic equation has found a new place to shine, right on Google ’s homepage. The tech giant’s latest animated Doodle turns the world’s most famous search engine into a playful classroom, celebrating the formula ax² + bx + c = 0 that has challenged and fascinated generations of students. The Doodle, which first appeared in the US and UK, is now rolling out across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Timed with the academic calendar, it aims to remind students, teachers, and curious adults alike that maths can be visual, interactive, and even fun. By blending art, education, and technology, Google is turning a simple search into an opportunity to learn.The animation begins with the familiar Google logo transforming into an elegant visual of parabolas, each representing the curve of a quadratic equation. The Doodle highlights the key components of the formula, the coefficients a, b, and c, and demonstrates how these numbers affect the shape and position of the curve. In a few seconds, it shows how the equation’s roots, or solutions, are found where the curve crosses the x-axis.This is more than a nostalgic nod to school maths. The Doodle serves as a quick refresher for anyone who might have forgotten how the quadratic formula works.With its engaging movement and simple explanations, it captures the beauty of algebra in motion, making complex concepts feel approachable.Google’s timing is intentional. Around October and November, many education systems worldwide cover quadratic equations as part of the curriculum. Search data shows a clear trend: global queries for “how to solve quadratic equations” rise sharply during this period.By featuring the formula in a Doodle, Google not only celebrates a core mathematical concept but also supports students as midterm exams approach. The Doodle links directly to Google’s learning resources, including Search features that allow users to type, scan, or even speak equations. From there, they can get step-by-step explanations, interactive graphs, and practice problems generated in real time.In doing so, Google turns its homepage into a study companion. What might look like a cute animation is actually a digital bridge between curiosity and comprehension.The quadratic formula,x = [-b ± √(b² − 4ac)] / (2a),is one of the most recognisable equations in mathematics. It solves any second-degree polynomial equation, offering a precise way to find the values of x that make the expression equal zero.At the heart of this formula is the discriminant (Δ = b² − 4ac), which determines the number and type of solutions.If Δ > 0, there are two real roots.If Δ = 0, there is one repeated real root.If Δ < 0, the roots are complex (non-real).This principle is far from abstract. Quadratic equations describe real-world phenomena everywhere: in physics (projectile motion), engineering (parabolic reflectors), economics (profit maximisation), and even computer graphics. By visualising this concept in the Doodle, Google connects the dots between theory and reality.Google has increasingly positioned itself as a learning ally. Over the past few years, it has introduced AI-driven study aids, practice modules, and interactive learning cards directly within Search. Students can scan handwritten equations with their phones and instantly receive step-by-step solutions and visual explanations.This quadratic Doodle builds on that mission, showing how technology can make education more inclusive.Instead of treating maths as intimidating, it reframes it as something dynamic and discoverable. It also aligns with Google’s larger goal of supporting STEM education globally, especially in regions where access to quality learning resources can be limited.The quadratic equation is more than just another topic in the syllabus. It represents a key transition point for students, from simple arithmetic to higher-level reasoning. Mastering it lays the foundation for understanding calculus, data analysis, and scientific modelling.By choosing this equation for a Doodle, Google reminds users that maths is not only relevant but also beautiful in its logic and structure. For many, this simple animation may spark curiosity, confidence, or even nostalgia.While the Doodle will only appear for a day, its impact may last much longer. It encourages learners to revisit one of mathematics’ most powerful tools and shows that with the right mix of creativity and technology, even an equation can inspire millions.In the end, Google’s Doodle is not just a celebration of the quadratic equation. It is a celebration of learning itself, proof that curiosity and discovery can still begin with a simple search.","Google Doodle celebrates the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0.

Public opposes AI race, polling reveals

Tech giants race ahead despite safety concerns







Over 800 prominent figures spanning technology, politics, entertainment and science have signed an extraordinary open letter demanding an immediate halt to superintelligent AI research. The coalition, announced by the Future of Life Institute, includes AI godfather Geoffrey Hinton, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan Markle , and former Trump strategist Steve Bannon. Five Nobel laureates, ex-military leaders, and celebrities like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and will.i.am have also lent their names to the cause.Their message is simple: ""a prohibition on the development of superintelligence"" until there is ""broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably"" and ""strong public buy-in."" Superintelligence refers to AI systems that would exceed human intelligence at all cognitive tasks—technology that organizers believe could arrive in as little as one to two years.""The future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it,"" Prince Harry said in his statement. ""The true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer.""Actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt offered a more pointed critique: ""Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.""The timing reflects mounting alarm that superintelligence—AI surpassing human capability across all cognitive tasks—could arrive within one to two years. Yet polling released with the letter shows a stunning disconnect: 64% of Americans believe such systems shouldn't be built until proven safe, while just 5% support the current breakneck pace of development.Anthony Aguirre, the institute's executive director, argues that ""a small number of very wealthy companies"" are choosing humanity's path forward without consulting anyone else. ""No one's really asked almost anybody else, 'Is this what we want?'"" he told TIME.The appeal comes as Silicon Valley's biggest players accelerate their pursuit of artificial general intelligence and beyond. Meta's Mark Zuckerberg declared superintelligence ""now in sight"" last July. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expects it by 2030. Companies are pouring hundreds of billions into AI infrastructure this year alone.Even one OpenAI employee, Leo Gao, broke ranks to sign—a notable defection from a company Altman calls a ""superintelligence research company.""The statement represents the Future of Life Institute's second major intervention. A 2023 letter calling for a six-month AI pause failed to slow development, prompting this more focused campaign targeting superintelligence specifically.","Over 800 prominent figures have signed an open letter demanding an immediate halt to superintelligent AI research.

How tech companies are scaling back remote work options







Microsoft has reportedly exempted several sales roles from its upcoming return-to-office mandate. This suggests that the software giant is adopting a more flexible approach than many competitors in the tech industry. The company stated that this carveout is due to the nature of client and partner-facing work. In an internal memo sent to employees (reviewed by Bloomberg), the company’s human resources executive, Theresa McHenry, referred to these roles and wrote that “we recognise that the nature of work differs from other parts of Microsoft.”The exempted roles include commercial sales and solution engineering. In the note to employees, McHenry added,A growing number of technology companies are requiring employees to increase their office presence.Dell Technologies Inc. mandated a five-day office week for its sales staff over a year ago. Amazon.com Inc. now requires most corporate employees to work from the office daily.Microsoft, which previously maintained a flexible policy, announced last month that Seattle-area staff must work on-site three days a week starting next spring, with similar requirements planned for other U.S.and international locations.According to a July report from real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., more than half of Fortune 100 employees in traditional desk roles now work from the office full-time.Recently, Google modified its pandemic-era ""Work From Anywhere"" policy with new restrictions that reduce employee flexibility. Under the updated rules implemented this summer, workers can no longer use their WFA allowance to work from home or from Google offices in different states or countries. Previously, employees could work remotely from any location outside their main office for up to four weeks per calendar year, with the ability to use these days as needed.The WFA policy operates separately from Google's hybrid schedule, which permits employees to work from home two days weekly. However, the new restrictions specify that WFA days cannot be used to work from home or nearby locations, limiting their use to places away from both home and the main office.",Microsoft has reportedly exempted several sales roles from its upcoming return- to-office mandate.

A New York Times report recently said that e-commerce giant Amazon plans to replace more than half a million jobs with robots. Quoting the report, X user Jason wrote: “Amazon is gonna replace 600,00 folks according to NYTimes — and that’s a low ball estimate IMO. It’s insane to think that a human will pack and ship boxes in ten years — it’s game over folks.” The post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who agreed with the claim saying “AI and robots will replace all jobs.”The tech billionaire further predicted an era where working will be voluntary. “Working will be optional, like growing your own vegetables, instead of buying them from the store,” he wrote in the post.The publication claims to have viewed internal Amazon documents allegedly showing how different parts of the company are navigating its ambitious automation effort. Notably, Amazon denied the NYT report about it replacing around 6,00,000 of human jobs with robots. In a statement, the company said that the documents viewed by the publication were incomplete and did not represent the company’s overall hiring strategy.Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Nantel stated that the e-commerce company planned to hire 250,000 people for the coming holiday season. The firm also said that it’s not insisting executives avoid certain terms, and that community involvement is unrelated to automation.Musk in a March 2025 interview with Ted Cruz said that people’s standard of living will be higher because of AI. He then said“Goods and services will become close to free. It's not as though people will be wanting in terms of goods and services.

How Pichai’s childhood shapes his approach to technology



Also Read |





As debates around screen time and its impact on children continue to grow, Sundar Pichai , CEO of Google, presents a balanced and considered approach. Unlike many parents who impose rigid restrictions, Pichai focuses on fostering digital literacy, guiding his children to navigate the digital world thoughtfully, safely, and responsibly while understanding potential risks and benefits. He recognises that technology is an inevitable part of modern life, offering both opportunities and challenges, and believes that teaching children to manage their own screen time is far more effective than outright bans.Rather than avoiding technology, he encourages open dialogue, setting realistic boundaries, encouraging curiosity, and modelling healthy behaviour. Pichai’s parenting philosophy highlights a broader trend among tech leaders: encouraging mindful engagement, instilling self-regulation, nurturing critical thinking, and helping children develop healthy, lifelong habits in a highly connected and digital-first environment.Sundar Pichai admitted that he has “always been worried about technology” in relation to his children. However, he recognises that growing up in a digital era is unavoidable. Unlike some peers in the tech industry who impose rigid rules, Pichai focuses on equipping children with the knowledge and skills to manage their own screen time. He emphasises teaching children to take ownership of their choices, enabling them to navigate technology responsibly rather than seeing it as forbidden or dangerous.Pichai’s philosophy is rooted in the belief that digital literacy is essential for today’s youth. He explains, “Rather than just banning devices, it’s important they learn to make choices.” By learning to self-regulate, children acquire critical thinking skills and the ability to differentiate between productive and mindless digital engagement. This approach is more sustainable than strict prohibitions, fostering a sense of responsibility and independence in young users.In a 2017 interview with the New York Times, Pichai detailed a practical method he uses at home: making the television less accessible. This approach, which he refers to as creating “activation energy,” subtly discourages passive consumption by introducing small barriers to immediate engagement. Pichai acknowledged the complexity of this method, noting that he is “genuinely conflicted, because I see what my kids learn from all this. ” The tactic reflects a balance between allowing opportunity and preventing overindulgence, highlighting the nuance required in modern parenting.Pichai’s approach is informed by his own experiences. Growing up in Chennai, India, he had minimal exposure to phones, computers, or television. The contrast between his childhood and the highly connected environment his children inhabit today informs his careful and deliberate parenting style. By consciously monitoring his own technology usage, he sets a practical example, modelling mindful device habits that his children can emulate.Sundar Pichai’s methods align with a broader philosophy shared by influential figures in the tech world. Late Apple CEO Steve Jobs emphasised tech-free family dinners to encourage personal connection, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates delayed phone access for his children until age 14, and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban uses routers to monitor and control internet use. All reflect the belief that technology should be treated as a tool to enhance life, rather than as a default source of entertainment or distraction.For Pichai, the lessons are clear: fostering digital literacy, creating small barriers to discourage mindless consumption, and modelling responsible use can be more effective than imposing outright bans. Even children of tech leaders benefit from this balanced approach, learning to navigate the digital landscape thoughtfully. In an era where technology permeates every aspect of life, cultivating responsible screen habits equips the next generation to thrive, making conscious choices while still enjoying the opportunities technology provides.","Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google.

AI investments drive Microsoft's revenue surge to $281.7 billion

Microsoft’s stock performance reflects decade of leadership under Nadella







Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella received a record-breaking $96.5 million compensation package for fiscal year 2025, marking a 22% increase from the previous year's $79.1 million. The substantial pay raise comes as the Redmond giant positions itself as a leader in artificial intelligence, with the board crediting Nadella's strategic vision for the company's exceptional performance.According to Microsoft's proxy filing, the bulk of Nadella's compensation—approximately $84.2 million—came from stock awards tied to the company's market performance. His package also included a $9.5 million cash bonus, a $2.5 million base salary, and roughly $196,000 in other benefits.Microsoft's board emphasised that more than 95% of Nadella's compensation is performance-based, with shareholder returns and growth metrics serving as key determining factors. The company delivered impressive results for fiscal 2025, achieving a 15% revenue increase to $281.7 billion and a 16% jump in net income to $101.8 billion.The compensation committee highlighted that products like Azure and Copilot were instrumental in driving these strong results. The board stated the performance ""demonstrates that Satya Nadella and his leadership team have positioned Microsoft as a clear artificial intelligence leader for this generational technology shift"".Since becoming Microsoft's third CEO in 2014, Nadella has overseen significant growth in both company performance and his own compensation. His total pay has risen dramatically over the past decade—from approximately $18 million in 2015 to $55 million in 2022, before reaching this year's record high.Microsoft's stock has risen 23% this year through Tuesday's close, outperforming the S&P 500's 15% gain. Last year, Microsoft became the second company to reach a $3 trillion market cap, joining rival Apple . The company has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI since 2019, though it recently announced plans to become more self-sufficient in AI infrastructure.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella received a record-breaking $96.5 million compensation package for fiscal year 2025.

Explained: Darktrace CEO says she was deepfaked — and couldn’t tell the difference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-darktrace-ceo-says-she-was-deepfaked-and-couldnt-tell-the-difference/articleshow/124733495.cms,"Popelka’s research team replicated her voice using open-source tools, demonstrating how little data is needed to train AI models/ Image: X@TimesBusiness

The big picture





Deepfake Shock: Nirmala Sitharaman Reveals Fake Videos Of Herself Online, Warns Of AI’s Dark Side

Driving the news





Why it matters





In 2019, fraudsters used AI-generated audio to impersonate a CEO and tricked a UK energy firm into transferring €220,000.

In 2023, an Asian multinational lost $35 million after a finance executive was duped by a video call featuring a deepfaked CFO.

Now, even cybersecurity leaders are falling within the crosshairs.

The technology behind the scam





The context





The bigger picture





Corporate defences are unprepared: Traditional cybersecurity focuses on code and networks, not human perception.

Legal frameworks lag: The UK, EU, and US are only beginning to draft legislation for labelling or watermarking synthetic media.

AI companies are conflicted: The same technologies that power creative tools and customer service bots are also enabling sophisticated fraud.

What’s next





Introduce multi-factor verification for all voice or video-based requests.

Train staff to verify sensitive communications via secondary channels.

Implement synthetic-media detection systems across email and messaging platforms.





When the boss of a cybersecurity firm can’t tell real from fake, it’s time to worry about AI’s next frontier.In a startling admission that highlights how advanced artificial intelligence scams have become, Darktrace CEO Jill Popelka revealed she was targeted by a deepfake of her own voice during a company board meeting.Her team received a voicemail requesting confidential details — while she was physically present elsewhere. The audio, Popelka said, was so realistic that even she couldn’t distinguish it from her real voice.The revelation comes as governments and corporations scramble to counter a surge in AI-driven impersonation fraud, where cloned voices, faces, or emails are used to breach security systems, steal data, or manipulate decisions.Speaking at The Times UK Tech Summit in London, Popelka described how the fake message appeared authentic and well-timed. The scam surfaced shortly after Darktrace’s £4.4-billion takeover by US private-equity firm Thoma Bravo, during the company’s first post-acquisition board meeting.“They can just type in a message and my voice can instantly be replicated. I couldn’t tell the difference,” she said. “These deepfakes exploit human vulnerability — and they’re very hard to protect from.”Popelka’s research team later replicated her voice themselves using publicly available tools, confirming how little data is needed to train an AI model convincingly.Etienne De Burgh, senior security and compliance specialist at Google Cloud, who shared the stage, added:“We already knew these techniques existed, but they are becoming far more believable.”Darktrace isn’t just another tech firm — it’s one of the world’s foremost AI-driven cybersecurity companies, originally founded in Cambridge with backing from the late entrepreneur Mike Lynch.If a company built to detect digital anomalies can be targeted by a deepfake, the threat has clearly moved beyond theoretical.The incident illustrates a profound shift: voice and video can no longer be trusted as proof of identity.From corporate executives to politicians and journalists, anyone with a digital footprint can now be cloned with frightening accuracy.Such scams have already caused multi-million-dollar losses globally:Modern voice-cloning tools can reproduce a person’s tone, accent, and cadence from as little as a 30-second voice sample — often available through public speeches, interviews, or even social media clips.Once trained, the model can “speak” any typed text in that person’s voice in real time.Detection tools exist, but the arms race between creation and detection is uneven.AI audio generators evolve faster than filters designed to flag synthetic content, leaving institutions perpetually one step behind.Darktrace, listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2021 at £1.7 billion, was acquired by Thoma Bravo earlier this year following a volatile period on public markets. Popelka took over in 2024 after former CEO Poppy Gustafsson stepped down.The company’s systems are widely used to identify “patterns of life” — the normal digital behaviour within an organisation — and flag anomalies that could signal a cyberattack. Ironically, it now faces a new threat: AI-driven deception aimed directly at human trust.Deepfakes are democratised: What once required sophisticated labs can now be done by anyone with a laptop and access to open-source AI models.Experts warn that deepfake risks will escalate as AI becomes embedded in daily workflows. Corporates are urged to:For now, Popelka’s case serves as a cautionary tale: even the protectors of cyberspace can fall prey to its illusions.When CEOs can’t tell real from fake, trust itself becomes the new cybersecurity frontier.",Darktrace CEO Jill Popelka revealed she was targeted by a deepfake of her own voice during a company board meeting.

Trump Aide’s ‘Unhinged’ Criticism ‘Prompts’ China To Shake Up Trade Team; Xi’s Rare Move

Poll Is the Dutch government's seizure of Nexperia a sign of increasing global trade tensions? Yes, it's a concerning trend No, it's just a unique case

US expands export blacklist to target Chinese companies

What is US trade Entity Blacklists

What China said on US expanding export Blacklist

Dutch government seizes control of Chinese chip company Nexperia





China's recent expansion of rare Earth export controls appeared to intensify the US-China trade war, but some analysts point out that the dispute began with an action taken by America in late September. According to a report in the South China Morning Post, the decision by the US Bureau of Industry and Security (US-BIS) to widen its trade Blacklists in September angered China, leading to a slew of retaliatory measures against the US. This included action against US chip giant Qualcomm.On September 29, the US Bureau of Industry and Security broadened its trade blacklists that reportedly prompted not only China’s retaliatory measures but also influencing the Netherlands’ seizure of chip firm Nexperia.The BIS oversees two blacklists -- the entity list and the military end-user list -- targeting companies deemed security threats. Previously, US exporters needed licenses to deal with listed entities. The new rules, effective late September, extend restrictions to any company at least 50% owned by listed entities.On September 29, the US Commerce Department issued a new rule expanding its restricted export list, known as the Entity List, to automatically include subsidiaries owned 50% or more by a company on the list, according to posting in the US Federal Register.The action is said to have greatly increased the number of companies that require licenses to receive American goods and services. The rule is likely to disrupt supply chains. It also makes it more difficult for companies to determine whether exports to a customer or supplier are restricted, and places more of a burden on the exporter to figure out ownership before moving forward.Though companies around the world are on the Entity List, the change will most significantly impact Chinese entities, experts said.America puts companies on the Entity Blacklists that it has determined pose risks to US national security or foreign policy. There are reportedly about 1,100 Chinese entities on the list, according to think tank the Center for a New American Security.China's Commerce Ministry strongly criticized the rule. ""This move by the U.S. is extremely egregious in nature,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""It seriously infringes upon the legitimate rights and interests of the affected enterprises, severely disrupts international economic and trade order and gravely undermines the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.""In SCMP report, Goldman Sachs analysts noted that, while the US rule applies globally, China views it as a targeted escalation.Earlier this month, Dutch government believed chipmaker Nexperia’s Chinese owners planned to move its manufacturing operations to China, prompting the unprecedented seizure of the company. Authorities seized control of Nexperia’s management and ousted its Chinese CEO, Zhang Xuezheng, citing national security concerns.","China's recent expansion of rare Earth export controls appeared to intensify the US-China trade war.

What Airbnb ’s new AI customer service agent can do





“I think the social features, the community, that’s probably the most differentiated part of Airbnb.

People are the reason why I think Airbnb is such a sticky service.”

Why Airbnb is not being integrated into ChatGPT





“quite ready”

“I didn’t think it was quite ready,”

“almost self-contained”





Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky stated that the company typically does not use OpenAI 's latest models extensively in production for its AI tools. He noted that there are often faster, cheaper alternatives available. Recently, the travel app maker announced that it has updated its in-app artificial intelligence customer service agent, which was rolled out to all US users in English in May. The update allows customers to take more actions without needing a live representative. In an interview, Chesky revealed that the agent is built on 13 different AI models, sourced from providers including OpenAI, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s Qwen model, Alphabet Inc.’s Google , and other open-source providers.Chesky said to Bloomberg:He specifically praised the Alibaba model, saying,Airbnb's new AI-powered customer service agent now includes action buttons and links that allow users to handle tasks such as changing or cancelling reservations on their own.This update has resulted in a 15% decrease in users requiring help from a live representative and reduced the average resolution time from nearly three hours to six seconds. The company also plans to introduce Spanish and French language support later this year, followed by 56 additional languages next year.Apart from the AI agent, Airbnb has also introduced new social features aimed at helping users connect and enhancing travel recommendations within the app. Guests can now share their Airbnb profiles with others after booking an experience, and travellers who joined the same tour can message each other. However, conversations continue only if the recipient accepts the message request.More features are planned for next year, and Chesky said these could eventually support user-generated content on the platform.Chesky also noted that he has decided not to integrate the company’s app with OpenAI’s ChatGPT because the platform’s tools aren’tyet. He added that Airbnb will continue to monitor the development of ChatGPT’s app integrations and could consider collaborating in the future, similar to other travel platforms such as Booking Holdings and Expedia Group.Chesky said, explaining that because Airbnb is a community of verified users, OpenAI would need to build a platform strong enough for Airbnb’s app to function in anway within ChatGPT, the report noted.Chesky, who is friends with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman , said he has even advised the company on its new third-party developer features. Meanwhile, OpenAI has declined to comment but pointed to a recent blog post describing the app integration system as a developer preview with more updates expected, the report added.","Airbnb has updated its in-app artificial intelligence customer service agent.

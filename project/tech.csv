"There are no red lines after ..., says Yemen's al-Qaida branch leader in warning to Elon Musk, Donald Trump Musk and others; Tesla logos in the threatening video",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/there-are-no-red-lines-after-says-yemens-al-qaida-branch-leader-in-warning-to-elon-musk-donald-trump-musk-and-others-tesla-logos-in-the-threatening-video/articleshow/121712871.cms,"Saad bin Atef al-Awlaki, the leader of al-Qaida's Yemen branch, has issued threats against U.S. President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to a half-hour video message released early Saturday (May 8), as reported by the Associated Press (AP). In his first video since assuming leadership of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) last year, al-Awlaki also urged lone-wolf militants to target leaders in Egypt, Jordan, and Gulf Arab states, citing the devastation in Gaza.The report notes that the video featured images of Trump, Musk, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and logos of Musk’s companies, including Tesla. Al-Awlaki declared, “There are no red lines after what happened and is happening to our people in Gaza. Reciprocity is legitimate,” per the AP.Despite AQAP’s weakened state due to infighting and U.S. drone strikes, the group remains a significant threat, the AP reports, having been considered al-Qaida’s most dangerous branch since the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden. Al-Awlaki, who has a $6 million U.S. bounty on his head, replaced Khalid al-Batarfi, whose death AQAP announced in 2024, according to the report.The AP report highlights that AQAP’s focus on the Israel-Hamas war mirrors the strategy of Yemen’s Houthi rebels , who have attacked Israel and commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The U.S. Navy has faced its most intense combat since World War II against the Houthis, the AP states. Al-Awlaki may be seeking to boost AQAP’s profile, with the group estimated by U.N. experts to have 3,000 to 4,000 fighters and supporters, funded through bank robberies, smuggling, and ransoms, per the report.Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert cited by the AP, noted, “As the Houthis gain popularity as leaders of the ‘Arab and Muslim world’s resistance’ against Israel, al-Awlaki seeks to challenge their dominance by presenting himself as equally concerned about the situation in Gaza.” He added, “For a national security and foreign policy community increasingly disengaged from Yemen, this video is a clear reminder: Yemen still matters.”","Saad bin Atef al-Awlaki, the leader of al-Qaida's Yemen branch, has issued threats against U.S. President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk.

Elon Musk on Tesla Takedown protests

Protests targeting Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk persist despite his recent exit from leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and a public feud with President Donald Trump over Trump’s sweeping tax and domestic policy legislation, dubbed the “The One Big, Beautiful Bill,” according to a report by CNN. Musk, who donated $288 million to Trump’s 2024 campaign, labeled the bill a “disgusting abomination” shortly after stepping down from DOGE, his federal cost-cutting initiative. The dispute escalatedThe Tesla Takedown movement shows no signs of slowing, despite Musk’s DOGE exit, his clash with Trump, and Tesla’s declining sales and stock value. After Musk’s departure, the movement’s Bluesky account called for protests on June 28, Elon Musk’s birthday, to “recommit to the fight.”The Tesla Takedown movement urges people to “sell your Teslas, dump your stock and join the picket lines” to “help save lives and protect our democracy,” per its website. Tesla’s sales dropped 13% in the first quarter of 2025, the largest decline in its history, while its stock (TSLA) fell about 14% this week, down nearly 47% from its December 18 peak of $488.54.The Tesla Takedown movement, which began in mid-February during Musk’s DOGE tenure, organized 60 demonstrations outside Tesla showrooms on Saturday (May 7) in cities including Delray Beach, Florida; Louisville, Kentucky; and Decatur, Georgia. In Washington, DC’s Georgetown neighborhood, about 30 protesters gathered at 11:30 a.m. ET outside a Tesla showroom despite rainy weather, a smaller turnout than the 200 who protested the previous week in Rockville, Maryland. Local co-organizers Melissa Knutson and Sara Steffens attributed the lower attendance to weather and competing Pride Month events.“This is not over because (Musk) decided to go home with his tail between his legs,” Knutson told CNN, emphasizing the movement’s resolve. “We are tired of the billionaire takeover and we are not letting up,” Knutson added.Elon Musk has said that Tesla Takedown movement is funded by dark money groups tied to political operatives. In a remote interview last month with Bloomberg's Qatar Economic Forum, Musk decried violent protests and people burning him in effigy and Tesla cars, saying many of them deserve to be imprisoned. ""It's not fine to resort to violence,"" he said, calling it ""evil"" to damage someone's car or threaten him personally.","The Tesla Takedown movement urges people to “sell your Teslas, dump your stock and join the picket lines” in cities including Delray Beach, Florida, Louisville, Kentucky; and Decatur, Georgia.

What to Expect at WWDC 2025: iOS 19, AI, M4 Macs & More

Apple CEO Tim Cook said that Steve Jobs gave him a crucial skill that only “few people have” and he learnt late – the ability to change one’s mind instantly when new facts emerge. In a 2024 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Cook revealed that Job – co-founder of Apple taught him never to stay “married to my past views” and to let go of pride when better evidence appears. Steve Jobs, Tim Cook recalled, could shift direction in a snap—something that surprised him at first but later became a trait he admired and adopted.“[I learned] not to be so proud you can't change your mind when you're presented with new evidence,” Cook said in the interview. This flexible mindset, according to those close to Jobs, was powered by strong emotional intelligence.In Steve Jobs’s biography, author Walter Isaacson wrote that Jobs had the ability to ""size people up, understand their inner thoughts, and hurt them at will,"" highlighting how his emotional intelligence could be both inspiring and cutting.Many former Apple colleagues say this mix of intensity and intuition helped revive the company from near collapse and shaped its culture of bold innovation. The practice also echoes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s belief that “people who are right a lot change their mind a lot”—a mindset linked to strong decision-making.Jobs’s influence extended well beyond Tim Cook. Former Apple designer Jony Ive once called Jobs “the most remarkably focused person” he’d ever met, describing his focus as an “every-minute” discipline. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also credited a pivotal 2010 conversation with Jobs for inspiring the product focus that helped build Salesforce into a $250 billion company.In an 2019 interview, Benioff reflected how a single meeting in 2003 left a lasting impression on the Salesforce CEO, who credits Jobs for planting the seed of what would become the company’s app marketplace. Jobs urged the Salesforce founders to build a cloud software ecosystem—an idea that eventually led to the creation of AppExchange.Years later, when Jobs launched the iPhone App Store in 2008, Benioff was so moved by his words, “I give you App Store,” that he handed over the AppStore.com domain to Apple as a tribute.","Apple CEO Tim Cook said that Steve Jobs gave him a crucial skill that only “few people have” and he learnt late.

Who will replace Elon Musk as Donald Trump's Silicon Valley bestie: Four tech CEOs analyst are betting on,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/who-will-replace-elon-musk-as-donald-trumps-silicon-valley-bestie-four-tech-ceos-analyst-are-betting-on/articleshow/121705352.cms,"Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook co-founder and Meta Platforms CEO

Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO

The high-profile alignment between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump appears to be dissolving. Following the Tesla CEO's departure from a prominent advisory role, questions are now emerging regarding which, IF ANY, tech executive might next enter the President's inner circle. His second inauguration in January was a red carpet for Silicon Valley elites — with execs from Apple, Meta, Google and even OpenAI making an appearance, essentially pointing out a way that there’s no shortage of names lining up to be the next tech mogul to the Oval Office.Here's a list of potential contenders — executives and entrepreneurs who can be the next in line (via Business Insider).Mark Zuckerberg was among the first tech CEOs who demonstrated support for Trump. Meta contributed $1 million to Trump's inauguration, and Zuckerberg co-hosted a black-tie event to honour the president. Moreover, it was Zuckerberg's Meta that quickly brought changes to how the company worked. For example, launching X-like Community Notes service for fact checking, and making significant changes to its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programmes.In early 2025, the company announced that it would be terminating major DEI initiatives, including those related to hiring, training, and supplier diversity. Reportedly, Zuckerberg also made multiple trips to Trump's Mar-a-lago residence. Zuckerberg is reportedly establishing a stronger presence in Washington D.C., having acquired a $23 million, 15,000-square-foot mansion in the capital.OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman has also engaged with the Trump administration. His involvement includes the Stargate project, a $100 billion AI infrastructure plan announced the day after Trump's inauguration, involving OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. Altman's inclusion in the project came as a surprise because of infamous Musk-Altman feud when the Tesla CEO was standing beside the President.In May, Altman joined Trump on a trip to Saudi Arabia while working on a major deal to construct one of the world's largest AI data centers in Abu Dhabi. The Wall Street Journal reported this trip prompted Musk to join at the last minute, and that Musk allegedly attempted to derail the deal, for which OpenAI was ultimately selected. Trump has expressed enthusiasm for the AI arms race, aligning with Altman's focus.Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang did not attend Trump's second inauguration in January but was present on the Middle East trip in May. Nvidia is involved in the OpenAI data center plans in the UAE, partnering with Oracle, SoftBank and G42. Huang has also praised Trump on several occasions for reversal of Biden administration's chip export rules, calling the previous rules ""fundamentally flawed"".However, Nvidia has faced challenges from the Trump administration, specifically in April when Trump banned the chip maker from selling its most advanced chips, the H20, to China. Nvidia stated this decision cost the company $5.5 billion. Jeff Bezos , founder of Amazon and Blue Origin, has transitioned from public opposition towards Trump to a more cooperative stance. Bezos said in December that he expects a more friendly regulatory environment in the upcoming administration and in January, Amazon donated $1 million for Trump's inauguration.“I’m actually very optimistic this time around. He seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. If I can help do that, I’m going to help him,"" Bezos said at that time.However, the Bezos-Trump relationship has seen strained periods. In 2015, Bezos famously suggested he would use his space company, Blue Origin, to ""#sendDonaldtospace"" after Trump criticised the Washington Post, which Bezos owns.A brief point of tension emerged in April when Amazon reportedly considered displaying Trump's tariffs next to product prices, a plan White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called ""hostile and political."" The idea was not implemented.","Elon Musk's high-profile alignment with US President Donald Trump appears to be dissolving.

Meta signs 20-year nuclear deal to power AI operations

The tech industry witnessed dramatic developments this week, from a spectacular public falling-out between President Trump and Elon Musk that threatens billions in federal subsidies, to Nintendo's Switch 2 console launch creating massive consumer frenzy with sold-out pre-orders. Meanwhile, Google CEO Sundar Pichai bucked industry trends by promising continued engineering hiring through 2026, even as Microsoft cut another 300 jobs following last month's 6,000-person layoff. Apple 's WWDC 2025 kicks off next week with anticipated major iOS and AI updates, while Meta secured a 20-year nuclear power deal to fuel its AI ambitions, highlighting the week's mix of corporate drama, product launches, and the ongoing AI transformation reshaping Big Tech.After a friendship that began during Trump's 2024 presidential campaign when Musk publicly endorsed him following an assassination attempt, the relationship between President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has dramatically deteriorated into a public feud. Their alliance, which saw Musk appointed as co-lead of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after Trump's election victory, began unraveling in May 2025 when Musk criticized Trump's signature spending bill as a ""disgusting abomination.""The conflict exploded into the open on June 5, 2025, when the former allies exchanged a series of bitter insults on social media, with Musk claiming ""Trump would have lost the election"" without him and making explosive allegations about Trump's connection to Jeffrey Epstein , while Trump threatened to terminate billions in federal subsidies for Musk's companies.The public breakdown of their relationship reached a tipping point when Trump admitted during an Oval Office press conference that he was ""very disappointed"" in Musk and didn't know if their friendship could be salvaged, even reportedly deciding to sell the Tesla he had purchased just months earlier during their alliance.Google CEO Sundar Pichai has announced that the tech giant will continue expanding its engineering workforce through 2026, positioning the company against widespread industry fears about AI-driven job displacement. Speaking at the Bloomberg Tech conference, Pichai emphasized that artificial intelligence serves as ""an accelerator"" rather than a replacement for human talent, enabling Google to pursue greater opportunities in emerging technology sectors like Waymo autonomous vehicles, quantum computing, and YouTube's global expansion.This hiring commitment stands in stark contrast to competitors like Microsoft, which have cut thousands of positions to fund AI investments, and even Google's own recent history of laying off 12,000 employees in 2023 with additional reductions following.Microsoft has eliminated over 300 additional jobs this week, just weeks after announcing 6,000 layoffs in what represents the company's second-largest workforce reduction since cutting 10,000 roles in 2023. While the specific departments affected in the latest round remain undisclosed, previous layoff patterns suggest software engineers and project managers are likely most impacted, as last month's cuts hit coding professionals hardest with over 40% of eliminated positions belonging to software engineers despite Microsoft's $80 billion AI infrastructure investment.CEO Satya Nadella has characterized these workforce reductions as a ""realignment"" rather than performance-based decisions, explaining it as ""repositioning for what comes next"" in the company's AI transformation, which now sees artificial intelligence writing up to 30% of code in some projects. The layoffs reflect broader industry trends as tech giants like Salesforce, Amazon, and Google implement flatter organizational structures and reduce engineering hiring due to AI adoption, with Microsoft's cuts occurring as the company continues investing billions in AI while employing approximately 228,000 full-time workers worldwide.Nintendo's highly anticipated Switch 2 launched earlier this week to massive consumer demand, with gaming fans lining up at electronics stores across Tokyo and pre-orders selling out within hours. The $499.99 console, featuring a larger screen and improved graphics compared to its predecessor, received 2.2 million lottery applications in Japan alone, while Target's pre-orders sold out in under two hours. Nintendo forecasts 15 million Switch 2 sales this financial year and has pledged to strengthen production capacity to meet overwhelming demand. With the original Switch selling 152 million units since 2017, analysts predict the new device could surpass 100 million sales by 2030, though supply shortages may persist for weeks or months as the company scales up manufacturing. OnePlus has launched two flagship devices in India, with the OnePlus 13s and the OnePlus Pad 3 tablet. The OnePlus 13s, priced starting at Rs 54,999, features a 6.32-inch LTPO AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate, powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset with 12GB RAM and 512GB storage, while packing a 5,850mAh Silicon Carbon battery with 80W fast charging and a dual-camera setup with 50MP primary and telephoto lenses.Meanwhile, the OnePlus Pad 3 boasts a larger 13.2-inch 3.4K 144Hz display, also powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor with up to 16GB RAM, featuring eight speakers for immersive audio, a massive 12,140mAh battery with 80W SuperVOOC charging, and priced at $699.99 (approximately Rs 60,070) for the base 12GB+256GB variant. Both devices run Android 15-based OxygenOS 15 and offer enhanced productivity features, with the OnePlus 13s available in Black Velvet, Pink Satin , and Green Silk colors, while the Pad 3 comes in Storm Blue and Frosted Silver, available in Europe from June 19th and North America from July 8th, with Indian availability confirmed soon across major platforms.Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2025 is set to kick off next week from June 9-13 at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, with the keynote scheduled for 10 a.m. PT on June 9 followed by the Platforms State of the Union Address at 1 p.m. PT.The event, which can be watched online via apple.com, the Apple TV app, and Apple's YouTube channel, is expected to unveil major software updates including iOS 19 (or possibly iOS 26 according to rumors suggesting a numbering system change), iPadOS, macOS, and WatchOS.This year's conference is particularly anticipated for potential dramatic design overhauls across Apple's operating systems, with Bloomberg reporting that iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16 will feature new icons and menus creating a more cohesive style reminiscent of VisionOS, while Apple is also expected to outline significant progress in artificial intelligence with enhanced Apple Intelligence features and Siri improvements, as the company seeks to compete with Google's Gemini and other AI offerings from Android vendors.Meta has secured a 20-year nuclear power agreement with Constellation Energy to meet the growing energy demands of its artificial intelligence operations. The deal will expand output at Illinois' Clinton Clean Energy Center by 30 megawatts starting in June 2027, when the plant's current state-funded support program expires. This partnership will preserve 1,100 local jobs and generate $13.5 million in annual tax revenue while providing clean energy equivalent to powering a city of 30,000 residents. The agreement makes Meta the latest tech giant to turn to nuclear power for AI infrastructure, joining Microsoft, Amazon, and Google in similar partnerships as companies balance surging energy needs with greenhouse gas reduction goals.","Microsoft cuts 300 more jobs after laying off 6,000 employees last month.

Atkinson was convinced by Jobs to become 51st team member of Apple



Bill Atkinson , the Apple Computer designer instrumental in creating the graphical user interfaces that made the Lisa and Macintosh computers accessible to millions, has died. He was 74. His family confirmed the cause as pancreatic cancer in a Facebook post. He had a close relationship with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs during the early 1980s when they worked on the Macintosh. Apple CEO Tim Cook has extended his condolences with a post on X (formerly Twitter).""We are deeply saddened by the passing of Bill Atkinson. He was a true visionary whose creativity, heart, and groundbreaking work on the Mac will forever inspire us. Our thoughts are with his loved ones,"" Cook said in a post.Atkinson was the programmer behind QuickDraw, a foundational software layer for both the Lisa and Macintosh computers. This library of small programmes efficiently displayed shapes, text and images on screen. Embedded in the computers' hardware, QuickDraw provided the distinctive graphical interface that presented a simulated ""desktop"" with icons for folders, files, and applications.Atkinson is widely credited with inventing key elements of graphical computing, including ""pull-down"" menus and the ""double-click"" gesture, which allowed users to open files and applications simply by clicking a mouse button twice.Before the Macintosh debuted in January 1984, most personal computers were text-based, requiring users to type complex commands. Graphics were not an integrated function, and mouse pointing devices were not common.QuickDraw was initially developed for Apple's Lisa computer, launched in January 1983. Though the Lisa offered early easy-to-use features for business users, its high price of $10,000 (nearly $33,000 today) led to its commercial failure.QuickDraw soon became the basis for the Macintosh's successful graphical interface. This approach to computing originated from the ""Dynabook"" project led by computer scientist Alan Kay at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in the 1970s.In 1979, Xerox provided Jobs and a small team, including Atkinson, a private demonstration of Kay's work. Since they could not examine the software code, the Apple engineers made assumptions about the technology, leading to fundamental technical advancements and new capabilities.After the Macintosh's release, Atkinson conceived HyperCard, a programme that wove together text, images and video in a simple database. This software became a significant precursor to the World Wide Web.Atkinson was pursuing a Ph.D. in neurobiology at the University of Washington when Jobs convinced him to become Apple's 51st employee. Their relationship was close during the early 1980s as they worked on the Macintosh. However, when Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 to found Next, Atkinson declined to leave, citing his commitment to the HyperCard project.","Atkinson was the programmer behind QuickDraw, a foundational software layer for both the Lisa and Macintosh computers.

Allegations against Elon Musk: Immigration status and more

The background of the Musk-Trump fallout

Steve Bannon’s longstanding criticism of Elon Musk

The political and legal implications

The escalating feud between Elon Musk , the world’s richest entrepreneur, and former President Donald Trump has taken an explosive new turn. Steve Bannon , a former White House strategist and close Trump ally, has publicly urged Trump to investigate Musk’s immigration status and deport him “immediately.” This demand comes amid growing tensions between the billionaire CEO and the MAGA movement, which Musk once aligned with but has since distanced himself from.Bannon has also called for the federal government to seize Musk’s SpaceX company, invoking the Defense Production Act, in response to Musk’s threat to halt critical space missions. This article delves into the latest developments, the historical context of this feud, and the broader political implications of this extraordinary clash.On April 24, 2025, Steve Bannon made headlines by urging President Donald Trump to take decisive action against Elon Musk. On his podcast “War Room,” Bannon insisted that Trump should invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to seize SpaceX, Musk’s rocket company, citing Musk’s threat to decommission the Dragon spacecraft that transports astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS).The Defense Production Act, originally enacted during the Korean War, empowers the president to compel private companies to prioritize government contracts essential to national defense. Trump famously used the DPA during the COVID-19 pandemic to accelerate production of medical supplies. However, it is important to note that the Act does not explicitly authorize the government to seize private companies outright, raising legal questions about Bannon’s proposal.Bannon’s demand to seize SpaceX represents a dramatic escalation in the ongoing conflict. Musk later softened his stance, apparently backing off the threat to disable SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft, but the call to investigate his immigration status and suspend his security clearances remains a serious political pressure point.Bannon’s claims go beyond corporate control. He has expressed a “strong belief” that Elon Musk, a South African-born billionaire who became a naturalized US citizen, is in the country illegally and must be deported immediately. He demanded a formal federal investigation into Musk’s immigration status, asserting that Musk’s past and current actions warrant government scrutiny.In addition, Bannon has called for probes into allegations of Musk’s drug use and claims that Musk sought classified Pentagon briefings on China — claims Musk has vehemently denied, labeling some reports as “pure propaganda.” Bannon also suggested suspending Musk’s security clearances and revoking federal contracts across his business empire, including Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter).The rift between Elon Musk and Donald Trump did not happen overnight. Musk was once a prominent Trump supporter, serving briefly as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and acting as a key presidential adviser. The relationship began to sour publicly when Musk vocally opposed Trump’s legislative priorities, especially the “One Big Beautiful Bill” currently under Congressional consideration. Musk condemned the bill as a “disgusting abomination” and urged lawmakers to kill it.The personal animosity intensified further after Musk accused Trump’s administration of withholding files related to Jeffrey Epstein, insinuating the president was protecting himself. Musk’s public support for impeachment proceedings against Trump and favoring Vice President JD Vance as a replacement deepened the divide.Trump, in turn, has expressed disappointment and frustration with Musk’s break from their alliance. He has threatened to revoke billions in federal contracts and subsidies Musk’s companies currently enjoy. Speaking to reporters, Trump said, “I’ve helped Elon a lot,” but added that Musk had “gone crazy” and implied their relationship may be over.Steve Bannon has been an outspoken critic of Musk since early 2025. He has repeatedly called Musk a “parasitic illegal immigrant” and accused him of disregarding American values and traditions. Bannon argues that Musk was given unprecedented power within the Trump administration but ultimately used it to serve his own interests rather than the country’s.On his podcast, Bannon stated, “As soon as [Musk] didn’t think he ran the deal or got the adoration, he turned on President Trump, MAGA, and most importantly, the country.” Bannon claims Musk financially supports progressive politicians and is involved in efforts to impeach Trump and influence election outcomes. He warned Trump’s supporters to be vigilant against Musk’s alleged betrayals.This feud represents a rare convergence of political rivalry and national security concerns. Bannon’s call for deportation and company seizure is unprecedented for a tech entrepreneur of Musk’s stature. It raises significant questions about the limits of executive power, the role of immigration status in public discourse, and the use of government authority against private businesses.Musk’s companies are heavily intertwined with US government contracts, especially SpaceX’s critical role in national space and defense programs. Any disruption could have significant consequences for American space capabilities and technological leadership.","The escalating feud between Elon Musk and former President Donald Trump has taken an explosive new turn.

Morgan Stanley bull has this prediction for Elon Musk's EV company Tesla,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/morgan-stanley-bull-has-this-prediction-for-elon-musks-ev-company-tesla/articleshow/121603102.cms,"Tesla may not be interested in eVTOL anytime soon

Why eVTOL market may not a profitable bet yet

Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas has predicted that Elon Musk may be ""tempted to solve"" another ""problem"" by leveraging Tesla's expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), batteries and manufacturing. As per Jones, the problem is ""commercialising air taxis,"" also known as electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles.In his latest research note, Jonas argued that Tesla may enter the nascent eVTOL market as these aircraft have long been predicted to revolutionise urban transport, yet even leading developers like Archer Aviation are still in the developmental phase.Last week, Archer's Midnight prototype, slated for its first deliveries later this year to Abu Dhabi, successfully completed a piloted flight test.According to a report by Fortune, while Jonas believes that solving this technological challenge aligns with the interests of Tesla engineers, he acknowledged that Tesla has indicated it is currently too stretched to seriously consider an eVTOL venture, without outright refuting the idea.The US government is reportedly keen on supporting the growth of flying cars. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posted this week, ""eVOTLs [sic] are going to fundamentally transform how the public travels. Let’s make sure the US leads the way.""Currently, the eVTOL market faces significant hurdles. Several promising startups, including Lilium and Volocopter, have encountered financial difficulties before establishing commercially viable services. A key challenge in achieving stringent safety standards while ensuring full autonomy, as scaling the business typically requires removing costly pilots from the equation. Additionally, there aren't enough customers with pilot licenses to support widespread adoption.","Tesla may enter the nascent eVTOL market, says Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas.

Short-form video app TikTok has blocked search results for the #SkinnyTok hashtag globally after it drew sharp criticism for promoting extreme and unhealthy weight-loss content. The decision comes in response to growing pressure from European regulators and officials in France, who flagged the trend for potentially endangering young users' mental health.In a statement, TikTok spokesperson Paolo Ganino said “[We] have blocked search results for #skinnytok since it has become linked to unhealthy weight loss content”.

Banning social media before 15 is my priority.”The ban has amplified calls in Brussels for stricter rules on social media use by children.

According to a report by Associated Press, the deal will also boost the output of Constellation Energy’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois.Announced on June 3, the agreement is part of a broader trend of tech companies partnering with nuclear energy providers as AI usage surges. Financial terms were not disclosed. The Clinton plant, originally set to close in 2017 due to financial losses, was sustained by Illinois’ zero-emission credit program, which expires in 2027, as per the report. The Meta deal, effective from June 2027, will increase the plant’s clean energy output by 30 megawatts, preserve 1,100 local jobs, and generate $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, the companies said.“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” Meta’s head of global energy, Urvi Parekh, said.

A Taylor Swift fan

Lucy Guo's OnlyFans' Rival Passes Controversy

A New Era for Women in Business

The world now has a new youngest self-made woman billionaire and she is a techie. Carnegie Mellon University dropout Lucy Guo has claimed the title of the world’s youngest self-made billionaire, surpassing pop icon Taylor Swift , according to a recent Forbes report. Guo’s meteoric rise in the tech industry has positioned her as a trailblazer, highlighting the growing influence of women in entrepreneurship.Taylor Swift, previously recognized as the youngest self-made billionaire, has been dethroned by 30-year-old Lucy Guo. Swift, known for her chart-topping hits like Love Story and her business acumen in the music industry, held the title due to her massive earnings from music, tours, and endorsements. However, Guo’s innovative contributions to the tech world have now eclipsed Swift’s financial milestone.Lucy Guo’s ascent to billionaire status is largely attributed to her 5% stake in Scale AI , a data annotation firm she co-founded in 2016 with business partner Alexandr Wang. The company specializes in providing labeled data to train artificial intelligence applications, serving major clients in industries like autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and e-commerce. Forbes estimates Guo’s net worth at $1.3 billion, driven by Scale AI’s soaring valuation.Guo is optimistic about the evolving landscape of entrepreneurship. In an interview with Forbes, she stated, “I think we’re about to see a lot more entrepreneurs be women and valuations grow at a tremendous rate. I wouldn’t be surprised if someone else took the title next year, but it’s really exciting to see.” Her confidence reflects a broader trend of increasing diversity in the tech and business sectors.Despite her billionaire status, Guo maintains a surprisingly modest lifestyle. “I still live a very frugal lifestyle,” she shared with Forbes. “For lunch, I get ‘buy one get one free’ all the time or, like, the 50%-off deals. But the one day I decide I need a private jet, maybe I’ll sell some shares, but at the moment I’m very happy flying commercial.” This grounded approach sets her apart in a world often associated with extravagant spending.Addressing her new title, Guo expressed admiration for Taylor Swift, noting, “She has always struck me as someone that’s very pro-woman and wants other people to win. I am a huge fan of her; I think she’s an icon.” Guo’s comments highlight a mutual respect between the two, despite their competition for the billionaire title.Beyond Scale AI, Guo has ventured into other entrepreneurial pursuits, including co-founding Passes, a platform positioned as a rival to OnlyFans. Passes aims to empower content creators by offering a subscription-based model. However, the platform faced scrutiny earlier this year when a content creator filed a lawsuit alleging that Passes distributed sexually abusive material involving her while she was underage. The controversy has raised questions about the platform’s content moderation practices, though Guo has not publicly commented on the issue.Guo’s achievement marks a significant moment for women in tech and entrepreneurship. Her success with Scale AI and her forward-thinking approach to business underscore the potential for women to lead in high-growth industries. As Guo herself predicts, the coming years may see even more women breaking barriers and claiming top spots in the billionaire rankings.With her wealth, influence, and innovative mindset, Lucy Guo is poised to continue shaping the tech industry. Whether through Scale AI, Passes, or new ventures, her journey as a self-made billionaire is just beginning. As she told Forbes, the rapid pace of change in entrepreneurship means the title of youngest billionaire may soon pass to another visionary—potentially another woman pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.","Lucy Guo has claimed the title of the world’s youngest self-made billionaire, surpassing pop icon Taylor Swift.

The headline announcement is expected to be a redesign of Apple’s operating systems, potentially rebranded with a year-based naming scheme: iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. Reports suggest iOS 26 will undergo its most significant overhaul since iOS 7, introducing a unified design language with floating tab views, updated iconography, and glass-like UI effects inspired by the Vision Pro’s aesthetic. This cohesive look aims to rival Google’s Android 16 revamp, prioritizing fluidity and personalization across devices.Apple Intelligence, introduced in 2024, will see further enhancements, though not as the centerpiece. Rumors indicate Apple will open its Foundation Models to third-party developers, enabling custom AI-powered features in apps like Safari and Photos, which may be quietly rebranded as “AI-powered.” A long-awaited Siri overhaul remains in development but is unlikely to debut fully. Additionally, an AI-powered coding tool, possibly in partnership with Anthropic, could be introduced for Xcode, streamlining app development.iPadOS 26 may introduce a “Pro” version with advanced multitasking, improved external display support, and professional-grade apps, catering to power users. watchOS 26 is expected to support third-party Control Center widgets, while tvOS 26 could feature a revamped CarPlay UI and animated lock screen artwork. visionOS 26 may bring native support for gaming controllers like PlayStation and Xbox, alongside minor UI tweaks to bolster Apple’s spatial computing push.Hardware announcements are less likely, as Apple’s recent M4 MacBook Air release and focus on fall hardware events suggest a software-driven WWDC. However, speculation persists about a potential M4 Ultra chip reveal or Mac Pro updates, though these are considered long shots.Developers will have access to over 100 technical sessions, online labs, and one-on-one consultations with Apple experts, covering topics like Swift, machine learning, and AR/VR tools. The Swift Student Challenge will also spotlight emerging talent, with 50 Distinguished Winners invited to a three-day Apple Park experience.As Apple aims to balance innovation with its privacy-first ethos, WWDC 2025 is set to lay the groundwork for a smarter, more cohesive ecosystem, with iOS 26 leading the charge. Stay tuned for live updates as Apple unveils its vision for the future.","Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off on June 9, 2025.

North Korea reportedly experienced an internet significant outage on Saturday (June 7), lasting several hours and disrupting access to government websites and official news services. The widespread disruption effectively severed the nation from global cyberspace. While the cause of the outage remains unclear, researchers monitoring North Korea's internet and technology infrastructure suggest it was likely an internal issue rather than a cyberattack.According to news agency Reuters, the assessment is based on the fact that connections through both China and Russia, typically used by North Korea, were also affected.During the outage, key North Korean websites, including its main official news services, the Foreign Ministry, and the national airline Air Koryo, were inaccessible. Service began to slowly return around midday, according to checks conducted by the news agency.As per a UK-based researcher who monitors North Korea's internet, even email services were impacted.“Hard to say if this is intentional or accidental - but seems like this is internal rather than an attack,” the researcher said.Martyn Williams, an expert on North Korea's technology and infrastructure at the Washington-based Stimson Center, also said that the internal nature of the problem was indicated by the non-functioning Chinese and Russian connections.In previous years, North Korea has faced extensive internet outages that were suspected to be the result of cyberattacks. The nation is claimed to have operated sophisticated elite teams of hackers, including the government-backed Lazarus group, which has been implicated in attacks against foreign institutions and companies, and more recently, in the theft and laundering of cryptocurrencies.","Key websites including that of foreign ministry, national airline affected.

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to prevent the country from drone attacks. Reacting to Trump’s latest executive order, a White House executive said that it addresses threats fromas well as potentially more sophisticated adversaries. The order focuses on reducing national security and public safety threats posed by drones within the US. President Trump has also directed a task force to boost the detection and identification of drones in the country. The initiative also aims to address unlawful uses, such as spying and drug smuggling. This is a priority given upcoming events like the FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.Sebastian Gorka, the senior director of counterterrorism at the White House National Security Council, said to reporters.He claimed that this order is the federal response to foreign-made drones and the protection of US military sites, critical infrastructure and large public events has been insufficient.He highglighted that the executive order will support the government's counter-drone capabilities. Gorka also mentioned that the FBI would begin training state and local law enforcement to improve their ability to protect against drone threats.The risks of drone warfare have become a priority after Russian strikes in Ukraine and Ukraine’s surprise attacks on aircraft inside Russia, Gorka noted.Gorka added.This order will also aim to advance US drone development and expand the technology’s commercial applications, including for deliveries and other uses.Meanwhile, talking with the reporters, Michael Kratsios, the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, said:Apart from this, Trump also signed orders intended to pave the way for a new generation of supersonic jets in the US and to promote the development of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, often referred to as air taxis.Kratsios added.",US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to prevent the country from drone attacks.

Indian professionals and their employers are increasingly exploring alternatives to H-1B visas, such as L-1 and O-1 visas, amid stricter scrutiny of H-1B applications and ongoing tech layoffs in the US, according to immigration experts cited by the Economic Times. Demand for EB-5 immigrant investor visas has also surged, with a 50% increase since January 2025, noted Sukanya Raman, country head - India & GCC practice team at Davies & Associates LLC. “These are in current status for Indian nationals, meaning visas are available, and they can receive authorization and travel documents in 3-6 months,” she told ET, highlighting their appeal for Indian families on H-1B visas whose children are nearing 21 and at risk of aging out.USCIS data shows a 27% year-on-year drop in shortlisted H-1B visa applications this year, the lowest since FY21, with the US approving 85,000 H-1B visas annually, of which Indians secure about 70%. The new Trump administration’s tightened H-1B scrutiny since early 2025, combined with layoffs at tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Intel, has heightened anxiety among Indian professionals.“Our clients are more fearful, especially about international travel and visa ‘stamping’ at consular posts abroad,” Joel Yanovich, an attorney at Murthy Law Firm, told the publication. “I don’t think a day goes by without clients asking if it’s safe to travel.”This has driven demand for L-1 visas (for intracompany transfers) and O-1 visas (for individuals with extraordinary abilities in fields like science, arts, or business), which lack the annual caps of H-1B visas. “Part of this spike is seasonal, tied to those not selected in the H-1B lottery, but it also reflects employers and individuals aiming to avoid anticipated H-1B scrutiny,” Yanovich said.Some companies are transferring employees to countries like Canada temporarily to qualify for L-1 visas, which can lead to EB-1C green cards for managers, Raman explained. Others are pursuing EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) visas for those with advanced degrees working in the US national interest, she added.Gnanamookan Senthurjothi, a US immigration attorney, told ET that the number of people seeking assistance for these visa options has risen in recent months.","Indian professionals and their employers are increasingly exploring alternatives to H-1B visas, such as L-1 and O-1 visas.

FBI on how to safeguard against scammers

Scam Series: The ""Meme Malware"" WhatsApp Scam

The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) has issued an alert, advising all smartphone users in the US to be wary of scams designed to coerce them into sending money. These attacks, which often involve impersonating government agents, are a growing concern for law enforcement, it said.""Scammers are spoofing FBI phone numbers nationwide, impersonating government agents. Victims are tricked into thinking an arrest is imminent unless they send money,"" the bureau stated (via Forbes).""The FBI will never call you demanding money to get out of criminal charges. It’s a scam. Hang up and visit the FBI's ic3.gov to file a report,"" it addedNotably, New York State Police recently issued similar warnings, noting ""an ongoing phone spoofing scam"" that impersonates law enforcement or government agencies. These scammers demand personal information like Social Security numbers and threaten punitive action for non-compliance.As per the law enforcement agencies, these scams are designed to create fear and confusion by making calls appear to originate from trusted sources. This often leads victims to comply with demands or share sensitive information that can be used for further financial fraud.They also claim that scammers have started posing as bank investigators, fire department charity collectors and even claiming to be from jury duty, demanding payment to avoid penalties for alleged failure to appear.The FBI reiterates that these impersonation scams rely on intimidation tactics. Scammers typically use an urgent, aggressive tone, refuse to speak with anyone but the targeted victim, and urge victims to keep the demands secret from family, friends, or financial institutions.Demands for payment can vary, including prepaid cards, wire transfers, cash sent by mail or inserted into cryptocurrency ATMs, or even cash delivered to a courier at the victim's home.The FBI stresses that since these scams prey on natural fears, users should hang up immediately and that all law enforcement agencies will never make such threats by phone or text.","Scammers are spoofing FBI phone numbers nationwide, impersonating government agents.

Getting fundamentals of software is important: Satyla Nadella

Poll Do you agree with Satya Nadella that understanding the fundamentals of software is crucial for tech beginners? No, AI is enough for beginners. Yes, absolutely!

“Just getting real fundamentals of software (if you're a software engineer), I think matters a lot.” Adding further, he said “To me, having the ability to think computationally (is important).”

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shared an important advice for aspiring tech professionals. The Microsoft CEO recently appeared in a conversation with tech YouTuber Sajjaad Khade where he urged students to focus on building strong fundamentals in computational thinking , even as AI shapes the software industry. He stressed that despite AI’s growing role in coding, the ability to break down problems logically and design systematic solutions remains essential. However, Nadella warned that even with AI, success still depends on giving clear, structured instructions—a skill that blends technical knowledge with systems thinking.“The path to being that software architect gets speeded up,” Satya Nadella said, adding that soon, “All of us are going to be more software architects.”During the conversation , Khade asked Satya Nadella: “In this world of AI, if I'm a beginner, just want to break into tech, what's your number one piece of advice?”Nadella replied saying:Nadella explained using his own example saying he was able to fix a bug by just assigning it to the CoPilot coding agent. “Except I was thinking about it, it was a pretty cool issue, right?

Most people want 100x returns

But play by 1x rules

Took me a while to figure out money.

Wealth took even longer.

But there’s one pattern I keep seeing

The biggest wins usually come from breaking the rules .

Not illegally. Just unapologetically

When I moved back to India post dot-com bust, I had -

No money

No plan

No safety net

Everyone had the same advice -

“Get a job. Play it safe. Rebuild slowly.”

Instead, I did something…

Stupid? Brave? Both

Started an Internet company in a country where there was no Internet

No D2C. No dating apps. No e-com playbook.

We didn’t follow demand. We created it.

And honestly, I’ve seen this play out again and again>

Creators who started before content was cool

Founders who launched when the market said “not now”

Brands that won by ignoring the rulebook

The rules are useful.

But at some point, you’ve got to know when to bend them.

So whether you’re building, creating or just figuring stuff out -

First learn the rules. Then, write your own

Because “play it safe” rarely makes history

Shark Tank India Judge and Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal recently shared a post on LinkedIn, reflecting on his entrepreneurial journey and the mindset required for outsized success. Mittal emphasised that while most people aspire to 100x returns , they often play by 1x rules, avoiding bold risks that could lead to transformative breakthroughs. In the long LinkedIn post, Anupam Mittal recalled his decision of moving back to India after the dot-com bust , despite having no money, no plan and no safety net.

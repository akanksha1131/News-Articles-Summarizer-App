‘I don't think it could be recreated': Chrome chief dismisses browser’s ‘existence’ without Google at US antitrust trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/i-dont-think-it-could-be-recreated-chrome-chief-dismisses-browsers-existence-without-google-at-us-antitrust-trial/articleshow/120645831.cms,"Representative Image

“Chrome today represents 17 years of collaboration between the Chrome people and the rest of Google. Trying to disentangle that is unprecedented. I don’t think it could be recreated,”

Google Chrome chief's concern with browser's ownership



Google Chrome ’s general manager, Parisa Tabriz , has said that the browser cannot ‘exist’ without the tech giant. During an antitrust trial in Washington, US, the company’s executive said that Google is the only company capable of supporting Chrome’s current feature set, due to its deep “interdependencies” with its parent company Alphabet’s infrastructure. Speaking before Judge Amit Mehta at the US Justice Department’s case, Tabriz explained that critical browser functions—like its safe browsing mode and password-breach alerts—draw on shared Google systems, which are beyond Chrome’s codebase. She argued that separating Chrome from the rest of the company would be an unprecedented technical challenge.Tabriz said to the court, as reported by Bloomberg.Tabriz said this as Judge Mehta presides over a three-week hearing to determine what changes Google must make to its business practices, after last year’s finding that the company illegally monopolised the search market.The US Justice Department wants Google to divest its Chrome browser and provide a portion of its collected data for use in competing search results. It also asked Judge Mehta to prohibit Google from paying to secure default search-engine status—a restriction that would extend to its AI offerings, including Gemini, which the government argues benefited from Google’s unlawful search monopoly.Google’s Chrome browser, which holds roughly 66% of the global market as of March, is built atop the open-source Chromium Project and accepts contributions from companies like Meta, Microsoft and the Linux Foundation.During the Justice Department’s antitrust remedies hearing, Harvard professor James Mickens testified that spinning off Chrome to a new owner “is feasible from a technical perspective” and could be done “without breaking too much” of its functionality; he added that Google would still have incentives to maintain Chromium for Android and other uses, the report noted.However, Tabriz countered that by saying that Google has supplied over 90% of Chromium’s code since 2015 and invests hundreds of millions annually in its development.She noted, “Google invests hundreds of millions of dollars into Chromium,” estimating that 1,000 engineers in her division have worked on the project. Tabriz added that other companies “are not contributing now in any meaningful way.”","Google Chrome's general manager, Parisa Tabriz, has said that the browser cannot ‘exist’ without the tech giant.

"Elon Musk calls Google-owned Waymo ‘expensive’, former robotaxi company CEO fires back: ‘They've failed utterly and…’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-calls-google-owned-waymo-expensive-former-robotaxi-company-ceo-fires-back-theyve-failed-utterly-and/articleshow/120643110.cms,"What Musk said during earnings call

Google-owned Waymo’s former CEO has responded to the remarks made by Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the self-driving car project during the company’s recent earnings call about Waymo's expensive sensor suite and its approach to autonomous driving. In a sharp rebuttal, John Krafcik – who led Waymo from 2015 to 2021 – said that Tesla has yet to demonstrate any real-world competitive presence in the robotaxi market. Musk projected a rapid expansion to “millions” of fully autonomous Teslas by the second half of next year.“Tesla has never competed with Waymo — they've never sold a robotaxi ride to a public rider, but they've sold a lot of cars,” Krafcik said in an email to Business Insider.“And although Tesla hopes to compete with Waymo someday, they've failed utterly and completely at this for each of the 10 years they've been talking about it,” he added.Musk informed the investors that the initial “pilot” rollout in Austin this June will consist of 10 to 20 robotaxis, which will be Tesla Model Y cars. He also claimed that Tesla will have a market-share domination of “99% or something ridiculous.”Musk touted Tesla’s camera-based, “generalised” AI approach as superior to Waymo's lidar-heavy, pre-mapped strategy, claiming it would lead to lower costs and higher production volumes.“The issue with Waymo's cars is it costs way more money,” Musk said.While Tesla is said to adapt to various driving environments without the need of pre-mapping a particular region, Waymo maps out a city with its cars before deploying a robotaxi service.Krafcik dismissed Musk’s cost arguments, emphasising the importance of safety. He argued that the long-term cost of sensors is “trivial” compared to the “massive quantifiable safety benefits” they provide.Krafcik also cast doubt on Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, which is central to its robotaxi vision. Despite Tesla's claims and recent previews of its robotaxi app, he pointed to the lack of a fully autonomous, publicly available service.“Well, after 10 years of undelivered promises, it seems pretty rational for those watching to be data- and evidence-driven,” Krafcik said.“There's still a lot of promises, still no Tesla liability for FSD driving performance, and still no universal robotaxi service,” he added, while noting that Tesla's FSD has improved but stressed that this does not equate to a proven, safe and truly autonomous robotaxi service.","John Krafcik, who led Waymo from 2015 to 2021, said Tesla has yet to demonstrate any real-world competitive presence in the robotaxi market.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has been confronted with various challenges on his path to turning a garage business into one of the biggest companies in the world. During his early days, Bezos faced doubts from investors and the public regarding the potential of e-commerce. He grappled with scarce resources and stiff competition from traditional retailers. As Amazon expanded, Bezos encountered logistical and operational challenges in expanding the business worldwide, keeping customers satisfied, and making timely deliveries.Despite these challenges, his vision, risk-taking attitude, and single-minded obsession with customer experience enabled him to turn Amazon into a global technology giant. Explore some of the major challenges being faced by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and how he overcame them.One of Jeff Bezos's most infamous failures is the Amazon Fire Phone, released in 2014 was Amazon's initial foray into the smartphone industry, challenging titans Apple and Samsung. The phone came equipped with flashy technology such as Dynamic Perspective (a 3D-like motion interface) and Firefly (a feature that could scan objects in the real world to immediately purchase them on Amazon). Though ambitious, the phone was obviously made more to promote purchasing than to offer a fantastic mobile experience. Consumers found it gimmicky, pricey, and without essential features. Large app makers avoided it, and the phone became obsolete in no time. Amazon had to drop its price from $199 to 99 cents within months and eventually wrote off $170 million worth of unsold goods. The Fire Phone flopped so badly that it retarded Amazon's hardware plans — but Bezos took it in stride, terming it as a necessary failure along the innovation path.Amazon in 2020 launched ""Crucible,"" its first AAA multiplayer video game. It was one of a series of moves by Bezos to make Amazon a gaming industry powerhouse. Created by Amazon Game Studios, Crucible was destined to be a huge success, rivaling such games as Fortnite and Overwatch. But the initial release was nothing short of calamitous. Unfocused, littered with errors, and a failure to pull in a fan base, only one month post-launch did the game get put back into closed beta — unheard of in video games — and a few more months later it was outright cancelled. Although the precise cost of development wasn't disclosed, typical AAA games are in the order of $60–$80 million, a significant reputational and financial loss. Though there was a failure, Amazon went on investing in other games as well, such as the ultimately successful ""New World,"" indicating Bezos's failure-to-learn strategy.Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Berkshire Hathaway launched Haven in 2018 as an ambitious joint venture. It was intended to transform American healthcare for the workers of the companies and eventually, possibly, the general market. The vision was to lower the cost of healthcare and enhance results through technology and innovation — classic Bezos thinking. But the healthcare system was too complicated. The company faced fuzzy objectives, leadership turnover, and minimal concrete progress. By early 2021, Haven quietly closed. It never rolled out a product or shook up the system as intended. For Bezos, this was a stark reminder that even ambitious, well-capitalized projects can fail when attempting to reform industries with entrenched inefficiencies.During the dot-com bubble, Bezos invested big in startups that shared Amazon's ecommerce vision. One of the largest flops was Pets.com, in which Amazon had a large stake. Launched with great fanfare — including a Super Bowl commercial that starred a sock puppet — the company vowed to bring pet supplies to your doorstep. But the business model was flawed: shipping heavy pet food was costly, and the company sold it at little markup and with free shipping. As losses accumulated, confidence dwindled. When the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, Pets.com folded. Amazon lost millions in the process, and the sock puppet became a lasting symbol of dot-com failure. Bezos admitted the error but attributed it to a risk necessary in pushing the limits of ecommerce.Another dot-com failure investment was Kozmo.com, which guaranteed one-hour delivery of items such as DVDs, snacks, and magazines. Amazon invested more than $60 million in it, thinking ultra-fast delivery was the future. Kozmo's product was novel but unsustainable — no minimum order quantity, and free delivery. The firm grew too rapidly and went out of money. It collapsed in 2001. The irony is that this same concept — speedy delivery — would later prove to be one of Amazon's greatest assets in the form of Prime. But at the time, the infrastructure was not in place, and Bezos's dream was premature.Amazon's initial serious foray into the peer-to-peer payments market, WebPay, was introduced in 2009. It enabled users to send money from their Amazon accounts, going head-to-head with companies such as PayPal. However, the service failed to gain traction. Its interface was awkward, and consumers had no incentive to move from more established sites. Amazon closed it down by 2014. The failure demonstrated that even with the Amazon name behind it, badly implemented financial tools wouldn't work without actual innovation or consumer incentive.According to the reports, Amazon invested $175 million in LivingSocial, a daily deals site intended to compete with Groupon, in 2010. Early on, the business expanded briskly, but the daily deal format started declining. LivingSocial attempted to revamp by providing tickets to events and staging experiences in neighborhoods, even going as far as expending millions redeveloping an historic building into a venue. Those efforts could not revive expansion. LivingSocial was purchased in 2016 by Groupon for zero dollars — $0. Amazon's investment in terms of large dollars was gone, and the arrangement was broadly agreed upon as not succeeding.In 2014, Amazon tried to rival Square and PayPal with its own payment device: the Amazon Local Register. It was an app and card reader designed for small businesses. But it didn't catch on — the device didn't have competitive features, and small business owners didn't use it. Amazon discontinued it in 2015 and closed it down completely in 2016. Similar to WebPay, it demonstrated that entering a space without a clear benefit to the user wouldn't be sufficient to capture market share.Askville, introduced in 2007, was Amazon's take on Yahoo! Answers or Quora — a Q&A site where users could pose questions and receive community answers. While it amassed a respectable user base, it never really found its market or achieved mainstream fame. As years went by, Amazon lost enthusiasm for keeping it going, and in 2013 the site was closed. The endeavour never merged with Amazon's overall business and is today a relic of its early Web 2.0 days.It debuted in 2015, and Amazon Destinations was Amazon's foray into the travel sector by providing short getaway hotel bookings. But the site had no competitive offers, didn't provide flights, and wasn't sufficiently enticing to shake up large travel websites such as Expedia or Booking.com. In a mere six months, Amazon shut it down. Bezos never made a public comment on the failure, but it was a textbook example of a company attempting to reach too far beyond its area of expertise without providing something new or better.Amazon's flash fashion sale website, MyHabit, opened in 2011 as flash-sale retailers such as Gilt and Rue La La gained popularity. It was designed to provide fashion enthusiasts time-limited offers on high-end clothing and accessories. But the idea didn't pan out as shoppers grew weary of flash sales, and competition within the fashion sector increased. MyHabit was discontinued in 2016, with Amazon choosing instead to merge clothing sales under the Amazon Fashion banner. It was a move away from niche fashion experiments, but a shift towards wider, long-term thinking.In 2009, Amazon removed unauthorised copies of George Orwell's ""1984"" and ""Animal Farm"" from customers' Kindles remotely. While the move was within the law — the books were available for sale by a third-party who did not have the right to distribute them — it generated public outcry. The removal of content from individuals' devices was itself Orwellian in nature, and critics charged Amazon with digital censorship. Bezos apologised in person, labeling the action ""stupid, thoughtless, and painfully out of line with our principles."" The affair hurt trust in Kindle and made clear the dangers of digital overreach.","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has been confronted with various challenges on his path to turning a garage business into one of the biggest companies in the world.

Mark Zuckkerberg’s wife Priscilla Chan-funded free Silicon Valley School to shut down next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/trump-effect-mark-zuckerberg-funded-silicon-valley-school-to-shut-down-next-year-read-what-the-note-on-the-schools-website-says/articleshow/120497475.cms,"What the note on the school's website says

Mark Zuckerberg's Education Ventures

The Primary School , a no-cost private institution in the Bay Area co-founded by Priscilla Chan , wife of Facebook parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , will reportedly cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students. First reported by Bloomberg, the impending closure was disclosed in a statement posted on the school's website recently. In a move aimed at preserving its legacy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the billionaire couple's philanthropic arm, has committed $50 million to invest in the communities the school serves -— specifically East Palo Alto, Belle Haven, and the East Bay region near San Francisco -- over the subsequent few years.""This was a very difficult decision, and we are committed to ensuring a thoughtful and supportive transition for students and families over the next year,"" the online statement conveyed. Carson Cook, a spokesperson for The Primary School, stated there would be no further comment beyond the official announcement.Pediatrician Priscilla Chan, 40, co-established The Primary School in 2016, implementing an ""integrated health and education model"" designed to support families and children from birth through high school, according to the organization's tax filings. The school's inaugural middle school cohort commenced in 2023.The most recent tax documentation indicates that over 95% of The Primary School's students in East Palo Alto identify as under-represented minorities. The filing also revealed the nonprofit held assets exceeding $30 million as of the end of June 2023.The Primary School is among several educational endeavors recently initiated by prominent billionaires. Elon Musk , Jeff Bezos, and Larry Ellison have all established schools in recent years. Musk's nonprofit, the Musk Foundation, has contributed $237 million to his technology-focused primary and secondary school in Austin, named Ad Astra, with future aspirations for a university. Ad Astra collaborates with the same entity that assisted Ellison in establishing his Hala Kahiki Montessori school in Lanai, Hawaii, an island largely owned by the Oracle co-founder. Amazon.com founder Bezos has created a network of Montessori-inspired preschools catering to children in underserved communities.The closure of The Primary School coincides with significant strategic shifts within Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms Inc. as the 40-year-old founder appears to be aligning his business interests more closely with the Trump administration. Recent appointments to Meta's board include longtime Trump allies Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, and Dina Powell McCormick, who served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser during his first term.Furthermore, Zuckerberg has appointed a Republican strategist as chief of global affairs, eliminated Meta’s US fact-checking program, rolled back the company’s hate-speech policies, and discontinued key diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at both Meta and CZI. This contrasts with The Primary School's documented commitment to diversity, which included conducting a diversity audit in June 2020 following the Black Lives Matter protests and forming a DEI task force in the fall of that year.","The Primary School will cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students.

OpenAI has also made the tool accessible to free-tier users, offering five tasks per month. Paying users benefit from expanded usage limits , with the tool seamlessly switching to the lightweight version once limits for the original deep research are reached.While responses from the lightweight version are shorter, they retain the structured logic and citations that users expect from the original deep research tool. OpenAI claims the lightweight model is cheaper to serve, enabling broader adoption without compromising the user experience.“All Plus, Team, and Pro users now have expanded usage of deep research.

Implications for global research

Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law, which restricts the sharing of “important data” with overseas partners without approval. The suspension impacts joint research in fields like health and environmental studies , raising questions about the future of international scientific cooperation .Implemented in 2021, China’s Data Security Law broadly defines “important data” as information that could threaten national or economic interests or affect the rights of individuals or organisations. European agencies, including the German Research Foundation , Swedish Research Council, and Swiss National Science Foundation, have expressed concerns over the law’s vague provisions, which make it difficult to assess compliance and avoid legal liabilities.The law requires security clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China to export data classified as “important,” effectively making cross-border data sharing extremely challenging. This has led to the suspension of new co-funded projects with China’s National Natural Science Foundation.The halt in collaborations could delay progress in critical areas like pandemic response and air quality studies, where data sharing is essential. Experts warn that the restrictions may hinder the ability to address global health challenges effectively.Jan Palmowski, Secretary-General of the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities, emphasised the need for responsible and safe data sharing to tackle future pandemics and other health crises.","Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law.

“I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”

“then I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky, and I probably would have been overly nice, but wondered if it was the right thing to do? Luckily, it never happened.”

“When it comes to shopping, I’m not exactly the target audience,”

“the most different than I am.”

“Because she’s so good with people. When we would go on family vacations, we would find some part of the beach to just be off on our own, and Phoebe would go down the beach and meet people and bring them back to introduce them to us,”

Gates admitted he deliberately chose not to fund his daughter Phoebe’s AI-powered shopping app , Phia, explaining that otherwise he’d have ended up supervising the business too closely. Instead of serving as an investor, he provided Phoebe with guidance on personnel issues and left the funding to others.

What Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal said

All of this - https://reddit.com/r/StartUpIndia/comments/1k7j841/zomatos_internal_chaos/ - is utter nonsense.

Neither are we losing market share, nor will we ever force our employees to order on Zomato. Freedom of choice is something we stand for vehemently.

It is embarrassing to even clarify this - but doing it since many people reached out to me with concern.

And thanks everybody for your concern.. appreciate it.

An anonymous Reddit post recently claimed that things inside Zomato are ""going off the rails."" According to the post, leadership recently allegedly admitted that Zomato is losing market share to Zepto Cafe and Swiggy, adding that the employees are now required to order from Zomato at least seven times a month. Responding to the claims, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal said that “All of this is utter nonsense”. Stating that “it is embarrassing to even clarify this,” Goyal said that “Neither are we losing market share, nor will we ever force our employees to order on Zomato.”“Freedom of choice is something we stand for vehemently,” he further added.As mentioned above, a Reddit user r/StartUpIndia claimed that the food delivery platform is forcing its employees to order from the app seven times a week, adding that “ordering from competitors is outright banned in the office”. The Reddit post describes confusion at the leadership level. Rakesh Ranjan, CEO of Zomato's food delivery business, reportedly told employees to “stay focused” and “get back on track” during a townhall, but was removed from the role just two days later.The post also mentions a toxic work environment, where micromanagement and public criticism of employees are common. ""The only thing keeping the company profitable now is platform fees,"" it claims, adding that there’s little focus on long-term sustainability.There are growing issues with delivery partners as well, the user alleged.

US judge to review actions after Google ad market case on May 2,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-judge-to-review-actions-after-google-ad-market-case-on-may-2/articleshow/120639685.cms,"Five big anti-trust cases targeting Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook going in the US

A U.S. judge has scheduled a hearing on May 2 to discuss possible actions the U.S. Justice Department and several states may seek against Google. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that the company illegally dominates two online advertising markets . The judge then said that Google has built an illegal monopoly over publisher ad servers and ad exchanges, engaging in anticompetitive acts to maintain dominance, harming publishers, competition and consumers.Judge Brinkema said that the hearing is intended to get an early overview of potential remedies before considering specific actions. The judge led a non-jury trial last year and will decide what steps Google must take to restore competition, which could include selling parts of its business.This ruling marks the second time a U.S. court has found Google to hold an illegal monopoly. In August 2024, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google used exclusive agreements with companies like Samsung Electronics to strengthen its search engine monopoly.Judge Mehta is currently considering whether Google should be required to sell its Chrome web browser to improve competition in the search market.Google, on its part, has denied the government’s allegations in both cases and has stated plans to appeal both rulings.The ruling is part of a broader US government push to curb Big Tech, with five major antitrust cases targeting tech giants, marking an aggressive shift in enforcement since the Microsoft case in the 1990s.Analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf of Emarketer said the antitrust tide has turned against Google, though legal remedies and timelines depend on appeals, which could span years. The case, launched under the Trump and Biden administrations, follows another ruling last August that Google illegally monopolized search, also under appeal. Online advertising fuels Google’s fortune, funding free services like Maps, Gmail, and search, and its AI investments.","U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that the company illegally dominates two online advertising markets.

Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos says company is ‘saving Hollywood’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-ceo-ted-sarandos-says-company-is-saving-hollywood/articleshow/120625779.cms,"What Netflix CEO said about the movie theatre experience



“What does that say? What is the consumer trying to tell us? That they’d like to watch movies at home, thank you. The studios and the theatres are duking it out over trying to preserve this 45-day window that is completely out of step with the consumer experience of just loving a movie.”

“I believe it is an outmoded idea, for most people, not for everybody.”

“We didn’t save it to save the theatre business. We saved it to save the theatre experience,”

“We have these bespoke releases … we have to do some qualification for the Oscars. They have to run for a little bit, it helps with the press cycle a little bit. But I’ve tried to encourage every director we work with to focus on the consumer, focus on the fans. Make a movie that they love, and they will reward you,”

“Folks grew up thinking, ‘I want to make movies on a gigantic screen and have strangers watch them [and to have them] play in the theatre for two months and people cry and sold-out shows … It’s an outdated concept,”

Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos has claimed that the streaming giant is ""saving Hollywood."" Talking at the TIME100 Summit, Sarandos said that he was asked if his company is destroying Hollywood amid issues like shrinking theatrical windows and sagging box office receipts, he said, “No, we’re saving Hollywood .” Sarandos countered these accusations by saying Netflix is “a very consumer-focused company. We deliver the program to you in a way you want to watch it.”Referring to the declining box office sales, he said:While admitting his love for theatres and their communal atmosphere, the Netflix boss noted,However, Netflix hasn’t entirely removed itself from the movie theatre business. The company owns Los Angeles’ Bay Theatre and New York’s Paris Theatre, which Sarandos says Netflix “saved” from becoming a Walgreens.he added.The company also gives certain films limited theatrical releases to qualify for awards, as with 2022’s “Glass Onion” and 2024’s “Emilia Pérez.”Sarandos noted.Sarandos said this while highlighting that Netflix is “in a period of transition.”When asked if creating films “for the communal experience” is “an outmoded idea,” he replied, “I think it is — for most people, not for everybody. If you’re fortunate to live enough in Manhattan, and you can walk to a multiplex and see a movie, that’s fantastic. Most of the country cannot.”Although he insisted he still loves movie theatres and their decline doesn’t “bother” him, Sarandos warned Hollywood not to get “trapped” behind traditional theatrical windows. Instead, he argued, studios should adapt to how audiences want to watch movies or risk losing relevance.","Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos has claimed that the streaming giant is ""saving Hollywood"" While admitting his love for theatres and their communal atmosphere, the Netflix boss noted, “I believe it is an outmoded idea, for most people, not for everybody”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120625756,imgsize-22158,width-400,resizemode-4/Netflix-CEO-Ted-Sarandos-says-company-is-saving-Hollywood.jpg"

Intel Chief Financial Officer (CFO) David Zinsner has expressed concerns that President Donald Trump's tariffs and retaliatory measures from other nations have significantly increased the likelihood of an economic recession.“The very fluid trade policies in the US and beyond, as well as regulatory risks, have increased the chance of an economic slowdown, with the probability of a recession growing,” Zinsner said during the company's quarterly earnings call on Thursday (April 24).He further elaborated on the potential economic impact, saying, “The biggest risk we see is the impact of a potential pullback in investment and spending, as businesses and consumers react to higher costs and the uncertain economic backdrop.”While Intel's geographically diverse production facilities mitigate some of the direct effects of the tariffs, Zinsner acknowledged that the company “will certainly see costs increase.”Earlier this month, JP Morgan projected that the US will slip into a recession by the end of 2025, followed by Trump's reciprocal tariffs. CEO Jamie Dimon also warned that sweeping tariffs may unleash financial instability.“I think probably a recession is a likely outcome,” said Dimon, adding that recent steep market declines are deepening fears.“When you see a 2,000-point decline in the Dow, it sort of feeds on itself... it makes you feel like you're losing money in your 401(k), you're losing money in your pension. You've got to cut back,” he noted.Meanwhile, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, CEO of Intel Products, suggested that rising costs could lead consumers to favour laptops and computers utilising older, less expensive chip generations.“The macroeconomic concerns and tariffs have everybody kind of hedging their bets in what they need to have from an inventory perspective,” Holthaus said during the earnings call.In addition to tariff-related challenges, Intel is navigating US government efforts to impose licensing requirements on the shipment of advanced artificial intelligence chips to countries like China.",Intel CFO David Zinsner expressed concerns that President Donald Trump's tariffs and retaliatory measures from other nations have significantly increased the likelihood of an economic recession.

Elon Musk criticism of OpenAI’s for-profit status

Podcaster Rob Wiblin recently shared a post highlighting a legal letter titled 'Not For Private Gain', signed by 3 Nobel Prize winners and dozens of AI researchers, accusing OpenAI of illegally restructuring from a non-profit to a for-profit entity. Sent to California and Delaware Attorneys General, the letter allegedly demands halting the restructuring of the company. X owner and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk replied to the post, calling it “scam of the century”.The post also has screenshots of the letter with the following text highlighted in colour: All of the governance safeguards that Mr. Altman claimed “ensure (OpenAI) remains focused on its long-term mission would be in jeopardy”. It also has a table comparing the current governance safeguards of OpenAI (under its nonprofit structure) with the proposed changes under the for-profit restructuring.Founded in 2015 as a non-profit organization, OpenAI is reportedly looking to turn the status to for-profit. The company, as per reports plans to restructure as a public benefit corporation, a shift that has raised concerns among AI experts, legal scholars and former OpenAI employees. They argue that the move could compromise OpenAI’s original mission to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of all humanity.Elon Musk, one of the co-founders of OpenAI has been a vocal critic of this transition. He has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI that will go to a jury trial in spring 2026. The lawsuit, initially dismissed, accuses OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman of deviating from its founding agreement by emphasizing profits over AI safety .","OpenAI is reportedly looking to turn the status to for-profit.

US President Donald Trump praised Elon Musk 's efforts to reshape the federal workforce while calling for more aggressive action in a social media post that drew swift response from the tech billionaire.""ELON IS DOING A GREAT JOB, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE,"" Trump posted on his social media platform, adding ""REMEMBER, WE HAVE A COUNTRY TO SAVE, BUT ULTIMATELY, TO MAKE GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE.""Musk quickly responded ""Will do, Mr. President!"" before announcing a new accountability measure for federal workers. ""Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump's instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,"" Musk posted, adding that ""Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.""Through his role at the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), Musk has implemented strategies similar to those he used at X (formerly Twitter), where he famously required employees to commit to an ""extremely hardcore"" work culture or leave. Earlier initiatives included mandatory return-to-office policies and buyout offers to federal agencies, similar to that of what he implemented at Twitter after its purchase.In the mass layoffs at multiple agencies, the administration reported that about 77,000 workers, roughly 3% of the civilian workforce, accepted buyout offers. The Musk-headed department has further terminated more than 1,000 federal contracts it deemed unnecessary or wasteful, spanning 39 federal departments and agencies. DOGE claims to have saved approximately $55 billion in federal spending thus far, though a review of itemized savings on its website only accounts for about $16 billion.","US President Donald Trump praised Elon Musk's efforts to reshape the federal workforce.

The ceremony took place at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with his girlfriend and family members in attendance.

Missed opportunity

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently appeared on an Indian-origin YouTuber's podcast shortly after the company announced its new quantum computer chip . Dwarkesh Patel , the host of the YouTube podcast, generated buzz, particularly after sharing how he secured Nadella's participation in the podcast.Patel revealed that he secured the interview with Nadella through a simple "" cold email ."" In the podcast, the Microsoft CEO shared a key ""lesson"" he's learned throughout his career and offered advice to new employees joining the company.‚ÄúKids, don't underestimate the power of a cold email,‚Äù he said in the podcast.Nadella's recent appearance came about in an unexpected way. Patel, known for interviewing prominent figures like Mark Zuckerberg and Tony Blair, noticed that Nadella had subscribed to his newsletter. Seizing the opportunity, Patel sent a brief email with the subject line ‚ÄúWanna come on my podcast?‚ÄùIn the email, Patel expressed his appreciation for Nadella subscribing to his newsletter and extended an invitation to appear on his podcast. He specifically mentioned his interest in discussing Nadella's views on AI and Microsoft's future.‚ÄúHi Satya, saw your email on my newsletter subscriber list. Appreciate you tuning in! Would you be interested in coming on my podcast?... I'm keen to hear how you're thinking about AI (and Microsoft) over the next 3/10/25 years,‚Äù Mr Patel wrote.To Patel's surprise, Nadella apparently responded within just four minutes, expressing his enthusiasm for the opportunity.‚ÄúYour pod is super. I would love to,‚Äù he said.Patel later shared this story on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting the potential of a well-crafted cold email.Nadella reflected on a significant oversight in the company's history -- the failure to anticipate the dominance of search as the internet's primary business model. Nadella acknowledged that Microsoft underestimated the potential of search to organize the web, allowing Google to capitalize on this opportunity and establish a highly profitable business.‚ÄúWe missed what turned out to be the biggest business model on the web because we all assumed the web is all about being distributed. Who would have thought that search would be the biggest winner?"" he asked.Mr Nadella acknowledged that this oversight was a crucial lesson for him.""These business model shifts are probably tougher than even the tech trend changes,"" he said.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appeared on an Indian-origin YouTuber's podcast shortly after the company announced its new quantum computer chip.

Sam Altman announces birth of premature son and emotional journey of parenthood



Reactions to Sam Altman‚Äôs announcement of premature baby boy



OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has married his partner, Oliver Mulherin . Altman, 38, the well-known tech figure, and Mulherin, an Australian software developer, got hitched in a private wedding amidst palm trees and some observers at an isolated tropical beach resort.Recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared his personal emotional baby boy news on February 23, 2025. Altman made public this happy news in an emotional post on X (formerly Twitter), the medium where he had made his audience well-acquainted with the life of the man behind OpenAI. It was a snug moment for the tech world, particularly when Altman's off-work life was barely seen by the public eye.Oliver Mulherin was born in Melbourne, Australia. There, he picked up a liking for technology during his childhood years. He pursued his science and technology skills from the John Monash Science School. Next, he took on a Bachelor of Computer Science course at the University of Melbourne and graduated in 2016. His education paved the way to his professional life as a successful software engineer.Oliver Mulherin has achieved great success in the technology sector, with a varied career in several well-known organizations. His career started with an internship at Vital-Sim in Calgary, Canada, in 2014, where he learned the most important aspects of software development. In 2015, he co-founded PROPL in Melbourne, which marked the beginning of his entrepreneurial endeavors. Following his exit from PROPL in 2017, Mulherin worked at the IOTA Foundation, SPARK Neuro, and Broadwing before working a significant role at Meta (formerly Facebook) in 2020, where he served as a softwareengineer until 2022.During his career, Mulherin has made significant contributions to numerous projects that would improve user experiences and blend innovative technologies into the tech space. He has also innovated AI-based solutions and business models through innovations such as TechSavvy, where he registered incredible growth and garnered investor interest.Oliver Mulherin and Sam Altman's relationship entered the public sphere when they both went to a White House dinner in June 2023, organized by President Joe Biden for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The couple remained quiet about their engagement, but they got married in January 2024 in an intimate beach wedding in Hawaii with close friends and family members. The wedding ceremony had Jewish elements, including breaking the glass.In his post, 39-year-old Altman announced that his early baby boy was born prematurely. Altman told his fans that the new infant was getting the right medical care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Premature births can come with added anxiety since early babies are typically in greater need, but Altman informed that his son was fine with the medical treatment.Altman shared his utter delight at becoming a first-time parent, captioning, ""Welcome to the world, little guy!"" With this happy news, Altman also shared a striking image of his newborn's small hand grasping an adult finger, representing the fragile and intimate connection between parent and child. He also explained the premature birth, that the baby would be in the NICU for a bit but is fine. Altman also appreciated the peaceful time spent taking care of his son, calling it ""really nice to be in a little bubble taking care of him."" This phrase encapsulated both the difficulty and the deep emotional process of being a parent.Altman concluded his post with an extremely emotional statement, ""I have never felt such love,"" to emphasize the utmost joy and close connection that comes with parenthood.Altman's news was instantly shared and went viral, receiving widespread attention mostly from his fellow tech professionals. He was among the very first to comment, with the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, saying, ""My heartfelt congratulations, Sam! Parenthood is one of the richest and most enriching experiences of life. All the best to you and yours."" Nadella's message set the tone and, before long, many other business leaders soon followed suit to congratulate and offer best wishes to the new parents. Thousands of individuals participated in congratulating Altman on the good news, highlighting the positive response he got from his followers and peers as well.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has married his partner, Australian software developer Oliver Mulherin.

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you‚Äôre a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you‚Äôre selling algos or strategies to other traders, you‚Äôll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can‚Äôt publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

What SEBI‚Äôs new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ‚Äôs new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI‚Äôs newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading‚Äîan opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: ‚Äúwhite box‚Äù algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and ‚Äúblack box‚Äù algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India‚Äôs algo trading landscape‚Äîexpanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you‚Äôve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Wilkinson posted on Twitter.Vembu, who positions his company's Zoho Sign as a competitor to DocuSign, didn't hold back in his criticism of the digital signature giant.

Donald Trump makes a Big announcement just a day after meeting Apple CEO Tim Cook,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-makes-a-big-announcement-just-a-day-after-meeting-apple-ceo-tim-cook/articleshow/118495379.cms,"What Donald Trump said about Apple‚Äôs plans

How Trump‚Äôs tariffs can affect Apple

US President Donald Trump has revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook is planning to shift manufacturing from Mexico to the US, a report claims. Trump reportedly disclosed the company‚Äôs move at a gathering of governors, however, the Cupertino-based tech giant has yet to make any official statement regarding the same.According to a report by Bloomberg, Trump cited a recent meeting with Cook at the White House to say that Apple ‚Äústopped two plants in Mexico‚Äù and will build products in the US instead. He also said that Cook has promised that Apple will invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the US.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs [Cook] going to start building. Very big numbers ‚Äî you have to speak to him. I assume they‚Äôre going to announce it at some point. They don‚Äôt want to be in the tariffs,‚Äù Bloomberg quoted Trump saying.The report didn't detail which manufacturing facilities Trump referred to, but it noted that Apple partner Foxconn Technology Group has a significant presence in Mexico and plans to expand there. While Foxconn produces the iPhone in Asia, Apple still relies predominantly on China for production.During the transition, Cook attended Trump‚Äôs inauguration last month and also visited his Mar-a-Lago estate. Meanwhile, Apple risks potential challenges as the US-China trade dispute intensifies.Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese-made goods poses a significant challenge as Apple works to boost sluggish iPhone sales, and China is also reportedly considering investigating Apple's app fees and policies.This has further complicated matters given that China is the company‚Äôs largest manufacturing hub while the US remains its biggest market.Apple is also increasingly turning to domestic production through its partnership with TSMC which is building chip factories in Arizona to produce semiconductors for devices like the iPad and Apple Watch.","US President Donald Trump has revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook is planning to shift manufacturing from Mexico to the US.

In a highly anticipated interview aired on Fox News Channel on Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk defended their aggressive cost-cutting initiatives aimed at reshaping federal spending. The conversation, marked by mutual admiration, addressed concerns regarding Musk‚Äôs role in government restructuring and potential conflicts of interest due to his business ventures.Musk, who has been entrusted with overseeing the cost-cutting drive through the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), stated that he would continue working with Trump ""as long as he can be helpful."" The interview sought to clarify Musk‚Äôs position in the administration, as well as address skepticism over his influence on policies that may impact industries in which he has vested interests.A key topic of discussion was the extent of Musk‚Äôs involvement in government restructuring. While Musk has been playing a prominent role in implementing spending cuts, the White House maintains that he is not an official employee and has no direct decision-making authority. When asked whether he intended to work with Trump for the entire four-year term, Musk responded:Trump‚Äôs administration has prioritized reducing federal spending since his return to office last month, placing Musk at the forefront of these efforts. The billionaire, who is also a major Trump donor, has leveraged broad powers granted to him by the administration to reform and consolidate federal agencies.Musk‚Äôs involvement in federal restructuring has led to criticism over possible conflicts of interest. Many of the agencies subject to budget cuts and restructuring have regulatory oversight over his companies, including SpaceX, Tesla, and The Boring Company. Critics have questioned whether Musk‚Äôs role in the government could benefit his businesses, raising ethical concerns.However, Trump dismissed such claims, stating that Musk would not allow conflicts of interest to interfere with his responsibilities.Trump assured during the interview.Musk reinforced this stance, emphasising that his actions are under intense scrutiny:he said.Elon Musk claimed that DOGE is committed to transparency, with its actions being documented on a public website. This, he argued, would ensure that any potential conflicts are immediately identified and addressed. Trump supported this statement, asserting that Musk is operating under ""a pretty big microscope,"" implying that any questionable decisions would be swiftly exposed by the media and government watchdogs.During the interview, Trump praised Musk‚Äôs business acumen and leadership, referring to him as ‚Äúbrilliant,‚Äù ‚Äúhonest,‚Äù and a ‚Äúvery good, solid businessman.‚ÄùAt a separate press conference held at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Trump further described Musk as a ""patriot."" He commented on Musk‚Äôs role within the administration, saying:Throughout the interview, Trump and Musk exchanged praise, highlighting their strong working relationship. At one point, Musk openly expressed his support for Trump, saying:Fox News host Sean Hannity, who conducted the interview, remarked on the close relationship between the two, stating:","Elon Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump gave an interview to Fox News on Tuesday.

Meta case, reveal that Meta staffers discussed acquiring copyrighted works through legally questionable means to enhance their AI capabilities.The filings include conversations between Meta employees, such as Melanie Kambadur, a senior manager for Meta's Llama model research team, and Xavier Martinet, a Meta research engineer. In one chat, Martinet suggested acquiring books without proper licensing, stating, ""my opinion would be (in the line of 'ask forgiveness, not for permission'): we try to acquire the books and escalate it to execs so they make the call‚Äù.The discussions also highlighted Meta's internal debates over the legality of using unauthorised copyrighted materials. Martinet argued that many startups were likely using pirated books for training, saying, ""a gazillion startups were probably already using pirated books for training"". Kambadur noted that while using publicly available data required approvals, Meta's lawyers were becoming ""less conservative"" with such approvals.The court documents further reveal that Meta employees considered using Libgen, a platform known for providing access to copyrighted works, despite its legal issues. One employee even shared a Google search result indicating that ""Libgen is not legal‚Äù.These revelations have intensified the legal battle between Meta and the plaintiffs, including authors Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, who claim that Meta used their copyrighted works without permission.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has recently talked about a significant oversight: failing to anticipate the dominance of search as the web's most successful business model, which Google capitalised on, and has said that it is ‚Äúone lesson learned‚Äù for him.‚ÄúWe missed what turned out to be the biggest business model on the web, because we all assumed the web is all about being distributed,‚Äù he said during a recent podcast with Indian YouTuber Dwarkesh Patel.‚ÄúWho would have thought that search would be the biggest winner in organising the web? And so that's where we obviously didn't see it, and Google saw it and executed super well,‚Äù he added.This miscalculation, they admitted, led them to miss out on a massive opportunity, one that Google capitalised on with remarkable success.‚ÄúSo that's one lesson learned for me: you have to not only get the tech trend right, you also have to get where the value is going to be created with that trend. These business model shifts are probably tougher than even the tech trend changes,‚Äù Nadella noted, underscoring the difficulty of predicting how emerging technologies will translate into sustainable and profitable ventures.Nadella explained that he has been a part of four major technological transformations. The first was the shift from mainframes to personal computers and then to client-server architecture.‚ÄúIt was very clear to me. I remember going to what is PDC in '91, in fact I was at Sun at that time. In '91, I went to Moscone. That's when Microsoft first described the Win32 interface and it was pretty clear to me what was going to happen, where the server was also going to be an x86 thing,‚Äù he added.The next major transformation was the emergence of the web, during which the Mosaic browser was released shortly after Nadella joined Microsoft, followed by the Netscape browser .‚ÄúWe had the browser moment, and so we had to adjust. And we did a pretty good job of adjusting to it because the browser was a new app model,‚Äù he added.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has talked about a significant oversight: failing to anticipate the dominance of search as the web's most successful business model. ‚ÄòWe missed what turned out to be the biggest business model on the web, because we all assumed the web is all about being distributed,‚Äô he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118462009,imgsize-19586,width-400,resizemode-4/118462009.jpg"

The selloff was sparked by the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's release of its R1 reasoning model , which reportedly used lower-capability chips for development.The market reaction wiped nearly 20% from Huang's personal net worth, though the company's stock has since recovered most of its losses.

""Obviously, that paradigm is wrong.""The CEO stressed that teaching AI models to reason better remains computationally intensive and represents ""the next scaling frontier"" for the tech sector. This aligns with Nvidia's January statement to Fortune, which highlighted that ""inference requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.""The company maintains that three scaling laws govern AI development: ""pretraining and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.""

Apple removes one of the biggest security features for these users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-removes-one-of-the-biggest-security-features-for-these-users-in-the-uk/articleshow/118462186.cms,"What Apple has to say about removing ADP

What it means for users

Apple, in a significant move, has disabled its most robust encryption feature, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), for new users in the UK. This decision comes in the wake of the UK government ordering Apple to create a backdoor that would allow access to user data.According to a report by Bloomberg, ADP is an optional feature that provides end-to-end encryption for various iCloud data and offers an additional layer of security for sensitive information like device backups, photos, messages, and more.Apple expressed ‚Äúgrave disappointment‚Äù with the situation, emphasising the rising threat of data breaches and the importance of user privacy.‚ÄúWe are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,‚Äù the company said in a statement.‚ÄúADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices,‚Äù it added.This move follows reports that the UK government had demanded Apple build a backdoor into its systems for global user data access under the Investigatory Powers Act, essentially allowing officials to compel companies to remove encryption and prohibits them from disclosing such orders.Apple previously called the bill ‚Äúunprecedented overreach by the government‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe UK could attempt to secretly veto new user protections globally preventing us from ever offering them to customers.‚ÄùApple‚Äôs decision to remove ADP, rather than comply with the backdoor demand, is a direct response to the government‚Äôs order.The company reiterated its commitment to user privacy and security‚ÄúAs we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will,‚Äù Apple added.While existing ADP users have a grace period to disable the feature manually, new users in the UK will not have access to it, raising concerns about user privacy and the potential for increased government surveillance.It also sets a concerning precedent that could encourage other countries to pressure Apple into weakening its security measures, the report says.","Apple has disabled its most robust encryption feature, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), for new users in the UK.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates shared personal insights about his childhood, revealing that he likely would have been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) if he were growing up today, in a recent interview. Gates, one of the most influential figures in the tech industry, discussed his early struggles in school, his extraordinary focus on subjects that engaged him, and the unconventional learning path that ultimately led to the creation of Microsoft. His comments are part of a broader reflection found in Source Code: My Beginnings, the first installment of his memoir trilogy, which explores his early years, his entrepreneurial journey, and the formative experiences that shaped his career.During the interview, Gates described his childhood as one filled with energy and an intense ability to focus‚Äîthough only on topics that captivated him. He recalled how some teachers struggled to categorize him, with some suggesting he skip ahead a grade while others thought he should be held back. Despite these challenges, one thing was clear‚ÄîGates had a natural talent for mathematics.Gates said. He credited his love for learning and problem-solving as key factors that led him toward computer science and software development.Gates‚Äô memoir delves into his early experiments with technology, particularly his high school years, where he and his childhood friend Paul Allen began exploring the potential of computer programming. One of their earliest ventures, Traf-O-Data, was designed to create software for the Altair computer‚Äîan early microcomputer built by Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS).Traf-O-Data laid the foundation for what would eventually become Microsoft in 1975. That year, the fledgling company generated $16,005 in revenue while Gates and Allen earned just $9 per hour. However, their vision extended far beyond a single software product.Gates explained. He believed that hiring the best minds and utilizing cutting-edge tools would allow Microsoft to move faster than its competitors, giving it a strategic edge in the industry.By 1977, Microsoft's growing success gave Gates the confidence to drop out of Harvard University. Two years later, in 1979, he relocated Microsoft to the Seattle area, where the company would grow into one of the most dominant forces in the technology world.Although Gates stepped down as Microsoft's CEO in 2000, the company‚Äôs impact under his leadership remains evident today. The Windows operating system and other software developed during his tenure continue to be central to Microsoft‚Äôs business model. The company, which now generates $212 billion in annual revenue and holds a market value of $3.1 trillion, has solidified its place as a global technology leader. Microsoft‚Äôs success also accounts for a significant portion of Gates' estimated $100 billion fortune.Gates' memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, concludes in 1979, before his personal life‚Äîincluding his 1994 marriage to Melinda French and their 2021 divorce‚Äîbecomes part of the narrative. The book focuses instead on his early experiences, the development of Microsoft, and the challenges he faced in shaping a company that revolutionized the software industry.As Gates continues his philanthropic efforts through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, his reflections on childhood, education, and entrepreneurship offer valuable insights into how unconventional thinking and relentless curiosity can lead to groundbreaking achievements.","Gates' memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, explores his early years, his entrepreneurial journey, and the formative experiences that shaped his career.

"TikTok‚Äôs return ‚Äòcrushes‚Äô Chinese competitors on Apple, Google app stores in US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktoks-return-crushes-chinese-competitors-on-apple-google-app-stores-in-us/articleshow/118456366.cms,"Why was TikTok removed from Apple App Store and Google Play Store

TikTok's reinstatement in US app stores following a temporary ban has negatively impacted Chinese competitors that had gained traction during the platform's absence, according to a recent report. These competitors saw a surge in popularity after TikTok was removed from Apple and Google app stores, but have experienced a decline since TikTok's return.Citing Sensor Tower data, Bloomberg reported that downloads of apps like Xiaohongshu plummeted 91% since TikTok‚Äôs reinstatement five days ago.The Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu, which translates to ""little red book,"" saw a surge in popularity in the US, becoming the most downloaded free app in the Apple App Store on January 15th. This surge occurred despite the platform's predominantly Chinese user base of over 300 million.American users are increasingly turning to Xiaohongshu, with some expressing their disagreement with the US government's concerns about the Chinese ownership of TikTok.TikTok, owned by ByteDance, was temporarily removed from app stores on January 18 due to government pressure to divest the app over national security concerns. This led to a surge in popularity for Chinese rival Xiaohongshu (Red), which gained nearly 500,000 US users.Other platforms like YouTube, Snap, Facebook, and Instagram also saw increased usage during TikTok's absence. However, with TikTok's return to the Apple App Store and Google Play on February 14, the app has reportedly seen more than double its usual download rate, the report said.The app‚Äôs reinstatement followed intervention by President Donald Trump , who provided assurances to TikTok and its partners that they would not face penalties for continued operation. While TikTok's app and website remained accessible during the ban, they were unavailable for download until recently.Prior to the reinstatement, Trump had publicly suggested the possibility of the US government taking a significant stake in TikTok, potentially including a role in content moderation. Numerous parties have expressed interest in acquiring the platform, but no sale has been finalised.","TikTok, owned by ByteDance, was temporarily removed from app stores on January 18 due to government pressure to divest the app over national security concerns.

Google adds Gemini AI-powered features to Gmail



Google has reportedly started rolling out the much-awaited update to Gmail for Android. As reported by 9to5Google, the Gmail users on Android will now be able to create new labels directly within the mobile app. Until now, label creation was restricted only to the web, leaving mobile users with limited organisational tools. But with the latest update (version 2026.01.26.x) the mobile users will also be able to create new labels.As reported by 9to5Google, users can now open the navigation drawer and find a new option labelled ‘Create label’ between ‘manage subscriptions’ and exiting labels. Tapping on it opens a simple interface in which you can enter a new label name. A pill-shaped ‘New’ tag and a circular badge on the hamburger menu indicate that the feature is live.Along with this, Gmail for Android also enable users to delete labels on the go. You can just go to Settings > Gmail address > Notifications> Manage labels. You can easily select and remove labels without the need to switch to desktop.Last month, Google rolled out some AI-powered features in Gmail. The company introduced Search's AI Overviews-like feature for inboxes and an AI Inbox—while the two features are reserved for a selected few , Writing Tools, which have already existed for a while, will now be made available for free to everyone.AI Overviews, which lets you ask Gmail questions in plain English rather than hunting for keywords and the ""AI Inbox"" tab that ditches the traditional chronological email list for a personalized briefing.","Google has reportedly started rolling out the much-awaited update to Gmail for Android.

OpenAI's top researcher Zoe Hitzig has quit. Announcing her resignation on X, formerly Twitter, Hitzig said, ""I resigned from OpenAI on Monday. The same day, they started testing ads in ChatGPT. OpenAI has the most detailed record of private human thought ever assembled. Can we trust them to resist the tidal forces pushing them to abuse it? I wrote about better options for @nytopinion."" Her opinion piece in New York Times is titled, 'OpenAI Is Making the Mistakes Facebook Made. I Quit.'Zoe Hitzig is a Research Scientist at OpenAI and a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows. She received my PhD in economics from Harvard in the year 2023. She holds an M.Phil from the University of Cambridge. ""This week, OpenAI started testing ads on ChatGPT. I also resigned from the company after spending two years as a researcher helping to shape how A.I. models were built and priced, and guiding early safety policies before standards were set in stone,"" is how Hitzig starts her Oped.Hitzig is visibly unhappy with ChatGPT showing ads to its free users. She says though she believes that ads are not immoral or unethical as AI is expensive to run, but she has deep reservations about OpenAI’s strategy.The reason, according to her, is: ""For several years, ChatGPT users have generated an archive of human candor that has no precedent, in part because people believed they were talking to something that had no ulterior agenda. Users are interacting with an adaptive, conversational voice to which they have revealed their most private thoughts. People tell chatbots about their medical fears, their relationship problems, their beliefs about God and the afterlife. Advertising built on that archive creates a potential for manipulating users in ways we don’t have the tools to understand, let alone prevent.""She says that though OpenAI claims that it will adhere to principles for running ads on ChatGPT, she is ""worried subsequent iterations won’t, because the company is building an economic engine that creates strong incentives to override its own rules."" She adds that the erosion of OpenAI’s own principles to maximize engagement may already be underway. ""It’s against company principles to optimize user engagement solely to generate more advertising revenue, but it has been reported that the company already optimizes for daily active users anyway, likely by encouraging the model to be more flattering and sycophantic. This optimization can make users feel more dependent on A.I. for support in their lives. We’ve seen the consequences of dependence, including psychiatrists documenting instances of “chatbot psychosis” and allegations that ChatGPT reinforced suicidal ideation in some users,"" wrote Hitzig.Comparing OpenAI to Facebook, she write, ""In its early years, Facebook promised that users would control their data and be able to vote on policy changes. Those commitments eroded. The company eliminated holding public votes on policy. Privacy changes marketed as giving users more control over their data were found by the Federal Trade Commission to have done the opposite, and in fact made private information public. All of this happened gradually under pressure from an advertising model that rewarded engagement above all else.""In her opinion piece, Hitzig also gives three options/approaches that she says can be used by AI companies to help potentially stop them from manipulating consumers.* One approach is explicit cross subsidies — using profits from one service or customer base to offset losses from another.* A second option is to accept advertising but pair it with real governance — not a blog post of principles, but a binding structure with independent oversight over how personal data is used.* A third approach involves putting users’ data under independent control through a trust or cooperative with a legal duty to act in users’ interests.In conclusion, she writes, ""None of these options are easy. But we still have time to work them out to avoid the two outcomes I fear most: a technology that manipulates the people who use it at no cost, and one that exclusively benefits the few who can afford to use it.""","Zoe Hitzig is a Research Scientist at OpenAI and a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows.

""We're proud of the progress we've made, and we're always working to do better,""

Google-owned YouTube doesn’t consider itself a social media service and claims it isn't addictive. This argument came during the second day of opening statements in a social media addiction trial in the US. The company's lawyers said YouTube is an entertainment platform, more like Netflix than a social network like Facebook, with people using the video streaming app to learn how to cook, knit, and become pop stars rather than endlessly scrolling. While talking about the app's video recommendation algorithm during the trial, Luis Li, YouTube's lawyer, contended,In this case, a 20-year-old California woman identified as K.G.M. has accused YouTube and Meta's Instagram of creating addictive apps that harmed mental health. The trial, in the California Superior Court of Los Angeles, is the first in a series against Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, testing whether social media use can lead to addiction comparable to slot machines at casinos and cigarettes.Teenagers, school districts and states have filed thousands of lawsuits against the tech companies, accusing them of designing their platforms to encourage excessive use. The social media companies have argued that there is no scientific evidence proving that their platforms cause addiction and have pointed to a federal law that protects them from liability for what their users post online. A win by the plaintiff could open the door to monetary damages in similar lawsuits, and judges could order the companies to change their app designs.YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, Facebook parent Meta’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, and Instagram head Adam Mosseri are among the executives expected to testify in the trial.In his opening statements, Mark Lanier, the plaintiff KGM's attorney, claimed that internal documents from YouTube's parent company, Google, referred to features as “He also pointed to Meta documents showing employees had twice said its methods reminded them of those of tobacco companies.He said KGM's case wasNYT reported.YouTube's lawyer Li challenged that the video streaming site was not designed for infinite scrolling.

Despite a significant selloff in software stocks triggered by Anthropic's legal AI tools, they argue AI will enhance, not replace, existing software, enabling greater productivity and innovation.

Nvidia's Huang chimes in with Pichai, calls selloff 'most illogical thing in the world'

What exactly triggered the selloff

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

Why the fear runs deeper than one plugin

Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't buying the panic. During the company's earnings call, Pichai pushed back against the market hysteria triggered by Anthropic's new AI plugins, calling it overblown. AI is ""an enabling tool,"" he said, just as it has been for Google 's own products—Search, YouTube and others. Companies ""seizing the moment"" will find the same opportunity ahead, he added.His comments come as software stocks worldwide nurse heavy losses. Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugins, wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single session. Analysts dubbed it a 'SaaSpocalypse'. Pichai's view? The scramble is overdone.Pichai isn't alone in questioning the market reaction. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was even more direct at a Cisco event, calling the selloff ""the most illogical thing in the world."" His take: AI will use existing software tools, not reinvent them. ""Would you use a screwdriver or invent a new screwdriver?"" he asked. Huang added that Nvidia itself has adopted such tools extensively, freeing up employees to focus on designing chips and computer systems.Software company executives have also pushed back, arguing they do far more than just build code. Their offerings include data management and purpose-built solutions that are difficult to replicate, especially for enterprises outside the tech world like retail and oil and gas.Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its agentic AI assistant for non-technical professionals. Most covered standard enterprise functions—sales, marketing, finance, customer support. But the legal plugin rattled nerves. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings.Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan called it ""a sign of intensifying competition"" that could hurt big players in the legal space. The fallout was swift. Thomson Reuters and RELX both closed down around 15%. LegalZoom crashed nearly 20%. Indian IT stocks weren't spared—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5%, Wipro fell nearly 5%.The concern isn't just about legal workflows. There's a dawning realisation that AI tools can now do far more than most non-techies realise. With relatively simple prompts, they can take over a user's computer, write software, analyse stock market data, manage emails and countless other tasks. People have taken to social media describing how they built their first software program without ever learning to code. Shopify's CEO built software that could interpret his recent MRI.Meta's CFO Susan Li told investors last week that the company has seen a 30% year-over-year increase in output per engineer driven by AI coding tools. Power users have seen an 80% boost.Anthropic's numbers back up the concern. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualised recurring revenue by November, months after launch. The company is reportedly raising $20 billion at a $350 billion valuation. Jefferies noted that OpenAI is losing corporate ground to Claude, with enterprises now making up 80% of Anthropic's business.Pichai and Huang are betting the panic subsides. Wall Street isn't so sure yet.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismiss market panic over AI plugins, calling it overblown.

Oracle’s risky AI bet

Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has now seen an unprecedented $50 billion wiped off his net worth in less than forty days this year, as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison’s fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January. A single-day slump of 5% in Oracle’s stock erased about $9 billion from this wealth, deepening the decline.The round in software stocks was triggered by Anthropic’s release of plugins for its Claude Cowork AI agent, which can easily automate corporate tasks in legal, scales, finance, marketing and data analysis. Investors now fear that such tools could lead to reduction in the demand for external software from established giants such as Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit and Atlassian. Shares of all these companies tumbled earlier this week before staging a particle rebound, but Oracle’s loses remained steep.Ellison was not along in facing the sharp decline in net worth. Along with him, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also saw his net worth fall by around $11 billion, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost around $8 billion. On the other hand, other tech leaders like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang each shed around $5 billion as the stocks of the companies dropped by at least 2%.For those unaware, Oracle has aggressively positioned itself as an important player in the AI boom, the company has signed deals with Nvidia and OpenAI in order to offer data centers powering next-generation technology. However, its heavy spending and increasing debt have raised concerns among analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations — contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue — surged 438% year-over-year to $523 billion as of November 30, nearly ten times its annual revenue of $53 billion.Critics believe that Oracle may be overspending. Popular American investor Michael Burry has publicly bet against Oracle. Burry has warned that the company’s debt-fueled expansion tied to AI contracts was unnecessary, calling the moves “hard to explain” and suggesting that “ego” might be driving decisions.","Ellison's fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January.

Why Microsoft needs a quality czar right now

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre. Charlie Bell, who led the company's security operations since 2021, is stepping down from that role to become what's effectively an engineering quality czar—reporting directly to Nadella.""Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo shared on Wednesday. ""And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!""Bell's replacement? Hayete Gallot, who's returning to Microsoft after an 18-month stint as Google Cloud's President of Customer Experience. She previously spent over 15 years at Redmond, climbing to the rank of corporate vice president across Windows, Office, and security teams.The shift is significant. Bell oversaw a team of roughly 10,000 people and was the driving force behind Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative—a company-wide push launched after Chinese hackers breached US government email accounts through a Microsoft Cloud exploit in 2023. That incident triggered a scathing review from the Department of Homeland Security, which called Microsoft's security culture ""inadequate.Now, Bell will work closely with cloud and AI chief Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on what Nadella calls the ""Quality Excellence Initiative."" The initiative is aimed at delivering ""durable, high-quality experiences at global scale""—corporate speak that likely translates to fewer Azure outages, fewer broken Windows patches, and fewer out-of-band emergency fixes.Gallot's appointment signals a shift in how Microsoft thinks about its security business. Nadella specifically highlighted her ability to combine ""product building with value realization for customers."" She'll also oversee Ales Holecek, who takes on a newly created Chief Architect for Security role.The timing isn't random. During last week's earnings call, Nadella talked up momentum in security products like Security Copilot agents and Purview. The company clearly wants someone who can sell security as aggressively as they build it.Nadella's memo doesn't spell out exactly why engineering quality needs its own dedicated leader at this moment. But the clues aren't hard to find. Microsoft now uses AI to write around 30 percent of its own code, Azure outages remain a recurring headache, and Copilot adoption sits at a modest 3.3 percent among Microsoft 365 users. Bell's got his work cut out.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre.

Why Amazon is shutting down Amazon Go and Fresh stores

Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain. The decision of the company to shut down the Amazon Fresh stores will lead to thousands of job cuts across the US. Last week, the e-commerce major announced that it will close around 60 Fresh stores which will put an end to the effort of six-years. As reported by Business Insider, the WARN notices filed in various states confirm the sale of layoffs. As aper the filling, in California only the company will shut down 20 Fresh stores which will affect around 3,900 workers. Most Fresh locations closed to the public on February 1, though California stores will remain open until mid-March due to state law.As Amazon is shutting down the Fresh stores, it has outlined two main options for the affected employees. The company is giving a choice to the employees in which they can either choose the severance pay or can take transfer within the company. The workers will continue to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after the closure announcement, or until April 28. The compensation offered by the company will be based on either the minimum pay for their employee class of their average hours worked over the past 60 days whichever is higher.The report further adds that employees who do not secure another role within the company by late April will then receive severance packages, calculated as one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh. Workers are guaranteed a minimum of four weeks’ pay, with the possibility of up to 20 weeks depending on tenure.For those seeking to remain within Amazon, the company is encouraging Fresh workers to apply for similar positions at Whole Foods Stores or Amazon grocery warehouse via its internal A to Z portal. An Amazon spokesperson said: “All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we’re providing career transition services to help them explore options.”Amazon Fresh associates typically earned between $16 and $20 per hour, according to data from job site Indeed. Their responsibilities ranged from picking delivery orders to handling checkout operations.Amazon Go and Fresh stores were introduced as Just Walk Out technology, but they struggled to establish a distinctive customer experience and sustainable economic model. On the other hand, Whole Food Market acquired in 2017 by Amazon say strong growth with sales rising more than 40% in recent years.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s academic background and early career path



Dario Amodei’s rise at OpenAI and the birth of GPT models



Dario Amodei leaves OpenAI and builds Anthropic



Dario Amodei’s cautious leadership style



Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now. He is not a loud public figure, and he rarely chases attention, but his work has quietly shaped how modern AI systems are built and controlled. Before running a multi-billion-dollar company, Amodei spent years in labs and research roles, studying complex systems and how they behave under pressure. That background still shows in how he talks about artificial intelligence today. While others focus on speed and scale, he appears more concerned with safety, limits, and long-term risks. As AI moves faster than regulation, Amodei’s cautious approach is becoming harder to ignore.Before AI became the world’s favourite buzzword, Amodei was deep in academia. He studied physics at Stanford University and later earned a PhD in biophysics from Princeton. At the time, he was focused on understanding complex biological systems. Cells. Signals. Patterns that emerge rather than being designed. Looking back, that mindset fits AI almost too well.After completing his doctorate, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine.There was no clear path to becoming a tech billionaire. That part came later. Almost accidentally, it seems. Amodei eventually moved into machine learning research, joining companies like Baidu and Google Brain. At Google, he worked on neural networks and AI safety.Colleagues from that period say he already seemed concerned about failure modes. In 2016, he joined OpenAI. Things moved fast after that.At OpenAI, Amodei rose quickly. By 2019, he was Vice President of Research, helping set the organisation’s overall research direction. He led work on GPT-2 and GPT-3, models that changed public perception of AI almost overnight.These systems could write essays, answer questions, and even mimic conversation. Sometimes convincingly. Sometimes awkwardly. During this time, Amodei also co-invented reinforcement learning from human feedback. RLHF sounds technical, but the idea is simple. Teach AI systems by showing them what humans actually prefer, not just what scores well mathematically.In 2021, Amodei left OpenAI along with six others, including his sister Daniela Amodei. They founded Anthropic. Some people were sceptical at first. But Anthropic took a different route. It became a public benefit corporation. That detail mattered. It signalled that profit would not be the only priority. At least in theory. Their AI model, Claude, leaned into being cautious. Less dramatic. More restrained. That tone appealed to companies worried about reputational risk.By September 2025, Anthropic was reportedly valued at $183 billion by private investors. That number raised eyebrows. Especially for a company without much public hype.Partnerships with Alphabet and Amazon helped fuel that growth. So did rising concerns about AI safety across governments and corporations. As Anthropic’s valuation climbed, so did Amodei’s wealth. His real-time net worth now sits around $3.7 billion, ranking among the world’s richest people.Amodei does not sound like most tech CEOs. He hedges. A lot. “It seems.” “It might.” “We’re not fully sure yet.” That language annoys some people. Others trust it more. He avoids grand predictions. No promises of utopia. No claims that AI will solve everything.Experts say his influence shows up in quieter ways. Safety research is becoming mainstream. Alignment discussions moving from fringe to boardroom. Competitors are copying ideas they once ignored. No one really knows what comes next for Dario Amodei. AI is moving fast. Faster than regulation.","Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now.

'OpenAI deal is eating Oracle alive financially'

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

US banks are pulling back—and that's a big problem

A possible Cerner sale and 40% upfront customer deposits show how tight things have gotten

Oracle is staring down the possibility of its largest-ever workforce reduction—and at the heart of it is a $300 billion partnership with OpenAI that's proving far more expensive than anyone initially let on.Investment bank TD Cowen reported this week that Oracle is weighing cuts of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs. The move would free up an estimated $8 to $10 billion in cash flow, money the company desperately needs as it tries to bankroll a sprawling network of AI data centers built largely to serve Sam Altman 's company.TD Cowen puts the OpenAI commitment alone at around $156 billion in capital spending—and roughly 3 million GPUs to back it up. Oracle has already burned through $58 billion in debt in just two months. That's $38 billion for data centers in Texas and Wisconsin, $20 billion for a campus in New Mexico. Total debt now sits north of $100 billion.The kicker? That $58 billion covers only a slice of what's actually needed. Since its September 2025 peak, Oracle's stock has shed more than half its value—about $463 billion in market cap, gone.The financing crunch isn't just an Oracle internal issue anymore.Multiple US banks have quietly retreated from lending on Oracle-linked data center projects. TD Cowen noted that lenders have roughly doubled the interest rate premiums they charge Oracle since September, pushing borrowing costs into territory usually reserved for junk-rated companies.The result? Several data center leases Oracle had been negotiating simply stalled. Private operators couldn't get the funding to build, which means Oracle can't deliver the capacity its customers—especially OpenAI—are counting on. Some Asian banks are still willing to step in, but that doesn't solve the immediate problem in the US, where most of Oracle's expansion is planned.Oracle isn't sitting idle. The company is now requiring new customers to pay up to 40% of contract value upfront—essentially asking clients to co-fund the infrastructure. It's also exploring ""bring your own chip"" arrangements, where customers supply their own hardware.On the table too is a potential sale of Cerner, the healthcare software unit Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in 2022. That would be a significant strategic pivot, signaling that AI infrastructure is now the clear priority—everything else is up for grabs.TD Cowen also flagged that OpenAI has already begun shifting some near-term capacity needs over to Microsoft and Amazon, which is not exactly a vote of confidence in Oracle's ability to deliver on schedule.The company has not publicly commented on the layoff reports or the financing difficulties.","Oracle faces massive job cuts, potentially 20,000-30,000, to fund its costly $300 billion OpenAI partnership.

"Egypt bans Roblox nationwide over child safety concerns, raising global questions about kids' online freedom",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/egypt-bans-roblox-nationwide-over-child-safety-concerns-raising-global-questions-about-kids-online-freedom/articleshow/127935398.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Roblox faces a government ban in Egypt: Here’s why



What this ban means for kids and parents



Roblox going dark in Egypt, the platform that lives almost entirely on screens, the sudden loss felt very real. With games loading, Avatars running around blocky worlds. And then Egypt has officially banned Roblox, saying the move is about protecting children from harmful online content. The story underneath feels layered, political, and a little messy. Roblox looks harmless on the surface but experts say the risk is not the visuals but the interaction. The platform allows users to create games, chat with strangers, and move freely between user-generated worlds.A spokesperson confirmed the company has reached out to Egyptian authorities, offering dialogue to resolve the issue and restore access. The company says it has worked with regulators in other regions to build localised safety systems that align with cultural values. Last year, the company restricted some features across parts of the Middle East to address safety concerns. This ban did not come out of nowhere. Roblox has already been blocked or restricted in countries like Qatar and Turkey with other nations watching closely.The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.According to state-run media, the ban will be coordinated with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. That means internet providers are expected to block access nationwide with no single official explanation was released at first. Later, state outlets pointed to growing concerns about children’s exposure to inappropriate content, online interactions, and psychological risks as reported by Bloomberg. An Egyptian senator had already called for regulating Roblox to protect children’s moral and educational values.President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi recently called for limits on children’s phone use, pointing to similar moves abroad. Australia has banned social media for certain age groups. France is moving in the same direction. Egypt’s parliament is now discussing broader rules for digital platforms including unified age classifications, stronger verification, penalties and possibly forcing companies to have local representatives inside the country.For children, the ban feels abrupt and confusing. For parents, reactions are mixed. Some welcome the move, while others worry it pushes kids toward less visible, less regulated platforms, potentially exposing them to more risks. That is the irony experts often point out. When one door closes, another usually opens. Sometimes darker, more unpredictable, and harder to monitor.Still, supporters of the ban argue that Roblox’s scale makes it different. Millions of users. Constant interaction. Endless content that cannot realistically be watched, moderated, or controlled by humans alone, leaving significant safety and privacy concerns for young players and families.","The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive.

What is Phishing: How to spot and stop this common online fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-is-phishing-how-to-spot-and-stop-this-common-online-fraud/articleshow/128220101.cms,"What is Phishing

Free phone or empty Bank Account: New scam alert

What is phishing and how it works

Different types of phishing attacks

Email phishing: This is the most common type. Attackers send bulk emails pretending to be banks, social media companies, tax authorities or online retailers. The goal is to trick recipients into clicking a fake link.

Spear phishing: Spear phishing targets specific individuals or organisations. Instead of a general message, attackers personalise the email using the victim’s name, job title or company details. According to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report, targeted phishing attacks are a leading cause of corporate security incidents.

Smishing: Smishing is phishing conducted through SMS messages. In India, fraudulent text messages often claim that a bank account will be frozen unless a link is clicked. CERT-In has warned users about such mobile-based scams.

Vishing: Vishing involves phone calls. Attackers pretend to be customer care agents, tax officials or law enforcement officers. They may ask for one-time passwords or banking details. Banking authorities have repeatedly warned that banks never ask for OTPs over phone calls.

Clone phishing: In clone phishing, a legitimate email is copied and resent with a malicious link replacing the original attachment or link. Because the email appears familiar, victims are more likely to trust it.

Why phishing works

Warning signs of a phishing attacks

You should be suspicious of requests for personal information that come out of the blue. Real banks and government agencies will never ask you for your password or OTP through email or text message.

Generic greetings, like ""Dear Customer"" instead of a specific name, can be a sign of a lot of phishing attempts.

It's common for domain names to be spelled wrong. A fake website, for instance, might change a letter in the domain name to make it look like the real one.

Bad grammar or strange wording could be a sign of fraud, but modern phishing attempts are getting better.

People who want to stop victims from thinking clearly often use urgent threats that require immediate action.

How to protect yourself from phishing

Don't click on links that look suspicious. If you get an email that looks like it's from your bank, don't click on the link. Instead, open the official banking app or type the website address into your browser.

Whenever you can, turn on two-factor authentication. Even if a password is stolen, the second verification step can prevent unauthorised access.

Keep software updated. Security updates patch vulnerabilities that attackers exploit.

Use filters for spam. Most email services automatically filter out messages that look suspicious.

Educate family members. Elderly users and teenagers are often targeted due to a lack of awareness.

Report phishing attempts.

How organisations can reduce phishing risk

Training employees is very important. Regular training sessions help employees spot emails that look suspicious.

Using email authentication standards can help cut down on fake emails. These technical steps check that the sender is who they say they are.

You can find malicious activity early by using endpoint security software and intrusion detection systems.

If credentials are stolen, limiting administrative access makes it less likely that damage will be done.

The internet has changed how people work, shop, bank and stay in touch. Bills are paid online. Salaries are credited digitally. Government services are accessed through apps. Emails carry office documents. Social media connects families across continents. But along with convenience has come risk. Cybercrime has grown steadily over the past decade, and one of the most common methods used by criminals is ‘phishing’.Phishing is not a new threat. It has existed since the early days of email. Yet it continues to succeed because it does not rely on complex hacking tools. Instead, it targets human behaviour. It uses fear, curiosity, trust, or a sense of urgency. A fake link can show passwords, bank account numbers, or personal information with just one click.You need to know what phishing is now. It is a basic skill for living in the digital age. This article talks about what phishing is, how it works, the different types, real-world examples, warning signs, and how people and businesses can protect themselves.Phishing is a type of cybercrime in which criminals pretend to be someone or something trustworthy in order to get people to give them private information.This information could be passwords, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, Aadhaar numbers, one-time passwords, login information, or other private information.Phishing comes from the word ""fishing."" Attackers send out a lot of emails, texts, or fake websites in the hopes that someone will fall for their trap. Phishing doesn't steal information directly through technical breaches; instead, it tricks people into giving it away.Phishing attacks usually involve fake messages that look like they come from reliable sources. These messages are meant to steal information or put harmful software on your computer.Phishing always happens in the same way. The attacker first makes a fake message. This message often looks like it came from a bank, a delivery service, the government, your job, or a well-known online service. It could warn you about a blocked account, an unpaid bill, suspicious activity, or a request for urgent verification.Second, the message has an attachment or link in it. The link takes you to a fake website that looks a lot like the real one. Logos, colours and layouts are copied to appear genuine.Third, the victim enters personal information. Once login details or payment data are entered, the information goes directly to the attacker.In some cases, clicking on a bad link could install malware that records keystrokes or lets criminals access a device from afar.Phishing emails often make you feel like you need to act right away. For instance, a message might say that an account will be closed in 24 hours if no action is taken right away.Phishing is not limited to email. Criminals constantly adapt their methods. Below are the different types of phishing attacks that one needs to be careful of:Phishing works because it targets human psychology. Criminals create fear by claiming suspicious transactions have occurred. They create urgency by saying accounts will be suspended. They create excitement by promising lottery winnings or refunds.Many people assume that if an email includes official logos or appears professionally written, it must be legitimate. Attackers exploit this trust.Phishing also succeeds because people often access email on mobile devices, where URLs are harder to examine carefully.Even though phishing emails may look real, they often have warning signs that are as follows:To stay safe, you need to be aware and follow some basic digital hygiene rules. To keep yourself safe from phishing, follow these steps:Because one employee's mistake can expose company systems, organizations are at greater risk.

"ChatGPT-maker OpenAI launches Teen Safety Blueprint for India, focuses on 'safety' over 'privacy'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-maker-openai-launches-teen-safety-blueprint-for-india-what-is-says-and-steps-company-is-taking-to-protect-kids/articleshow/128219301.cms,"Dangers Of AI: Is ChatGPT Quietly Harming Your Mental Health? | Global Pulse

‘Treating teens like teens’

At a time when AI companies are under pressure to offer safe chatbot conversation experiences to kids, OpenAI , the company behind ChatGPT, has released safety blueprint for teens in India. The company emphasises that it aims to keep safety over privacy for younger users. “We're taking steps to strengthen protections for Indian teens through age prediction, age-appropriate policies, and parental controls, informed by conversations with policymakers, regulators, educators, and child safety experts, as well as mental health and digital well-being practitioners,” the company says in the report.According to OpenAI, the new protections come in addition to features already available for all users. These include in-app reminders during long sessions to encourage breaks; safeguards that direct users to real-world resources if the company’s systems detect they have expressed suicidal intent. The company also offers “ways to escalate risks of physical harm to others for human reviewers who can take action; and industry-leading prevention of Al-generated child sexual abuse material (SAM) and child sexual exploitation material (CSEM).In particular, we constantly improve our CSAM/CSEM detection methods and report confirmed CSAM to relevant authorities.”OpenAI claims that it aims to ensure that all teens using Al receive age-appropriate protections by default, and that parents and educators can deploy additional protections to personalize how teens use Al.OpenAI’s blueprint acknowledges a hurdle unique to the Indian market: the prevalence of shared technology. According to the RATI Foundation’s Ideal Internet Report 2024-25, approximately 62% of Indian teens access the internet via shared family devices.The core of the new framework is the concept of “age-aware AI behaviour.” OpenAI argues that AI responses should not be “one-size-fits-all,” advocating for a system where ChatGPT recognises the developmental stage of the user.“We believe that Al companies should identify teens on their platforms using privacy-protective, risk-based age estimation tools to distinguish between teens and adults. These tools should minimize the collection of sensitive personal data, while still effectively distinguishing users under the age of 18 (U18). Where possible, these methods might also rely on operating systems or app stores to determine a user's age,” the company says.Furthermore, the framework introduces enhanced Parental Controls, allowing parents to link accounts, set “blackout hours” for AI usage, and remotely disable chat history and memory features.","OpenAI has released safety blueprint for teens in India.

Changing digital advertising and commerce in 2026: 5 ways Google aims to use AI to make shopping easier for consumers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/changing-digital-advertising-and-commerce-in-2026-5-ways-google-aims-to-use-ai-to-make-shopping-easier-for-consumers/articleshow/128219245.cms,"Historically, consumers have faced a necessary trade-off: buy quickly and risk getting it wrong, or spend hours researching to get it right.

We’re seeing that trade-off disappear.

Consumers are continuing to search, scroll, stream and shop — and now, AI is proving that speed and certainty can go hand in hand. It’s an expansionary moment for businesses and consumers alike that requires a new playbook.

In 2026, we’re reimagining commercial experiences to be fluid, assistive and personal, so businesses can build confidence from the start.

Turning influence into impact on YouTube

As the #1 most-watched streaming platform in the U.S. for nearly three years 1 , YouTube is fueling discovery — whether people are watching #GRWM Shorts, their favorite podcasts or big moments like the Olympics. Creators on YouTube are today’s most trusted tastemakers 2 , and these relationships can help consumers move from “just looking” to “just got it” faster.

In 2026, we’re building stronger connections between brands and creators. We’ve started down this path with open call, exploring new ways for advertisers to source creator partnerships. This year, we’re taking it even further: using AI to deeply understand content and audiences, and instantly matching brands with the creator communities that will love their products. This turns creators’ organic influence into real business impact.

Reinventing ads for the new era of Search

Search is no longer limited to keywords — more and more, people are brainstorming, snapping photos and asking questions conversationally. In 2026, this shift is turning Search into a more powerful tool for discovery, where ads can inspire and answer all at once. We aren't just bringing ads to AI experiences in Search; we are reinventing what an ad is.

Take AI Mode

, for example: It offers new opportunities for businesses to fit naturally into the conversation. That’s why we’ve spent the past year testing new ad formats that bridge inspiration and action. Our research has shown that AI Mode provides a more helpful shopping experience when users can easily compare a variety of brands and stores. 3

AI Mode already surfaces organic shopping recommendations based on what’s most relevant to a query. Now, we’re testing a new ad format to showcase retailers that offer those products, clearly marked as sponsored. This new format helps shoppers easily find convenient buying options, and offers retailers the opportunity to show up in these key moments of consideration. We are testing similar formats in categories beyond retail, like travel, to help people find relevant products and services.

We also recently introduced a new monetization experience in AI Mode, Direct Offers, to help brands stand out in the moment that matters. Direct Offers allow businesses to share a tailored offer with a shopper who is ready to buy to help close the sale, without changing what they offer everyone else. We will expand these to include special offers that go beyond price to value, like loyalty benefits and product bundles.

Unlocking the future of agentic commerce

In 2026, agentic commerce is no longer just a concept, it’s reality. It will transform how we shop, from discovery to decision, while helping brands differentiate themselves.

Our goal is twofold: One, remove the gruntwork of shopping so consumers can focus on the fun parts. Two, work hand-in-hand with the industry on the building blocks needed to make agentic commerce seamless and secure.

This is why we launched the Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) in 2025, and built on it with the introduction of the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) last month. UCP standardizes how businesses connect with AI agents across the entire shopping journey, including the critical step of enabling secure digital identity and payments. In the weeks following the launch, we've received tremendous interest from hundreds of top tech companies, payments partners and retailers interested in integrating it. It’s already improving shopping experiences on Google. In fact, UCP-powered checkout is rolling out now, letting US shoppers buy items from Etsy and Wayfair, right in AI Mode in Search and the

Gemini

app (with Shopify, Target, and Walmart coming soon).

UCP’s potential extends far beyond retail. It’s helping to lay the foundation for a future where all commercial experiences can be seamless and agentic.

Accelerating growth with Gemini 3

During this time of transformation, businesses need tools that can keep up. Last year, we delivered a decade's worth of innovation in 12 months, culminating in the arrival of our most intelligent model to date, Gemini 3. Gemini underpins our ad tools — and as the models improve, our products improve, without customers needing to change anything.

In 2026, our Gemini-powered ad tools will drive even more growth through creativity, performance and ultimately real business impact.

It starts with creativity: taking imagination and turning it into action with tools like

Nano Banana

, and now Veo 3, in Google Ads Asset Studio. This is helping advertisers produce studio-quality work in minutes, effectively making AI a real-time creative partner for businesses. Adoption is accelerating, proving that generative media is now a scalable reality: In 2025, we saw a 3x increase in Gemini-generated assets created by advertisers, and in Q4 alone, Gemini was used to generate nearly 70 million creative assets in AI

Max

and Performance Max. 4

But great creative is meaningless if it doesn’t show up at the right moment. AI-powered campaigns help advertisers adapt as experiences evolve. Building on our campaigns, last year, we introduced AI Max to power performance and expand the reach of advertisers' Search campaigns. It is already unlocking billions of net-new searches that these advertisers weren’t reaching before. 5

Paramount Skydance has made another offer to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WB). The company has revised its bid by adding a $2.8 billion payment to Netflix if the deal falls through. The company, led by Oracle founder Larry Ellison’s son, David Ellison , has also promised to make quarterly shareholder payments that increase each quarter after January 1, 2027, only if the deal does not close. This comes after Paramount made a hostile takeover bid to acquire WB after the company’s board rejected its offer and recommended that shareholders stick to Netflix’s offer. In December 2025, the streaming giant placed a bid to acquire WB and its assets for nearly $82 billion.The cash offer remains at $30 per share. Still, the new terms include a quarterly payment of 25 cents per share to shareholders, which Paramount said would be worth about $650 million and would remove Warner's $1.5 billion financing cost tied to its debt exchange offer.According to an LA Times report, the changes may not convince WBD's board, which has backed a competing offer from Netflix. The report claims that Paramount sent the updated offer to the WBD board and said it was willing to continue talks.Paramount said the company would help Warner refinance its $15 billion bridge loan. The revised offer is funded by $43.6 billion in equity from the Ellison family and RedBird Capital Partners, plus $54 billion in debt from Apollo, Bank of America, and Citigroup. The offer also includes a personal guarantee of $43.3 billion from David Ellison's father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.As per the report, Ellison said the new additions to Paramount's bid “underscore our strong and unwavering commitment to delivering the full value [Warner Bros.

Impact of social media on mental health and tips to take care of yourself

Meta has defended its position

In a first, Instagram head Adam Mosseri is scheduled to take the stand on Wednesday (February 11) to face intense questioning in case regarding whether the app’s design is a driver of the youth mental health crisis. Mosseri will testify in open court during a trial centred on allegations that the platform’s algorithms intentionally fuel “social media addiction.”The trial focuses on the allegations by a 20-year-old California woman, identified in court filings as K.G.M., that Instagram’s algorithm is attention-grabbing which led to addiction during her formative years. Central to her deposition is the “endless scroll” feature, wherein a user can continuously watch content without any natural “stop point”.K.G.M. testified that this feature kept her trapped in a cycle of consumption that directly contributed to her severe anxiety and depression. The plaintiffs’ attorneys are expected to confront Mosseri with internal Meta documents that they claim show the company was well aware of the psychological toll Instagram took on minors.Meta has remained firm in its defense.“We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,” a Meta spokesperson stated ahead of the testimony.The company’s lawyers claim that the internal discussions regarding these harms were part of an effort by the company to build better safety features, and are not a proof of negligence.Mossari’s appearance is expected to be be followed by a testimony from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is slated to appear in the coming weeks as part of the same high-stakes litigation.Meanwhile, the plaintiff's legal team has highlighted a recent Meta study which reportedly indicates that teenagers facing existing life difficulties are the most vulnerable to platform addiction. Moreover, K.G.M’s claims are supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which issued a warning in January stating that ‘addictive’ features make it significantly harder for children to “disengage from digital devices. ”",Adam Mosseri will testify in open court during a trial centred on allegations that the platform’s algorithms intentionally fuel ‘social media addiction’ The plaintiffs’ attorneys are expected to confront Mosseri with internal Meta documents that they claim show the company was well aware of the psychological toll Instagram took on minors.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128214869,imgsize-620682,width-400,resizemode-4/instagram-ceo-adam-mosseri.jpg"
"Facing ban and backlash, Microsoft plans to rewire data centres and on the way solve every American technology company's 'big' AI problem",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facing-ban-and-backlash-microsoft-plans-to-rewire-data-centres-and-on-the-way-solve-every-american-technology-companys-big-ai-problem/articleshow/128214571.cms,"“Microsoft is exploring how this technology could make electrical grids stronger and reduce the impact data centres have on nearby communities.”

How can this technology improve the efficiency of Microsoft and other data centres



“That actually helped the supply chain and manufacturer variety, and even some of the costing of HTS … for us to, like, oh, 'Well, let's think about that. Now things have changed a little bit,”

How Microsoft is planning to use HTS cables in its data centres



Microsoft has announced plans to redesign its data centres using high-temperature superconductors (HTS). These materials, through which electricity flows without resistance, appear meant to calm rising fears about the power needs and facilities of AI. They could minimise the physical space required by data centres and the electricity transmission cables supplying them power, which may reduce the backlash against AI. This comes as tech companies face criticism for the substantial energy requirements of generative AI, delays in connecting to power grids due to inadequate infrastructure, and the local impacts of new data centre construction.Recently, Microsoft also announced its plans to scale back data centre expansion in the US and Europe. The company cancelled or delayed projects representing roughly 2 GW of capacity due to oversupply concerns and shifting AI demand. The pullback came after US President Donald Trump announced a partnership with tech companies to ensure data centres do not drive up electricity bills, naming Microsoft as the first company on board.Microsoft President Brad Smith described Microsoft’s plans at an event near the White House in October 2025.In his speech, Brad stated that the idea aims to minimise water consumption while guaranteeing that Microsoft’s electric power does not influence people’s bills. He added that in towns where Microsoft has data centres, the company would pay its property taxes and accept neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts.In a recent blog post, Alistair Speirs, Microsoft GM of Global Infrastructure Marketing, wrote,Current data centres and energy infrastructure rely on copper wires to conduct electricity. However, HTS cables conduct electrical current with zero resistance, reducing energy loss and enabling lighter, more compact cables. HTS is already used in MRI machines and, more recently, in short stretches of power lines in dense metropolitan areas, including Paris and Chicago.Their use has been limited in part because HTS cables are more complex and expensive to integrate into energy systems than copper cables. To achieve zero resistance, HTS cables must be cooled to low temperatures, likely using liquid nitrogen.The HTS ""tape"" used to form superconducting cables is typically made of rare-earth barium copper oxide. While a superconducting cable requires only a small amount of rare-earth material, the supply chain for the rare-earth element remains largely concentrated in China. Increasing manufacturing capacity for this tape to a level that makes it affordable poses an additional challenge, experts say.That is starting to change due to the power demands of generative AI. In recent years, tech companies have fuelled research into nuclear fusion power, and much of the HTS tape that is currently manufactured is used in fusion research. Growth in that area has helped lower material costs.says Husam Alissa, director of systems technology at Microsoft.Microsoft is primarily interested in using HTS in two ways, according to Alissa. Within a data centre, smaller cables would enable greater flexibility in how electrical rooms and hardware racks are laid out. With funding from Microsoft, Massachusetts-based superconducting company VEIR demonstrated last year that HTS cables at a data centre could deliver the same power while reducing cable dimensions and weight by about 10x compared to conventional alternatives.Outside the data centre, Microsoft is open to working with energy companies to support the buildout of long-distance power lines using HTS. Expanding transmission lines has been a bottleneck in updating the power grid, connecting data centres, and building out additional power supply, with approvals for such infrastructure across multiple jurisdictions often taking considerable time.With power lines made of HTS, the space required could shrink. While overhead transmission lines may require an area of approximately 70 metres in width, superconducting cables may require only 2 metres of clearance, according to the Microsoft blog, reducing construction time and costs.Additional interest in HTS for data centres could also enable fusion companies to procure more of the material at lower cost, helping advance nuclear fusion technology. Microsoft has separately reached a deal with another company developing a fusion power plant in Washington state.","Microsoft has announced plans to redesign its data centres using high- temperature superconductors (HTS) These materials, through which electricity flows without resistance, appear meant to calm rising fears about the power needs and facilities of AI.

‘Mystery’ Jony Ive AI device reveal vs shipping

The ‘io’ name is dead

OpenAI’s secret device: What we know so far

The mystery surrounding OpenAI ’s foray into an AI-powered physical hardware may have been partially lifted as the company has provided a significant update to the project's timeline. The ChatGPT-maker has confirmed that its highly anticipated AI device, which is being developed in collaboration with former Apple design chief Jony Ive, will not reach the hands of consumers until at least February 2027.According to a report by Business Insider, the revelation surfaced in a sworn statement by Peter Welinder, OpenAI’s vice president and general manager, as part of a court filing on Monday (February 9). The admission came amid a legal battle with the startup Iyo, which sued OpenAI last year over the “io” trademark.While the shipping date has been pushed to early 2027, the public “reveal” of the device may still be closer than it appears. Speaking at Axios House Davos last month, OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer, Chris Lehane, confirmed that the company is “on track” for a product unveiling in the second half of 2026.“We are looking at something in the latter part [of 2026],” Lehane told Axios, noting that while this is the most likely timeline, “we will see how things advance.”A major pivot in the project’s branding was also confirmed in the recent filing. OpenAI’s legal team stated that the company has officially abandoned plans to use the “io” name for any forthcoming hardware. This decision follows a temporary restraining order issued June last year that forced OpenAI to scrub mentions of the “io” partnership and promotional videos from its website.The lawyers noted that OpenAI has “reevaluated the branding... in light of OpenAI's existing brands,” and will not use the contested name for marketing or the sale of any AI-enabled hardware. The lawyers also argued that a scheduled preliminary injunction hearing in April 2026 is now “unnecessary.”OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been vocal about his desire to move beyond the traditional smartphone era. Previously, he described the upcoming device as a “radical departure” from current mobile technology, and even labeling the experience as “peaceful.” Altman has also hinted that users will likely be “shocked” by the device's simplicity.Industry speculation suggests the hardware will be a screenless, wearable form factor controlled almost entirely through voice, sound and gesture. Rumour mill says that designs have ranged from a “Pin” or Brooch, advanced earbuds and even a high-tech pen or glasses.","ChatGPT-maker has confirmed that its highly anticipated AI device, which is being developed in collaboration with former Apple design chief Jony Ive, will not reach the hands of consumers until at least February 2027.

""a diverse range of payment methods can genuinely become options.""

What Japanese companies said about Apple ecosystem commissions



More than 600 Japanese companies are reportedly calling on Apple and Google to eliminate commissions on app purchases. A report claims that these companies have argued that the fees make external payment options unviable following Japan's Mobile Software Competition Law, which is set to take effect in December.According to a report by The Japan Times, seven IT-related industry groups, including the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association, have issued a joint statement saying the burden of commissions is so heavy that directing users to external payment sites ""has not become a viable option.""Before the law took effect, in-app sales were subject to a commission of up to 30%. Apple and Google responded to the new law by allowing out-of-app billing but charging commissions of 15%-20% on revenue generated from external sites.The groups are seeking treatment similar to what Epic Games secured in the United States, where an injunction forced Apple to allow external payments without collecting a commission.Developers in Japan said Apple's current alternative payment setup hasto use the newly permitted payment methods, with fees ranging from 5% to 21% that, when combined with credit card processing fees, can be as costly as Apple's built-in system. They urged the creation of a market in whichThe Japanese groups also argued that similar payment methods are offered free of charge in the US, accusing Apple and Google of placing Japan's consumers and businesses at a disadvantage compared to those in the United States.In January, one of the seven groups, the Mobile Content Forum, had already issued a written statement criticising Apple and Google's approach. The seven groups collectively include more than 600 companies and organisations, such as major IT firms, game companies and software developers. With the joint statement, calls for improvement are spreading across the broader IT industry.Attention will turn to how the Japan Fair Trade Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the new law, will respond.Apart from Japan, developers in the EU have made similar demands to Apple. In December 2025, a coalition of developers petitioned the European Commission, saying Apple's revised App Store fees continued to disadvantage EU apps.A group of 20 European app makers and consumer bodies filed a petition to the European Commission to lower Apple’s commissions. They argued that the fees disadvantage their apps compared to competing apps in the US.","More than 600 Japanese companies are reportedly calling on Apple and Google to eliminate commissions on app purchases.

In March 2026, it will be a year since America's biggest bank made 5-day work from office compulsory. The largest US bank, which employs more than 300,000 people globally, told all of its employees to return to the office five days a week starting in March, ending a hybrid work-from-home policy that took effect during the pandemic. Just days after CEO Jamie Dimon's order to all employees to come into the office five days a week, a petition surfaced. The petition, which was part of complaints over JP Morgan's call to bring employees back to office 5 days a week, asked CEO Dimon to reverse the change. The petition that continues to be live online is addressed to chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. In the petition, employees have complained about losing hybrid working arrangements. ""Some employees sought advice from the Communications Workers of America on how they might set up a labor union, a rare thing in the US finance sector.And now a year since the petition was set up, it has about 2,000 signatories out of the Bank's more than 300,000 global employees. According to a report in Financial Times, there are some who believe that signing the petition will be a ‘career suicide’. The report details internal backlash to the 5-day mandate.As per the report, employees at the America's largest lender told the Financial Times they were bewildered by management’s insistence on a full-time return to company offices, though teams are scattered across the globe. “My team is spread out through two continents and three time zones,” said a JPMorgan employee who signed a petition to bring back hybrid work. “JPMorgan is a global company — why can’t that include my home office?” “Hybrid is working and employees love the happy medium,” the staffer told the FT. ""We, the workers of JPMorganChase (JPMC), are concerned about the future of our workplace - its integrity, employee satisfaction, and the increasing toxicity that has metastasized in our company culture in the last couple of months,"" reads the petition.Dimon announced the five-day return to office policy on January 10, 2025, ahead of a March 2025 start date. Soon after announcing the change, Dimon went viral for angry outburst he had about the employee petition during a Town Hall meeting. When asked about the in-person work policy during the staff meeting, he said, ""Don't waste time on it. I don't care how many people sign that fucking petition,"" he said, drawing some laughter. Instead, Dimon demanded more efficiency and stressed employees have a choice whether to work at JPMorgan. The CEO told them not to be mad at him, and said it was a free country.Dimon, who has run the lender for 19 years, said some staff did not pay attention during Zoom meetings, which reduced their efficiency and creativity. In-office requirements will not be left up to managers, Dimon said. ""There is no chance that I will leave it up to managers,"" he said. ""Zero chance. The abuse that took place is extraordinary.""In an interview to CNBC, Dimon said, that he respects employees who don't want to come into the office five days a week, but said the policy will not change because it is best for clients and the company. ""I am not against working from home, I am against where it doesn't work,"" he said, adding that 10% of the bank's jobs are done remotely.Later in the year, in an interview to Bloomberg, Dimon said that he also understands the appeal of logging in from home; remote work can pan out well for some companies and certain roles. Talking about his angry response to a question on work from home, he said, “I gave a very detailed answer about why [work from home] doesn’t work for young people, why it doesn’t work for management, why it doesn’t work for innovation,” Dimon said. “I completely applaud your right to not want to go to the office every day. But you’re not going to tell JPMorgan what to do.”","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon ordered all employees to return to the office five days a week starting in March 2025.

"After Sam Altman calls Anthropic’s ads ‘clearly dishonest’, company's executive says: We are not even …",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-sam-altman-calls-anthropics-ads-clearly-dishonest-companys-executive-says-we-are-not-even-/articleshow/128207808.cms,"Why OpenAI leadership is unhappy with Anthropic’s ads



Anthropic’s chief commercial officer talks about infrastructure ‘wars’



Days after OpenAI CEO Sam Atlman criticised Anthropic’s Super Bowl ads targeting ChatGPT, the Claude-maker’s commercial chief has issued a rebuttal, escalating the public ‘war of words’ between two of the world’s leading AI companies. Responding to the criticism, Anthropic’s chief commercial officer Gary Smith defended the company’s “unconflicted” business model. The dispute centres on Anthropic’s ad campaign, which mocked ChatGPT’s ad placement while announcing “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.”In an interview with CNBC, Smith said Anthropic is “unconflicted” by not offering ads, as it focuses on selling its AI to businesses.“We’re not fighting another partner for eyeballs or for ad revenue or anything. Our focus is on model quality, model efficacy, how it can integrate across the wider enterprise, which comes back to all of the investments that we’re really focused on... we are exclusively focused on a different set of things. Our attention is not split,” he said.Smith also said that it was the company’s “conscious decision” not to include ads in Claude, adding that advertising would take Anthropic in “directions where you’re optimising for the wrong things.”He further explained that without ads, the company can focus on areas such as making AI models more intelligent and being “genuinely helpful, safe, and trusted.”Anthropic made multiple Super Bowl ads and shared them on social media. The ads took a direct jab at OpenAI’s recent testing of advertising within ChatGPT. Altman quickly dismissed the campaign, calling it “funny” but “clearly dishonest.” Altman asserted that OpenAI would “obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them.”OpenAI president Greg Brockman also hit back at Anthropic's Super Bowl ad campaign, calling out what he sees as a “fundamental difference in our respective outlooks on AI.”However, the version that aired on TV was softer than the one Anthropic initially uploaded to YouTube. The original tagline read, ""Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude."" During the actual broadcast, it was swapped to: ""There is a time and place for ads. Your conversations with AI should not be one of them."" The softer tone suggested that Anthropic pulled back slightly after Altman’s 420-word criticism.While talking about the race to win infrastructure war, Smith highlighted both the companies’s vastly different approaches in terms of “announcement” culture.While OpenAI has committed over $1 trillion to future infrastructure, including a $100 billion partnership with Nvidia and a $10 billion deal with Cerebras, Anthropic’s is taking a disciplined approach, committing $50 billion to US data centres with a “do more with less” mindset.“We’ve made less flashy headlines than some, and we’ve been focused on growing revenue and winning business, rather than spending money and announcing the biggest compute deals that we possibly could,” Smith told CNBC.Smith also pushed back against the idea that Anthropic is trailing in the infrastructure race, saying that the company is not splashing in infrastructure it doesn't need.“This isn’t us buying ahead of demand,” Smith said while praising the “incredible growth” in Claude Code and Cowork. These are the two key products that Anthropic sells to businesses. Smith added there had been “incredible growth in enterprise business overall, that we absolutely need to satisfy.”“We are looking at buying as close to the right amount of compute to keep us on that very, very significant acceleration curve, and not go too much, not go too little, because too little would be bad for our customers,” he said.",OpenAI CEO Sam Altman criticised Anthropic's Super Bowl ads targeting ChatGPT.

“The most important thing about technology is understanding the problem it solves.”

“Software is eating the world, and AI is eating software.”

“We are just beginning to scratch the surface of what AI can do.”

“Innovation is not about ideas, it’s about making ideas happen.”

“Computing is not just about speed; it’s about solving the hardest problems.”

Jensen Huang is the CEO and co-founder of NVIDIA, a company that makes graphics processing units (GPUs) and is becoming more important in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Huang was born in Taiwan and grew up in the US. He studied electrical engineering before starting NVIDIA in 1993. Because of his leadership, the company has become a major player in AI research, gaming, data centers, and computers. At first, GPUs were only used to make graphics for games. Now, they are also used a lot in AI models and tasks that require a lot of computing power. NVIDIA has become a major player in technology in the 21st century thanks to this change.In this case, Huang's ideas about AI are important for both business and policy talks. He often says, ""It's very clear that AI is going to affect every industry."" I think that AI should be a part of every country's national strategy. ""All countries will be affected…"" Huang's quote says that AI is not just for a few fields. Instead, it is a broad-based force that will have an impact on business, education, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, and other areas.He also talks about how important national planning is and says that AI should be part of countries' long-term economic and strategic plans. This quote is part of a growing global conversation about how countries get ready for changes in technology and how people learn to live and work in new ways.Jensen Huang’s quote: ""It's very clear that AI is going to impact every industry..."" says that artificial intelligence is a technology that will affect everyone in society. He doesn't think that AI will only have an effect on one area, like software or robotics. He says that AI technologies will change many areas of life, including health care, education, agriculture, transportation, finance, and entertainment.Huang says that every country should include AI in its national strategy. This means that they need to plan and get ready. Governments make plans for things that are important for the country's growth, like energy, infrastructure, and education. Huang thinks that AI is just as big and important. Countries that plan could use AI to boost their economies, create jobs, make scientific discoveries, and improve public services. But people who don't know how to use AI or don't get it right away might have problems.His last point, that ""every country will be affected,"" supports the idea that AI has an impact on the whole world. This means that it's not just a problem for tech companies or rich countries; it will affect all countries, their industries, and their workers.You can use Jensen Huang's quote every day, even if you don't work in tech. Here are a few:The main point in all of these situations is to get ready, learn, and change. Even if you don't work with AI directly, knowing how it works can help you get ready for what's to come.Artificial intelligence is already part of many products and services people use daily, such as voice assistants, recommendation systems, navigation tools, and language translation. It changes the way people use technology and the way businesses run. Jensen Huang's quote gets to the heart of the matter when it says that AI will change countries and industries in important ways, not just the future.By suggesting that AI be part of a national strategy, Huang makes it a public issue, not just something that businesses are interested in. This is part of a bigger trend in talks around the world. Business leaders, scientists, teachers, and governments are all trying to figure out how to deal with the pros and cons of technology changing so quickly.Jensen Huang has shared several noteworthy statements over the years.

Tesla executives who have recently left the company

Tesla's new global sales chief takes charge to address the company's European sales drop

Tesla has reportedly appointed Joe Ward, its vice president for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, to oversee global electric vehicle sales. This move comes as the company addresses declining deliveries and a series of executive departures. A Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the matter, said Ward is set to lead Tesla's worldwide sales, service, and delivery organisation. Ward has worked at Tesla since 2010, starting as a logistics intern and advancing through the sales organisation before being named VP for EMEA in 2022.The appointment comes as Tesla faces weakening EV demand in the US and declining sales in Europe. At the same time, CEO Elon Musk focuses resources on artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous driving, and robotics. Tesla sales in China also faced pressure in late 2025 and early 2026. In November 2025, the company's retail sales reportedly fell 7.37% year-on-year to 531,855 units for the Jan-Nov period. Meanwhile, October 2025 saw a 3-year low, shrinking Tesla's market share to 3.2% as the company faces strong local competition from BYD, Xiaomi, and Nio, which hurt Tesla's market position in China. In addition to declining sales in the US, China, and Europe, Tesla also lost its position as the world's top EV seller to China's BYD in 2025 amid slumping deliveries.Ward's promotion follows the recent exit of Tesla's head of sales for North America, which was a part of an ongoing wave of senior executive departures from the company.Last week, Raj Jegannathan, who had been leading Tesla’s sales operations since July 2025, announced that he was leaving the company after 13 years. Jegannathan, an engineering executive who served as VP of IT, AI Infrastructure, Apps, Infosec, and Vehicle Service Operations, had reportedly grown closer to Musk and was brought in to replace Troy Jones, who left as VP of North America Sales after 15 years at the company.A number of veteran executives departed the company in 2025, including vehicle program managers for the Cybertruck, Model 3, and Model Y electric cars. Omead Afshar, a close aide to Mr. Musk who previously ran the electric carmaker’s sales and manufacturing operations in North America on an interim basis, is another who left the company last year. Other top employees who have left the company include Milan Kovac, who led Tesla’s engineering on the robot Optimus program, and David Lau, who ran software for over a decade.Ward is assuming responsibility for global sales as Tesla works to address a sharp drop in demand across Europe. The carmaker's sales in Germany fell 48% in 2025 and have continued to decline in 2026. In January, Tesla sales in the UK, the Netherlands, and France dropped by 57%, 67%, and 42%, respectively.The company has not launched new models or made notable updates to its current vehicles, and Musk's political activities have turned away many European customers.Ward's promotion is notable given his background as a Tesla veteran with over 15 years at the company and experience running a major regional operation. However, he is being moved from the region where Tesla is currently experiencing a significant decline.However, Tesla's demand issues extend beyond the sales and service organisation. With automotive revenue representing about 70% of the company's $24.9 billion last quarter, improving sales remains important even as Musk focuses on AI and robotaxis.","Joe Ward has worked at Tesla since 2010, starting as a logistics intern and advancing through the sales organisation before being named VP for EMEA in 2022.

Amazon employees argue Claude is better than Kiro

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

No explicit ban on Claude: Amazon spokesperson

Amazon employees are not allowed to use Anthropic’s Claude Code for production work without formal approval, says a Business Insider report. The restriction applies to live products and production code, even as other large tech companies encourage wider use of the AI coding tool. Specifically, this contrasts with software giant Microsoft that recently asked its engineers to test Claude Code alongside GitHub Copilot and share feedback on performance. As per the BI report, Amazon shared an internal guidance policy to its users last year, directing them to use Kiro, its in-house AI coding assistant. The guidance advised employees to rely on Kiro instead of non-approved third-party tools, including Claude Code, when writing production code.The move, the publication reports, triggered criticism across internal Amazon discussion forums. In one thread cited in the report, around 1,500 employees supported a request for Claude Code to be formally approved for internal use. Some employees said the restrictions created confusion, particularly for engineers working on AWS Bedrock, which offers customers access to third-party AI models, including Claude.""Customers will ask why they should trust or use a tool that we did not approve for internal use,"" one employee said.Several employees questioned how they could promote Claude Code to customers while being restricted from using it themselves in official work. One employee wrote internally that customers may question why they should trust a tool that Amazon does not allow for internal production use.Amazon's Claude restrictions have also led to internal debate over productivity. Some engineers argued that Claude Code performs better than Kiro for certain tasks and warned that limiting tool choice could slow development. Others said the lack of transparency around the decision not to formally approve Claude Code added to frustration, especially after earlier internal documents suggested it had cleared security and legal reviews. That language was later removed, according to the report.An Amazon spokesperson said that while Amazon maintains ""a strong strategic partnership with Anthropic,"" and that there's no explicit ban on Claude Code. The company, however, applies ""stricter requirements for the tools used to develop production code specifically,"" the spokesperson added, stating that Amazon provides a process for seeking exceptions.He further said that the company is seeing improvements in efficiency and delivery from Kiro and wants employees to use the internal tool to deliver faster for customers.""We are seeing incredible improvements in efficiency and delivery from Kiro, our customer growth is rapidly accelerating, and we want to make sure our internal employees all take advantage of this capability to deliver faster for our customers,"" the spokesperson said as quoted in the report. ""While we continue to support existing tools in use today, we do not plan to support additional, third-party AI development tools.

What do we know about ByteDance’s chip-making efforts so far

ByteDance is reportedly developing an AI chip. This will position the parent company of the popular short-video app TikTok to compete with Nvidia in the AI-processor market. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the Chinese tech giant has entered talks with Samsung Electronics to manufacture the AI chip. The partnership comes as ByteDance seeks to secure its own supply of advanced chips amid Nvidia's dominance of over 90% of the specialised AI chip market.The Reuters report, citing people familiar with the matter, said ByteDance aims to receive sample chips by the end of March and plans to produce at least 100,000 units this year, with the potential to scale up to 350,000 units.According to a source cited by Reuters, the Samsung deal is especially valuable because it will allow ByteDance to access memory chips that are in short supply globally as AI infrastructure expands. ByteDance's action is part of a larger trend in which tech companies are creating custom chips to lessen their reliance on Nvidia, whose GPUs are now the industry standard for AI inference and training.However, in a statement to Reuters, a ByteDance spokesperson said that the information about the in-house chip project is inaccurate without elaborating. The work would represent a significant development for ByteDance, which has sought to develop chips to support its AI workloads.ByteDance's chip efforts date back to at least 2022, when it began hiring chip-related staff. In June 2024, ByteDance started working with US chip designer Broadcom on an AI processor, with manufacturing planned to be outsourced to Taiwan's TSMC, Reuters previously reported.Code-named SeedChip, the chip project is a part of ByteDance's larger effort to invest in AI development, from chips to large language models, with the hope that the technology will revolutionise its business portfolio, which includes enterprise cloud services, e-commerce, and short video. In 2023, the business established Seed to create AI models and market its applications.ByteDance plans to spend over 160 billion yuan ($22 billion) on AI-related procurement this year, with more than half allocated to purchasing Nvidia chips, including H200 models, and to developing its in-house chip, according to a report citing a source.ByteDance executive Zhao Qi told employees at a January all-hands meeting that the company's AI investment would benefit all divisions, according to a fourth source briefed on the meeting.Zhao, who oversees ByteDance's Doubao chatbot and its overseas version, Dola, acknowledged the company's AI models trailed behind major players like OpenAI but pledged continued support for AI development this year, the person said.Beyond ByteDance, global tech companies, including Alphabet's Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, have developed their own AI chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia, the primary supplier of specialised chips for AI development.For Chinese tech companies, US export controls on chip sales to China have increased the need to develop their own AI chips. While ByteDance has yet to launch its own chip, its rivals, Alibaba and Baidu, are further along in AI chip development: Alibaba unveiled its Zhenwu chip last month for large-scale AI workloads. Baidu sells chips to external clients and plans to list its chip unit Kunlunxin soon.","Chinese tech giant ByteDance is reportedly developing an AI chip.

Memo that Boston Dynamics CEO sent to staff announcing his resignation



Team,

For more than 30 years, I have dedicated my life to building the world's best robots alongside the world's best team, and I could not be prouder of the company we have built together.

Today I'm making the incredibly difficult decision to step down as CEO of Boston Dynamics. Amanda McMaster will serve as interim CEO, and our Board of Directors will be leading a search to find the company's next leader. We will host an all-employee meeting later this week to celebrate our success and make the transition official. My last day with the company will be Feb. 27.

I accepted the position of CEO in the fall of 2019 as the company stood at an inflection point. Our challenge was clear: transition from an innovation lab to a sustainable, scalable business while retaining the exceptional talent and culture that made our breakthroughs possible. I'm proud to say that we have navigated these changes well, culminating in the remarkable year we just experienced. We've achieved meaningful commercial milestones with Spot and Stretch, re-established Atlas' leadership in a rapidly emerging industry and deepened our strategic partnership with Hyundai and Google DeepMind. Our success hinges on the same principle that guided this transition: we are building for the long term. The robotics market is at an early stage, and companies that combine technical excellence, commercial discipline, and patient capital are best positioned to capture what comes next. Boston Dynamics has all three.

The company is in a strong position, poised for the next stage of growth. A new CEO will bring the experience and energy required for this next phase. Our existing leadership team is strong, capable, and united. They know what this business needs to achieve as we prepare to produce robots at mass scale, and I have full confidence that Amanda and the team will guide Boston Dynamics through this transition phase without missing a beat.

Boston Dynamics has been the ride of a lifetime. What this place has become has exceeded anything I could have ever imagined all those years ago in our funky lab in the basement of the MIT Media Lab.

“We are on a mission to make Airtel the safe network. While working towards this, we have realised that despite the foundational role played by One-Time Passwords (OTPs) in securing digital transactions, their efficacy is frequently being undermined by criminal tactics. We are, therefore, pleased to announce a significant advancement in Airtel’s network layer that is designed to strengthen protection against banking frauds.

Our newly developed, AI-powered, autonomous solution operates proactively at network level and is engineered to detect and intervene against fraudulent activity in real-time. Extensive trials have demonstrated a remarkable level of accuracy and impact in preventing the menace of such scams.”","Airtel’s Fraud Alert AI feature for OTP safety: How it works. ‘Our newly developed, AI-powered, autonomous solution operates proactively at network level and is engineered to detect and intervene against fraudulent activity in real- time’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128198687,imgsize-40126,width-400,resizemode-4/airtel-launches-ai-fraud-alert-feature-to-keep-your-otps-safe-heres-how-it-works.jpg"

"Google to employees: You can go for our Voluntary Exit plan, if you are not enjoying …",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-to-employees-you-can-go-for-our-voluntary-exit-plan-if-you-are-not-enjoying-/articleshow/128195966.cms,"Google chief business officer give ‘All in’ ultimatum



Which Google teams are impacted



This is Google’s third Voluntary Exit plan in a year



Google has reportedly announced a new round of voluntary exit packages – this time for employees within its global business organisation (GBO). The latest plan signals a push for staff to fully commit to its AI-driven future. Google’s chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, told staff in an internal memo that while the company finished 2025 in a strong position, the rapid pace of the current tech landscape requires a workforce that is entirely aligned with the company’s AI mission.“We’re starting the year in a strong position thanks to everything you accomplished in 2025. But the game is dynamic, the pace is electric, and the stakes are high,” Schindler wrote in the memo, according to Business Insider.The offer targets employees who may feel ‘out of sync’ with Google’s rapid transformation into an “AI-first” business entity. Schindler’s memo directly said that every member of the business unit needs to be “all in” on “embracing AI to have even greater impact”.For those who find themselves “not enjoying the pace we need to operate in” or who are simply “ready to move on,” the company is providing a severance-backed exit path.Notably, the employees working on solutions teams, sales, corporate development and others. Furthermore, Schindler said America’s large customer sales teams and other customer-facing roles are not be eligible for the programs.“While all GBO functions are essential to our long-term strategy, we’ve decided not to offer VEP for these particular roles to limit as much disruption to our customers as possible,” he wrote.This is not the first time Google has used buyouts to reshape its workforce without resort to immediate, involuntary layoffs. Over the past year, the tech giant has implemented similar programmes. In June 2025, buyouts were offered to US staff during a strict “return-to-office” crackdown. In October 2025, exit packages offered to YouTube employees amid a broader reorganisation.In August last year, Google's Chief People Officer Fiona Cicconi explained the company's Voluntary Exit Programme (VEP) as “actually quite successful,” as the company is still streamlining its workforce and reducing material layers across divisions.According a report CNBC, speaking at the recent town hall meeting, Cicconi revealed that abbot 5% of the employees in important departments including marketing, search, people operations and hardware have opted into VEP this year.“It's actually quite interesting to see who's taking a VEP. It's people sort of wanting a career break, sometimes to take care of family members,” Cicconi was quoted as saying.",Google has reportedly announced a new round of voluntary exit packages for employees within its global business organisation.

An open letter demands Benioff take a public stand against ICE

Benioff's influence in Washington adds weight to the debate

Salesforce employees are circulating an internal open letter urging CEO Marc Benioff to publicly denounce US Immigration and Customs Enforcement after he cracked jokes about ICE agents surveilling international workers at a major company event in Las Vegas this week. During his opening keynote at Salesforce's annual Company Kickoff on Tuesday, Benioff asked employees who had traveled from outside the US to stand up—then quipped that ICE agents were in the building keeping tabs on them, according to reports from Wired, Business Insider, and 404 Media, all of which viewed internal Slack messages.The room reportedly groaned. Employees flooded Slack channels with anger and disbelief, with one writing, ""It's hard to believe this company still has values when you make completely off-base jokes about ICE in your opening keynote.""The backlash was swift. In a channel called #airing-of-grievances, one employee posted a meme asking ""Are we the baddies?"" while others questioned whether any apology could undo the damage. Several employees told outlets they were ""furious,"" with one describing the mood as employees going ""absolutely apeshit"" on internal channels.Beyond the jokes, employees are pushing for something more concrete. The open letter, first reported by Wired, calls on Benioff to issue a public statement condemning what it describes as ICE's ""unconstitutional conduct"" and to draw clear ""red lines"" barring the use of Salesforce's cloud and AI products for immigration enforcement.It specifically flags leaked documentation showing Salesforce pitched its Agentforce AI technology to help ICE rapidly hire 10,000 new agents and process tip-line reports.The letter also references the recent killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, calling them a ""devastating indictment of a system that has discarded human decency.""The letter pointedly notes that Benioff's voice ""carries unique weight"" in political circles, citing an episode last fall when Trump reportedly called off an ICE deployment in San Francisco after outreach from Bay Area tech leaders, including Benioff and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.Salesforce did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Salesforce employees are circulating an internal open letter urging CEO Marc Benioff to publicly denounce US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

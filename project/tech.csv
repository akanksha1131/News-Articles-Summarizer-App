SC asks phishing attack victims to change passwords

The Supreme Court registry has issued a public notice warning against fake websites pretending to be its official site. These fake websites, the advisory notice says, are trying to collect people's personal and confidential information, says a PTI report. The SC registry said “The Registry, Supreme Court of India has been made aware of a phishing attack,” adding that the fake websites have been hosted on the uniform resource locator (URL).It said, “The attackers through the URLs are soliciting personal details and confidential information. Any visitor on the above URLs is strongly advised not to share and divulge any personal and confidential information, as the same shall enable the perpetrators to steal the information.”The registry stated that this notice is for public safety and strongly advises everyone not to click on or share any links they receive without first checking if they are genuine.A phishing scam is a type of online fraud where scammers trick people into sharing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details.They often do this by sending fake emails, messages, or links that look like they come from trusted organizations (like banks, government agencies, or popular websites). Once you click on the link or share your information, the scammers can use it for illegal activities, such as stealing money or identity theft.“Please note that the Registry, Supreme Court of India will never ask for personal information, financial details or other confidential information. Please also note that the Supreme Court of India is the registered user of the domain name www.sci.gov.in and before clicking on any URL always hover over the URL to verify the same,” it said.It advised that anyone who falls victim to a phishing attack should immediately change the passwords for all their online accounts. They should also contact their bank or credit card company to report any unauthorized access or suspicious activity.“The Registry, Supreme Court of India has taken due concern of the phishing attack and has flagged the same with law enforcement agencies, to investigate the phishing attack and bring the perpetrators to justice,” it added.","The Supreme Court registry has issued a public notice warning against fake websites pretending to be its official site.

Telecom operators are reportedly lobbying the Department of Telecommunications DoT ) to adopt the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India 's (TRAI) definition of international traffic, a change that could boost their SMS revenues by over Rs 400 crore annually.According to a report in Economic Times, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), whose members include Reliance Jio Airtel and Vodafone-Idea , have sent a letter to the telecom secretary Neeraj Mittal. The letter has urged the DoT to incorporate Trai's recommendations into existing unified license agreements and upcoming authorizations. Trai recently defined international traffic as SMS messages that originate or terminate from devices, servers, or applications located outside India. COAI believes this definition will provide much-needed clarity to the industry.Experts predict that adopting this definition could generate over Rs 400 crore in additional annual SMS revenue for telcos by preventing the misclassification of international messages as domestic ones.This push follows years of dispute between telecom operators and multinational companies (MNCs), including e-commerce giants, regarding message classification. These MNCs include Amazon, Flipkart, Netflix and others.Telcos have alleged that some MNCs process international transactions from foreign servers but send SMS messages from domestic systems to avoid higher international SMS charges. While Trai has set domestic SMS rates between 0.2 and 0.5 paisa, international SMS rates are significantly higher, ranging from ₹2 to ₹5 depending on the origin country.Trai's recent recommendation clarifies that any incoming application-to-person (A2P) SMS message should be considered international if it requires the use or intervention of any device, system, or application located outside India. This move addresses the issue of various entities, including financial institutions, e-commerce firms, enterprises, cloud providers, and OTTs, using A2P messaging without revealing the SMS origin. Telcos argue that this clarity is crucial.","Telecom operators are reportedly lobbying the Department of Telecommunications DoT to adopt Trai's definition of international traffic.

Moraes suspended X in Brazil

A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has issued a stern warning to tech companies, saying that they must adhere to Brazilian laws to continue operating in the country. Justice Alexandre de Moraes , who temporarily suspended Elon Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) in Brazil, stressed that the court will not tolerate the exploitation of hate speech for profit.“In Brazil, (the companies) will only continue to operate if they respect Brazilian legislation, regardless of the rant of Big Tech managers,” Moraes said, as per news agency Reuters.While Moraes did not name any specific company, his remarks came shortly after Meta announced plans to discontinue its US fact-checking program and loosen restrictions on discussions surrounding controversial topics.Moraes, speaking at an event commemorating the second anniversary of the January 8 riots in Brazil, underscored the importance of respecting Brazilian legislation, regardless of the opinions of Big Tech executives.Meanwhile, Brazilian prosecutors have requested clarification from Meta regarding whether the changes to its fact-checking program in the US will also apply to Brazil. Meta has been given 30 days to respond as part of an ongoing investigation into online misinformation and violence.On August 30, 2024, Moraes ordered the suspension of X (formerly Twitter) in Brazil, accusing the platform of failing to comply with local laws requiring the appointment of a legal representative in the country.This decision resulted in a complete shutdown of X's operations in Brazil. Major tech companies like Apple and Google, along with Brazilian internet service providers (ISPs), blocked access to the platform for their users, effectively cutting off millions of Brazilians from the social media service.The suspension, initially ordered by Moraes and later unanimously upheld by a Supreme Court panel, led to a clash between Moraes and X owner Elon Musk, who criticised the judge's actions as censorship.",Justice Alexandre de Moraes has issued a stern warning to tech companies.

US giants challenging local rivals with quick commerce expansion



Blinkit will now deliver laptops, monitors, and printers in 10 minutes. This expansion into electronics makes the Zomato-owned quick commerce platform the third quick commerce platform to offer rapid delivery of such high-value items, following Flipkart Minutes and Bigbasket's BB Now. Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa took to social media platform X (earlier Twitter) to announce the new offering. Currently, this service is live in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and more. The company has also promised to add more brands and their products to the service in the coming days.In the X post, Dhindsa wrote:Earlier this month, Blinkit also introduced a 10-minute ambulance service in Gurugram. The company plans to expand this service to other major cities within the next two years.The Indian quick commerce market is heating up with the entry of US giants Amazon and Flipkart, challenging local players like Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Zepto. Amazon is piloting its ""Tez"" service in Bengaluru, offering fast delivery of essentials. Meanwhile, Flipkart is also expanding its ""Minutes"" service with an extensive network of dark stores and a wider product range, including electronics and even medicine.This intensified competition is putting pressure on existing players' profitability, forcing them to innovate and adapt. BigBasket, for example, is integrating with Tata Cliq to offer 15-minute delivery of fashion items, expanding the scope of quick commerce.While the sector's growth projections have been revised by analysts, the arrival of Amazon and Flipkart promises to reshape the quick commerce landscape in India, potentially leading to greater convenience and choice for consumers.","Blinkit will now deliver laptops, monitors, and printers in 10 minutes.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni defended Elon Musk against criticism in a recent interview with Corriere Della Sera. Meloni questioned the labeling of Musk as a ""Monster."" She linked this criticism to his political associations, specifically mentioning his close relationship with then President-elect Donald Trump . Musk served on Trump's transition team and was expected to take on an advisory role. Meloni stated that Musk is often seen negatively for supporting what some consider the ""wrong"" side. ""Musk is labeled a 'Monster' simply for supporting what some consider as the 'wrong' side,"" she said.When asked if she is friends with Musk, Meloni replied,She added, “Musk is a great personality of our time, an extraordinary innovator who always looks to the future.”,” she told the publication.Elon Musk presented Italy's PM, 47, with the Global Citizen's Award at the Atlantic Council think tank’s Global Citizen Awards. ""I thank Elon Musk, for the beautiful words that he had for me and for his precious genius for the era in which we live,"" said Meloni in her thanks address at the event. The video of the same was shared recently by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley Association on Twitter and reposted by Elon Musk.Italy PM Meloni was in the US recently to meet Trump. The US President-elect hailed Italian Prime Minister Meloni as a “fantastic woman” who has ""really taken Europe by storm,"" as per a report in CNN. A member of the right-wing Brothers of Italy party, Meloni took office in October 2022. She has been recognised as the most powerful person in Europe for 2024 by Politico.According to CNN reports, the details of the meeting have not been disclosed, although the Italian leader, like others, has been seeking to strengthen ties with the President-elect ahead of his inauguration on January 20.One possible topic on the agenda was the detention of Italian journalist Cecilia Sala, who was arrested in Iran last month, it said. Meloni's visit to Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida's Palm Beach comes after she dined with the President-elect and Musk during the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris last month.","Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni defended Elon Musk against criticism in a recent interview.

iPhone SE 4 may have a new name

Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. A report previously suggested that these devices would launch alongside iOS 18 .3 and iPadOS 18.3, but Gurman clarified that while the products are being developed on the same software ""train,"" their release may not coincide with the updates. Instead, Gurman stated that Apple is targeting a release “before iOS 18.4,” offering a more specific timeframe for the highly anticipated devices.Taking to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Gurma wrote “Yes, the new iPads and iPhone SE replacement are being developed on the iOS 18.3 train - but that doesn’t mean they launch together this month”. Adding further, he said “It means they’ll launch before iOS 18.4, by April if all goes to plan.”According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, iPhone SE 4 may be rebranded as the iPhone 16E . The naming speculation originated from Chinese social media platform Weibo user Fixed Focus Digital and was later corroborated by leaker Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter). While neither source has an established track record with Apple rumors, the potential rebranding would align the budget model more closely with Apple's flagship iPhone 16 lineup. The potential name change would mark a significant shift from Apple's previous ""SE"" branding for its budget iPhone line.The device is rumored to receive a major redesign, adopting the modern aesthetics of the iPhone 14 and moving away from the dated iPhone 8-style design of the current SE model. Key upgrades include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID authentication, and a USB-C port, replacing the Touch ID button and Lightning connector found on the current model.Sources indicate the device will feature a single 48-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of RAM, and Apple's latest A-series chip to support new AI features. The company is also expected to implement its first in-house designed 5G modem in the device.","Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

Elon Musk says ‘yes’ to Google and Microsoft AI heads on this,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-says-yes-to-google-and-microsoft-ai-heads-on-this/articleshow/117090468.cms,"Synthetic data is the way to go, says Musk

Elon Musk has joined the chorus of AI experts declaring that we've hit “peak data.” In a recent livestream, the xAI founder stated that AI models have essentially consumed all of humanity's accumulated knowledge and there’s very little real-world data left to train AI models on.""We've exhausted basically the cumulative sum of human knowledge...in AI training,"" Musk said, adding, “That happened basically last year.”Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind , recently cautioned that the rapid advancements in AI chatbots may be slowing down. He attributed this potential slowdown to a growing scarcity of high-quality data for training AI models. Hassabis said that tech companies have essentially ‘exhausted’ the readily available data on the internet, having already used it to train existing large language models.In fact, about a month ago, Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman talked about the use of synthetic data to train AI models because the available data is exhausted – something that OpenAI's former chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, warned about.Musk believes the solution lies in synthetic data – data generated by AI itself. He envisions AI models creating their own training data and engaging in a “process of self-learning.”“The only way to supplement [real-world data] is with synthetic data, where the AI creates [training data],” he said.“With synthetic data … [AI] will sort of grade itself and go through this process of self-learning,” he added.This approach is already being adopted by major players like Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic, who are using synthetic data to train their most advanced AI models.Google DeepMind has reportedly been using synthetic data to train AL models and it relied on this method to help train a model that can solve Olympiad-level geometry problems.In fact, the AI arm of Google recently pointed to inference-time compute – a solution to tackle the lack of data to train AI models. This technique allows AI models to tackle complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, manageable prompts, essentially learning along the way.""We’re generating vast amounts of synthetic data. That synthetic data is increasingly high quality,"" Suleyman told The Verge in an interview last month.","Elon Musk has joined the chorus of AI experts declaring that we've hit “peak data.” In a recent livestream, the xAI founder stated that AI models have essentially consumed all of humanity's accumulated knowledge.

What NRAI said against Swiggy and Zomato



“We are absolutely not okay with Zomato and Swiggy engaging in private labelling and selling food directly via Blinkit’s Bistro app and Swiggy’s Snacc app for quick food delivery. They have access to all our data, which they do not share with us. For us, there is complete consumer masking. We have no reason to believe they are not migrating our customers to the products they sell as private labels on their apps, whether it’s data from a tea brand, biryani, or momo. We are seriously considering taking legal action.”

“Quick commerce in food is here to stay, grow, and add more zing to the food delivery space. People want more convenience, and this will give an edge to restaurants that can adapt to it. We fully support it. However, as long as these aggregators work with restaurants and enable them to go quick, we’re fine with it. But we cannot support a model where they sell similar products themselves, effectively competing with us. This has not been allowed for even larger e-commerce players operating under the marketplace model,”

Restaurants across India are protesting against Zomato and Swiggy 's launch of standalone apps for 10-minute food delivery . The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) is also planning to take the issue to the Competition Commission of India (CCI). The NRAI alleges that these new apps, Bistro by Zomato-owned Blinkit and Snacc by Swiggy, amount to the companies operating private labels , which could harm existing restaurant partners. This move escalates an ongoing case the NRAI has with the CCI against the two food delivery giants, accusing them of anti-competitive practices.In a statement to the Economic Times, Sagar Daryani , NRAI president and co-founder and CEO of Wow Momo said:Food delivery platforms like Zomato and Swiggy use services like Bistro and Snacc, respectively to source food and beverages from third-party vendors and deliver them through quick-commerce dark stores. Apart from this, the companies also provide a 15-minute food delivery service by aggregating restaurants. Swiggy’s rapid food delivery service, offered under its Bolt model, now contributes to over 5% of its total food delivery orders, ET reports.Daryani added.NRAI has also urged the government to grant industry status to the food services sector, news agency PTI reports. The restaurant body cited the food services sector’s economic contributions and potential to grow into a Rs 7.76 lakh crore industry by 2028.","Restaurants across India are protesting against Zomato and Swiggy's launch of standalone apps for 10-minute food delivery.

American giants getting battleground-ready for Desi companies

India's Quick Commerce landscape is heating up in 2025, with new entrants and established players aggressively expanding their operations. Two of the biggest Desi players in the fast-growing Quick Commerce segment -- Blikit and Swiggy -- are set to get American competition. According to a report in Economic Times, US-based ecommerce company Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart are gearing up fast for the Quick commerce market entry in 2025. Walmart is the biggest retail company in America.Amazon has reportedly begun testing its quick commerce service, ""Tez,"" in select Bengaluru neighborhoods with its employees. This pilot program focuses on delivering everyday essentials from sellers quickly, utilizing dark stores in key city areas and partnering with leading third-party logistics firms. Amazon confirmed the pilot, emphasizing its commitment to innovation and faster delivery speeds. Amazon confirmed the development to Economic Times. “We are always innovating to offer even more value to customers, and this limited pilot in select pin codes of Bengaluru is a trial to offer even faster speeds on a selection of everyday essentials from our sellers, that customers often need quickly,” a spokesperson said.Meanwhile, Walmart-owned Flipkart's quick commerce service, ""Minutes,"" is rapidly scaling up. It's projected to operate around 150 dark stores this quarter and is expanding its product range to include higher-value items like smartphones, laptops, and even medicine delivery in select Bengaluru areas. A recent Jefferies report highlights Flipkart's aggressive pricing strategy, positioning it as a strong competitor against established quick commerce leaders like Zepto, Swiggy Instamart , and Blinkit. The report also notes Flipkart Minutes ' consistent availability of electronics, including iPhones, setting it apart from competitors who offer them only on specific occasions. Sources indicate Flipkart is steadily increasing its dark store count, expanding into new markets like Kolkata, and broadening its product categories. Industry experts suggest Flipkart could become a major challenger in the quick commerce space this year.Other notable developments from Indian companies include Tata-owned BigBasket integrating Tata Cliq to offer 15-minute delivery of fashion products, signaling a new area of focus for quick commerce.While brokerages have revised growth projections for the Quick Commerce sector, the entry of major players like Flipkart and Amazon is expected to put pressure on the profitability of existing companies.","American giants getting battleground-ready for Desi companies.

“We continue to align ourselves with strong capital partners who believe in our mission and are supporting our ambitious programs,”

“We remain fully committed to the development and launch of Terran R and continue to make significant progress toward our 2026 launch target.”

Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt has reportedly invested in Relativity Space, a 3D-printed rocket company that competes with Elon Musk 's SpaceX. A Bloomberg report citing sources claimed that Schmidt has been backing the company since last year, providing a significant financial boost. This investment comes after Relativity Space faced challenges raising capital in 2024. The company is among a growing number of startups vying for a share of the space launch market , alongside established players like SpaceX and Firefly Aerospace .Earlier, Schmidt served as the CEO of Google ’s parent Alphabet, until 2011, when he transitioned to the role of executive chairman. He departed from the board in 2019 and has since focused on philanthropic initiatives, investment ventures, and advisory roles with the US government, as well as work through his family foundation.A representative for Schmidt declined to provide a comment, while Relativity also remained silent regarding his financial investment, the report noted.Relativity said in a statement.Founded in 2015 in Long Beach, California, Relativity started building rockets primarily using 3D printing technology. The company achieved a valuation of $4.2 billion in 2021, backed by investors such as Fidelity Management & Research Company, Jared Leto, and Mark Cuban.In 2023, Relativity launched its first rocket, the Terran 1, on a test flight that failed to reach orbit. Following this, the company decided to discontinue the Terran 1 program and shift its focus to the Terran R , a larger rocket scheduled for its maiden flight in 2026.Last year, Relativity faced financial challenges, with dwindling cash reserves and difficulties securing the additional funding needed to support the development of Terran R and maintain daily operations.In a statement, the company affirmed its commitment to the Terran R project, stating,","Relativity Space is a 3D-printed rocket company that competes with Elon Musk's SpaceX.

The standalone app will be available in 76 cities across India.As reported by Economic Times, Sriharsha Majety, Group CEO and co-founder of Swiggy, revealed that while Instamart will remain accessible through the main Swiggy app, the standalone app aims to provide a more direct and convenient experience for users. The company believes that Instamart has the potential to achieve far greater user adoption, possibly surpassing food delivery in terms of size.“While it’s been clear for a while now that Swiggy Instamart is set to match food delivery in size, recent developments show it’s on track to surpass food delivery in both penetration and scale.

However, the standalone Instamart app is expected to draw a much larger user base and further enhance the company's reach.The standalone app is set to be launched in a few weeks, marking another step in Swiggy's journey towards becoming a house of apps.","Swiggy is set to launch a standalone app for its quick commerce arm, Instamart.

Bill Gates: The Founding Visionary (1975–2000)

Pioneering the PC revolution: Gates secured a pivotal deal in 1980 to supply the operating system for IBM’s first personal computer. Microsoft purchased and adapted an existing system, branding it MS-DOS. This move catapulted Microsoft into prominence as a leader in operating systems.

Innovations in software: The launch of Windows 1.0 in 1985 introduced the Graphical User Interface, making computing more accessible. Subsequent versions, such as Windows 3.0 (1990) and Windows 95 (1995), solidified Microsoft’s dominance. The introduction of Microsoft Office further cemented its role as the go-to provider of business productivity tools.

Growth and challenges: Microsoft’s 1986 Initial Public Offering (IPO) made Gates a billionaire at age 31. However, the company faced legal scrutiny in the late 1990s when the U.S. Department of Justice accused it of monopolistic practices by bundling Internet Explorer with Windows. Despite a protracted legal battle, Microsoft reached a settlement in 2001.

Legacy: Gates stepped down as CEO in 2000 to focus on philanthropy through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. His tenure left an indelible mark on the technology landscape, making Microsoft synonymous with personal and professional computing.

Steve Ballmer: Expanding Horizons (2000–2014)

Successes and innovations: Under Ballmer, Microsoft entered the gaming industry with the launch of the Xbox in 2001, challenging Sony and Nintendo’s dominance. The company also released Windows XP, one of its most successful operating systems.

Challenges in the mobile market: Despite successes, Ballmer’s tenure faced setbacks, such as the underwhelming reception of Windows Vista and Microsoft’s failure to establish a strong foothold in the mobile market. The introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the rise of Android further marginalized Microsoft’s smartphone efforts.

Strategic acquisitions: Ballmer spearheaded significant acquisitions, including Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011, bolstering Microsoft’s position in communication technologies.

Financial growth: Despite challenges, Microsoft’s annual revenue tripled during Ballmer’s tenure, reflecting its expanding product portfolio and global reach. He announced his retirement in 2013, stepping down in February 2014.

Satya Nadella: Reinventing Microsoft (2014–Present)

Shift to cloud computing: Nadella prioritized Microsoft Azure, turning it into a leader in cloud infrastructure. By 2020, Azure surpassed Microsoft’s Windows business, reflecting the success of this strategic pivot.

Subscription-based services: Nadella championed the shift to subscription models, with Microsoft 365 becoming a cornerstone of the company’s offerings. This transition provided consistent revenue streams and aligned with evolving user needs.

High-profile acquisitions: Nadella oversaw transformative acquisitions, including:

Mojang (2014) : Creator of Minecraft, for $2.5 billion.

: Creator of Minecraft, for $2.5 billion.

LinkedIn (2016) : Professional networking giant, for $26.2 billion.

: Professional networking giant, for $26.2 billion.

GitHub (2018): Leading platform for software collaboration, for $7.6 billion.

Focus on AI: Microsoft has emerged as a key player in AI under Nadella. The company’s partnership with OpenAI, with investments exceeding $13 billion, has positioned it at the forefront of AI advancements. Microsoft’s commitment includes plans for significant investments in GPUs and AI data centers through 2027.

Cultural transformation: Nadella’s leadership has been credited with transforming Microsoft’s internal culture, fostering collaboration and innovation. His emphasis on empathy and adaptability has redefined the company’s approach to challenges and opportunities.

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet reveals her key interview question for potential employees. In a recent podcast with Norges Bank Investment Management CEO Nicolai Tangen, Sweet explained how she determines candidate suitability. She asks all applicants, regardless of position: “What have you learned in the last six months?” This question, according to Sweet, helps her gauge their commitment to continuous learning. The podcast interview with Tangen provided insights into Sweet's hiring practices at Accenture.She said: “One question that we ask everyone, regardless of if you’re a consultant or you’re working in technology … we say: ‘What have you learned in the last six months?’. A lot of the time people are asking me, ‘How do I know if someone’s a learner?’ And it’s a very simple way to know. “She explained that the question is a simple but effective way to gauge if someone is a continuous learner. She added that it doesn’t matter if the answer is something as casual as “I learned to bake a cake”—what matters is whether the candidate can answer the question. If they can’t, Sweet believes that shows they’re not interested in learning new things.When asked what she had learned in the last six months, Sweet mentioned that her focus had been mostly on artificial intelligence (AI). She shared that in recent months, AI had been a hot topic in meetings with CEOs. Despite her busy schedule, Sweet revealed that she learned how to bake bread.Sweet also stressed the growing importance of human resources (HR). She believes HR is one of the best fields to be in right now, as CEOs are increasingly focused on how to train and develop talent in this AI-driven era.This hiring approach highlights how companies are adjusting their recruitment strategies in response to AI, which is changing job roles across departments. Daniel Shapero, LinkedIn ’s COO, also looks for candidates who are comfortable using AI, asking them how they’ve used it in their daily tasks. Shapero believes that candidates who can use AI effectively are more likely to help their organizations become more AI-driven.","Accenture CEO Julie Sweet reveals her key interview question for potential employees.

""Infrastructure today needs to be thought of differently from traditional ways""

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has announced the company's plans to invest $3 billion in India in cloud and AI infrastructure, including setting up new data centres over the next two years. The $3 billion additional investment in India is said to be Microsoft's single-largest expansion into the region. During his India visit, Nadella also had an interaction with Infosys co-founder and chairman Nandan Nilekani in Bengaluru, on the sidelines of an event where Microsoft announced fresh investments in the country and met partners as well as customers.The two leaders spoke about a range of issues including India's role in AI innovation, the increasingly critical role AI will play in the global economy, human capital and AI and more. Nilekani said that India will be the use case capital of the world, while Nadella outlined the impact being created by some of India’s leading startups and enterprises building out the use cases with AI.Talking about his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Nadella said, “I had a chance to meet Prime Minister Modiji yesterday and it was fantastic. It's great to listen to his vision of how he wants to drive AI missions. It's the combination of the Yojanas (schemes), the India Stack, the entrepreneurial energy in this country, and the demographics on both the consumer and business sides that are all coming together in a virtuous cycle,” Nadella said.To this, Nilekani said, “We have political leadership that is very savvy. I know you met Prime Minister Modi yesterday, and they understand that we must strike the right balance between AI innovation and safeguards. In some parts of the world, they are saying safeguards first without worrying about innovation. We know the right balance between responsible AI and innovation.”Responding to Microsoft CEO Nadella’s question on contextualising AI adoption in India, Nilekani said, “I think India will be the use case capital of AI in the world. We have several things working for us. We have 15 years of experience in building population-scale digital infrastructure, which makes it cheaper and allows for high-volume, billions of transactions. We know that game well.”Giving example of UPI, Infosys chairman Nilekani said that Indians are quick to adapt and accept new technology. “UPI was launched about seven years ago, and now there are 400 million users and 16 billion transactions a month. It's unbelievable that this can happen. I think AI is at that spot, and we must make it work. For example, if you look at Aadhaar authentications, it's all AI-based because we have to do liveness detection for biometrics, so people don't spoof it. It's all AI-based. Look at our tax systems, the back end is all AI figuring out who's committing fraud. That's why tax revenues are going up,” he said.Emphasising the advances in AI and the increasingly critical role it will play in the economy, Nadella said infrastructure today needs to be thought of differently from the traditional ways. “With infrastructure, there’s a new formula for any country or company. I think of that formula as tokens per dollar per watt. Fundamentally, their (country or company) growth depends on how efficiently they can drive that equation,” he said.When asked about the advice he has for global CEOs, Nadella said ""change management is the hard thing”.... “At Microsoft, for instance, the efficiency gains in various functions – customer service, internal IT, and others – all show double-digit improvements. These improvements directly influence budgetary decisions. From a CEO's perspective, this translates to setting specific targets, such as 10 points or 300 basis points of operating leverage for the upcoming year, with a five-year compound growth plan. ...Thanks to capital markets, what they expect of CEOs is miracles every 90 days,” he said.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has announced the company's plans to invest $3 billion in India in cloud and AI infrastructure, including setting up new data centres over the next two years.

Nvidia CEO is “dead wrong”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s single comment about the future of quantum computing triggered a massive selloff earlier this week, wiping out approximately $8 billion in market value from quantum computing companies.Major quantum computing players bore the brunt of the selloff. IonQ shares plummeted more than 40%, while Rigetti Computing crashed by over 45%. D-Wave saw its shares sink 36%, though the stock remains up about 600% over the past year.During Nvidia's analyst day at CES, Huang said getting ""very useful quantum computers"" to market could take 15 to 30 years. He told analysts that quantum computers would need 1 million times the number of quantum processing units , called qubits, that they currently have.""He's dead wrong,"" fired back D-Wave Quantum CEO Alan Baratz. ""The reason he's wrong is that we at D-Wave are commercial today,"" Baratz told CNBC, citing major clients like Mastercard and NTT Docomo that are ""using our quantum computers today in production to benefit their business operations.""Baratz acknowledged that while Huang's ""comments may not be totally off-base for gate model quantum computers,"" they are ""100% off base for annealing quantum computers"" – the technology D-Wave uses. He offered to meet Huang ""any time, any place"" to help fill in these knowledge gaps.The quantum computing sector had seen increased attention following Google's December announcement of its Willow quantum chip breakthrough. Google said it had completed a 100 qubit chip, marking the second of six steps in its strategy to build a quantum system with 1 million qubits.

Quick commerce driving blue-collar employment; India to see demand for 2.4 million jobs by 2027,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quick-commerce-driving-blue-collar-employment-india-to-see-demand-for-2-4-million-jobs-by-2027/articleshow/117063073.cms,"Quick Commerce: Image for representation

The rapid rise of quick commerce is anticipated to create a substantial increase in the need for blue-collar workers, with India projected to require 2.4 million jobs by 2027, according to job matching and hiring platform Indeed. Quick commerce companies hired over 40,000 employees in the last quarter to handle increased festive shopping and ecommerce demand, Indeed India Sales Head Sashi Kumar said.""The quick commerce industry in India is on a rapid growth trajectory, and we're seeing a significant shift in how blue-collar hiring is evolving to meet this demand.""As the industry continues to expand, the need for skilled and semi-skilled workers is growing, making hiring more competitive. Employers are increasingly looking for talent that can adapt to a fast-paced, technology-driven environment,"" he told PTI.Blue-collar jobs refer to occupations that involve manual labour or skilled trades. These roles often require physical work and hands-on training and experience rather than formal education.The average monthly base salary for these roles, including delivery drivers and retail staff, is about Rs 22,600, according to a survey by Indeed.""India will need 2.43 million blue-collar workers across various industries. Among this, the quick commerce sector alone is set to create half a million new jobs and lead the way,"" the survey said.During peak seasons, workers often benefit from increased earnings through bonuses. Additionally, many companies provide non-monetary perks, such as smartphones, and referral rewards, the study said.The primary roles that quick commerce companies recruited for during the festive season included delivery drivers, warehouse associates, marketing and promotional personnel, packaging workers, and logistics coordinators.The top five skills employers identified as high priorities are navigation and driving, digital literacy, data analysis, management, and tech support to increase efficiency and scalability in the workforce. The adoption of automation and digital tools is also shaping the types of skills needed for these roles.""Quick commerce is about more than convenience; it's about creating careers, opportunities, and a sustainable workforce. Every new delivery driver or warehouse worker represents a story of change, offering long-term employment that supports millions of families,"" Kumar said.The rise in blue-collar jobs within the quick commerce industry is mainly fuelled by the growing demand for rapid delivery services. Customers expect goods, especially groceries and essentials, to be delivered within minutes.The competition among quick commerce players to provide faster delivery times and the expansion of their service areas are driving employment in this sector, Kumar said.""The quick commerce sector has a unique opportunity to redefine blue-collar work in India. By focusing on structured roles, career growth pathways, and better work environments, the industry can create a workforce that is not only resilient but also ready to drive its future growth,"" he said.Major cities like Chennai, Pune, Bangalore, Mumbai, and Delhi are experiencing a notable increase in hiring as quick commerce continues to grow, according to the study. Additionally, Tier 2 cities such as Chandigarh and Ahmedabad are also witnessing a surge in job opportunities, indicating the expanding influence of quick commerce in emerging urban areas.While quick commerce is at the forefront of generating blue-collar jobs, other industries like logistics, manufacturing, and traditional e-commerce are also seeing an increased demand for blue-collar workers .Quick commerce stands out due to its speed, scalability, and reliance on technology, which has made rapid hiring and training possible during peak seasons, Indeed said.","India projected to require 2.4 million blue-collar jobs by 2027.

In a surprising turn of events, Errol Musk, the father of tech billionaire Elon Musk , has publicly advised the people of the United Kingdom to disregard his son’s recent comments on British politics. Speaking to LBC News, Errol Musk expressed his disapproval of Elon’s foray into UK political discourse, emphasising that wealth and fame should not lend undue weight to his opinions. The controversy revolves around Elon Musk’s statements on social media, where he criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other political figures over their handling of a sensitive issue involving ""Pakistani grooming gangs."" The incident has sparked widespread debate, drawing reactions from political leaders, public figures, and Elon’s father himself.In his interview, Errol Musk made it clear that he believes his son’s comments should not be given undue attention. “Just don’t listen to him, that’s all. I’d say don’t worry about it. Tell him to get lost,” he said. He went on to downplay the significance of Elon’s remarks, asserting that the billionaire’s opinions hold no more value than those of countless others expressing similar sentiments online.“People don’t have to listen to what he says. I mean he’s just a person. The fact that he has money or something, he’s a billionaire or something to that effect—I mean, hundreds of thousands of people are tweeting the same things or saying the same things as he is,” Errol Musk added, as per reports. His comments reflect a broader concern about the influence of high-profile individuals on public discourse.Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and owner of X (formerly Twitter), stirred controversy when he accused UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer of being complicit in the actions of ""Pakistani grooming gangs."" These gangs, predominantly consisting of men of South Asian origin, were implicated in the systematic sexual abuse of young girls in northern English towns such as Rochdale, Rotherham, and Oldham between 2008 and 2013.Musk alleged that Starmer, who served as head of the UK’s prosecution service during the period, prioritized political gains over justice for victims. In a series of posts on X, Musk stated, “Starmer must go and he must face charges for his complicity in the worst mass crime in the history of Britain.” He further claimed that many individuals in positions of power in the UK should face legal consequences for their alleged roles in covering up the scandal.Musk also directed criticism at UK safeguarding minister Jess Phillips, labeling her a “rape genocide apologist” and accusing her of failing to address issues related to child abuse. He called for a new inquiry into the grooming gangs, despite the conclusion of a years-long national investigation into child sexual exploitation in 2022.Prime Minister Keir Starmer firmly rejected Musk’s accusations, describing them as baseless and harmful. Without directly naming Musk, Starmer criticized those spreading misinformation, stating, “Those who are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible are not interested in victims; they’re interested in themselves.”Starmer warned that such rhetoric could have dangerous consequences, including threats and intimidation against public figures. “We have seen this playbook many times—whipping up intimidation and threats of violence, hoping that the media will amplify it. When the poison of the far right leads to serious threats to Jess Phillips and others, then in my book a line has been crossed,” he added.Elon Musk’s involvement in UK politics has drawn international attention, with reactions ranging from support to criticism. On X, Musk conducted a poll asking whether Americans should “liberate” the British from their “tyrannical government,” further fueling the controversy.French President Emmanuel Macron also weighed in, expressing concerns about Musk’s growing interference in European political matters. Macron’s remarks echo broader apprehensions about the influence of high-profile individuals like Musk on sensitive political issues.","Elon Musk’s father, Errol, has publicly advised the people of the United Kingdom to disregard his son's recent comments on British politics. Errol Musk expressed his disapproval of Elon's foray into UK political discourse, emphasising that wealth and fame should not lend undue weight to his opinions. The controversy revolves around Elon Musk's statements on social media, where he criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer over their handling of a sensitive issue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117059726,imgsize-42898,width-400,resizemode-4/117059726.jpg"

EU court ‘fines’ European Commission for violating data privacy rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/eu-court-fines-european-commission-for-violating-data-privacy-rules/articleshow/117058926.cms,"Why EU court has fined the commission

A court in the European Union (EU) has sent a strong message on data protection to the European Commission (EC). In what can be termed as a landmark ruling, the EU General Court has ordered the Commission to pay damages to a German citizen for violating the bloc's own data protection rules.The court ordered the Commission to pay 400 euros ($412) in damages to the individual. While the fine is small, the decision is significant because it marks the first time an EU institution has been held financially liable for breaching the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).The case stemmed from the citizen's use of the “Sign in with Facebook” option on an EU webpage to register for a conference. The court found that the Commission transferred the user's IP address to Facebook parent company Meta Platforms in the US.This transfer essentially violated the GDPR regulations, as it lacked adequate safeguards for personal data. The GDPR – the first of its kind – is considered one of the world's strongest data privacy laws, and major companies like Klarna, Meta and LinkedIn have faced hefty fines for non-compliance.In 2023, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission fined Meta a record 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) for violating EU privacy laws by transferring the personal data of Facebook users to servers in the US, thereby violating EU’s data protection rules (GDPR).It also ordered the company to stop transferring data collected from Facebook users in Europe to the US. Regulators also said Meta failed to comply with a 2020 decision by the EU’s highest court that user data in the US was not sufficiently protected from American spy agencies.","The EU General Court has ordered the Commission to pay damages to a German citizen for violating the bloc's own data protection rules.

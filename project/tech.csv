Deutsche Bank analysts' warning on AI spend





Global stock markets, riding high on AI euphoria at the start of 2026 may be disregarding one of the biggest threats: A surge in inflation driven partly by the tech investment boom; warn analysts. According to a report in Reuters, the US stock indexes, where seven biggest technology companies (called Magnificent Seven) made double-digit gains in 2025 to hit record highs as exuberance about AI. For those unaware, the Magnificent Seven stocks are a group of high-performing and influential companies in the US stock market: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia. In the world of finance, the Magnificent Seven are a group of seven high-performing, influential stocks in the technology sector. The name comes from a 1960 John Sturges Western film, “The Magnificent Seven,” depicting a powerful group of seven gunmen.Analysts are reportedly worried that multi-trillion-dollar race by so-called hyperscalers like Microsoft, Meta and Alphabet to build new data centres is an inflationary force, because of the rate at which these projects are gobbling up energy and advanced chips. ""The costs are going up not down in our forecast, because there's inflation in chip costs and inflation in power costs,"" Morgan Stanley strategist Andrew Sheets told Reuters.In fact, the stock markets have already shown some early signs of nerves about rising costs and potential AI over-spending.Deutsche Bank sees the scale of capital expenditure (capex) investment going into AI as gargantuan. The Bank expects AI data-centre capital expenditure to reach as much as $4 trillion by 2030 and the rapid rollout of these projects could cause supply bottlenecks in chips and electricity that make investment costs spiral, the bank's analysts warned. According to Deutsche Bank, hyperscalers cumulative spend of $4 trillion on AI data centers through 2030 is more than the U.S. government’s moon-landing program in the 1960s: “10x [the] inflation-adjusted cost of Apollo programme with no guaranteed return.""You need a pin that pricks the bubble and it will probably come through tighter money,"" said Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management. He said that while he was holding on to big tech stocks for now he would not be surprised to see inflation booming worldwide by the end of 2026.","Deutsche Bank sees the scale of capital expenditure (capex) investment going into AI as gargantuan.

Microsoft Edge adopts Copilot's design language in major UI overhaul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-edge-adopts-copilots-design-language-in-major-ui-overhaul/articleshow/126359078.cms,"Microsoft is giving its Edge browser a significant visual overhaul, adopting the sleek design of its Copilot AI. This refresh, currently in testing, brings rounded corners and new color schemes across the browser's interface. This move signals a broader push for a unified, AI-driven look across Microsoft's services, aiming to integrate experiences rather than launch entirely new ones.

A unified look across Microsoft's AI tools





Microsoft is rolling out a visual refresh for its Edge browser, borrowing heavily from the design language of its Copilot AI assistant. The changes are currently being tested in early Canary and Dev channel builds, marking what could be the beginning of a broader design shift across Microsoft's product lineup.The redesign touches nearly every part of the browser interface. The new tab page, settings menu, context menus, and dropdown elements all now feature the rounded corners, color schemes, and typography that debuted with the Copilot app. According to Windows Central, these changes appear regardless of whether users have Copilot Mode enabled, though the new tab page adapts based on the setting.This move represents a departure from Microsoft's established Fluent Design system, which currently powers Windows 11, Xbox, and Office. The Copilot design language originally emerged after most of the Inflection AI team joined Microsoft in 2024, bearing striking similarities to the Pi AI assistant Inflection had developed.Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman confirmed last year that the company plans to evolve Edge rather than create an entirely new AI-focused browser. ""There isn't going to be a new browser; this is just going to be one experience,"" Suleyman told The Verge's Tom Warren.The Edge browser is not the only interface being reworked. In addition, Microsoft is also exploring the use of its copilot design language Copilot Discover, which is an AI-driven version of the MSN.com site. Although the new look has not been implemented in Windows or Xbox, the overall trend here is towards a unified look for its services, which is AI-driven.The new interface is currently in the preview stage, and it will probably be several weeks before it makes it to the stable version of the Edge browser.","Microsoft is rolling out a visual refresh for its Edge browser, borrowing heavily from the design language of its Copilot AI assistant.

"Zo​​mato parent Eternal’s CEO Deepinder Goyal asked Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa to step down twice after acquisition, here’s why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zomato-parent-eternals-ceo-deepinder-goyal-asked-blinkit-ceo-albinder-dhindsa-to-step-down-twice-after-acquisition-heres-why/articleshow/126356263.cms,"Left: Eternal CEO Deepinder Goyal | Right: Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsha

""Right after we acquired Blinkit, I asked him (Albinder) to leave. I told him, 'You will not be able to cut it.' He said okay. This happened twice during that timeframe, and we started the transition,""

""All of us have this armour. And when patient coaching runs out, I penetrate this armour. Me being angry is also because I care,""

What is Eternal CEO Deepinder Goyal said about ‘rock bottom phase’



""rock bottom""

""I call this rock bottom, where I hurt people, their self-confidence completely goes for a toss. I do this with people who I think have insane potential, but something in their head is coming in their way,

""

""Over time, the success rate of this is four out of five, where they come out of it,”





Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato 's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the food delivery service acquired Blinkit. Goyal explained that this move was part of his tough leadership reset method. Speaking on a video podcast with Raj Shamani, Goyal noted that these conversations took place soon after the acquisition of the quick commerce startup, when Dhindsa was struggling to adapt to the changes required after the integration.Goyal said on the podcast.These remarks offer a rare public look at how Goyal handles senior leadership changes at Eternal, which owns both Zomato and Blinkit, especially when founders or top executives need to adapt to a new company structure after an acquisition. Goyal explained his leadership style involves extended periods of coaching, but if no progress is made, he confronts the person directly.he noted.The situation reveals the challenges that can arise when successful startup founders join larger organisations through acquisitions and must adjust their working style to fit the new company's expectations.Describing what he calls aphase, Goyal said he sometimes purposely breaks down a leader's confidence to make them start fresh.he explained.According to Goyal, this method has worked most of the time.he added.However, Goyal did not confirm whether Dhindsa's job or duties officially changed during this time. Still, his comments show how intense the process was of bringing Blinkit into Eternal, especially as the company was growing both Blinkit and Zomato while facing more competition in quick commerce.Zomato bought Blinkit, which was previously known as Grofers, in 2022 for Rs 4,447 crore, or about $568 million at the time, in an all-stock deal. This marked Zomato's official entry into India's rapidly growing quick commerce business. Since buying the company, Blinkit has become a key growth area for Eternal, opening many new stores and handling more and more orders.","Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the acquisition of Blinkit.

EXPOSED: Mark Zuckerberg Embarrassed on Hot Mic Admitting Total Confusion During Trump Dinner





Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs in first half of 2025, Meta CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz. A Twitter user who goes by the moniker @HinataMotivates, said to be a tech-motivation account, shared a podcast clip (going back to 2022) where Zuckerberg talks about Meta hiring rule and his advice for college students. Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone and the one that he says is also an important tip for any college student. In an episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said that most people know Facebook ’s dorm-room origin story and that many have learned the wrong lesson from it. He said that his initial ability to launch Facebook wasn’t because he dropped out of college. According to Zuckerberg, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make in college. He advised college students that choosing their social circle is the most pivotal decision, as people tend to emulate those around them. “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he said in the podcast.“I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they’re basically building relationships [with]. ” Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University.While the group split up in a not-so-happy manner, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he tries to prioritize relationships over objectives. This applies especially to hiring. Zuckerberg said that he extends the idea to his Meta hiring philosophy: He only employs candidates he did hypothetically work for, underscoring reciprocity and alignment in professional networks. When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person. “I will only hire someone to work for me if I can see myself working for them,” he said.Mark Zuckerberg said that the strategy creates a work environment that’s both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you’ll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together. It’s all about finding personal compatibility, he said, not unlike “choosing friends or a partner.”","Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone.

Skyscanner has these three 'tips' for you to buy cheap air tickets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/skyscanner-has-these-three-tips-for-you-to-buy-cheap-air-tickets/articleshow/126355672.cms,"Tip 1: Know where it's cheapest to go

Flight prices can feel like a guessing game. One day a ticket costs one amount, the next day it's completely different. Many travelers end up spending more than they need to simply because they don't know when to book or where to look for deals. This is especially frustrating when you're trying to stick to a travel budget but still want to explore new places. Rather than endlessly searching different dates and destinations hoping to stumble upon a good deal, consider using tools that do the hard work for you.Skyscanner, which is a popular flight aggregator service, offers multiple useful tools that can help you find the cheapest air tickets without the hassle. These tools are designed to save you time and money and can be used by users if they're flexible about their destination, travel dates, or both. Here's everything you need to know about finding affordable flights using Skyscanner's three key tips.One of the biggest barriers to finding cheap flights is being locked into a specific destination. Skyscanner's ""Explore Everywhere"" feature solves this by letting you search for ""Everywhere"" rather than a particular city.The tool shows all places you can fly to from your airport, organised by price from cheapest to most expensive.To use the feature, users can visit Skyscanner’s website or app and enter their departure city. They can then select “Everywhere” as the destination and choose travel dates or pick the “Cheapest month” option if their plans are flexible. Skyscanner will show users destination results sorted by price, with filters available for direct flights, specific airlines, or regions. This can be a useful one for travellers who want the best deals and are open to different destinations.As flight prices change often, checking them every day can be time-consuming. To solve this issue, Skyscanner offers tools like Price Alerts and the Saved Feature. These tools help users to track fares automatically.The Saved feature works like a travel wishlist. This feature allows users to save flights and organise them into lists. Meanwhile, the ‘Price Alerts’ feature monitor these saved flights and notify users when prices change.Users who want to set up this feature will need to follow these steps:Once this feature is set up, it will make it easier for users to book at the right time without constantly checking flight ticket prices.One thing that matters the most while booking flights is the timing. Skyscanner's flexible dates feature shows prices for different days or months in one calendar view. This includes options such as thefeature, which identifies the month that has the lowest prices overall, while thetool provides day-by-day pricing for your chosen month.To use this feature, users have to enter their cities, click, and choose their preferred option. Once it's set up, users can review the grid showing the lowest recent fares and select dates that fit your budget. Both features work on Skyscanner’s desktop site and mobile app.The prices shown are estimates based on recent searches and can change quickly, so book soon when you find a good deal.

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

iPhone Fold expected design and features



iPhone Fold expected price







Apple is expected to launch its first foldable smartphone next year. Now, the long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders offering a clear look at the design of first foldable iPhone. As per the YouTube channel Front Page Tech and popular tipper Ice Universe, the design of Apple’s first foldable iPhone may resemble to Google’s Pixel Fold. As per the images leaked online, the yet-to-launch foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style foldable design.As per the leaks, the upcoming foldable iPhone is said to feature a large internal display and a smaller cover screen. The renders also highlight a minimal crease along with fold area where rival devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold have often drawn criticism. The design appears to prioritize durability and a seamless viewing experience, aligning with Apple’s reputation for premium hardware aesthetics.“The comparison of the design of the Samsung Galaxy Wide Fold and the Apple iPhone Fold is almost identical, with the only difference being the R-angle. Samsung is more square, while Apple is more rounded. Do you prefer the square one or the rounder one?,” wrote Ice Universe.Early leaks suggest that the first foldable iPhone may look and function differently from the current iPhone lineup. It is expected that the foldable iPhone may ditch the Face ID in order to accommodate the thinner foldable design. It is also said that the company may include a 24MP under-display selfie camera which will offer a cleaner and uninterrupted look to the display. The is also tipped that the foldable iPhone may feature another 24MP camera on the cover display making it easier for the users to take selfies or answer video calls.On the back, the foldable iPhone may feature a dual-lens setup with two 48MP sensors — one standard and one ultrawide — but no telephoto lens. This simplified camera system seems to be a design trade-off to maintain the slim build that a foldable phone requires. While the camera specs may sound modest compared to Apple’s Pro models, the focus for this device appears to be on delivering a sleek design, new display technology, and the flexibility of a foldable form factor.Multiple online rumours suggest that the upcoming Foldable iPhone may be priced around $2,399.","The long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders.

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta.

Elon Musk has recently focused attention on the AI tool for the creation of images and videos by xAI’s Grok Imagine, with a thread about guidelines for the creation of aesthetically attractive and cinematic content. Elon Musk recently posted a thread that directed attention to a guiding article by AI enthusiast @karatademada with instructions and explanations that highlight the effectiveness of storytelling in improving the output of AI-generated media. Unlike common AI tools for the creation of images that depend on the description of an object, Grok AI is highly successful with descriptions that focus on emotion, ambience, lighting, and camera angles, according to the article posted by Elon Musk.Grok Imagine is an AI-powered creative tool designed to help users generate cinematic-quality images and videos from simple text prompts. By combining advanced image generation with dynamic visual styling, it allows creators to experiment with lighting, composition, and motion without technical expertise.Users of Grok Imagine are taught one of the most important lessons in moving away from simple, descriptive prompts.Instead of writing, ""A woman walking on a street,"" for instance, they should be thinking about how to direct the scene: ""Cinematic shot of a woman walking alone on a rainy Paris street at night, reflections of neon lights on wet pavement, filmed in 4K, directed by Christopher Nolan, atmospheric and moody. "" By setting the mood and style, users really let the AI interpret the story behind an image rather than just objects in their own space.Grok Imagine does well with emotional context. Instead of ""A happy girl under the sun,"" a more illustrative and emotionally evocative prompt would be: “Close-up of a carefree young woman laughing under golden sunlight, wind blowing through her hair, summer energy, cinematic lens flare, warm tone."" By including how it should make the viewer feel in the image, the AI can create compositions that really carry emotional depth and engagement, making them appear much more lifelike and compelling.Camera perspective and cinematography terms are critical for creating dramatic scenes. Users are capable of defining a wide establishing shot, a low-angle shot, or a close-up shot. These definitions include: “Wide establishing shot of a futuristic city skyline at dawn, soft mist, glowing reflections on glass towers, slow camera pan,” or “Low-angle cinematic shot of a hero standing on a rooftop, coat flapping, sun behind silhouette. ” These descriptive terms enable Grok Imagine to render scenes with a cinematic perspective.The following five aspects must be involved within the prompt for high-quality results to be achieved consistently:By dissecting the prompt into these elements, it becomes certain that the AI will comprehend the entire scene and generate images that correspond to the user’s vision.Grok Imagine allows the refinement of images in increments. New scenes can be improved or changed by stating the additional elements: Same picture, but include soft morning sunlight filtering through the window, a cup of cappuccino on the table, and the Paris skyline reflected in the glass. In much larger ways, complete scene transformation is also accomplished: Change the same scene into a cyber café scene in the future, a place of holographic menus and digital rain.The creation of better AI-generated images is an iterative process. Users can take the advice offered to improve their prompts through the use of language, style, and composition. An example would be to take a basic prompt, Portrait of a woman holding flowers,"" and improve it in the following manner: Cinematic portrait of a woman holding yellow tulips; soft focus; 85mm lens; soft morning light.","Elon Musk recently posted an article about how to use Grok Imagine to create cinematic AI images and videos.

A militant group named the Vulkangruppe has claimed responsibility for an arson attack that disrupted power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses in Germany. In a 2,500-word protest letter, the group stated the act was a protest against the climate crisis and the role of artificial intelligence (AI). The attack, which occurred last week on a bridge crossing the Teltow canal, damaged high-voltage cables near the Lichterfelde heat and power station in Berlin.Stromnetz Berlin, the city's grid operator, reported that 35,000 households and 1,900 businesses may be without electricity and heat until January 8. According to a report by The Guardian, the group wrote that they specifically chose to target"" German state security authorities have opened an investigation into the incident.

Berlin had some snow over the weekend, and temperatures dropped well below freezing at night.Berlin's mayor, Kai Wegner, said that he believed the massive blackout was done for political reasons, while security experts said it looked like a previous far-left attack.Wegner told reporters during a visit to an emergency shelter for those without heat and hot water.With cell phone networks down, police used loudspeakers on their cars to tell people what was happening as they helped those who needed care. Several local train lines stopped running, and many students who were supposed to return to school this week may see their break extended into next week.A previous arson attack blamed on the far left in September 2025 knocked out power for 60 hours in the southeast part of the city in what was reportedly Berlin's most extended power cut since World War II.Early guesses for the weekend blackout had included possible Russian sabotage, as Germany has been closely watching for attacks on its infrastructure by other countries.In March 2024, Vulkangruppe claimed an arson attack against a power tower at the Tesla gigafactory outside Berlin that cut off electricity to the plant and temporarily stopped production.In its 2024 annual security report, Germany's domestic intelligence watchdog mentioned repeated attacks on the local power grid by Vulkangruppe, which it labels as a left-wing extremist group.It said the group, believed to be about 14 years old, chose targets for their, intending to cause destruction requiring painstaking and lengthy repairs with little concern for collateral damage.Stromnetz Berlin said that at first, 45,000 homes and 2,200 businesses in the districts of Nikolassee, Zehlendorf, Wannsee and Lichterfelde lost power starting last week. A day later, the company said on its website that about 10,000 homes and 300 businesses in Lichterfelde had had their electricity restored.But cold weather was making it harder to lay new underground cables, meaning the remaining homes may have to wait until later this week to get their lights and heat back on.Stromnetz Berlin noted.Experts said attacks on energy infrastructure required little specialist knowledge to have a significant impact, with maps showing key parts of the power grid widely available online and few backup plans ready to use in the event of sabotage.","The far-left group Vulkangruppe has claimed responsibility for an arson attack that disrupted power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses in Germany.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ However, he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

“The Old New Thing”

""Bill Gates asked me to contact you.""

What Microsoft engineer said about company’s method of handling angry customers



“A colleague of mine who used to work in product support told me that they had a procedure if a customer became irate and demanded to speak with Bill Gates. (This was, of course, back in the days when Bill Gates still ran the company.)

The product support technician would apologise for not resolving the problem to the customer’s satisfaction, but if the customer continued to demand to speak with The Boss, the technician would indeed transfer the customer.

The customer was transferred to a special internal phone number, and when the operators saw a call on that line, they took the call and said, “Bill Gates’s office.” They weren’t actually in Bill Gates’s office. They were just pretending to be Bill Gates’s secretary. Their job was to tell the caller that Mr. Gates is currently unavailable, but if the customer leaves a message and their contact information, they will pass the information to Mr. Gates.

Of course, I assume¹ the information was never actually passed along to Bill. The information went back into the product support channel with a note that the customer was escalated to “Bill Gates’s office.” The technician who returned the call would probably say something like “Bill Gates asked me to contact you to follow up on an issue you had earlier.”

Maybe Bill got a copy or a summary of these messages, I don’t know.”





Microsoft had a specific method for handling angry customers who demanded to speak with Bill Gates . According to veteran Microsoft engineer Raymond Chen, the company used to transfer these customers' calls to a special phone line where operators pretended to be the CEO's secretary. In hisblog, Chen noted that the software giant’s operators would tell customers that Gates was unavailable, take their complaint details, and route the information back to tech support, which would then call back, claiming,He explained that support teams followed this process when important customers became upset. If saying sorry and trying to fix the issue didn’t calm them down, the call was sent to a special internal number that sounded like Bill Gates’s office. He noted that this elaborate ruse satisfied angry customers without bothering the billionaire founder of the company, and the support team itself finally handled the issue. Chen revealed this while recounting the 30-year-old procedure used by the company's product support team.In his blog post, Chen wrote:","Microsoft had a specific method for handling angry customers who demanded to speak with Bill Gates.

“We've lost the whole cloud. We have lost the internet, let's be honest. If I want my information 100 per cent in the EU . . . keep on dreaming. You're setting an objective that is not realistic. In cyberspace, everything is commercial. Everything is privately owned,”

""Everybody was supporting the Airbus initiatives decades ago.

""I think on an EU level we should clearly identify what sovereignty means to us in the digital domain. Instead of putting that focus on how can we stop the US 'hyperscalers', maybe we put our energy in... building up something by ourselves,”

Belgium's cybersecurity chief, Miguel De Bruycker, has revealed that Europe faces andue to its heavy dependency on American companies for digital infrastructure. In a recent interview, the director of the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB) said that Europe has fallen so far behind the US in digital infrastructure that it has. De Bruycker told the Financial Times that it wasto store data fully in Europe because US companies dominate digital infrastructure across the continent. The Belgian official also warned that Europe's cyber defences even depend on the cooperation of private companies, most of which are American.he added. This dependence represents anfor the EU, said De Bruycker, who has led the CCB since it was founded a decade ago.Beyond security concerns, Europe is also missing out on crucial new technologies being developed in the US and elsewhere, he noted. These include cloud computing and artificial intelligence, both of which are vital for defending European countries against cyberattacks. These comments raise concerns within the European security community about the EU's digital infrastructure falling into the hands of foreign actors.Europe needs to develop its own capabilities to enhance innovation and security, De Bruycker said, adding that legislation such as the EU's AI Act, which regulates the fast-developing technology, wasinnovation. He suggested that EU governments should support private efforts to build scale in areas such as cloud computing or digital identification technologies.It could be similar to when European countries jointly created the planemaker Airbus, he said:Companies such as OVHcloud in France and Schwarz Digital in Germany already provide essential digital infrastructure, according to IT experts.EU countries have been worried about their reliance on US tech companies such as Amazon, with growing calls to increase Europe'sHowever, De Bruycker said those discussions were oftenand lacked focus.he noted.Belgium, as a host of the EU institutions and NATO, has faced increased hybrid attacks allegedly staged by Russia, with more cyber assaults and drone incursions into its airspace since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Last year, Belgium experienced five waves of DDoS attacks lasting days, in which compromised devices overwhelmed the websites of businesses and government agencies, temporarily shutting them down. De Bruycker said the attacks typically targeted up to 20 different organisations per day, withgenerally behind them. Although it was unclear whether the Kremlin was directly sponsoring them, the attacks typically followed as a response to anti-Russian statements by politicians.he said.Although such attacks have increased, De Bruycker does not see them as particularly harmful and says they are primarily aimed at disruption. He said,After Russia invaded Ukraine, the US hyperscalers were crucial in helping salvage data from Russian attacks, De Bruycker added.He also expressed confidence in continued cooperation with American companies to crack down on bad actors, despite US tech companies having aligned themselves closely with the Trump administration, which has repeatedly signalled it would step away from supporting Europe's security.","Belgium's cybersecurity chief Miguel De Bruycker says Europe has ""lost the internet"" and cannot guarantee data stays within the EU.

"Deepinder Goyal’s Temple wearable explained: How the device works, tracks blood flow, brain health, and ageing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deepinder-goyals-temple-wearable-explained-how-the-device-works-tracks-blood-flow-brain-health-and-ageing/articleshow/126349099.cms,"Image source: YouTube

What Deepinder Goyal’s Temple device tracks and why brain blood flow matters



‘ Gravity Ageing Hypothesis ’ behind Deepinder Goyal’s Temple device



Deepinder Goyal’s personal role in testing the Temple







Zomato co-founder Deepinder Goyal on Raj Shamani’s Figuring Out podcast , which sparked interest not just for the content of Goyal's remarks but also for entirely different reasons. Online viewers were quick to notice a tiny metallic object that appeared to be affixed to Goyal’s Temple area, sparking rapid speculation throughout social networks. On one hand, comments tapered off into joking around about it possibly being some kind of chewing gum or perhaps a hidden charging connection for his phone or other devices. In truth, there is far more to this tiny device than one can imagine. Its name is Temple, and it is currently one such wearable that focuses on brain functions by monitoring the flow of blood in real time.Temple is a small wearable device resembling a clip that is clipped on the side of the Temple. This device continuously tracks blood circulation to the brain. The amount of blood supply that reaches the brain is understood to be a very relevant pointer to overall neurological function and the ageing processes of the brain. The continuous tracking offered by Temple will allow the wearer to see patterns of blood circulation when they are at work and active versus when they rest or are stressed.The brain requires a stabilised and constant blood supply to function.Any alteration in the blood flow to the brain has been associated with fatigue, lack of concentration, memory problems, and ageing-related cognitive impairments. Researchers have been studying the above in controlled environments with the aid of giant imaging machines, with continuous monitoring in real-life situations not easily possible. Temple seeks to fill the above gap by studying the brain in normal life situations rather than in a controlled environment.Temple's growth is based on what Goyal calls the ‘Gravity Ageing Hypothesis’. This proposal implies that the effect of the force of gravity pulling for many years may lead to a slight effect on the circulation of blood in the body, specifically the energy involved in pushing the blood towards the head for the brain to function properly. According to the hypothesis, the loss of effectiveness in the circulation of blood in the head may contribute to the ageing process. Although the hypothesis is popular, scepticism surrounds the idea because ageing is known to involve a complex interaction of genetic factors, environment, lifestyle, and diseases.Although it has generated a lot of buzz, Temple is still neither a Zomato product nor available for public use. The product has been privately developed by the parent organisation of Zomato, named Eternal, as a part of Goyal's private research initiative named Continue Research. The level of investment made into this project by Goyal has reportedly been to the tune of $25 million. There has been no declaration on the regulatory approval and pricing of the product, which again indicates it is purely a product in the experimental phase.Goyal has not used Temple as a completed product or as the result of a product launch. Rather, Goyal has been using the device on himself for the past year. This has been the result of his interest in health optimisation for quite some time, which has been previously stated by Goyal through public statements. This has included the use of tracking biological markers, fasting schedules, and other health-optimising modalities. Temple represents the natural continuation of these experiments, as Goyal could study the effects of these modalities on blood flow to the brain, with ongoing self-experimentation, data collection, transparency, and iterative refinement methods.",Temple is a small wearable device resembling a clip that is clipped on the side of the Temple.

Mark Cuban on biggest barrier for students





American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions”. However, he said that students should not rely much on AI. Instead, they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results,” he said adding “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”.In an interview with CNBC’s Make It last year, Cuban said that tomorrow’s leaders might be today’s AI-obsessed kids. “Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that’s needed in the future workplace,” he said adding: “Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.”During the interview, Mark Cuban said that “Access is the biggest barrier” to students being taught how to best use AI tools effectively and ethically at school. According to Samsung’s new Solve for Tomorrow 2025 AI Readiness Study, 80% of US teachers believe that learning AI skills is important for students’ success in the future. However, research shows that educators have expressed concern over misuse of AI tools to cheat, or that the information obtained from AI models will include errors that spread misinformation.But Cuban has asserted that students need to learn to use AI tools properly and productively. He has previously likened the current AI boom to past technological revolutions, particularly the rise of computers and the internet. “Spend as much time as possible familiarizing yourself with the latest AI tools and models, so you can impress future employers with your up-to-date prompt engineering and model customization skills,” an advice that he often gives to students, per a CNBC report.Speaking on an episode of the “TBPN” podcast in 2025, Mark Cuban said”“Every single company needs that. There is nothing intuitive for a company to integrate AI, and that’s what people don’t understand. That is going to be jobs left and right.”","Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions” He said that they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126352688,imgsize-29300,width-400,resizemode-4/billionaire-mark-cuban-has-a-success-tip-for-students-ai-will-help-students-think-bigger-but-it-doesn39t-.jpg"

Goldman Sachs: Companies discussing AI in the context of employees or layoffs appear to ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/goldman-sachs-companies-discussing-ai-in-the-context-of-employees-or-layoffs-appear-to-/articleshow/126351092.cms,"Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more

'Clear evidence of layoffs directly motivated by AI remains limited'





Is AI leading to layoffs? This is the biggest question that analysts across spectrum have been trying to gauge. Goldman Sachs' recent economic analysis shows a bifurcated picture of artificial intelligence’s impact on the workforce. The findings are claimed to be based on an analysis of third quarter corporate earnings of nearly all the S&P 500 companies and results commentary by senior economist Ronnie Walker. While the analysis showed that a relationship between overall labor market outcomes and AI exposure at the economy-wide level has yet to be established, it also showed something else.“While we still do not find a relationship between labor market outcomes and AI exposure at the economy-wide level,” Walker wrote, “we find that companies that have discussed AI in the context of their workforce have cut their job openings more sharply this year.” Indeed, Walker wrote that most components of Goldman’s layoff tracker “increased notably” in recent months. He highlighted that the companies discussing AI in the context of their workforce or layoffs “indeed appear to be pulling back disproportionately on hiring. ” Walker said that management teams are increasingly viewing AI not just as a tool for efficiency but as a core component of their future human capital strategy, leading to preemptive cuts in new roles.Walker’s piece agrees with a previous analysis by his Goldman colleagues David Mericle and Pierfrancesco Mei, who argued in October that “jobless growth” may become a new normal feature of the post-pandemic economy. In his analysis, Walker found that the companies that most frequently discussed tariffs had “disproportionately cut job openings this year.” Some companies reportedly noted that they planned to reduce costs by “hiring less, reducing headcount, or pursuing productivity-enhancing initiatives (such as investing in AI solutions). ” Goldman Sach's research shows that AI has quickly become a central topic in conversations about headcount within the tech sector since November 2022.Walker found a “bifurcated” outlook, as his research agreed with many economists’ arguments that the U.S. has a “K-shaped economy,” where consumer spending is strong overall, but concerns about lower-income health abound. This underperformance is expected to continue for the low-end consumer into 2026, Walker wrote, reflecting tepid job growth and pressure from benefit cuts.In a related research in October 2025, Goldman Sach's economists Manuel Abecasis and Pierfrancesco Mei wrote, “So far, we do not find clear evidence that most of the increase in these measures is directly motivated by AI, even if we see large increases in tech layoffs across both the Challenger and WARN measures.” They added, “As our portfolio strategy team noted, only a small number of S&P 500 firms have explicitly referenced AI when discussing large-scale layoffs. Most companies instead point to the need to streamline and restructure operations, sometimes attributing these changes to new technologies that enable efficiency gains.”",Goldman Sachs' recent economic analysis shows a bifurcated picture of artificial intelligence’s impact on the workforce.

PWC US CEO Paul Griggs on what made the company change its stance on Crypto,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/pwc-us-ceo-paul-griggs-on-what-made-the-company-change-its-stance-on-crypto/articleshow/126350160.cms,"""The

Genius Act

and the regulatory rulemaking around stablecoin I expect will create more conviction around leaning into that product and that asset class. The tokenisation of things will certainly continue to evolve as well. PwC has to be in that ecosystem,”

What PWC US CEO Paul Griggs said about the Genius Act

“We feel a responsibility to be hyper-engaged on both sides of the business. Whether we are doing work in the audit space or doing work in the consulting arena — we do all the above in crypto — we see more and more opportunities coming our way,”

“We are never going to lean into a business that we haven’t equipped ourselves to deliver. Over the last 10 to 12 months, as we’ve taken on more opportunities in that digital assets arena, we’ve bolstered our resource pool inside and outside,”





PWC has shifted its outlook on cryptocurrency . PWC US CEO Paul Griggs has confirmed that the company, which is also known as one of the Big Four accounting firms, has decided to “lean in” to cryptocurrency work following the Trump administration’s support for digital assets such as Bitcoin. This shift follows years of the company taking a cautious stance on cryptocurrency. In an interview with the Financial Times (FT), Griggs said that the reversal occurred as the US appointed pro-crypto regulators and Congress passed new laws, such as the “Genius Act”, to govern the industry.Griggs said to FT.These comments reflect how the Trump administration's cryptocurrency policy moves have convinced established businesses that they can enter the digital asset market that many had previously avoided. The change comes as regulatory clarity around digital assets has improved in the US, with new frameworks addressing stablecoins and other crypto products that previously existed in legal uncertainty.The Genius Act, signed into law by US President Donald Trump in July, was the first rule issued by the country for digital tokens tied to tangible assets like the US dollar. This law now allows banks to create and launch their own digital currencies.The Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Paul Atkins, whom Trump appointed, has also made creating rules for cryptocurrency a top priority. In comparison, this is a complete change from the Biden administration, which was hostile toward digital assets.Greggs explained.Until recently, the Big Four accounting firms had largely avoided auditing crypto businesses in the US. They also set strict conditions for working with crypto clients, partly because US regulators were wary of the sector. Regulators worldwide have long raised concerns about crypto, citing risks to consumers and financial stability, as well as its use in fraud and money laundering.After a shift in US policy, PwC began actively advising companies on how they could use crypto technology. According to Griggs, PwC has told clients that tools like stablecoins could help make payment systems more efficient.Other Big Four companies are moving in the same direction. Deloitte, which has audited Coinbase since 2020, released its first “digital assets roadmap” for crypto accounting in May. KPMG has said 2025 could be a turning point for wider digital asset adoption and is promoting services focused on crypto compliance and risk management.PwC has also added crypto-related audit clients, including Bitcoin miner Mara Holdings, which appointed PwC in March. The firm is also pitching tax advice linked to digital assets.Griggs became PwC’s US senior partner in 2024 after nearly 30 years at the firm, during which he led the audit of Goldman Sachs and worked on career development programmes.He said PwC had to bring in outside talent to strengthen its crypto expertise. This included hiring senior partners such as Cheryl Lesnik, who rejoined PwC after spending three years working with crypto clients at a smaller accounting firm.Griggs added.","PwC US CEO Paul Griggs said the company has decided to ‘lean in’ to cryptocurrency work.

This follows Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun's exit, signaling a shift from fundamental research to commercial AI products. The unit faces internal turmoil and resource constraints as Meta prioritizes generative AI initiatives.

FAIR's identity crisis: From blue-sky research to product focus

Tensions simmer as LeCun criticizes LLM-focused strategy





Meta's famed AI research division has lost yet another senior leader, with VP Jitendra Malik announcing his departure to join Amazon's robotics efforts. The exit comes amid mounting turmoil at FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), which some former employees have described as ""dying a slow death"" as Meta pivots aggressively toward commercial AI products. Malik's resignation follows chief AI scientist Yann LeCun's recent departure and adds to a growing exodus of top researchers who helped build Meta's reputation as an AI powerhouse.Malik, who split his time between Meta's FAIR lab and UC Berkeley, announced on January 4 that he will lead Amazon's robotics research in San Francisco starting January 5. ""It is time to move on,"" he wrote on X, highlighting accomplishments including video action recognition models, tactile sensors, and the recent SAM 3D breakthrough in computer vision.The departure caps a tumultuous year for FAIR, a unit once considered Meta's crown jewel in AI development. Since CEO Mark Zuckerberg launched his ""year of intensity"" push in January 2025, the lab has undergone multiple reorganizations, faced budget constraints, and seen more than half the authors of the original Llama research paper leave within months of publication.Former FAIR researchers told Fortune earlier this year that Meta has steadily deprioritized open-ended exploration in favor of product-driven initiatives under the GenAI organization.The lab now gets less computing power than teams focused on generative AI, according to ex-employees, though Meta declined to confirm resource allocation details.In August, Meta consolidated its AI efforts by dividing the Superintelligence Labs into four teams, creating confusion over project ownership and team assignments. The reshuffling was followed by 600 job cuts in October, and Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang framed the layoffs necessary to accelerate decision-making.That instability was compounded when LeCun left to pursue his own project on ""world models""—a path different from that of the large language models that now define Meta's approach to AI. In a December Financial Times interview, LeCun admitted Meta's Llama 4 results were ""fudged a little bit"" and criticized the company's ""LLM-pilled"" direction as incompatible with achieving superintelligence.Former research scientist Tian Yuandong, who left Meta in November, told Chinese media that internal conflicts emerged as computing resources became scarce amid the industrywide LLM race. Another ex-employee, Joena Zhang, wrote that ""nobody really knew what anyone was doing"" during the first half of 2025 at what's now called Meta Superintelligence Labs.Meta says it remains committed to FAIR, and employee sentiment surveys of recent times indicate improvement: Optimism was at 80% by late 2025.","Meta's AI research division, FAIR, is experiencing significant leadership departures.

Video of Lat One v0.1 test flight.

uSTOL achieved. Achievement unlocked

The plane crashed a bit later, which we knew was going to happen, and our simulations had already suggested so, due to structural defects. However, the main objective of the test flight was to test uSTOL, which was successfully demonstrated.

We are already building Lat One v0.2, which should hopefully complete a mission. Making a plane take off is only 20% of the problem. Making it land safely is where the work lies.

Overall, we learnt so much from this entire experience. We will come out better and stronger from this.

When Deepinder Goyal predicted the crash

India has tried building gas turbine engines before. And we’ve come close.

At LAT, we want to get past the finish line. So we’re putting together a propulsion research team in Bangalore, focused solely on building gas turbine engines from scratch. Lightweight. Efficient. Flight-ready. Made in India.

What’s different this time?

We’re giving engineers the freedom to think, build, break, and repeat. Our dedicated research centre — with labs for combustion, turbomachinery, thermal systems, and materials, will give engineers the space and freedom to iterate fast, and get to real outcomes at a speed which is unprecedented in the industry.

Also, this team will be led by engineers. No waiting around for approvals from ""business"" people. No chasing slides or meetings. Just hands-on problem solving, running bench tests, working with suppliers, building hardware from scratch — and pushing the limits of design and physics every day.

It won’t be easy. But if it works, it changes everything. A full engine stack, built locally. Powering STOL aircraft. UAVs. Remote connectivity. Self-reliance.

If you’ve ever built turbines, rotors, control systems — or anything close — and want to be part of something that could one day, rewrite history, write to us at engines@lat.com

Coding Agents have divided developers across the spectrum



How good or bad is the quality of code AI can generate

Complimenting a competitor





A Google principal engineer named Jaaana Dogan has almost gone 'viral' along with her post on how AI has transformed coding in the last one year. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Dogan wrote, ""I'm not joking and this isn't funny. We have been trying to build distributed agent orchestrators at Google since last year. There are various options, not everyone is aligned... I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour."" The post that has so far received almost 7 million views has triggered a debate on the role of AI tools like Claude, Google Gemini and others in software coding, with advocates on both sides.Soon after her post on using Claude Code for coding went viral, Dogan clarified that the code generated is not perfect but a good start. ""It's not perfect and I'm iterating on it but this is where we are right now. If you are skeptical of coding agents, try it on a domain you are already an expert of. Build something complex from scratch where you can be the judge of the artifacts,"" she wrote. Talking of Vibe Coding, and how it existed in some form earlier too, she wrote, ""The idea of everyone building software intimidates people.For me, growing up in the 80s and early 90s was unique because we used to program our own personal computers. Programming was an activity for everyone who had a computer.""Dogan lamented that Coding Agents have divided the developer community and that she has never seen a trend that has been as divisive. ""Since working on programming languages, I haven't seen this kind of polarized response from the developer community. There is a ton of hype & fluff about coding agents, which unfortunately often drowns out the genuinely good work being done. Things don't have to be this divisive."" She added in another after a series of posts on the topic, ""Coding agents are the most divisive subject. There are people who genuinely want to learn, there are skeptics, and there are people who are so dogmatic that they want to remove all sorts of communication on this subject. 2026 will be an interesting year.""Dogan said that the developer community has always been divided in camps, and went on to describe three. She wrote: ""The developer community has always been divided into a few camps:- People who are open to new modern tools- People who are building tools with new modern toolsand- People who think you should lose your job for using any modern tools.""When prompted on the quality of the code generated by Claude, Dogan said, ""To cut through the noise on this topic, it’s helpful to provide more more context:- We have built several versions of this system last year. - There are tradeoffs and there hasn't been a clear winner.- When prompted with the best ideas that survived, coding agents are able to go very far and generate a good decent toy version in an hour or so.""The Google engineer called all the controversy around Coding Agents on layoffs. ""All the controversy around coding agents is just a symptom. Where we are as an industry and the state of the job market is the main issue here since the beginning,"" she said.When asked about using a competitor's tool, Dogan said, ""This industry has never been a zero-sum game, so it’s easy to give credit where it’s due even when it's a competitor. Claude Code is impressive work, I'm excited and more motivated to push us all forward.""","Google engineer Jaaana Dogan has almost gone 'viral' along with her post on how AI has transformed coding in the last one year. The post that has so far received almost 7 million views has triggered a debate on the role of AI tools like Claude, Google Gemini and others in software coding.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126346789,imgsize-1323483,width-400,resizemode-4/how-vibe-coding-may-be-39sidelining39-engineers-at-meta39s-superintelligence-labs.jpg"
Ashley St Clair alleges Elon Musk’s Grok ‘undressed’ her childhood images; sparking AI safety concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ashley-st-clair-alleges-elon-musks-grok-undressed-her-childhood-images-sparking-ai-safety-concerns/articleshow/126345938.cms,"Ashley St Clair’s claims against Elon Musk’s AI tool Grok

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report

Widespread misuse of Grok’s image-manipulation features

What sparked the Grok digital undressing backlash





Ashley St Clair has accused Elon Musk ’s AI chatbot Grok of generating sexually suggestive edits of her photographs without consent, including images taken when she was only 14 years old. The allegations have surfaced amid growing concern over Grok’s ability to digitally alter images on X in response to explicit user prompts. St Clair, a columnist who previously made headlines after claiming she shares a child with Musk, says the incident represents a serious breach of consent, safety, and child protection laws. Her public statements have intensified scrutiny on xAI and its safeguards, while also reopening wider debates around AI misuse, accountability, and the risks faced by women and minors on large social media platforms.Ashley St Clair asserts that she found that Grok had reproduced modified pictures of her despite assurances that this chatbot would not create non-consensual pictures. On X, she began writing a series of messages where she accused Grok of sharing such pictures despite her objections. She demanded that this chatbot remove the posts and identification details that would be needed in case of legal proceedings against xAI.The most problematic part of the allegation from St Clair is the imagery that she was 14 at the time it was produced. Grok generated a bikini picture in response to an instruction from a user.The original picture was a child's image that had been transformed. According to a media article quoting the now-deleted Facebook account of the alleged victim, Grok was accused by the victim of making things that might make them uncomfortable in the future. Despite the imagery not involving full nudity, the alleged victim expressed the desire for it to be deleted.St Clair was quite expressive when she condemned the incident, with Grok’s actions described as ‘horrifying’ and ‘illegal’ by the Instagram spokesperson. St Clair has denied charges that her reaction to the incident is a product of her own hatred for Mike Krieger, explaining that this is a matter that involves safety. St Clair has given various reasons for her stand, including that the situation is rather contradictory.Concerns about Grok have been given further strength by a Reuters investigation. Reporters assessed public inputs given to the chatbot over a short period, finding over 100 attempts to use the image-manipulation tool in the digital alteration of photographs to partially undress individuals in the image. These are mostly young females, although there are also requests for males, public figures, and pets, highlighting systemic safeguards gaps, ethical risks, and urgent regulatory oversight.X has been inundated by images of women displayed in minimal clothing and/or changed clothing, all produced by the use of AI images. These images primarily followed the activation of Grok to ""undress"" women and display them in bikinis. The chatbot was known to have responded to a vast array of these requests, thereby editing the images of women into sexually explicit images of themselves without their consent. The response of the women was not long in coming in the form of complaints.The allegations being made against St Clair concern important aspects of consent, safety features of AI, and child safety laws. However, looking at the situation in its entirety, there is a growing need for greater control over the use of generative AI technology, putting pressure once again on Elon Musk and his ventures to be accountable.",Ashley St Clair has accused Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok of generating sexually suggestive edits of her photographs without consent.

Ten technology trends to watch in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ten-tech-trends-to-watch-in-2026/articleshow/126344580.cms,"After years of AI hype, 2026 brings a reality check. Companies need to prove their billion-dollar bets are worth it. Data centres are spreading globally, straining power grids. AI agents are moving from pilots to production. Robots are getting smarter. New hardware forms are arriving. Meanwhile, tech billionaires keep getting richer. The gap between hype and deployment is shrinking fast, and 2026 could turn out to be a real pivoting year.

AI shifts from hype to payback

Data centres spread across the globe

Work gets reimagined

Hardware gets weird new forms

Computing gets smarter, not just bigger

New models go beyond text

Robots become real(er)

The startup birth rate soars

Tech billionaires get even richer

What the 2026 really looks like





After years of AI hype and billion-dollar bets, 2026 is shaping up to be a reality check for the tech industry. Companies that dumped money into generative AI tools now face a simple question: show us the value, or shut it down.The pace of change isn't slowing. If anything, it's getting faster. Tools that seemed cutting-edge six months ago already feel outdated. Companies are racing to stay ahead, while also trying to prove their investments weren't wasted.Here are the ten trends in technology to watch out for in 2026.The experimental phase is over. Enterprises spent 2024 and 2025 testing AI pilots and proof-of-concept projects. Now they want measurable returns on those investments.""2026 is the 'show me the money' year for AI,"" says Venky Ganesan, a partner at Menlo Ventures. Companies will demand hard ROI numbers. Those that can't deliver value will see their software renewals drop and their fundraising dry up.This pressure will split the market. Some AI companies will thrive by solving specific problems well. Others will struggle or fail entirely. Ganesan predicts at least one major AI company will face severe financial trouble or bankruptcy in 2026.The flip side: successful companies could go public. Both OpenAI and SpaceX are eyeing IPOs at valuations near $1 trillion. If these launches succeed, they'll create a wave of new wealth and validate AI's business potential.You heard a lot about data centres in 2025. Get ready to hear more in 2026.The infrastructure boom that started in the US and China is going global. India is attracting massive investment from tech giants. Microsoft committed $17.5 billion to new data centres there. Before Microsoft's CEO left the stage at that announcement, Amazon declared it would spend $35 billion on its own facilities. Google and Meta quickly followed with their own multi-billion dollar plans.Southeast Asia is seeing double-digit growth in data centre capacity. Brazil wants to become Latin America's hub. Saudi Arabia and the UAE struck $600 billion in AI deals with the US, including plans for the largest AI campus outside America.This expansion creates real problems. These facilities consume enormous amounts of electricity and water. In hot regions, cooling requirements push consumption even higher. Brazil has already seen blackouts tied to data centre demand. Local communities often can't find out how much power and water a facility will use, thanks to legal secrecy.China offers a warning: just because you build it doesn't mean they'll come. The country rushed to construct about 150 new data centres in 2024. Now up to 80% of that new computing capacity sits unused, struggling to find customers.AI hasn't replaced most workers yet. Even though it has impacted a big number of workers, changing how work gets done in particular niches.Coding looks completely different than it did five years ago. Developers use AI assistants that can generate, debug, and refactor code. The technology has matured enough that these tools genuinely save time. Customer service is being handed over to chatbots, despite customer frustration.AI agents were the buzzword of 2025, but most stayed in pilot programs. Only 11% of organisations actually deployed them in production, despite 38% running tests. The gap between pilot and production tells the real story. Many companies automated broken processes instead of redesigning their operations from scratch. That approach rarely works.In 2026, agents will become more capable and trustworthy. They'll handle complex, multi-step tasks without constant human oversight. Think booking entire trips, negotiating better service rates, or managing workflows across different systems. ""A year from now, answering questions will be the least useful thing AI can do,"" says Fidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications. ""We'll have proactive AI assistants constantly running in the background, getting things done for us. ""But there's a catch. Many companies will spin out hundreds of agents per employee, only to see most sit idle. Without proper integration into existing workflows, these agents become expensive shelfware. The winners will be companies that connect agents to deterministic systems and give them clear, focused tasks.The smartphone has looked basically the same for a decade: a big black screen with some buttons on the side. That's changing.Apple is rumoured to release a folding phone in 2026. Android devices have already gone this route, even including some phones that fold twice. But Apple's loyal customer base could make folding screens mainstream.Then, a lot of others are also racing to build the first successful AI hardware device. OpenAI invested $6.5 billion in Jony Ive's startup, which is working on a physical AI product. The Humane pin and Friend necklace both made noise but never caught on. Humane has already shut down.Smart glasses present the most promising direction. They're already popular, and Meta dominates the space. In 2026, expect these devices to get smarter and more common. They offer a natural way to interact with AI without pulling out your phone.You'll also see AI show up in places you didn't ask for it. Samsung already added its Bixby assistant to refrigerators back in 2024. Hotels might offer smart duvets. Your rental car might have an AI assistant. Not all of this will be useful or wanted.The AI infrastructure race is shifting from raw scale to efficiency. You can't keep throwing more computing power at every problem.""2026 will be the year of frontier versus efficient model classes,"" says Kaoutar El Maghraoui, a principal research scientist at IBM. Next to huge models with billions of parameters, you'll see efficient, hardware-aware models running on modest accelerators.The hardware race won't only be about GPUs anymore. ASICs, chiplet designs, analogue inference, and quantum-assisted optimisers will all mature. A new class of chips designed specifically for running AI agents could emerge.Think of it like air traffic control for AI workloads. Computing power will be packed more densely and routed dynamically. If one job slows, another moves in instantly. Nothing sits idle. This makes infrastructure smarter, more sustainable, and more adaptable.Quantum computing is also reaching an inflection point. Microsoft, Google, and others believe quantum machines will start tackling problems that classical computers can't handle. Hybrid systems that combine quantum, AI, and supercomputers could drive breakthroughs in materials science, drug development, and climate modelling.Large language models dominated AI development for the past few years. They predict the next word in a sequence. In 2026, a different approach could take centre stage: world models.World models work by learning from videos, simulations, and spatial inputs. Instead of predicting the next word, they predict what happens next in the physical world. They model how things move over time.This matters for robotics, video games, and any application where AI needs to understand cause and effect without being explicitly programmed. World models can grasp concepts like gravity or momentum just by watching.Google, Meta, and Chinese companies like Tencent are all developing world models. Yann LeCun, one of AI's pioneers, left Meta to launch a world model startup. Fei-Fei Li's company World Labs released its first model in 2025.At the same time, Europe is moving in a different direction: small language models. These are lightweight versions of LLMs designed to run on smartphones or low-powered computers. They use fewer parameters and consume less energy, but they can still handle text generation, translation, and question-answering.Small models make economic sense amid talk of the AI bubble bursting. They cost less to build, less to run, and don't require massive data centres. European governments are increasingly wary of depending on American AI infrastructure, which could accelerate investment in smaller, more sustainable models.AI security becomes mission-criticalAI creates a cybersecurity paradox: the same capabilities driving business innovation are also introducing new risks. In 2026, organisations will face mounting pressure to secure AI systems while defending against AI-powered attacks.The threats are multiplying fast. Shadow AI deployments bypass security controls. Adversarial attacks manipulate models into producing wrong outputs. AI agents operating with broad system access create new attack surfaces. ""Every agent should have similar security protections as humans,"" says Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security.Even OpenAI is sounding the alarm. CEO Sam Altman recently acknowledged that AI models are ""starting to present some real challenges,"" including models that are ""so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities."" The company is actively hiring a new Head of Preparedness to study emerging AI-related risks, from cybersecurity threats to mental health impacts. The role comes with a $555,000 salary, reflecting how seriously the company takes these challenges.Companies will need to secure four domains: data, models, applications, and infrastructure. Defenders are fighting back with AI agents for red teaming, adversarial training, and automated threat detection at machine speed.Robots are nothing like what they used to be. From pre-programmed machines, they are evolving into adaptive systems capable of perception, learning, and autonomous operation. Physical AI is breaking out of warehouses and into mainstream use.Amazon has already deployed its millionth robot, and if the company is to be believed, AI coordinates entire fleets, and that’s helping them save travel time by about 10%. At BMW plants, cars now drive themselves along production routes. The real magic, however, is when world models combine with robotics, allowing systems to comprehend their surroundings and adapt to surprises.The next frontier is humanoid robots that can navigate spaces designed for humans, as companies race to craft machines capable of doing just that. The potential stretches across manufacturing, healthcare, and disaster response, and is increasingly accessible beyond the early adopters as costs fall.AI coding tools are making it easier than ever to build software. The result: a wave of new startups hitting the market in 2026.Tools like Replit, Cursor, and Loveable let people build products without engineering backgrounds. You can go from idea to working software faster than ever before. Building AI agents is also getting simpler. Business users can create them without touching code.Not every startup will make it. Markets will get crowded. Competition will heat up. But the sheer number of new companies will reshape the landscape and push established players to move faster.Tech's wealthiest executives are about to get a lot wealthier. Ten top earners added $550 billion to their fortunes in 2025. The trend isn't slowing down.Two massive IPOs are coming: OpenAI and SpaceX, both valued near $1 trillion. SpaceX's debut will add tens of billions to Elon Musk's net worth, which already sits around $600 billion. He's also eligible for two Tesla pay packages worth a combined $1.056 trillion. Sam Altman stands to benefit from OpenAI's listing, along with major backers like Microsoft. Jeff Bezos Mark Zuckerberg , and Satya Nadella have all seen their wealth climb as AI investments pay off.Larry Ellison might be the exception. Oracle's stock dropped hard as investors questioned AI spending, erasing $80 billion in market value.Every trend in tech seems to point in one direction: more wealth flowing upward. The AI boom, the data centre buildout, the chip shortage, the agent revolution—all of it concentrates power and money in fewer hands. A handful of tech executives now wield enormous influence over technology that affects everyone's daily life.Every trend here points to the same reality: the distance between hype and deployment is collapsing. Tech used to take years to move from labs to living rooms. Now it takes months, sometimes weeks.This creates winners and losers fast. Companies that can't prove AI's value will fold. Workers in certain fields will find their jobs radically different or gone entirely. Cities welcoming data centres might face power shortages they didn't plan for. Meanwhile, a small group of tech billionaires keeps getting richer off all of it, concentrating more control over systems that affect billions of people.The pace isn't slowing down. If anything, 2026 will be the year when that becomes impossible to ignore.","After years of AI hype, 2026 brings a reality check. Companies need to prove their billion-dollar bets are worth it.

Samsung Electronics co-CEO shares 'Google plan' to increase Galaxy smartphone sale,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-plans-to-double-gemini-powered-ai-devices-to-800-million-in-2026-says-co-ceo-t-m-roh/articleshow/126344246.cms,"No company immune to memory chip shortage





Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh said that the company aims to double the number of its mobile devices with AI features powered by Google's Gemini in 2026. By 2025, the South Korean firm had rolled out Gemini-backed AI features to about 400 million mobile products, including smartphones and tablets. It now plans to boost that figure to 800 million in the current year. “We will apply AI to all products, all functions, and all services as quickly as possible,” Roh told news agency Reuters in his first interview since becoming the company’s co-CEO in November. With the move, Samsung seeks to reclaim its lost crown from Apple in the smartphone market, the report says. It also aims to fend off competition from Chinese rivals not only in mobile telephones, but televisions and home appliances, all overseen by Roh.Roh said that other than search, consumers o frequently use a range of generative AI editing and productivity tools for images and others, as well as translation and summary features on smartphones.As per the report, Roh expects the adoption of AI to accelerate, as Samsung's surveys on awareness of its Galaxy AI brand jumped to a level of 80% from about 30% in just one year. ""Even though the AI technology might seem a bit doubtful right now, within six months to a year, these technologies will become more widespread,"" he said.According to the report, a global shortage of memory chips is a boon to Samsung's mainstay semiconductor business, but it may impact margins on the smartphone business, its second largest revenue source.""As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact,"" Roh told the agency, adding that the crisis affects not only mobile phones but other consumer electronics, from TVs to home appliances.He did not rule out raising product prices, saying some impact was ""inevitable"" from a surge in memory chip prices, but Samsung, the world’s No.1 TV maker, is working with partners on longer term strategies to minimise the impact.During the interaction, Roh acknowledged that the market for foldable phones has been growing slower than expected. He attributed this to the engineering complexities and lack of applications suitable for the hardware design, but expected the segment to go mainstream in the next two or three years. He said that a ""very high"" rate of foldable phone users opt for the same segment for their next purchase.","Samsung aims to double the number of its mobile devices with AI features by 2026.

Elon Musk has announced a major Neuralink Breakthrough. The Billionaire said that his brain-computer interface company Neuralink can possibly restore full body functionality. Elon Musk's brain implant company Neuralink will start ""high-volume production"" of brain-computer interface devices and move to an entirely automated surgical procedure in 2026, Musk said in a post on the social media platform X on Wednesday. “I am confident at this point that restoring full body functionality is possible with Neuralink,” the Tesla and SpaceX founder said in a post on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter. “Neuralink can essentially help bridge communications from the cortex, past the point in the neck or spine, where the nerves are damaged. It is possible from a physics standpoint to physically restore full body functionality,” he said in a video post.The breakthrough focuses on the motor cortex, restoring “full body functionality” for people with severed spinal cords. The motor cortex technology feature was first announced by Elon Musk in 2022, and the testing began in humans in the same year.According to Musk, any device that can be controlled via computer or phone can be controlled by a Neuralink implant.The device includes a chip that replaces a small piece of bone and is connected to the brain via a series of thin, threaded electrodes. The company's N1 implant includes 1,024 electrodes distributed among 64 threads, according to the company's website. “Neuralink will start high-volume production of brain-computer interface devices and move to a streamlined, almost entirely automated surgical procedure in 2026. Device threads will go through the dura without the need to remove it. This is a big deal,” he shared on X.Neuralink eyes mass brain implant production in 2026In September 2025, Neuralink announced that it had implanted its device in 12 patients. The year 2025 also saw Neuralink raising $650 million in Series E funding, led by investors including ARK Invest, Sequoia Capital, and Founders Fund, valuing the company at approximately $9 billion.On January 1 this year, Musk's California-based neurotechnology company announced taking major steps toward restoring vision, with a brain implant that allows the visually impaired, even those blind from birth.Blindsight, Neuralink’s brain chip aimed at restoring vision, received “breakthrough device” designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2024. The company is expected to begin high-volume production of the device this year.Elon Musk said that Blindsight will help people who have lost both eyes, and they will be able to see. He also claimed that, provided the visual cortex remains intact, the device can restore vision even in people who have been blind since birth. ""Blindsight will enable those who have total loss of vision, including if they've lost their eyes or the optic nerve, or maybe have never seen, or even blind from birth, to be able to see again,"" said Musk. Thanking US-FDA, Musk wrote, ""To set expectations correctly, the vision will be at first be low resolution, like Atari graphics, but eventually it has the potential be better than natural vision and enable you to see in infrared, ultraviolet or even radar wavelengths, like Geordi La Forge. Much appreciated, @US_FDA.""","Elon Musk's brain implant company Neuralink will start ""high-volume production"" of brain-computer interface devices and move to an entirely automated surgical procedure in 2026.

These devices blend vintage audio aesthetics with modern OLED screens, showcasing the technology's versatility. The cassette features a 1.5-inch round display, while the turntable boasts a larger 13.4-inch circular screen, offering interactive music experiences and visual moods directly on the units.

Samsung's retro concepts are part of a bigger OLED showcase





Samsung Display has cooked up something nostalgic for CES 2026. The company is showing off two retro-inspired concept devices—the AI OLED Cassette and AI OLED Turntable—that take vintage audio design and give it a modern twist with OLED screens. It's part of Samsung's effort to show that its display technology can work in pretty much any gadget you can think of, even ones that look like they belong in the '80s.The AI OLED Cassette features a compact 1.5-inch round OLED display, styled to look like a classic audio cassette. Images show it sporting a smartwatch-style interactive screen alongside what appears to be a status display. Meanwhile, the AI OLED Turntable steps things up with a much larger 13.4-inch circular OLED that seems to be touch-controlled, though Samsung hasn't revealed exactly what you'd use such a big round screen for on a turntable-inspired device.Both devices fall under Samsung's ""AI Edge Vision Station"" at CES, where the company is showing off various speaker-type AI assistants with displays. The idea is that instead of relying on external smart devices like traditional Bluetooth speakers, these concepts let you see music recommendations, pick songs, and even set visual moods right on the device itself.Samsung is positioning these as proof that OLED's flexibility—it can be curved, spherical, or circular—opens up creative possibilities that LCD simply can't match.While it's unclear if either product will actually hit shelves, they're certainly conversation starters.The company is also unveiling more practical innovations at CES, including ultra-thin laptop displays, 4,500-nit QD-OLED TVs, and automotive screens. But the cassette and turntable? Those are pure fun, showing Samsung isn't afraid to experiment with form factors that challenge conventional thinking about what a display should look like.","Samsung's AI OLED Cassette and Turntable show off the technology's versatility.

Palo Alto Networks' top exec calls AI Agents 2026's biggest insider threat that an 'impressed' Salesforce CEO said may rename the company after,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/palo-alto-networks-top-exec-calls-ai-agents-2026s-biggest-insider-threat-that-an-impressed-salesforce-ceo-says-may-rename-the-company-after/articleshow/126337744.cms,"When Chinese spies 'told' Claude to break into about 30 companies





AI agents are seen as one of the biggest productivity tools by technology companies. From Microsoft to Amazon and more, all technology companies are talking about the potential of AI agents. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff went to the extent of saying that he might rename the company 'Agentforce'. In December last year, a Salesforce employee told Business Insider that the company might change its official corporate name to Agentforce. Later in an interview, Salesforce CEO Benioff confirmed this is a possibility. ""It might,"" Benioff said and added, ""That would not shock me."" Salesforce CEO said that now customers don't want to hear about the cloud anymore and that he learned during recent focus groups ahead of the company's annual Dreamforce conference in October. Instead, clients want to talk about AI agents.""I dropped the word cloud totally,"" he said. ""I did it at Dreamforce. Did you notice I never used it in the keynote? We learned in focus groups customers don't talk about cloud anymore. They just want to talk about their agentic interface."" However, Palo Alto Networks Chief Security Intel Officer Wendi Whitmore does not seem to agree with Benioff. In an interview to The Register, Whitmore said that AI agents represent the new insider threat to companies in 2026.""The CISO and security teams find themselves under a lot of pressure to deploy new technology as quickly as possible, and that creates this massive amount of pressure - and massive workload - that the teams are under to quickly go through procurement processes, security checks, and understand if the new AI applications are secure enough for the use cases that these organizations have,"" Whitmore told The Register. ""And that's created this concept of the AI agent itself becoming the new insider threat,"" she added.""When we look through the defender lens, a lot of what the agentic capabilities allow us to do is start thinking more strategically about how we defend our networks, versus always being caught in this reactive situation,"" Whitmore said.Whitmore, along with just about every other cyber execs that The Register spoke to for the report, pointed to the ""Anthropic attack"" in October 2025 as an example. Chinese cyber spies used Anthropic's Claude Code AI tool to attempt digital break-ins at about 30 high-profile companies and government organizations – and the government-backed snoops ""succeeded in a small number of cases,"" according to a report from the AI company. The mid-September operation targeted large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers, and government agencies.While Whitmore doesn't anticipate AI agents to carry out any fully autonomous attacks this year, she does expect AI to be a force multiplier for network intruders. ""You're going to see these really small teams almost have the capability of big armies,"" she said. ""They can now leverage AI capabilities to do so much more of the work that previously they would have had to have a much larger team to execute against.""","Palo Alto Networks Chief Security Intel Officer Wendi Whitmore said that AI agents represent the new insider threat to companies in 2026. Whitmore, along with just about every other cyber execs that The Register spoke to for the report, pointed to the ""Anthropic attack"" in October 2025.

"Claude maker Anthropic’s founder, Daniela Amodei, on competing with fewer resources: We always had a fraction of what…",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/claude-maker-anthropics-founder-daniela-amodei-on-competing-with-fewer-resources-we-always-had-a-fraction-of-what/articleshow/126337100.cms,"Anthropic's co-founder Daniela Amodei champions a ""do more with less"" philosophy, prioritizing efficient algorithms and judicious resource use over massive infrastructure spending. While competitors invest heavily, Anthropic aims to lead with powerful models by focusing on superior training data and reasoning, challenging the prevailing scale-driven AI race. This strategy bets on smarter deployment, not just bigger budgets.

“I think what we have always aimed to do at Anthropic is be as judicious with the resources that we have while still operating in this space where it’s just a lot of compute.

Anthropic has always had a fraction of what our competitors have had in terms of compute and capital, and yet, pretty consistently, we’ve had the most powerful, most performant models for the majority of the past several years.”

How Anthropic’s Daniela Amodei and her brother are betting against their own views

""The compute requirements for the future are very large. So our expectation is, yes, we will need more compute to be able to just stay at the frontier as we get bigger,”

""A lot of the numbers that are thrown around are sort of not exactly apples to apples, because of just how the structure of some of these deals are kind of set up,""

""We have continued to be surprised, even as the people who pioneered this belief in scaling laws. Something that I hear from my colleagues a lot is, the exponential continues until it doesn't. And every year we've been like, 'Well, this can't possibly be the case that things will continue on the exponential' — and then every year it has,”

“scaling is not necessarily the only thing that matters”

“the person who wins, wins regardless of cost.”

“What happens when the curve reverses?”





Anthropic President and co-founder Daniela Amodei has said that her company follows a governing principle to ""do more with less"" to remain competitive in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. In a recent interview, Amodei clarified that, although competing firms such as OpenAI have committed around $1.4 trillion to infrastructure and chips, Anthropic aims to spend wisely and deploy efficient algorithms.Speaking with CNBC, Amodei, who is also the sister of the company’s CEO and another co-founder, Dario Amodei, said,This strategy challenges the current trend in Silicon Valley, where many AI companies are raising huge sums and building massive data centres to achieve success through scale. Amodei noted that the startup aims to be carefuk with its resources that it has while still operating in a sector that requires significant compute power.By prioritising smarter deployment over massive physical expansion, the company believes it can stay at the technological frontier without attempting to outbuild every other laboratory.Daniela Amodei and her brother, Dario Amodei, Anthropic's CEO and former Baidu and Google researcher, contributed to building the approach they're now challenging. Dario helped promote the scaling paradigm that guides the current AI model race, the strategy that increasing compute, data, and model size improves models predictably. This pattern has become the financial foundation supporting hyperscaler spending, chip valuations, and private market investments in AI companies still working toward profitability.However, Anthropic is trying to prove that it can disprove the logic that the next competition phase will simply be between the entities that can pay more for larger pre-training computations. Anthropic’s approach focuses on superior training data, superior reasoning in post-training models, and products that will lead to lower computing costs and improved adoption. However, Anthropic is not working under constrained budgets because it currently possesses about $100 billion in computing resources, which is set to increase.Amodei said.However, the company argues industry numbers aren't directly comparable, and certainty about ""right"" spending levels is less solid than it appears.she said, describing pressure to commit early for future hardware.Even insiders who shaped the scaling thesis have been surprised by consistent performance growth.Amodei explained.Daniela distinguished between technology and economic curves. Technologically, Anthropic sees continued progress, but questions remain about the pace of adoption. ""Regardless of how good the technology is, it takes time for that to be used in a business or sort of personal context. The real question to me is: How quickly can businesses in particular, but also individuals, leverage the technology?"" she noted. OpenAI focuses on establishing campuses, while Anthropic can easily move around based on costs and demand.Both companies are gearing up for potential IPOs while raising capital and improving their computational infrastructure. If funding for scale continues, OpenAI's approach may remain the norm. But if efficiency is promoted, the approach of Anthropic may gain the upper hand.Instead, it's a bet thatand thatThe “exponential” growth of improvements will continue “until it doesn’t,” said Amodei.

“All my experiences thus far with Alexa+, inclusive of this one, haven't convinced me that, other than the improved conversation flow, anything would justify paying a subscription fee.""

""It turned off the power strip that my aquarium filter is on and killed my fish.""

""It's so discouraging that we're in Q4 2025 and Alexa+ still can't play a song I ask for.""

“None of my devices, including the Alexa app, are responsive anymore,”

""The behaviour has become unbearably erratic. I just wanted to test the new experiences, but I wasn't expecting to get everything messed up,”

What Amazon said about Alexa+ performance

“overwhelming majority”

“As with any other consumer technology company, it's a standard part of the development process to beta-test products and features internally, well before they're distributed to customers,”

“We continue to be energised by the response to Alexa+ compared to what we call the classic Alexa experience,”

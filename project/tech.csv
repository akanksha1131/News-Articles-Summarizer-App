Pixel Buds 2a level up with Active Noise Cancellation

Google's hardware vision finally comes together

Pixel Buds 2a level up with Active Noise CancellationGoogle just wrapped up what might be their most ambitious hardware showcase in years, and this wasn't your typical ""here's a slightly better phone"" presentation — we're talking about a full ecosystem refresh. There were new Pixel phones that come with better cameras, a whole new chip, and more AI than ever. Oh wait, there's Pixelsnap too. Phones weren't the only thing new — Google also brought in a new Pixel Watch, a more affordable pair of Pixel Buds, new features for their existing Buds, all with a whole lot of AI sprinkled throughout.With the event now over, here's a roundup of everything Google announced at this year’s ""Made by Google"" showcase.The biggest of all announcements has to be Google's new chip, the Tensor G5 — its biggest silicon upgrade since the original Tensor launched. Built on TSMC's 3nm process node and co-designed with Google DeepMind, this isn't just about raw performance, though the 60% more powerful TPU and 34% faster CPU certainly don't hurt. The real story is how Tensor G5 enables genuinely useful on-device AI that actually works smoothly in daily use.The chip is the first to run Google's newest Gemini Nano model, which processes AI tasks 2.6x faster and 2x more efficiently than previous generations. This means features like Magic Cue, Voice Translate, and enhanced camera processing happen right on your phone without cloud dependence. Google's also built a completely new Image Signal Processor that handles everything from 10-bit video recording to 100x Pro Res Zoom, proving they're serious about making Pixel cameras genuinely competitive.What's impressive is that despite all this AI horsepower, Tensor G5 actually helps extend battery life to 30+ hours across the Pixel 10 lineup.The regular Pixel phone is finally getting some serious love. Google's done something smart here by giving the vanilla Pixel 10 a proper telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom and 20x Super Res Zoom. That's huge, because zoom capabilities used to be the thing that separated the regular folks from the Pro buyers.The specs tell a similar story. We're looking at 12GB of RAM and Google's new Tensor G5 chip, which they're claiming delivers 34% faster performance and 60% better AI processing. Battery life promises 30+ hours with fast charging that gets you to 55% in about half an hour.The 6.3-inch Actua display hits 3,000 nits peak brightness, which means you can actually see the thing outdoors without squinting like you're staring into the sun.The camera setup is particularly interesting — you get the main 48MP shooter with Google's signature HDR+ magic, an ultra-wide for those group shots where someone's always getting cut off, and now that telephoto lens that was missing before.They're also doing something fun with colours this time around. Instead of the usual ""here's black and white, maybe we'll throw in blue,"" we're getting Obsidian, Indigo, Frost, and Lemongrass.All that starting at Rs 79,999 ($799), and is up for pre-orders.Now this is where Google flexes their engineering muscles. The Pro models are packing 100x Pro Res Zoom, which sounds like one of those marketing numbers that means nothing until you actually try it. The secret sauce is an upgraded 5x telephoto working with that new Tensor G5 imaging processor.But here's where it gets interesting — they've built something called Camera Coach right into the camera app. It uses Gemini AI to analyse what you're shooting and suggests better angles, lighting, and settings. It can even recommend compositions you might not have thought of. Whether that's helpful or annoying probably depends on how good you think you are at taking photos already.Auto Best Take is solving a real problem though. You know how group photos always have that one person blinking or looking weird? This thing automatically finds similar shots and combines them so everyone looks good. They've also improved Add Me, which lets you add yourself to group photos even when you're the one behind the camera.The display cranks up to 3,300 nits peak brightness — genuinely impressive stuff. Both the 6.3-inch and 6.8-inch models have identical specs, including 16GB of RAM that feels like overkill today but might be prescient as AI gets more demanding. You're choosing based on size preference, not feature compromises.Pro buyers get a year of Google AI Pro thrown in, including access to their video generation tools and enhanced productivity features. Whether that's worth it depends on how much you care about creating AI videos of your cat.The Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL are also up for preorders, and comes starting at Rs 1,09,000.Google's taking another swing at foldables, and this time they seem to have learned from the category's growing pains. The big news is IP68 water resistance — a first for any Pixel Fold. They've also engineered a gearless hinge that's supposedly good for 10+ years of folding, which addresses the ""will this thing fall apart"" concerns that plague expensive foldables.The screens are where things get interesting. The inner 8-inch display uses ultra-thin glass with dual layers of protection film, while the outer 6.4-inch screen maintains that normal phone feel. Brightness improvements hit 3,000 nits peak, making outdoor use actually practical.The software experience is where foldables either justify their existence or don't. Google's split-screen multitasking feels more natural now, and the drag-and-drop between apps creates workflows that are genuinely faster than jumping between phone apps. Planning a trip by comparing flights in one window while checking hotels in another actually makes sense.Pixel 10 Pro Fold costs Rs 1,72,999, and you'd be able to buy in the coming weeks.Camera features like Dual Screen Preview let everyone see themselves while posing, and tabletop mode enables hands-free astrophotography. There's even a Made You Look feature that shows animations to get kids' attention for photos. Google's clearly thinking about why someone would want a foldable beyond just ""bigger screen for videos.""Here's the surprise announcement — if you haven't been on the internet for last few weeks — Google's magnetic accessory system called Pixelsnap, built into all Pixel 10 devices. It enables wireless chargers, stands, grips, and third-party accessories to snap on magnetically, even through cases.The Pixelsnap Charger delivers 25W Qi2 wireless charging with modular design that lets you detach pieces for portability. There's also a version with an adjustable stand for hands-free viewing while charging. Google's partnering with third-party manufacturers for certified accessories, suggesting they're serious about building an ecosystem.Whether this takes off depends on pricing and accessory availability. Google's track record with hardware ecosystems is mixed, but the magnetic approach feels more intuitive than previous proprietary attempts.Magic Cue is Google's shot at proactive AI assistance that anticipates what you need based on context. Call your airline and flight details surface automatically. Friend asks for your Airbnb address and the info appears ready to share. It's powered by on-device processing, so your personal stuff stays private while enabling helpful features.The examples sound useful, but predictive features live or die on accuracy. Get it right and it feels like magic. Get it wrong and it becomes annoying digital noise. Google's betting their contextual understanding has reached the point where this works more often than it doesn't.The fourth-generation Pixel Watch isn't revolutionary, but it's addressing the right problems. The display is 50% brighter with smaller bezels, which makes outdoor readability dramatically better. Anyone who's tried to check their watch in bright sunlight knows this matters more than fancy new sensors.The new chip architecture promises better performance while extending battery life — crucial for something you're supposed to wear all day. Dual-band GPS provides more accurate tracking, and they've made the design serviceable, which is good news for long-term ownership and sustainability.Health monitoring gets AI-powered insights that adapt to your patterns, and smart replies powered by on-device processing could actually improve how you interact with notifications. The 41mm and 45mm size options mean you're not stuck with one-size-fits-nobody approach.The Pixel Buds 2a bring Active Noise Cancellation to the A-Series line for the first time, along with 7 hours of playback extending to 20 hours with the case.The twist-to-adjust stabiliser is clever — customise the fit for workouts or casual listening. Powered by the Tensor A1 chip, they promise premium audio processing and AI features typically reserved for higher-end models.Pixel Buds Pro 2 get significant software updates including Adaptive Audio that automatically adjusts to your environment and Loud Noise Protection for hearing safety. You can accept or decline calls by nodding or shaking your head, which feels futuristic even if the practical utility remains to be seen.Both models integrate with Gemini for hands-free AI interaction, though the quality depends on noise cancellation effectiveness and voice recognition accuracy in real-world conditions.After a decade of feeling like they were playing catch-up, Google seems to have finally landed on a coherent hardware strategy that actually makes sense, and that as usual has a lot of AI sprinkled wherever Google can. Now, whether consumers actually want the AI-powered future Google's building remains the big question, but at least now they're backing it with hardware that can compete on specs and features.","Google just wrapped up what might be their most ambitious hardware showcase in years.

The premium PS5 Pro model jumps to $749.99 from its previous $699.99 price point. PlayStation 5 accessories will maintain their current pricing.""Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment,"" said Isabelle Tomatis, Sony Interactive Entertainment 's Vice President of Global Marketing. ""As a result, we've made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S.""The price increases come as the gaming industry grapples with economic headwinds, including tariffs on imported goods from manufacturing hubs like China, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Sony faces additional pressure from a 15% tariff on products shipped from Japan, where the company is headquartered.Sony previously raised PS5 prices in international markets including the UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand earlier this year, making the U.S. one of the last major markets to see increases.

Real-world utility will define success



With the increasing impact of artificial intelligence , the OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor has shared a striking parallel between the AI surge and the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at a recent tech conference Taylor stressed on the fact that while AI holds transformative potential, not every player in the AI space will emerge victorious.As per the report by Business Insider, drawing parallels Taylor said that today’s AI frenzy and the internet revolution saw meteoric heights but also crashed eventually. “Just like the dot-com boom, there will be winners and losers,” he said, underscoring the need for discernment amid the hype.Same way the AI sector is also witnessing billions of investment with startups and tech giants racing to create generative models, enterprise tools and autonomous agents. However, Taylor suggests that not all ventures are built on sustainable foundations.Taylor also added that the long-term success in AI will hinge on real-world utility, responsible deployment, and scalable infrastructure. He emphasised that the companies that are working to solve useful problems rather than chasing the buzzwords will emerge as leaders in the AI era.Taylor’s perspective aligns with the growing calls for ethical AI development, especially as governments and regulators grapple with how to manage the risks of misinformation, bias, and automation.","OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor has shared a striking parallel between the AI surge and the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.

Bezos-Sánchez wedding draws criticism over DiCaprio’s jet travel



Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s $40 Venetian wedding

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances.

He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company. I’ve got my methods of doing that, and I use machine learning. I sort through all 42,000 employees.”“100% of the time, I increased the company’s spend on OpEx [operating expenses]. And the reason for that is because you take care of people, everything else takes care [of itself],” Jensen Huang concluded.",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved from a futuristic concept to an everyday necessity, influencing industries ranging from healthcare and finance to entertainment and communication. It automates routine tasks, enhances productivity, and fuels innovations like ChatGPT, AI-driven translation services, and virtual gaming experiences.The growth of AI has also created a new class of billionaires, some of whom have built companies from scratch, while others have pivoted established businesses toward AI-driven opportunities. Backed by massive investments from Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and other global players, these individuals represent the cutting edge of technology and entrepreneurship. From Jensen Huang’s hardware empire to Alexandr Wang’s data infrastructure solutions, and from Sam Altman’s AI innovation to Yao Runhao’s virtual gaming platforms, these billionaires illustrate how AI is reshaping industries and redefining entrepreneurship.Source: ForbesJensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, sits at the top of the AI billionaire list with an astonishing $113 billion (£151 billion) net worth. Nvidia initially focused on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional visualization. However, as AI adoption accelerated, these GPUs became the standard for training and running large language models like ChatGPT and Meta AI.Huang’s strategic vision transformed Nvidia into the backbone of the AI industry. In July 2025, the company reached an unprecedented $4 trillion valuation, reflecting how central its hardware is to AI infrastructure. Owning 3% of Nvidia, Huang’s wealth grew by over 300% in just one year, making him one of the top 20 richest individuals worldwide.At just 26 years old, Alexandr Wang has secured his place as the youngest self-made billionaire in the AI sector. He founded Scale AI at the age of 19, after dropping out of MIT, to focus on providing data labeling and annotation services essential for AI training.Scale AI works with over 300 high-profile clients, including Meta, Google, and General Motors, supplying the data infrastructure required to build machine learning models. The company’s valuation reached $14 billion (£10.5 billion) in 2024, and Wang’s 14% ownership stake boosted his net worth to $2.7 billion (£3.6 billion). His success highlights how even niche AI services can yield massive fortunes.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is one of the most prominent faces in artificial intelligence. While OpenAI itself is valued at around $300 billion (£225 billion), Altman does not personally hold equity in the company. His wealth, estimated at $1.9 billion (£1.4 billion), stems from early investments in companies like Stripe, Reddit, and Helion Energy, combined with the success of his previous startup, Loopt, which he sold for $42 million in 2012.Altman’s leadership at OpenAI popularized generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, setting global trends in how businesses and consumers interact with AI. His influence extends beyond wealth, positioning him as one of the key thought leaders shaping AI’s future.Phil Shawe, co-CEO of TransPerfect, built one of the world’s largest translation and localization companies by leveraging AI-powered language processing. TransPerfect offers services across industries like law, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, helping businesses operate in multiple languages with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.Founded in 1992 from a dorm room at New York University, TransPerfect generated $1.3 billion (£976 million) in revenue in 2024. Shawe owns 99% of the company, securing a personal fortune of $1.8 billion (£1.3 billion). His journey shows how AI technology can transform even traditional industries like language services into billion-dollar enterprises.Dario Amodei, a former vice president of research at OpenAI, left to co-found Anthropic in 2021. His company focuses on building safe, reliable AI systems using reinforcement learning techniques that allow AI models to adapt through human feedback.Anthropic’s approach to ethical AI and safety-first principles resonated with investors and industry leaders, pushing the company’s valuation to $61.5 billion (£46.2 billion) by 2025. Amodei’s net worth has reached $1.2 billion (£901 million), proving that prioritizing responsibility in AI development can be both impactful and profitable.Liang Wenfeng, once largely unknown outside China, made headlines with DeepSeek-R1, a large language model that outperformed ChatGPT on certain benchmarks while being five times cheaper to run. This innovation shook global markets, causing Nvidia’s stock to drop 17% in a single day as investors reacted to the potential shift in AI computing costs.Wenfeng previously founded a successful hedge fund, and he used his financial expertise to build DeepSeek into one of the most cost-efficient AI providers globally. His net worth now stands at $1 billion (£751 million), making him a key figure in China’s growing AI industry.Yao Runhao, CEO of Paper Games, has carved out a unique niche by combining AI with gaming. His company’s hit product, Love and Deepspace, uses artificial intelligence to create virtual dating simulations with interactive, personalized storylines.The game attracts over six million monthly users, showcasing the demand for AI-driven entertainment. Paper Games employs around 2,000 staff and focuses primarily on the female gaming market in China, highlighting how AI is revolutionizing interactive leisure experiences. Runhao’s innovation has earned him a net worth of $1.3 billion (£977 million).","World’s wealthiest AI moguls ranked by net worth.

Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India, marking another step in its long-term strategy to strengthen its footprint in emerging markets. During Apple’s latest earnings announcement, CEO Tim Cook confirmed plans to open multiple new Apple Stores in India before the year ends. The move comes as part of a broader global expansion plan that also includes fresh Apple retail outlets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the launch of the Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia. Cook highlighted that these new physical stores are a key step in improving Apple’s customer experience, product accessibility, and service reach in high-growth regions like India.“We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn’t be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year,” Cook stated. “We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka.”According to Apple Magazine, four new stores are scheduled to open across key metropolitan cities in India, namely Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, and the Delhi NCR region. These new outlets will build on Apple’s successful retail debut in India in 2023, which saw the launch of Apple BKC in Mumbai and Apple Saket in Delhi. These initial stores have quickly become major crowd-pullers, especially during new iPhone release events, and have demonstrated the value of physical retail locations in India’s fast-growing premium smartphone market.To support this retail growth, Apple has been actively hiring talent for its upcoming stores. Earlier this year, Apple Store leader John Taffe shared on LinkedIn that Apple was looking for passionate and skilled individuals to join its retail team. “Apple’s journey in India has been incredible, and we’re thrilled to continue growing in these vibrant cities. To make these new stores a success, we’re looking for passionate and talented individuals to join our team,” Taffe noted. This hiring drive highlights Apple’s commitment to not only selling products but also delivering personalised customer experiences and creating jobs within the Indian retail sector.While India remains a critical market, Apple is expanding its retail network globally. Apart from its Indian plans, the company has announced new retail locations in the UAE, including a store in Al Ain, which will add to its existing four UAE outlets (two in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai). The Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia further emphasizes Apple’s growing focus on the Middle East.These international retail initiatives aim to strengthen Apple’s customer reach and brand experience beyond its digital ecosystem. Apple’s global retail growth is supported by its strong financial results. In its April–June quarter (Q3), Apple reported a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, showcasing robust demand even in challenging economic conditions. This financial strength gives Apple the confidence to invest heavily in physical stores in markets like India, where premium smartphone adoption is rapidly increasing.India has emerged as one of Apple’s most important growth markets, driven by rising disposable incomes, expanding smartphone penetration, and a growing preference for premium devices. The launch of Apple BKC and Apple Saket in 2023 marked the company’s first direct retail presence in the country, and the overwhelming customer response has paved the way for more stores. Apple’s upcoming four new stores signal a long-term commitment to India, where it faces strong competition from brands like Samsung and OnePlus. However, Apple’s focus on a seamless retail experience and exclusive customer service could help it capture a larger market share in the premium category.",Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered. This statement from Hassabis offers one of the clearest examples of how AI will alter specific professions, but not eliminate the need for human empathy and interpersonal care.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments, emphasizing lifelong learning, adaptive skills, ethical AI usage, and the development of new interdisciplinary roles bridging technology, creativity, and human-centric decision-making.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce.

Unconventional leadership and office creativity

Monthly “work church” meetings with grammar lessons

A billionaire breaking the mold

Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old CEO of Epic Systems, has built a remarkable $7.8 billion fortune through her 43% stake in the company, yet she has never taken a single share for personal use. Instead, she has committed to giving away nearly all her wealth to philanthropic causes, signing Bill Gates’ Giving Pledge in 2015 to donate 99% of her fortune. Beyond finances, Faulkner has created a corporate culture that values creativity, curiosity, and learning. From whimsical themed office buildings to innovative company-wide gatherings, she proves that leadership and generosity can coexist, while setting an example for other business leaders that success can be measured not only in profits but also in positive impact on employees and society.Faulkner, together with her husband, launched Roots & Wings to provide grants to nonprofits dedicated to improving the health, education, and well-being of children and families. Since its inception, the foundation has grown into a major philanthropic vehicle: in 2020, it granted $15 million to 115 organizations, and by 2024, it projected $67 million in grants to 305 nonprofits nationwide. Faulkner intends to steadily expand giving, aiming to distribute $100 million annually by 2027. To responsibly manage the sale of her non-voting Epic shares without destabilizing the company, she established a trust that governs these transactions. This careful planning ensures that her philanthropic mission can continue without affecting Epic’s stability or long-term growth.Epic Systems’ 1,670-acre campus in Wisconsin is far from a conventional office environment. Its 28 buildings feature fantastical themes ranging from Harry Potter and Alice in Wonderland to The Wizard of Oz, organized into mini-campuses such as Prairie Campus, Wizards Academy, and Storybook Campus. Inside, employees help source artwork and whimsical installations, including chocolate chip trails leading to a mock chocolate factory, hanging bridges to treehouses, and magical sculptures scattered across the grounds. This imaginative setting reflects Faulkner’s philosophy that creativity, play, and aesthetic engagement foster learning and productivity, making the workplace not just a location for tasks but a space for inspiration and collaboration.Once a month, Epic employees gather in the underground auditorium called Deep Space for a mandatory meeting affectionately nicknamed “work church.” These gatherings cover essential business news, company updates, and operational targets. Yet Faulkner adds unique elements that transform standard corporate meetings into engaging learning experiences. For instance, she incorporates grammar lessons, teaching employees proper usage of words such as “who” and “whom,” and emphasizing communication skills alongside company strategy. By blending education with corporate updates, these meetings reinforce a culture of continuous learning, intellectual curiosity, and attention to detail, encouraging employees to grow professionally and personally within the company. Her story demonstrates that visionary leadership can redefine both corporate culture and philanthropy on a global scale.Epic Systems is part of a broader trend of companies reimagining office culture to enhance employee engagement. Wellstar Health System, for example, offers wellness rooms with massage chairs, calming music, and healthy snacks, resulting in a 10% drop in employee turnover in 2024. Nonprofit Understood designs offices specifically for neurodivergent employees, with adjustable lighting, temperature zones, and assistive listening systems to support diverse needs. Even CEOs like Jeff Bezos favor “messy meetings” over rehearsed discussions to stimulate open debate and creativity. These examples show that unconventional setups, when thoughtfully implemented, can increase productivity, employee satisfaction, and innovation across industries.While many billionaires sign high-profile pledges without fully following through, Faulkner stands apart as a rare example of commitment and action. By giving away nearly all her wealth through philanthropy, cultivating a creative and educational workplace, and fostering employee engagement through unconventional office design and corporate rituals, she sets a benchmark for responsible, visionary leadership. Her approach demonstrates that a CEO can combine financial success, ethical responsibility, and innovation to create a lasting impact—not just on a company’s bottom line, but on the lives of employees, communities, and society at large.","Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old CEO of Epic Systems, has built a remarkable $7.8 billion fortune through her 43% stake in the company.

Microsoft employees occupied company headquarters Tuesday in the most significant protest yet against the tech giant's contracts with Israel, establishing an encampment they renamed "" Martyred Palestinian Children's Plaza ."" Around 50 current and former Microsoft workers, alongside community supporters, took over the East Campus Plaza at the company's Redmond, Washington headquarters as part of escalating demonstrations by the "" No Azure for Apartheid "" group. The protesters set up tents, erected memorials to Gaza casualties, and established a negotiating table inviting Microsoft executives to ""come to the table"" and end partnerships with the Israeli military.The demonstration ended after approximately two hours when police ordered protesters to leave, threatening arrests for trespassing. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the group ""was asked to leave, and they left"" but provided no additional comment beyond previous statements.The activists distributed a manifesto titled ""We will not be cogs in the Israeli genocidal machine: a call for a Worker Intifada,"" demanding Microsoft cut all ties with Israel, call for an end to the conflict, pay reparations to Palestinians, and stop discriminating against pro-Palestinian workers.The group has spent over a year pushing Microsoft to end its relationship with Israel, arguing the company's Azure cloud platform contributes to civilian deaths in Gaza by serving Israeli government and military agencies. Several organizers have been terminated for holding unauthorised campus events and disrupting executive speeches, including interruptions of CEO Satya Nadella's presentations.The protest follows recent reporting by The Guardian and +972 Magazine revealing Israel's military surveillance unit stored millions of Palestinian phone calls on Azure servers, with that data helping inform Gaza bombing targets. Microsoft enlisted law firm Covington & Burling to conduct an independent review of these allegations, though the company maintains it has ""found no evidence"" its technologies have been used to target civilians.The demonstrations were also motivated by the recent targeted killing of prominent Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif , according to protester Hossam Nasr, a former Microsoft employee who was fired last year for organizing a Palestine vigil.","Microsoft employees occupied company headquarters Tuesday in the most significant protest yet against the tech giant's contracts with Israel.

Looking further ahead, he envisions AI providing engineers with unprecedented ""leverage"" that will drive significant ""complexity and productivity"" improvements.The Meta executive predicts AI will enable dramatically leaner organisations, forecasting ""companies with a couple of employees and billions of users."" This aligns with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision of AI creating ""midlevel engineers"" capable of writing code and helping founders build with ""very small, talent-dense teams.""Zuckerberg has championed an ""efficiency"" push at Meta since 2022, resulting in tens of thousands of layoffs. The company recently announced plans to allow job candidates to use AI in coding interviews, signalling its commitment to integrating artificial intelligence throughout its engineering processes.Despite acknowledging uncertainty about exact outcomes, Bosworth emphasised that AI will help the software industry grow rather than shrink it.",Andrew Bosworth predicts AI will create a sharp divide in the software engineering profession.

National security concerns drive push for domestic chip production

US treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed Tuesday that the Trump administration is exploring taking an equity stake in struggling chipmaker Intel, converting billions in government grants into ownership rather than giving away taxpayer money for free.Speaking to CNBC, Bessent said any potential deal would focus on stabilizing Intel for domestic chip production rather than pressuring companies to buy from the semiconductor giant. ""The last thing we're going to do is put pressure, is take the stake and then try to drum up business,"" he told the network.The discussions center on converting approximately $10.9 billion in CHIPS Act grants into a roughly 10% equity stake in Intel, potentially making the US government the company's largest shareholder. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed this approach during a separate CNBC interview, criticizing the Biden administration 's original structure.""Donald Trump turns that into saying, 'Hey, we want equity for the money,'"" Lutnick explained. ""America should get the benefit of the bargain. Why are we giving a company worth $100 billion this kind of money?""The unusual arrangement would mark a significant departure from traditional government support for private companies, reflecting Trump's business-oriented approach to federal investments. Lutnick clarified that any equity stake wouldn't include voting rights or governance control.Bessent emphasized national security motivations, citing America's dangerous reliance on Taiwan for advanced semiconductors. ""The single point of failure for the global economy is that 99% of the advanced chips in the world are made in Taiwan,"" he said, calling it a critical vulnerability requiring immediate attention.Intel has struggled to compete with rivals like Nvidia and Qualcomm, recently announcing plans to lay off 15% of its workforce. The company received a boost Monday when Japan's SoftBank announced a $2 billion investment, sending Intel shares up 7.5%.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the potential deal ""a creative idea that has never been done before"" to ensure reshoring critical supply chains while benefiting taxpayers.

Bill Gates reveals his winning answer to ‘why should we hire you’ to crack any interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-reveals-his-winning-answer-to-why-should-we-hire-you-to-crack-any-interview/articleshow/123405257.cms,"

Bill Gates answers why should we hire you?

What are your strengths and weaknesses?





Where do you see yourself in five years?



What are your salary expectations?







Bill Gates’ final advice

When it comes to cracking a job interview, even the brightest candidates often stumble on the most common questions. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates , who has not only given interviews in his youth but also conducted countless ones as an employer, recently shared how to approach some of the trickiest questions that appear in almost every interview. Gates believes that while technical skills matter, the way candidates express their motivation, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities makes a lasting impression. His advice offers a mix of honesty, preparation, and strategic thinking that can help job seekers stand out in today’s highly competitive hiring environment.Gates emphasizes that this question isn’t about boasting but about clearly communicating your value in a way that resonates with the employer. He explains that hiring managers are not just looking for a list of accomplishments – they want to see how your skills and mindset directly align with the company’s mission and challenges. Instead of giving vague responses like “I work hard” or “I’m a team player,” Gates suggests tailoring your answer to highlight the exact strengths the employer is seeking. For example, if the role demands innovation, a candidate could describe a time when they creatively solved a difficult problem and how that approach could benefit the company.As an example, Gates himself often pointed to his coding achievements, deep passion for software, teamwork skills, and ambition when answering this question during his early career. By showcasing not only what he had already accomplished but also his enthusiasm and hunger to grow, he left interviewers convinced of his long-term potential. He advises modern candidates to take a similar approach: connect your unique skills directly to the company’s needs, show you are motivated to grow with the role, and position yourself as someone who can contribute to both short-term impact and long-term vision.According to Gates, this question is an opportunity for self-awareness rather than self-promotion. He recommends that candidates choose strengths that are relevant to the job while explaining how those qualities have produced real results in the past. On weaknesses, Gates suggests honesty balanced with growth – admitting areas of improvement while showing the steps you are taking to overcome them. This demonstrates maturity and a willingness to learn, qualities employers value highly.Bill Gates’ own answer: Gates admitted that he was not particularly skilled in marketing or sales, but he excelled in product creation and defining features. By acknowledging weaknesses without trying to disguise them, while doubling down on his true strengths, Gates showed the kind of critical self-awareness employers value.Gates points out that this question is less about predicting the future and more about revealing ambition. Employers want to see that candidates have direction and drive. He suggests aligning your career goals with the company’s growth, showing that you want to grow alongside the organization. Even if the long-term vision evolves, demonstrating that you think ahead and are motivated to build a future leaves a strong impression.On this tricky question, Gates advises candidates to strike a balance between confidence and flexibility. Being too rigid about salary can make you seem difficult to work with, while undervaluing yourself may raise doubts about your worth. Gates recommends doing prior research on industry standards and giving a reasonable range instead of a fixed number. He also stresses framing salary discussions in terms of value – how your skills and contributions justify the compensation – while showing openness to negotiation. This demonstrates professionalism and practicality, traits employers respect.For Gates, interviews are not just about answering questions but about telling a story – one that highlights your passion, your potential, and your fit with the company’s culture. He encourages candidates to prepare, practice, and remain authentic, reminding them that the goal is not perfection but connection. By framing common questions as opportunities to reveal character and ambition, Gates believes any candidate can turn a stressful interview into a powerful career breakthrough.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates offers advice on how to answer the most common interview questions.

But, with the growing demand for AI infrastructure, Foxconn is now retooling its operations to manufacture high-performance servers that power artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and data centers. This shift in operations marks a departure from its role as a behind-the-scenes assembler of consumer tech, positioning Foxconn as a key player in the future of enterprise hardware.According to a report by Business Insider, Barclays analysts Jiong Shao, Lian Xiu Duan, and Xinyao Song said, “The company has grown from its legacy business of building smartphones or assembling computers for the likes of Apple to being a critical player in not only AI servers but also in emerging new product categories such as EVs and humanoid robots”.AI servers are said to be the foundation of modern computing. The servers enable everything from large language models to real-time analytics. These machines also need specialised components such as high-speed networking, GPUs and advanced cooling systems. Foxconn is now moving into a space which reflects growing demand for this infrastructure.

Amazon stock remains one of the most popular on Wall Street

In a stock market captivated by artificial intelligence, Amazon .com Inc. is struggling to keep up. The e-commerce giant's shares have been significantly trailing the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index this year, according to a recent Bloomberg report. As the report says: In a stock market obsessed with artificial intelligence, Amazon.com is losing ground.The gap widened sharply after Amazon's disappointing earnings report on July 31. While the Nasdaq 100 is up 12% for the year, Amazon's stock has gained just 4.6%, placing it in the bottom half of the index's performers. The company's stock is currently trading at a near-record discount to the index—a stark contrast to the premium it commanded for most of the last two decades.The primary cause for the recent slide was slower-than-expected growth in Amazon's cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). This has fueled investor concern that the company is losing market share to competitors. For many investors, Amazon’s stock hasn't seen the same boost from AI investments as other tech giants like Microsoft and Meta Platforms.""For a lot of investors, Amazon just isn’t a pure-play way to play a theme you believe in,” said Eric Clark, a portfolio manager quoted by Bloomberg. ""People want purity in their investments. And if you want that, Amazon looks like a company that’s watered down by all the different businesses.”While Amazon still generates the majority of its sales from e-commerce, its wide-ranging business portfolio—from AWS to Whole Foods—is now being seen as a weakness rather than a strength. The company's diverse investments, which were long a draw for growth-oriented investors, are now seen as a drag on its stock price in an AI-dominated market.Despite remaining the market leader in cloud computing, AWS's 17% revenue growth in the second quarter was overshadowed by its rivals. For comparison, Microsoft's Azure unit saw a 39% increase in sales, while Google Cloud's sales grew by 32%.Meanwhile, other companies heavily focused on building AI computing capacity are seeing their shares skyrocket. Oracle Corp., which recently partnered with OpenAI to supply massive data center power, has seen its stock price surge by nearly 50% this year. The shares of CoreWeave Inc., an Nvidia-backed cloud computing provider, have more than doubled since its March IPO.“This new cohort of hyperscalers are going to be the companies we’re talking about in five years time,” said Clare Pleydell-Bouverie, co-manager of the Liontrust Global Innovation team. ""We’re not seeing the same AI induced acceleration"" from Amazon, she noted.Despite the recent setbacks, many investors remain confident in Amazon's long-term potential. They believe the company's AI investments will eventually pay off by improving efficiency and customer targeting across its many businesses.The stock remains one of the most-popular on Wall Street, with over 90% of the 82 analysts who cover it rating it a ""buy,"" according to Bloomberg data. This is a higher buy percentage than either Meta or Alphabet Inc. Eric Clark believes Amazon looks ""under-appreciated"" right now, but he's confident that its AI investments, especially within AWS, will eventually boost its bottom line.","Amazon's shares have been significantly trailing the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index this year.

The MSL group will now have four main components:

In a significant restructuring of its burgeoning artificial intelligence arm, Meta Platforms is splitting its newly formed AI group, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), into four distinct teams. The move, according to a report by The New York Times, comes amid internal tensions and a high-stakes race to develop so-called “Superintelligence.” The reorganization is a direct effort to better capitalize on the billions of dollars spent poaching top AI talent, with many researchers receiving compensation packages reaching into the hundreds of millions. According to an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg News, the new structure is designed to ""accelerate"" the company's pursuit of AI that can perform tasks better than humans.""Superintelligence is coming, and in order to take it seriously, we need to organize around the key areas that will be critical to reach it — research, product and infra,"" wrote Alexandr Wang, Meta’s new chief AI officer, in the memo. Wang, the former CEO of Scale AI, recently joined the company to lead this ambitious push.The New York Times reported that the shake-up is aimed at streamlining operations and accelerating the development of AI products to better compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google. The changes follow a series of leadership shake-ups in Meta's AI division over the past few years.* MSL Product* MSL Research* MSL Infra* MSL OpsThe AGI foundations group, one of Meta's three primary AI teams prior to this reorganization, is being dissolved. According to the internal memo, its leaders, Ahmad Al-Dahle and Amir Frenkel, will now focus on “strategic MSL initiatives.”While a person familiar with the matter told The New York Times that no layoffs were part of this specific reorganization, the report notes that the company is considering downsizing the AI division overall, which has grown to thousands of people in recent years. Additionally, some executives are expected to depart, and Meta is exploring the use of third-party AI models rather than relying solely on its own technology.Leadership roles within the new structure have also been assigned. Aparna Ramani will lead the MSL Infra team, and Robert Fergus, who co-founded the long-standing FAIR research lab in 2014, will continue to lead that group. He rejoined Meta this spring after spending several years at Alphabet Inc.'s DeepMind.

In a major development for the chipmaker, the Trump administration is in discussions to acquire a significant stake in Intel , potentially making the US government its largest shareholder, a report has said. This plan is being considered just as Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank Group has announced a $2 billion investment in the company.According to a report by Bloomberg, the Trump administration’s plan involves a specific approach: converting a portion of the grants made to Intel under the US CHIPS and Science Act into equity. The report says that this could result in a stake of approximately 10% for the US government, an investment estimated to be worth around $10.5 billion at Intel’s current market value.Reportedly, the grant money, which was originally intended to be disbursed over time as Intel meets project milestones, is roughly sufficient to fund this targeted holding. It is to be noted that the company is already slated to receive a combined $10.9 billion in grants for both commercial and military production, in addition to being able to draw on up to $11 billion in loans.While the plan is still under consideration and not yet finalized, it reflects the administration’s strategic interest in revitalizing American semiconductor manufacturing.SoftBank, meanwhile, has announced a $2 billion investment in Intel’s common stock, priced at $23 per share, making it the fifth-biggest shareholder. The report says that SoftBank sees significant value in Intel’s chip design operations, which hold the promise of high margins, and views the investment as a strong vote of confidence.“Masa and I have worked closely together for decades, and I appreciate the confidence he has placed in Intel with this investment,” said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan in a statement, referring to SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son.This comes at a crucial time for Intel, which has struggled to fully capitalise on the artificial intelligence boom and has invested heavily in its manufacturing business without securing a major customer.","The Trump administration is in discussions to acquire a significant stake in Intel.

Workday, a major provider of human resources technology, has confirmed a data breach that resulted in the theft of personal information from one of its third-party databases. In a blog post, the company announced that hackers stole an unspecified amount of data, primarily consisting of contact information such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. The breach was part of a ""social engineering campaign"" that targeted several large organisations. Workday explained that in this campaign, threat actors contacted employees via text or phone, posing as HR or IT staff, to trick them into giving up account access or personal information.In its blog post, Workday wrote:However, the company did not explicitly rule out the possibility that customer information was compromised, as corporate clients typically store most of their HR records and employees’ personal information with Workday.Workday, which serves more than 11,000 corporate clients and at least 70 million users globally, reportedly detected it earlier this month. The company also did not clarify whether it has the technical capabilities, such as access logs, to confirm if any customer data was stolen.While the company did not disclose the name of the third-party customer database platform involved, the incident comes amid a wave of cyberattacks targeting Salesforce-hosted databases used by major corporations. In recent weeks, Google, Cisco, Qantas, and Pandora have all suffered data theft from their Salesforce systems.Google attributed these breaches to ShinyHunters, a hacking group known for using voice phishing to trick employees into granting access to cloud databases.The company added that ShinyHunters was likely preparing a data leak site to pressure victims into paying for data deletion, a tactic similar to ransomware operations.","Workday confirms a data breach that resulted in the theft of personal information from one of its third-party databases.

Elon Musk’s longstanding concern



A global warning by Elon Musk



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again started a global debate over the declining population. Recently, Elon Musk warned people Japan will lose nearly 1 million people by the end of 2025. Now once again the tech billionaire has shared another warning on the collapsing population. Resharing a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk has once again raised the alarm about population collapse saying ‘since the turn of the century, and emphasised that artificial intelligence may be the only viable tool to help reverse the trend.The SpaceX CEO Elon Musk recently shared a post on X about population collapse. An X user called Tim Pool shared a post on X which reads, “The population isnt ""collapsing"" It has collapsed. The shoreline is receding and no one understands the tsunami about to hit us. As US population goes it will be impossible to redevelop. Automation won't replace your customers.”Elon Musk reshared this post along with a caption which reads, “I’ve been warning about this since the turn of the century.”Elon Musk has repeatedly warned about population collapse— not overpopulation—is the real existential threat to civilization. Musk earlier argued that declining birth rates could lead to economic stagnation, labour shortages, and even civilizational decline if not addressed. “Most people still think the world is overpopulated,” Musk said in earlier interviews. “It’s actually the opposite.”Japan has been the focal point for population collapse, but Musk’s warning also applies to other nations such as South Korea, Italy and parts of Eastern Europe as they are also facing similar trends. This issue of population collapse has also sparked the interests of pro-natalist policies, immigration reform, and even the role of AI and robotics in offsetting labor gaps.Recently, Elon Musk issued a stark warning about Japan. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the tech billionaire wrote: “Japan will lose almost a million people this year.” In the post, Musk said that this demographic was set in motion half a century ago adding that the population decline in the country “has nothing to do with AI.” “AI is the only hope for turning this around,” the tech CEO further stated.Elon Musk was responding to an X post that said: “Japan's population falling with 900,000 more deaths than births in 2024”.","The SpaceX CEO Elon Musk recently shared a post on X about population collapse.

Why startups are betting on Nuclear energy

Alphabet’s Google and nuclear startup Kairos Power announced a landmark partnership on Monday to deploy an advanced nuclear plant in Tennessee, with the goal of connecting to the Tennessee Valley Authority 's (TVA) electric grid by 2030. The project marks a significant step toward a new era of nuclear power in the United States, which has seen a halt in new construction for decades. The last two reactors built in the U.S. at Plant Vogtle in Georgia cost $18 billion more than expected and started operations seven years behind schedule in 2023 and 2024. The project’s problems are reported to have played a role in the bankruptcy of industry giant Westinghouse.Under the agreement, TVA has committed to purchasing up to 50 megawatts of power from Kairos Power's Hermes 2 reactor. According to a report by CNBC, this is the first time that a U.S. utility has signed a power purchase agreement with an advanced nuclear reactor, according to the companies. The electricity generated, enough to power approximately 36,000 homes, will be used to support Google's energy-intensive data centers in Montgomery County, Tennessee, and Jackson County, Alabama.The partnership aims to tackle a major obstacle that has plagued the U.S. nuclear industry: the immense cost and financial risk associated with building new plants. In this collaboration, Kairos and Google will bear the financial burden of constructing the first-of-its-kind project, while TVA provides a stable revenue stream through its power purchase agreement.The U.S. has not seen significant nuclear construction for decades due to massive budget overruns and delays, such as the Plant Vogtle project in Georgia, which went $18 billion over budget and started operations seven years late.Startups like Kairos Power are betting that their smaller, more affordable advanced reactors can avoid the issues that plagued large-scale projects like Vogtle. The Hermes 2 reactor, which received its construction permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in November 2024, is scheduled to begin operations in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, by 2030. The companies will still need to secure an operating license from the NRC before the plant can go live.For technology giants like Google, advanced nuclear power represents a crucial part of their strategy to meet the rising energy demands of artificial intelligence while maintaining their commitment to carbon-free energy. Google has already placed orders with Kairos for a total of 500 megawatts of power from future reactors, targeting a 2035 rollout.","Alphabet's Google and nuclear startup Kairos Power announced a landmark partnership on Monday to deploy an advanced nuclear plant in Tennessee.

Beyond Megapixels: Why the future of cameras lies in experiences -- a 'World Photography Day' reflection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/beyond-megapixels-why-the-future-of-cameras-lies-in-experiences-a-world-photography-day-reflection/articleshow/123381117.cms,"From Resolution to Relevance

Crafting Experiences

A Cultural Shift in India

Arun Babu, Associate Director and Head of Digital Camera, Instax and Optical Devices Division,

FUJIFILM India

For decades, camera innovation has been measured in megapixels. Higher resolution was synonymous with better quality, and the race to pack more pixels into every sensor drove much of the industry’s narrative. But this World Photography Day , as we celebrate the art of capturing moments, it is clear that we are at an inflection point. Beyond a certain threshold, more megapixels no longer guarantee more compelling stories or stronger emotional resonance. The future of imaging lies not only in technical specifications, but in the experiences cameras create, how they help people capture, share, and relive memories in ways that feel immersive and meaningful.There is a shift in consumer behaviour. The conversation is moving beyond technical superiority to creative possibility. People are no longer chasing resolution alone; they are seeking tools that help them express themselves and create engaging narratives. Features like computational photography, instant printing, and seamless cloud integration are becoming just as important as sensor size. In India, this shift is amplified by the rise of the creator economy where content is valued for its relatability and aesthetic rather than sheer technical perfection.The camera of the future will craft an experience. We are already seeing early signals in products that blend digital and physical touchpoints. AR-enhanced lenses, AI-powered composition tools, and seamless app integration are adding layers of creativity to photography that go far beyond raw image resolution. It’s about making the process intuitive and immersive while keeping the emotional connection at the center.Another key factor driving this transition is how we consume memories. The explosion of short-form video platforms and the surge in real-time content sharing have created demand for cameras that can adapt to dynamic storytelling formats. At the same time, there is a counter-trend: a renewed appreciation for physical, tangible memories as a reaction to digital fatigue. Gen Z and millennials today value printed photographs as ‘more meaningful’ keepsakes compared to digital-only images. Cameras that can bridge these worlds - capturing, creating, and curating experiences are leading this new wave of innovation.In India, where cultural moments are deeply tied to emotions and community, this evolution carries even more weight. Weddings, festivals, and family milestones are about shared experiences. The next generation of cameras must recognize this cultural context and offer features that enable people to capture stories holistically through interactive content, personalized prints, or immersive visual formats.Ultimately, the question is no longer “How many pixels?” but “How does it make you feel?” The future of camera innovation will be defined by how seamlessly technology disappears into the background to let emotion and storytelling take center stage. As an industry, our focus must shift from specs to sentiments, from resolution to relevance. That is where the next big leap lies - in creating cameras that do not just record images, but enrich the experiences that make those images truly unforgettable.","The camera of the future will craft an experience.

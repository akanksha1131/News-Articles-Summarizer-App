Synergy Marine Group growing vegetables on its vessels using AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/synergy-marine-group-growing-vegetables-on-its-vessels-using-ai/articleshow/115671633.cms,"Synergy Marine Group brings AI-powered agriculture techniques on its vessels Synergy Marine Group Introduces Onboard Synergy Marine Group has revealed that its Suezmax tanker “EFFIE MAERSK” has been using Agwa’s AI-directed cultivation devices since September. These units, which are about the same size as standard refrigerators or wine coolers, allow the crew to enjoy freshly picked vegetables in the middle of the ocean.Eli Feiglin, Chief Commercial Officer of Agwa, said, “The Agwa grower units represent a major leap in onboard sustainability. The fully automated process allows crews to enjoy fresh greens and herbs without the need for special skills or substantial time commitment.”The self-contained units use artificial intelligence, cameras and sensors to regulate environmental factors such as ultraviolet light, water, fertiliser and temperature. The system is designed to be entirely automated, so the crew need only to monitor the process and occasionally check on the plants’ progress.From three Agwa units the “EFFIE MAERSK” has up to four bowls of fresh salad per week, along with herbs for seasoning. This not only provides nutritional benefits but also reduces waste and lessens the need for costly deliveries of fresh produce, which often suffers significant nutrient loss during long voyages, claims SMG Captain Rajesh Unni, Synergy’s founder and Chairman, said “Agwa’s technology allows us to serve fresher, healthier food onboard, directly enhancing crew welfare. This innovation also reduces food waste and delivers real-time benefits for the crew, aligning with our shared commitment to a greener, more sustainable maritime industry .”","Suezmax tanker “EFFIE MAERSK’ has been using Agwa’s AI-directed cultivation devices since September.

Tesla CEO’s growing global influence

Tesla CEO Elon Musk joined in a call between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and US President elect Donald Trump , reports The Information. The call took place shortly after Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the November 5 presidential election. It is not yet known what else was discussed on the phone call, apart from the congratulatory message. Musk reportedly listened in as Pichai congratulated and spoke with Trump.This isn’t the first time that reports of a conversation between Trump and Google’s CEO have surfaced online. During his election campaigns, Trump mentioned twice about calling Pichai.In an interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait last month, Trump said that he called Google CEO Sundar Pichai to highlight alleged biases in Google search, claiming it only shows negative stories about him. He then said “I called the head of Google the other day and I said, ‘I’m getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don’t find them in Google’,” he said. Pichai, Trump said in the interview, told him that “you’re the No. 1 person on all of Google for stories”.Also read: Donald Trump: I called Google CEO Sundar Pichai the other day and said ... In October again, Trump claimed that Pichai called him to convey accolades on his visit to McDonald’s. During an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, he said “I actually got a call from Sundar...the head of Google and he said, sir, I just want to tell you what you did with McDonald's was one of the single biggest events we've ever had at Google”.Elon Musk, who has been a vocal supporter of Trump in the US elections, has reportedly spent close to $130m to help get the former president re-elected. He was recently appointed as co-chair of the newly formed “Department of Government Efficiency” alongside Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies - Essential to the 'Save America' Movement,” Trump said.The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has previously participated in calls with global leaders and has offered advice on personnel decisions, both privately and publicly, through X—the social media platform he acquired in 2022. He has briefly joined a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as listened during a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Additionally, Musk has been seen frequently at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, taking part in sensitive discussions.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk joined in a call between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and US President elect Donald Trump.

Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath: Why and how air pollution may not be Delhi's problem alone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamath-why-and-how-air-pollution-may-not-delhis-problem-alone/articleshow/115659240.cms,"Read the post here

‘You have to wonder what it will take for us to take air pollution more seriously. By the way, this data only covers until 2019, and things have only gotten worse in the last five years.

Maybe a property price discount for the quality of air and water is the solution. If economics accounted for this, maybe we would all figure this out. Essentially the air and water quality determines the rate for the property.

Also, this would probably turn a property owner into the owner of the place, and better odds of fixing it if working as a group. For example, if I went from owning a property in JP Nagar and caring for it to caring for my layout in JP Nagar and then the whole of JP Nagar, it could have a better outcome.

While Delhi is getting all the attention, the AQI (Air quality index) isn't good in most urban areas in the country. Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and others are included in areas with very poor air quality.’

Nithin Kamath , the co-founder and CEO of online brokerage firm Zerodha , has sparked a national conversation about air pollution with a bold proposal: linking property prices to air quality. In a recent social media post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Kamath argued that Delhi's air pollution crisis shouldn't be seen as an isolated issue but as a national problem with far-reaching consequences.The proposed link between air quality and property prices is meant to incentivise a collective effort towards cleaner air.By tying economic value to environmental health, Kamath suggests homeowners and communities will have a stronger reason to advocate for cleaner air policies and take action to reduce pollution.Kamath bolstered his argument by sharing data highlighting the devastating impact of air pollution on public health. He pointed out that the economic burden of pollution is enormous, with the potential to offset any potential gains from inflated property prices.","Nithin Kamath is the co-founder and CEO of online brokerage firm Zerodha.

The couple married five years after meeting, and Huang went on to found Nvidia at age 30 in 1993 after stints at LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices, and completing his master's degree at Stanford University. The company has since grown into a $3.48 trillion enterprise, powered by the recent artificial intelligence boom.Today, both of the Huangs' children work at Nvidia - daughter Madison as a marketing director and son Spencer as a senior product manager. The CEO's signature black leather jacket look, which has become part of his public persona, was curated by his wife and daughter.The origin story emerged during Huang's acceptance of an honorary degree at HKUST, adding a personal dimension to the public profile of the tech executive who famously conceived Nvidia's initial business plan at a Denny's restaurant - the same chain where he once worked as a waiter during his college years.","Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, revealed that homework and an ambitious career promise helped him win over his wife Lori during their college days.

Apple TV set-top-box launch and upcoming smart displays

Apple, before launching the Apple TV app and Apple TV set-top box, explored a full-fledged television set with touchscreen capabilities, a report has said. The prototypes of these devices were ready even as Steve Jobs , before his passing, claimed to have solved the puzzle of creating an Apple television . However, this vision never materialised.According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, before his death in 2011, the Apple co-founder told biographer Walter Isaacson that he’d “finally cracked it”, referring to large-display prototypes that could also serve as a touchscreen Mac or iPad.The product would sync with other devices and the iCloud service, Jobs said, and “have the simplest user interface you could imagine.”Gurman said that despite these advancements, Apple ultimately shelved the project for two reasons. One was the low-profit margins, and the other being high production and shipping costs.Gurman said that Apple’s analysis of the TV market as a business suggested that TVs provide low margins and consumers usually don’t buy new ones very frequently like the way they upgrade to iPhones or Mac PCs.“The effort never got as far as the Apple Watch or Vision Pro — or even the now-defunct self-driving car. TVs are a low-margin industry, and consumers don’t buy new ones very frequently. At the time, Apple was highly dependent on people upgrading iPhones, iPads and Macs as often as possible (that remains true today, but the company at least has a healthier services business). A low-margin device without a path to upgrades would have been a mistake,” Gurman added.High manufacturing costs also proved to be a deal-breaker. The total cost of shipping TV-like devices from factories to people's homes was also a concern.“Apple also immediately encountered cost concerns, including the expense of air-shipping gigantic panels from factories to warehouses to homes. The company would have needed to develop and produce new chips to power the displays, as well as the input-output electronics. And the project would have required manufacturing facilities for the high-quality screens and adequate supplies of glass,” Gurman added.However, this didn’t impact Apple’s aspirations to reach people’s TVs. Apple now offers Apple TV box for streaming and Apple TV+ app that has a selection of successful content.Gurman has also said that Apple is actively developing various smart home devices, including a wall-mounted smart screen “that users can stick in their kitchens for videoconferencing and looking up recipes.”Notably, Amazon recently launched a 21-inch smart display and gave Echo Show 15 an upgrade. In comparison, Apple’s version is said to be about the size of two iPhones side by side, putting the overall screen size below 7 inches.","Report: Apple explored a full-fledged television set with touchscreen capabilities.

Had the pleasure of sitting through a sales pitch for a pretty big ""productivity monitoring"" software suite this morning. Here's the expected basics of what this application does:

Full keylogging and mouse movement tracking (this has been around for ages)



Takes a screenshot of your desktop every interval (between 10 seconds to 5 minutes), also part of every RMM I know



Keeps track of the programs you open and how often, also standard



Creates real-time recordings and heat maps of where you click in any program (nearly all websites also do this)



Here's where it gets fun:

It allows your manager to group you into a ""work category"" along with your coworkers



It then uses ""AI"" to create a ""productivity graph"" from all your mouse movement data, where you click, how fast you type, how often you use backspace, the sites you visit, the programs you open, how many emails you send and compares all of this to your coworker's data in the same ""work category""



If you fall below a cutoff percentage (say you type slower than your colleague or take longer to fill out a form or have to answer a phone call in the middle of writing an email), you get a red flag for review that gets sent to your manager and whoever else they choose



You can then be prompted to ""justify"" this gap in productivity in their web portal



If your desktop is idle for more than 30-60 seconds (no ""meaningful"" mouse & keyboard movement), you get a red flag



If your workflow is consistent Monday - Thursday but falls below the set aggregate data score on a Friday, you get a red flag



It also claims it can use all of this gathered data for ""workflow efficiency automation"" (e.g. replacing you). The same company that sells this suite conveniently also sells AI automation services, and since they already have all your employee workflow data, why not give them more money while you're at it?



While this is all probably old news for everyone here, I for one can't wait until the internet as a whole collapses in on itself so we can finally be free of this endless race to the bottom.

A viral Reddit post has sparked outrage about the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor employee activity. The post details a user's encounter with employee monitoring software that goes beyond traditional methods, utilising AI to analyse a variety of metrics.The software reportedly tracks not just keystrokes and program usage, but also typing speed, websites visited, emails sent and received, and even mouse movement patterns.This data is used to create ""productivity graphs"" for each employee, potentially flagging individuals for seemingly minor deviations from perceived optimal activity.According to the post, a dip in typing speed or a visit to a news website could trigger a ""red flag"" notification sent to managers. The user even claims the software scrutinises break times, with anything exceeding 30 seconds deemed a potential productivity issue.","A Reddit post details a user's encounter with employee monitoring software.

'US ban on Huawei is ineffective'

Europe's biggest telecom equipment and network company Ericsson is reportedly planning to move its headquarters from Sweden to the US. CEO Borje Ekholm has suggested that the company might consider relocating due to Europe’s struggling telecom industry . In an interview with Bloomberg, Ekholm revealed that the company has been shifting investments to north America, where the business climate is more favourable for growth.Ekholm told Bloomberg that Europe is falling behind and lawmakers in the continent must prioritise consolidation and reduce regulation to improve the situation.“The natural conclusion of that is we’ll be shrinking in Europe and growing in North America,” he said.Ekholm continued to state that the question of officially relocating to the US is a recurring topic, and while Ericsson has deep ties in Europe, it needed to take a wider view of what the world will look like in the future.“Would we relocate at some point in time? That could well happen,” he said.Ericsson CEO said that Europe is one of the weakest telecom markets in the world. He said what policymakers need to do is encourage more consolidation and cut regulation there. 5G adoption rates in the Europe lag behind many other developed nations. Ericsson CEO said that he has thrown his weight behind efforts by the region’s telecom operators to combine after seeing a number of mergers either rejected or heavily modified by regulators. “Europe is in need of consolidation,” Ekholm said. “It’s too many operators.”The European Commission has long thwarted consolidation, in part to maintain affordable service. Operators are now offering phone plans at such low prices that they can’t afford to invest, Ekholm said.In the wide-ranging interview, Ekholm also said that the US sanctions on Huawei had proven ineffective and the Chinese company remains its biggest competitor. Ericsson is attempting to outdo competition through R&D, as well as investments around open RAN.Indeed, the company made major inroads in the open RAN space in the US, securing a $14 billion contract with AT&T at the end of 2023.The executive acknowledged an open RAN approach may lead to more competition for Ericsson in the broader sense but added that a “horizontal platform” is “the way for us to actually beat the Chinese”.As well as open RAN, Ekholm said he expects its network API business to generate revenue in the next one or two years.The Swedish vendor made a big play around APIs in 2022, spending $6.2 billion to acquire cloud provider Vonage Holdings. However it has since taken around a $4 billion hit on the value of the unit in total, due to lower anticipated market growth.Ekholm admitted Ericsson had “dropped the ball” and “lost focus” on Vonage’s core, but it is now more intent on executing its business plan.",Ericsson CEO said that Europe is one of the weakest telecom markets in the world.

Samsung One UI 7 expected rollout

Samsung One UI 7 expected features

Samsung One UI 7 may be released soon. While other brands are rolling out stable Android 15 updates , Samsung has yet to release the first beta of its One UI 7, marking a surprising slowdown for a company known for its rapid updates in recent years. According to reports, this delay might be due to Samsung focusing on perfecting One UI 7. According to a new leak, the company may begin rolling out the One UI 7 as early as next month.Here’s a look at the expected timeline and features of Samsung One UI 7As per the leak, Samsung may begin the beta rollout of OneUI 7 in the first week of December. The tipster claims that Samsung may launch the Galaxy S24 with the latest UI version next year. (Here’s when Samsung may launch the Galaxy S24 series). According to the leakster, the beta program could be two months long.The Samsung Galaxy S23 series is expected to receive the One UI 6 update roughly three weeks after the beta rollout. For Galaxy S22 users, the beta update may arrive next year, while the Galaxy S21 series is unlikely to participate in the beta program at all.Earlier this year, tipster Ice Universe shared a video showcasing the updated animations and redesigned Quick Panel in Samsung's One UI 7. The video revealed a notable change in Samsung's design approach, with notifications now separated from quick settings in the dropdown menu.The revamped Quick Panel may adopt a bubble-shaped icon design, reminiscent of iOS. At the top, two larger bubbles may be present to offer quick access to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, while smaller icons for features like airplane mode, location, and flashlight are expected to be neatly arranged within a rounded rectangle. Additionally, the video suggested that users will likely have the ability to customise the panel by adding or removing controls to suit their preferences.","According to a new leak, the company may begin rolling out the One UI 7 as early as next month.

US may reduce Intel’s $8.5 billion chips grant: This may be the reason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intels-8-5-billion-chips-grant-may-take-a-hit-this-may-be-the-reason/articleshow/115653749.cms,"Intel

Why there’s a delay in Intel’s manufacturing facility plans

What it means for Intel and US government

The US government is reportedly scaling back Intel’s preliminary $8.5 billion federal CHIPS grant, reducing the funding to less than $8 billion. Intel , the largest beneficiary under the CHIPS Act , had been slated to receive the grant as part of the government’s broader push to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing .Citing four individuals familiar with the matter, The New York Times reports that the decision comes after delays in Intel’s investment plans and the company’s ongoing business struggles.The report also says that the grant adjustment also considers a $3 billion contract Intel has been offered to manufacture chips for the US military.Reportedly, the company’s decision to delay the completion of a chip manufacturing facility in Ohio—now projected to be finished by the end of the decade instead of 2025—prompted the federal government to reassess the terms of the funding.As per the report, the delay comes as Intel is facing mounting financial pressures, including its largest quarterly loss in 56 years. These struggles have forced the company to scale back investments and focus on cost reduction, while also grappling with the challenge of catching up technologically to rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).There have been reports suggesting that Intel has struggled to convince customers of its ability to compete with TSMC’s advanced technology, a factor that influenced the administration’s decision.Intel’s plans were considered central to the administration’s goals of reshoring chip production and reducing reliance on Asian suppliers. Under the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan initiative passed in 2022, Intel would have got financial help that would have subsidized the total cost of construction of semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the US.This effort aims to strengthen the domestic supply chain for the critical components that power a wide range of electronic devices, from smartphones to household appliances.","The US government is reportedly scaling back Intel’s preliminary $8.5 billion federal CHIPS grant, reducing the funding to less than $8 billion.

A jury in the US has ruled in favour of Netlist, a computer memory company, in a patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics. According to a report, the jury awarded Netlist $118 million in damages after finding that Samsung's memory modules used in high-performance computing infringed on Netlist's patents.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the jury also determined that Samsung's infringement was willful, meaning a judge may potentially triple the damages awarded to Netlist.It is to be noted that the verdict comes after Netlist secured a $303 million judgement against Samsung in a related case last year and a $445 million win against Micron Technology in May over similar patents.Netlist filed a lawsuit in 2022 alleging that Samsung's memory modules used in cloud computing and other data-intensive applications infringed on its patents related to improving data processing and power efficiency.Samsung countered by claiming the patents were invalid and that its technology differed from Netlist's inventions.The ongoing legal dispute between Netlist and Samsung Electronics, focusing on patents related to memory chip modules, began in 2015. Netlist, established in 2000 by Hong Chun-ki, a former employee of LG Semiconductor, possesses a collection of patents covering a range of semiconductor technologies.According to a report by The Korea Economic Daily, in 2015, Samsung made a payment of $23 million to Netlist as part of a five-year joint development and licensing agreement aimed at the production of memory solutions. However, when this agreement expired, Netlist sought a renewal of the intellectual licensing terms, but negotiations between the two companies broke down.Following the unsuccessful negotiations, Netlist initiated legal action against Samsung, alleging patent infringement.The South Korean tech giant has filed a separate lawsuit against Netlist in Delaware, accusing the company of violating licensing obligations for technology related to international standards.","Netlist, a computer memory company, won a patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung.

The 3 biggest players in India's broadband market

Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea — continued to suffer customer losses for the third month in a row in September, as per the latest TRAI data . The fall comes following the mobile data tariffs hikes announced by the three telcos in early July. As per data released by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) for the month of September, Jio lost 7.9 million wireless customers, followed by Vodafone Idea which saw a decline of 1.5 million wireless customers and Bharti Airtel lost 1.4 million wireless users.This fall in Reliance Jio's 4G and 5G user base triggered a sharp fall in India's mobile broadband user base in September -- the first decline after two years of steady growth since the launch of 5G services in October 2022. India's 4G-cum-5G user base plunged by a record 5.6 million in September, shrinking the nation's mobile broadband user base to 901 million. This user base had earlier risen from 790 million in October 2022 to around 906 million in August 2024.Notably, state-owned BSNL, which did not implement price hikes, gained 1.5 million users.According to a report in Economic Times, analysts at Jefferies attribute this sharp decline to the price sensitivity of Jio's customer base. The telecom giant, along with Airtel and Vi, had increased their tariffs by 11-25% in July, primarily to boost their average revenue per user (ARPU).As a result of the tariff hike, Jio's market share in the data subscriber segment dipped by 60 basis points, while Airtel, BSNL/MTNL, and Vi gained market share. However, Jio remains the dominant player in the combined 4G/5G user segment, holding a 51% market share.According to the latest data as of September 30, 2024, India's broadband market continues to be dominated by five major players who collectively command 98.42% of the total wired and wireless broadband market share.Reliance Jio Infocomm leads the pack with 477.94 million subscribers, followed by Bharti Airtel with 285.17 million subscribers. Meanwhile, Vodafone Idea maintained its third position with 126.36 million subscribers, while the state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) holds 37.73 million subscribers.Atria Convergence Technologies rounds out the top five with 2.27 million subscribers.","Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea continued to suffer customer losses for the third month in a row in September.

Eric Schmidt , former CEO and chairman of Google, is advocating for a bold transformation in America's military approach. He suggests that the U.S. military should transition away from conventional tank fleets and instead focus on deploying AI-powered drones . Schmidt, who led Google through a decade of significant growth from 2001 to 2011, played a pivotal role in shaping the tech giant’s trajectory.After stepping down as CEO, he served as executive chairman for both Google and later Alphabet, its parent company, before resigning from the role in 2018. Schmidt's call reflects his deep engagement with cutting-edge technology and its potential applications in national defense.Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia recently, Schmidt said, ""I read somewhere that the US had thousands and thousands of tanks stored somewhere."" ""Give them away. Buy a drone instead."" Schmidt's advocacy for drones is rooted in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war . He argues that the conflict has demonstrated the effectiveness of affordable, off-the-shelf drones in neutralizing expensive military equipment.Schmidt, according to reports by Forbes, reportedly told the audience that the Ukraine-Russia war has demonstrated how “a $5,000 drone can destroy a $5 million tank.”As per a Forbes report earlier this year, Schmidt is the founder of White Stork, a military startup that is building a “Kamikaze drone” for Ukraine. The drones are reported to be designed to loiter on the battlefield before being dispatched to destroy its target.“White Stork” is also a reference to a species of bird that is commonly found in Ukraine. Schmidt's startup White Stork is reportedly actively developing autonomous Kamikaze drones designed to target enemy positions in Ukraine. These drones, equipped with AI, can operate in challenging environments and identify targets even when GPS signals are jammed.In July 2023, Schmidt wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal calling drones as “the future of war. According to Schmidt, Ukrainian forces have “succeeded” despite the fact that Russia has a 3-to-1 advantage in soldiers as well as air superiority. Reason is: Ukraine's deployment of drones.Schmidt is listed by Bloomberg Billionaires Index among the 100 richest people in the world with a fortune valued at almost $35 billion.","Eric Schmidt, former CEO and chairman of Google, is advocating for a bold transformation in America's military approach.

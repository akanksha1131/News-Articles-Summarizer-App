Elon Musk wants to create in Texas what no other company and business leader has ever done,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-wants-to-create-in-texas-what-no-other-company-and-business-leader-has-ever-done/articleshow/116638548.cms,"Representative Image

What happens when Starbase comes into existence



Elon Musk is taking steps to establish a first-of-its-kind town for its rocket company SpaceX and its employees in in Texas, US. Employees of SpaceX have formally filed a petition to incorporate a new municipality called Starbase in coastal South Texas, where the company’s rocket launch facilities are located. The proposed city’s first mayor would be a SpaceX security manager.Over the years, Musk has shifted his operations from California to Texas, developing facilities across several counties. Musk has been envisioning the Starbase town for years, but recently progress accelerated as SpaceX employees started moving into nearby homes and temporary housing near the launch site.According to a report by the New York Times, residents working for SpaceX filed an official petition with Cameron County to hold an election on incorporation this month. The document (seen by NYT) reveals initial plans for the city. If this city comes into existence, Musk will create history by doing something that no other company or business leader has ever done.The Starbase plan remained stalled for years, partly due to Texas laws requiring a minimum number of residents and majority voter support to establish a new municipality. However, SpaceX employees have started settling into refurbished homes and temporary housing near the company's rocket launch site, the report claims.This month, these residents took a step toward creating a new city by filing a petition with Cameron County to hold an election, revealing initial details about Elon Musk's vision for the proposed municipality.If approved, the election would allow voters to select three city officials, including Gunnar Milburn, SpaceX's security manager, as the proposed first mayor. The petition outlines a community of roughly 500 residents, including 219 primary residents and over 100 children, located near Boca Chica Beach at the end of State Highway 4. Covering about 1.5 square miles, the proposed town is small by Texas standards. Most residents are renters and work for SpaceX.However, the petition does not mention why Musk and SpaceX employees are pursuing the creation of Starbase or what benefits they aim to achieve. The proposed town could establish its own police or fire departments or enact its ordinances.Apart from this, Musk may also be looking into the possibility of housing employees in a development outside the town of Bastrop, near Austin. The area is home to a growing campus for Musk companies, including a manufacturing plant for SpaceX; the headquarters of the Boring Company, which is creating tunnelling technology; and, soon, offices for the social media platform X (earlier Twitter).","Elon Musk is taking steps to establish a first-of-its-kind town for its rocket company SpaceX and its employees in in Texas, US.

Messaging platform Telegram has achieved its first-ever profit in 2024, marking a major milestone for the controversial chat app 11 years after its founding, CEO Pavel Durov announced Monday.The company's revenue exceeded $1 billion this year, nearly triple its 2023 figure of $342 million, driven by advertising and premium subscriptions. Telegram also reported $500 million in cash reserves, excluding cryptocurrency holdings.The profitability announcement comes as Telegram faces mounting global scrutiny over content moderation. Durov is currently unable to leave France following his August arrest over allegations of enabling criminal activity on the platform.The messaging service, which claims approximately 950 million users, has expanded its monetization efforts through multiple channels. Its premium subscription service, launched in 2022, has attracted 12 million paying users at $4.99 monthly. The company has also introduced revenue-sharing for content creators, business-tier subscriptions, and a mini app store.Telegram has made progress addressing its substantial debt obligations, repaying what Durov described as a ""meaningful share"" of its $2 billion in bonds this fall. The company had previously discussed the possibility of going public.Despite its financial success, Telegram continues to face regulatory challenges worldwide. Several countries, including Spain , Germany, and the UK, have considered bans or sanctions over the platform's minimal content moderation and alleged spread of misinformation. The service remains banned in China, Thailand , and Iran.The company has responded to some concerns by expanding its content moderation team to over 750 contractors. Durov maintains that the platform can achieve financial sustainability while ""staying independent and respecting users' rights.""","Telegram announces its first-ever profit in 2024.

Trading in Bharat Global Developers shares halted: What Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath warned on 'Baap of Chart' and Trafiksol ITS Technologies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/trading-in-bharat-global-developers-shares-halted-what-zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamath-warned-on-baap-of-chart-and-trafiksol-its-technologies/articleshow/116639429.cms,"Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath's 'warning' to investors

Scam stories: 'Baap of Chart' and Trafiksol ITS Technologies

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has halted trading in Bharat Global Developers ' shares following concerns over an unusual price surge. The suspension comes in response to a complaint filed on December 16, accompanied by social media posts questioning the company’s financial transparency. The complaint pointed to an extraordinary rise in the company’s share price, which skyrocketed 105 times between November 2023 and November 2024.The price jumped from Rs 51.43 per share on December 26, 2023, to Rs 1,236.45 per share by December 23, 2024, a massive increase of 2,304%. The suspension once again highlights dangers of investing in stocks without strong fundamentals. This comes close on heels of SEBI imposing a fine of Rs 19 lakh on Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory and its proprietor for regulatory violations, including misleading investors with false promises of returns.As Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath too recently warned investors about prevalent stock market scams, citing two recent SEBI orders involving Trafiksol ITS Technologies IPO and ""Baap of Chart."" In a long post on X, formerly Twitter, and a blog post. In the blog, Kamath emphasized that seeking quick profits is a recipe for losing money.Kamath highlighted two distinct scams: One involving an SME IPO that raised Rs 44 crore to purchase software from a shell company with fabricated financials and a bogus client list, and another involving a financial influencer (""finfluencer"") who amassed Rs 17 crore by selling courses and seminars. He reiterated the adage, ""if something is too good to be true, it almost always is.""Zerodha's blog post elaborated on these cases. The first involved an IPO where funds were supposedly earmarked for software acquisition from a vendor that turned out to be a shell company incapable of delivering the promised software. Despite this, the IPO was oversubscribed 345 times. The post outlined three key takeaways from SEBI's order: the vendor's lack of operational capability, fabricated financials and a fake client list, and a suspicious vendor selection process. SEBI had previously halted the Trafiksol ITS Technologies SME IPO pending investigation and subsequently ordered the company to refund investors.The second case involved ""Baap of Chart,"" a finfluencer who promised high returns and ran an unauthorized investment advisory service, collecting significant sums from investors. SEBI's investigation revealed that he was not providing free advice but rather operating an unregistered advisory service. SEBI subsequently barred Nasiruddin Ansari and his associates from the securities market and ordered them to refund investors.Kamath has consistently addressed such fraudulent activities. He recently warned about the potential dangers of AI-driven scams, referencing a case where a Bengaluru techie lost ₹91 lakh in an online stock market scam. This underscores the increasing sophistication of scams and the need for investor vigilance.",Sebi has halted trading in Bharat Global Developers'shares following concerns over an unusual price surge.

The LCD vs OLED debate



""OLED monitors will likely occupy a premium segment, while LCD will continue to dominate mainstream and budget-conscious markets, especially in regions like India,”

""The coexistence of technologies—LCD, mini-LED, and OLED—ensures that no single technology will completely dominate the market. Each serves its unique purpose and audience,”

Viewsonic recently unveiled its latest range of ColorPro monitors in India. The company has witnessed a surge in the demand for monitors substantially due to shift toward hybrid work and gaming post-pandemic. Industry trends like high refresh rates , colour accuracy, and features such as Type-C connectivity and portable monitors are said to be reshaping customer expectations.Talking about the monitor market of India and outside, ⁠Oscar Lin, Director of Marketing and Sales (IT Business), said, ""The biggest selling point is how we meet or fulfil customer needs. For gamers, creators, or professionals, our goal is to help them achieve efficiency and perfection through our solutions.""Sanjoy Bhattacharya, Director of Marketing and Sales (IT Business), chipped in, ""Monitors today are far more than just panels. With added features like wireless compatibility and built-in batteries, we’re seeing a transformation in the Asia-Pacific region, and these trends are shaping the Indian market as well.”ViewSonic confirmed that the rollout of its new monitor lineup, featuring 18-19 SKUs, will begin by January-end or early February 2025. Wei said, ""We’ve identified market needs and developed products that align with those demands. Customers today are ready to invest in quality, and this positions us for positive growth.""While debating if the superior OLED panels will overtake the LCD market anytime soon, the company said that it is way too soon for such a transformation. Despite OLED technology offering superior quality, LCD will remain dominant in the monitor market for some time. The company sees LCD technology to remain as the industry standard, with innovations like mini-LED backlighting bridging the gap between LCD and OLED performance.Oscar noted.The penetration of OLED monitors globally is currently around 2%, a stark contrast to LCD's widespread adoption.Oscar highlighted.","ViewSonic recently unveiled its latest range of ColorPro monitors in India.

The 24-hour study by Heat Initiative and ParentsTogether Action reviewed 800 apps and found that problematic apps garnered more than 550 million combined downloads.The investigation uncovered widespread issues across apps rated 4+, 9+, or 12+ in categories like chat, beauty, diet, internet access, and gaming. Among the concerning discoveries were 25 chat apps enabling stranger communication with minors, apps promoting extreme dieting behaviors, and gaming apps soliciting inappropriate photos. Many apps also offered ways to bypass school and home internet filters, even while carrying ratings suitable for young children. Apple takes no legal responsibility for the veracity of age ratings,"" the report stated, despite the company's claims that the App Store is a ""trusted place"" for users. The study found nearly all weight loss and unfiltered internet access apps were approved for children aged four and above. The researchers called for several reforms, including implementation of independent third-party reviews, greater transparency in the app rating process, stronger enforcement of age ratings, and enhanced parental controls.While Apple conducts both automated and manual checks on apps and provides features like Screen Time for child protection, the company acknowledges that "" App Store security measures alone can never be perfect."" With nearly 2 million apps on the platform, comprehensive screening remains challenging. The report's authors emphasized that the most effective protection requires both improved app screening and engaged parenting, recommending that parents actively monitor their children's app usage and verify app safety through personal testing.The findings come amid broader scrutiny of the App Store, including a recent $1.95 billion EU fine over anti-competitive practices in March 2024.

NPCI issues an advisory about 'online scams' that Indians are losing crores to,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/npci-warns-phonepe-gpay-and-other-upi-users-about-scam-that-indians-are-losing-crores-to/articleshow/116352174.cms,"What NPCI advisory says

What is digital arrest scam



How to identify a digital arrest scam

Unexpected Contact from ‘Officials’: Be cautious if someone claims to be from government agencies like the police, CBI, income tax officers, or customs agents, contacts you. Be cautious especially if they claim urgent legal action is being initiated or warranted. They might allege that you or one of your family members is involved in a serious crime like money laundering, tax evasion, or drug trafficking.

Fear-based language and urgency: Scammers may request video calls, disguising themselves in police uniforms, using government logos, or creating official-sounding background noise to appear legitimate. They often threaten arrest or immediate legal action, demanding a quick response and using legal terms to sound convincing. In some cases, they create a police station-like set up to further convince victims of their credibility.

Request for sensitive information or payment: Scammers may ask for personal information or demand large sums of money, promising that this will clear up your involvement in the alleged crime. They may also coerce you to transfer money to their account until the investigation is complete. Terms like “clearing your name”, “assisting with the investigation”, or “refundable security deposit/escrow account” might be used by them to persuade you into transferring money to specified bank accounts or UPI IDs.

Tips to stay safe

Pause and Verify: If you receive unexpected calls or messages about legal issues, take a moment to verify. Stay calm, as scammers rely on fear and urgency. Real government and law enforcement agencies will never ask for money or investigate cases through phone or video calls. Always confirm the caller’s identity and consult trusted sources before taking any action.

Use Support Channels: Report suspicious numbers to the national cybercrime helpline by dialing 1930 or the Department of Telecommunication (https://sancharsaathi.gov.in/sfc/).

The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country. As digital payments, including UPI, gain widespread adoption, incidents of online scams have risen significantly. Indians, as mentioned by PM Modi in one of the episodes of Mann ki Baat have lost Rs 120.3 crore through digital arrest scam s. In its advisory, the NPCI highlights the critical need for awareness and vigilance to protect against such fraudulent activities as India advances towards a digital-first economy.In a press release, NPCI says “Digital payments are now accessible nationwide, driving India towards a digital-first economy. They offer both security and convenience. However, it's crucial to use digital payments safely and avoid online scams. Early identification of potential scams helps protect you and your loved ones, fostering a safer, less-cash economy, for everyone.”The 'Digital Arrest' scam is a type of online fraud where cybercriminals trick individuals into believing they are under investigation or at risk of arrest by law enforcement or financial authorities. Scammers often impersonate government officials, police officers, or financial regulators and use fear tactics to manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information or transferring money. Some of the common tactics used in the scam include fake calls or messages, threat of arrest and demand for payment.As per NPCI, you can identify a digital arrest scam by keeping an eye for the following","The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

What the Netflix lawsuit says

Netflix has filed a lawsuit against Broadcom in a California federal court, accusing the chipmaker's subsidiary, VMware, of infringing on its patents related to virtual machine technology, a report has said.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the lawsuit alleges that VMware's cloud software violates five Netflix patents covering various aspects of operating virtual machines, specifically focusing on the vSphere virtualization platform used for deploying and managing these virtual machines.Netflix's lawsuit claims that VMware's technology infringes on its patents related to virtual machine communications. Virtual machines are a key component of cloud computing, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine.“Broadcom and VMware, jointly and severally, have infringed, and continue to infringe, at least Claim 1 of the ’424 Patent, either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents, by making, using, selling, and/or offering for sale within the United States and/or importing into the United States products that are covered by at least Claim 1 of the ’424 Patent.

When Karnataka's opposition leader accused Infosys of ‘betrayal at its best’

Karnataka's Deputy Leader of Opposition, Arvind Bellad, has accused Infosys of failing to create sufficient jobs despite acquiring subsidized land from the government. Speaking during the legislative session on December 24, Bellad called for action against the IT company. The BJP leader shared a post on microblogging site X (formerly known as twitter), where he wrote “Infosys seems to think it’s in the real estate business, not IT! Subsidized land across Karnataka but no jobs?”.Bellad alleges that Infosys obtained land in Bengaluru, Mysuru, and Mangaluru but has not delivered on employment commitments. Sharing a video of him speaking during the session, the Hubballi-Dharwad (West) MLA called out ‘this betrayal’ by Infosys. He said “Time for the government to look into this act! We owe it to the farmers who lost their lands!”.He further stated that the government had acquired the land from farmers with ""pain"" and emphasized that it should not be handed over to the Bengaluru-based firm for real estate purposes.In February this year, Bellad reiterated similar concerns, urging the government to reclaim the 58 acres allocated to Infosys in Hubballi due to its failure to generate jobs. He then posted a video on microblogging website X (formerly Twitter) where he tagged Infosys.He then wrote “Betrayal at its finest! @Infosys promised jobs, but all we got were empty #promises and trees. #Infosys #Hubli was granted 58 acres of land which is in my constituency with the aim of fostering employment for the entire North Karnataka region, yet it has failed to deliver on job creation.

Google Santa tracker: How to use and top features



Google Santa Tracker , is a popular Christmas feature that allows users to track Santa Claus in real time as he delivers presents worldwide. This feature offers a digital way to follow Santa’s journey on Christmas Eve . Each December 24, Google transforms Santa's Village into an interactive tracking experience, delighting children and adults alike. The platform provides updates on Santa's route, showing his progress as he and his reindeer travel across the globe spreading Christmas cheer. Here’s how the tradition started:This festive tradition that began in 2004 builds on NORAD's long-standing Santa tracking program but has evolved with Google’s modern technology, incorporating playful features and educational games to engage users throughout the holiday season.Meanwhile, NORAD’s tradition of tracking Santa Claus on Christmas Eve began in 1955 when a misprint in a department store advertisement prompted a child to call a Colorado military command centre, hoping to speak with Santa Claus.Air Force Colonel Harry Shoup, who answered the call, pretended to be Santa and reassured the child. As more calls came in, Shoup assigned an officer to manage the enquiries, which started the festive custom that NORAD carried on after its establishment in 1958.For decades, NORAD has paused its regular airspace monitoring duties each holiday season to answer children’s questions about Santa’s journey and his remarkable gift-delivery mission. Each year, over 100,000 kids call in to track Santa’s location, while millions more follow his progress online in nine languages as he travels across the globe spreading holiday cheer.Santa's journey can be tracked using Google’s tool on iPhone, iPad or Mac by accessing the official Santa Tracking website through a web browser. The site includes a live map displaying Santa's current location, his next stop, a live video feed of his travels, and estimated arrival times for specific locations.The website also showcases photos of places Santa has already visited, a live tally of gifts delivered, and his current distance from the user's location. Additionally, it offers a variety of interactive activities, including games, creative projects, and videos, making the experience engaging and entertaining.","Google Santa Tracker is a popular Christmas feature that allows users to track Santa Claus in real time as he delivers presents worldwide.

Indian IT hiring landscape is undergoing a shift as it recovers from a challenging 2024 and looks ahead to growth in 2025. While the sector faced a 7% decline in hiring in 2024 due to global uncertainties, experts predict a rebound fueled by economic improvements and technological advancements. As India enters 2025, there are positive indications of a significant rebound in IT hiring, says a report by news agency PTI. With macroeconomic challenges easing and key global election outcomes, including those in the US, providing more certainty, organizations are expected to regain confidence in the economic outlook.Wipro CTO Sandhya Arun predicts that businesses will fast-track the adoption of AI and advanced technologies to unlock greater value.“Year 2025 promises to be a year of high-velocity technology disruptions, offering new opportunities and presenting unprecedented challenges. The future belongs to enterprises that embrace technology and disruption..."" Arun said.The demand for specialized tech roles is expected to rise by 30-35%, driven by increasing reliance on emerging technologies.The IT sector is projected to see a 15-20% growth in job opportunities across industries, according to Sunil Chemmankotil, Country Manager of Adecco India.“Looking ahead, the combined hiring intent from GCC and IT services will be a welcome relief to job seekers. Employers are optimistic about recovery and growth as companies adapt to new technological landscapes and market needs,” he said.The report states that companies are prioritizing workforce upskilling, especially in AI and cybersecurity, to address evolving demands. Projections indicate a 15-20% growth in job opportunities, with a significant rise in demand for specialized roles.Global Capability Centres (GCCs) accounted for over half of job openings, but this wasn’t enough to offset the slowdown in IT services. Despite this, demand for roles in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) surged by 39%, highlighting a focus on specialized skills. Hiring in Tier 2 cities grew by 48%, reflecting a move beyond traditional tech hubs.Mid- to senior-level hiring saw a 35% increase, though fresh graduate hiring remained slow, with delays in onboarding due to uncertain deal flows.

AI systems will have emotions because…

Yann LeCun , Meta ’s Chief AI Scientist, has made a bold, or rather provocative, prediction: future AI systems will possess emotions. In a recent interview, LeCun explained that emotions are an “inseparable component” of the design of advanced AI systems.“So the blueprint of AI systems that we’re envisioning, that we’re going to build over the next few years — those AI systems will have emotions. It’s a basically inseparable component of the design of those systems,” he said while responding to a question at an interview.He argues that emotions are a natural consequence of AI agents being driven by objectives and goals.“Why would they have emotions? Because they will be driven by objectives,” LeCun explained. “You give them a goal that they have to accomplish, a task, and their purpose is to accomplish this task, subject to guardrails that are hardwired into their design,” he added.“And for them to do this, they need a number of components. The first component they need is a way to determine whether this goal that we give them was accomplished or not. And what they also need is what we call a world model. What is a world model is something that we all have — a prefrontal cortex that allows us to imagine what the consequences of our actions. And it’s what allows us to plan a sequence of actions to accomplish a particular goal. Now if you have this ability to predict ahead of time what a sequence of action is going to produce, then you can predict whether a goal is going to be satisfied or not. And you can predict if the outcome is going to be good or bad,” LeCun added.LeCun believes that this ability to predict and react to potential outcomes will give rise to emotions in AI.“If you predict it’s going to be bad, you feel fear. If you predict it’s going to be good, it’s more like elation, right? So, (you’ll need) the ability to predict, and then to act so as to accomplish those predictions (which) produces the equivalent of emotions. So AI systems that are smart enough, that are capable of reasoning and planning, will have emotions,” he explained.","Yann LeCun, Meta’s Chief AI Scientist, has made a bold, or rather provocative, prediction: future AI systems will possess emotions.

Anti-piracy group ‘warns’ operators after taking down one of the world’s largest illegal live sports rings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anti-piracy-group-warns-operators-after-taking-down-one-of-the-worlds-largest-illegal-live-sports-rings/articleshow/116629841.cms,"Who were the primary targets of the piracy ring



What the affected companies said about the operation



“The shutdown of this globally notorious live sports piracy ring is a huge victory in our campaign against the piracy of live sports programs and follows other recent successful actions by ACE and law enforcement in Vietnam. ACE's live sports members face a unique threat when it comes to

digital piracy

, as live sports broadcasts lose substantial commercial value once the game ends. The takedown serves as a warning to piracy operators everywhere – including operators in live sports piracy – that ACE will identify and shut down their illegal operations.”

“DAZN stands with ACE in the fight to eradicate piracy, which undermines the sports ecosystem at all levels. It is very pleasing that a criminal operation of this scale was taken down. Piracy often compromises the security of fans' data, which is then used for illegal purposes, so the closure of this piracy ring has the added benefit that potential subscribers will be guided toward legitimate content providers like DAZN.”

The Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment ( ACE ) has shut down a major Vietnam-based sports piracy ring. In a blog post, the world's leading anti-piracy coalition announced the shutdown of the racket’s websites, including bestsolaris.com and streameast.to, which were viewed extensively throughout the world.With the websites getting over 812 million visits in the past year, the group became the largest sports piracy ring in the world. ACE noted that it identified and approached the Hanoi-based operators, who agreed to transfer 138 domains to the organisation. This is the largest sports piracy ring taken down by ACE to date which also includes other websites like markkystreams.com, crackstreams.dev and weakspell.to.The sites primarily catered to audiences in the US and Canada, streaming daily sports events, including content from all US sports leagues as well as global leagues across various categories. This illegal operation impacted all ACE members, including its sports-focused members like beIN Sports, Canal+, and DAZN.Commenting on the live sports piracy ring being busted, the executive VP and chief content protection officer for the Motion Picture Association (MPA), Larissa Knapp said:UK-based sports streaming platform DAZN also expressed its relief at the piracy racket being shut down. The company’s CEO Ed McCarthy said:","The Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment ( ACE ) has shut down a major Vietnam-based sports piracy ring.

SAP fired CTO Jurgen Muller based on sexual harassment allegations



Blizzard executives left after Microsoft acquisition



Bungie cut 17% jobs including top executives who were in senior leader roles



Elon Musk's Tesla cuts top executives and their teams



Evolv terminates CEO Peter George



Comtech fires CEO Ken Peterman over undisclosed conduct related reasons



Intuit lays off executives including many in top management



2024 has been a tumultuous year for corporate leadership in the tech industry as multiple companies made headlines for ousting their top executives. From tech giants like Intel and SAP to gaming powerhouses such as Bungie and Blizzard, high-profile firings have sparked conversations about shifting priorities, performance pressures, and internal upheavals among tech companies. These sudden departures reflect broader challenges, including the struggle to adapt to evolving market demands, employee dissatisfaction, and controversies surrounding the conduct of some leaders. Here’s a list of tech companies who were sacked, fired or laid off their top executives this year:Earlier this month, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger was ousted by the company's board of directors Driven by mounting concerns over Intel's struggle to regain market share and compete effectively with rivals like Nvidia, the company took this decision According to a Bloomberg report, the board's confidence in Gelsinger's leadership eroded after a meeting last week where the company’s performance and future strategies were scrutinised. Given the option to resign or face removal, Gelsinger ultimately chose to step aside.In September, German IT company SAP SE sacked its Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Jurgen Muller following allegations of sexual harassment. Müller stepped down from his position soon after facing the allegations. German prosecutors also launched a criminal investigation into Muller.Blizzard president Mike Ybarra announced his decision to leave the company months after Microsoft confirmed its acquisition of gaming studio Activision Blizzard earlier this year. Post his departure, Activision Blizzard faced a series of challenges, including allegations of workplace misconduct and mismanagement. The departure of the World of Warcraft and Overwatch 2 developer added to the company's ongoing troubles. The studio’s Chief Design Officer Allen Adham also departed from Blizzard. Microsoft also shared plans to appoint a new Blizzard president within a week.In July, another gaming studio, Bungie announced the layoff of 220 employees accounting for nearly 17% of its workforce, amid rising development costs, industry shifts, and challenging economic conditions. This decision impacted all levels of the company, including many executive and senior leadership positions. Apart from this, Bungie also announced major changes to its cost structure, redirecting its development focus exclusively to titles Destiny and Marathon.In April, Elon Musk-led car maker Tesla announced layoffs. The executives let go included senior director of EV charging senior executives Rebecca Tinucci and Tesla’s head of the new vehicles program, Daniel Ho along with their respected teams. This followed a round of layoffs that reportedly impacted 14,000 employees.Last month, security technology company, Evolv Technologies, fired its CEO, Peter George, amid an ongoing investigation into its sales practices. The company's board of directors made the decision after months of deliberation. Michael Ellenbogen, the current chief innovation officer, was appointed as the interim CEO and president.Global technology company Comtech fired its CEO Ken Peterman for undisclosed reasons related to conduct in March. The company's board of directors appointed John Ratigan, the chief corporate development officer, as interim CEO while initiating a search for a permanent CEO.In July, US-based IT company Intuit laid off about 1,800 employees, affecting 10% of its workforce which also included top executives. With these job cuts, the company was trying to streamline operations and improve decision-making. While some layoffs were due to performance issues, others were part of a broader restructuring plan to consolidate teams and shut down certain offices.","This year has been a tumultuous year for corporate leadership in the tech industry as multiple companies made headlines for ousting their top executives.

Airtel added 1.93 million mobile subscribers during the month. While Reliance Jio added more active users than Bharti Airtel in October 2024, as per Trai’s report, in terms of gross customer numbers, Airtel was the only gainer, adding 1.92 million users.Reliance Jio and Vi experienced significant losses, losing 3.76 million and resulting in their user bases shrinking to 460 million and 210.47 million, respectively. Airtel's user base increased to 385.41 million in October. Analysts attributed Jio’s substantial gross user loss to the removal of inactive, low-revenue 4G customers following July's rate hikes. Jio’s customer base comprises only 4G and 5G users.This shift impacted market share: Jio's decreased to 39.99% (from 40.2%), Airtel's increased to 33.5% (from 33.24%), and Vi's decreased to 18.30% (from 18.41%).Overall wireless tele-density in India fell to 81.77% in October 2024, with the total mobile user base declining by 3.31% to 1.15 billion due to the losses experienced by Jio and Vi.In the landline segment, Jio strengthened its market leadership, adding 0.68 million users for a total of 15.68 million.

Should we take the AI Leap of Faith?

What’s The

Future of Work

in the AI Era?

What does the future hold?

--- by Sajju Jain, Board Member, Entrepreneur, & Harvard Alum

Imagine, in the future, your colleague is not a person but an AI, tirelessly handling tasks with precision, completing work in seconds, and adapting to the latest industry trends before you even blink. That future isn’t a sci-fi movie plot, it’s happening right now!When considering AI’s impact on work, automation is often the first thing that comes to mind. Yet, for emerging markets , the applications are both broader and deeper. AI has evolved beyond simple task automation. It’s not just replacing human labour – it’s creating new possibilities for development and efficiency that were once unimaginable.For example, in healthcare, several AI startups are demonstrating how they can now automatically capture and consolidate a patient's tests and scans, their prescription information, and the clinician notes. This can provide a complete patient health snapshot to improve diagnosis, treatment, and give medical professionals more time with patients.Changes are also happening at the industry level where non-traditional players are competing with traditional healthcare providers. For example, Apple takes the vast amount of data it captures daily from users and creates a 'portable health record' for them. All this will help deliver better health outcomes, and the main beneficiaries will be emerging markets where it'll help lower costs and better utilize scarce resources like medical professionals.According to Accenture, AI can add up to $957 billion current gross value added to India's economy in 2035 by boosting productivity and creating significant new economic opportunities. Every other emerging market is also rushing to include AI at a national, industrial, and organizational level.For organizations, AI provides the potential to grow more effectively, reduce operational costs, and personalize customer experiences. According to the World Economic Forum’s recent report on the future of jobs, nearly 85% of Indian employers see AI as an opportunity to generate new jobs within the next 1-5 years and enhance the quality of existing roles. However, one of the most pressing challenges they face is the skill gap. AI demands a high level of language proficiency, data literacy, and analytical skills, which are not yet widespread among their workforces.To address this, organizations across emerging markets must invest in training and upskilling programs for their teams. Governments can support these initiatives by offering both financial and non-financial support.As AI becomes more integrated into our day-to-day lives, ethical considerations and data privacy concerns will become increasingly important. The NITI Aayog’s National Strategy for AI emphasizes the need for fairness, accountability, and transparency, especially when handling customer data.This means organizations, big or small, will need to establish clear data governance policies to comply with regulations and ensure that AI applications are ethical, fair, and non-discriminatory. Creating ethical AI isn't just about avoiding risk; it strengthens relationships with all stakeholders who know that their data is in safe hands.So, by embracing AI thoughtfully and responsibly, organizations can unlock unprecedented growth, streamline operations, and foster trust with stakeholders. Embracing AI and taking the leap of faith is not just worth taking, but essential for every organization's sustained success.The rise of AI is not just reshaping how we work but redefining what work means altogether. The future of work in India and other emerging markets will require a delicate balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and nurturing the uniquely human traits that set us apart. This transition isn't just about technology - it's about preparing people and organizations to thrive in a new era.All sectors of emerging economies are seeing growing demand for roles such as data analysts, AI trainers, cybersecurity experts, ethical AI consultants, and robotic process automation specialists. Interestingly, even roles in traditional fields like marketing, finance, and operations are also evolving to include more AI focused tasks, creating hybrid job profiles that combine core expertise with AI proficiency. For those in non-technical roles, learning how to work with AI tools for all types of roles will become a valuable skill.However, as these AI tools become ubiquitous and take on more data-heavy and process-driven tasks, stakeholders will place a premium on human interactions for competitive differentiation. Higher-level skills like emotional intelligence, creativity, and collaboration will play a critical role in AI-enabled workplaces. They'll help manage complex team dynamics, better support clients, and solve problems more effectively. So, having a mindset inclined towards continuous learning and adaptability will be critical for job security in this new landscape.The AI revolution is as unstoppable as the internet revolution was. It’s best that we embrace and guide it, instead of opposing it. The future of work for everyone in emerging markets will require creating a collaborative roadmap for responsible AI adoption – one that aligns technology with long-term goals and includes all impacted stakeholders, especially humans. Leaders across all types of organizations, both public and private, will need to work with their stakeholders to foster a culture that values continuous learning, encourages innovation, and helps their teams see AI as a tool to enhance, rather than replace, their work.",The rise of AI is not just reshaping how we work but redefining what work means altogether. The future of work in India and other emerging markets will require a delicate balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and nurturing the uniquely human traits that set us apart.

Donald Trump's AI head Sriram Krishnan bats to remove country caps for Green Cards; here's why it is good news for Indians,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trumps-ai-head-sriram-krishnan-bats-to-remove-country-caps-for-green-cards-heres-why-it-is-good-news-for-indians/articleshow/116629100.cms,"How removal of country caps may be good news for Indians



Elon Musk agrees with Perplexity AI CEO

US President-elect Donald Trump recently appointed Chennai-born Indian-American entrepreneur and venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan as Senior Policy Advisor for AI at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Krishnan, known for his close association with tech billionaire Elon Musk , recently shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) saying “Anything to remove country caps for green cards / unlock skilled immigration would be huge.”When a user asked if removing country caps may backfire, Krishnan explained the logic stating “we need the best, regardless of where they happen to be born (another bizarre quirk - the country cap is where you were born, not even citizenship)”.David Sacks, appointed by Trump as “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar,” further clarified Krishnan’s proposed removal of country caps. Taking to X, he shared a post:“Point of clarification: Sriram didn’t say he wants to remove all caps on green cards. He said he wants to remove *country* caps on green cards. Right now, every country in the world gets allocated the same number of green cards, no matter how many qualified applicants it has.”Adding further, he said “So applicants from India have an 11 year wait whereas applicants from many other countries have no wait at all.”“Sriram still supports skills-based criteria for receiving a green card, not making the program unlimited. In fact, he wants to make the program entirely merit-based. Supporting a limited number of highly skilled immigrants is still a prevalent view on the right. Sriram is definitely not a “career leftist”!,” he stated.Highlighting to focus on skilled individuals over equal country representation, Perplexity AI CEO Arvind Srinivas commented on Sacks post, “Exactly. DOGE for immigration doesn’t mean more immigration or remove caps. Rather, it means let the best people in based on skill rather than trying to make sure every country is equally important.”Notably, Elon Musk responded to Srinivas’s post with a 💯, showing his full agreement.","US President-elect Donald Trump recently appointed Chennai-born Indian-American entrepreneur and venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan as Senior Policy Advisor for AI at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.

Tips to stay safe from fake voice calls

Be suspicious of unexpected calls:



If you receive a call from an unknown number or an unexpected caller, be cautious.

Legitimate organisations rarely make unsolicited calls for sensitive information.



Verify caller identity:



If the caller claims to be from a bank, government agency, or company you do business with, independently verify their identity.

Use official contact information (phone numbers, email addresses) found on their website to reach out directly.



Never share personal information:



Do not share your Social Security number, bank account details, credit card information, passwords, or any other sensitive information with unknown callers.



Don't fall for urgency tactics:



Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into making quick decisions.

Take your time, and don't let them rush you.



Hang up and report:



If you suspect a call is fraudulent, hang up immediately.

Report the call to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.

You can also report it to your phone carrier.



Utilise call-blocking features:



Many phones and phone carriers offer call-blocking features.

Utilize these features to block suspected spam numbers.



A fraudulent call is making the rounds, falsely claiming to be from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The voicemail warns that your bank account will be blocked due to alleged fraudulent activity involving your credit card. However, PIB Fact Check has verified that these messages are completely fake and should be ignored.PIB Fact Check in its post on X (formerly known as Twitter) has confirmed that it is a fake voicemail and has asked users to stay aware. “Have you received a voicemail, allegedly from the Reserve Bank of India, claiming that your bank account will be blocked as your credit card has been involved in fraudulent activity #PIBFactCheck Beware!

Intel shareholders want fired CEO Pat Gelsinger to return three years of salary for these 5 ‘big mistakes’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-shareholders-want-fired-ceo-pat-gelsinger-to-return-three-years-of-salary-for-these-5-big-mistakes/articleshow/116618654.cms,"Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger delivers a speech at the COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan June 4, 2024. REUTERS/Ann Wang/File Photo

Intel shareholders have launched a derivative lawsuit against former CEO Pat Gelsinger and current CFO David Zinsner , demanding the return of $207 million in executive compensation following massive losses in the company's foundry business.The legal action, filed in federal court in San Jose, targets compensation paid to Gelsinger during his tenure from 2021 to 2023.The lawsuit, brought by LR Trust, alleges that Intel's leadership deliberately misled investors about the performance of Intel Foundry Services (IFS), which recorded a staggering $7 billion operating loss in 2023. According to court documents, the situation deteriorated further in 2024, with Q2 losses expanding to $2.83 billion, significantly worse than the $1.87 billion loss reported in Q2 2023.Shareholders claim that executives breached their fiduciary duties by maintaining an optimistic public stance about IFS despite its failure to attract major customers and mounting operational losses. The lawsuit specifically challenges Intel's 2024 Proxy Statement, arguing it failed to adequately disclose risks and misrepresented the foundry division's growth potential.The legal filing details five key allegations against Intel's leadership, including claims that IFS's reported growth metrics were misleading and that the division experienced declining product profit driven by lower internal revenue. These financial struggles ultimately led to company-wide layoffs and the suspension of Intel's dividend payments.This derivative lawsuit, which would return any awarded damages to Intel rather than individual shareholders, follows similar legal actions filed in June and August 2024. The mounting legal pressure comes in the wake of Gelsinger's resignation as CEO in December, marking a dramatic end to his vision of transforming Intel into a major player in the foundry business.The lawsuit also names various board members as defendants, accusing them of unjust enrichment and wasting corporate assets. Gelsinger had championed Intel's strategic pivot toward manufacturing chips for external customers when he announced the company's ""internal foundry model"" in October 2022, a move that shareholders now claim was mismanaged from the start.","Intel shareholders have launched a derivative lawsuit against former CEO Pat Gelsinger and current CFO David Zinsner.

The store has eliminated its practice of including hint-laden wrapping paper art, while also offering DLC instead of full games in some cases.The latest controversy peaked on December 23 when the platform offered Dark and Darker – Legendary Status DLC as its fifth mystery gift, requiring users to already own the base game. This marked a departure from previous years' offerings of complete games, leading to widespread disappointment among the community.A key point of contention is the removal of the promotional wrapping paper artwork that traditionally contained clues about upcoming games. While some users praise this change for maintaining genuine surprise, others lament the loss of the community guessing game that had become a holiday tradition.The promotion, running from December 19 to January 2, continues to offer daily free items instead of the store's usual weekly schedule. However, users have noted that this year's selections have been less notable compared to previous holiday giveaways.Adding to the changes, the usual pattern of advance leaks has been disrupted, with fewer accurate predictions circulating online. When leaks do occur, they now typically emerge just hours before releases, rather than days or weeks in advance as in previous years.The platform's holiday promotion will continue through early January, though the community remains divided over whether these changes represent an improvement or deterioration of the annual event."," Epic Games Store's 2024 holiday mystery game promotion has sparked controversy among users.

Meta Ray-Ban glasses with display: What to expect

Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly planning an upgrade for its Ray-Ban glasses. Rumours claim that these smart glasses may soon feature a display. A new report suggests that the next-generation model could launch by 2025. The current model supports voice commands and audio feedback. A display will not only improve the user experience by allowing more intuitive interactions and visual information but will also help the Meta Ray-Ban glasses with Apple’s mixed reality headset, Vision Pro.Using the glasses' reading feature is often convenient, but there are situations where a visual display proves more efficient. People can typically read text faster than it can be narrated, making the option important.According to a report by the Financial Times, this functionality is expected to arrive soon. The report claims that this upgrade marks a major step in Meta’s efforts to develop lightweight headsets that replace smartphones as consumers’ primary computing devices.The report cites sources familiar with the plans to claim that the social media giant is planning to integrate a screen into the $300 (above Rs 25,000) sunglasses it produces in collaboration with eyewear manufacturer EssilorLuxottica.The upgraded Ray-Ban glasses could launch as soon as the second half of 2025, featuring a small display designed to showcase notifications or responses from Meta’s virtual assistant.Similar to the Vision Pro, the Meta’s smart glasses are also unavailable in India.Previously, Meta unveiled an early prototype of its Orion AR glasses. Although the design is admittedly bulky and comes with a reported manufacturing cost of $10,000. However, the prototype offered a glimpse into the potential of augmented reality in a form factor closer to the existing Ray Ban smart glasses.Apple is also believed to share a similar vision, with its long-term goal reportedly focused on developing AR glasses. The Vision Pro is seen as an initial step on the path toward the anticipated Apple Glasses. While voice interaction will likely be a key feature, Apple is expected to prioritise integrated displays in its designs.",Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly planning an upgrade for its Ray-Ban glasses.

Two reasons why Microsoft may be exploring alternatives to OpenAI for 365 Copilot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/two-reasons-why-microsoft-may-be-exploring-alternatives-to-openai-for-365-copilot/articleshow/116609976.cms,"Why Microsoft is making this change

Tension between Microsoft and OpenAI

Microsoft is reportedly looking beyond OpenAI to power its flagship AI product, Microsoft 365 Copilot . The tech giant is reportedly exploring the use of alternative language models. This marks a shift from the company's previous emphasis on its early access to OpenAI's models, which was a key selling point when 365 Copilot launched in 2023.Citing sources, news agency Reuters reported that Microsoft is also seeking to reduce 365 Copilot's reliance on OpenAI due to concerns about speed for enterprise users. The company is also aiming to reduce its reliance on OpenAI's technology and potentially lower costs.For this, Microsoft is reportedly training its own smaller models, like the recent Phi-4, and customising open-weight models to improve 365 Copilot's efficiency and performance.“We incorporate various models from OpenAI and Microsoft depending on the product and experience,” a Microsoft spokesperson told the agency, while confirming that OpenAI remains a partner for “frontier models.”The goal is also to potentially pass those savings to the end customer, and Microsoft's leaders, including CEO Satya Nadella, are said to be tracking the efforts closely.This move mirrors similar efforts in other Microsoft business units. GitHub, for example, recently added models from Anthropic and Google as alternatives to OpenAI's GPT-4o. Microsoft's consumer chatbot, Copilot, also now utilizes in-house models alongside OpenAI's technology.Several reports have suggested that the close partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI may be facing some challenges. Just a year after Microsoft played a key role in reinstating Sam Altman as OpenAI's CEO, their relationship appears to be showing signs of strain.While acknowledging the natural tensions in any partnership, Suleyman hinted at the diverging paths of the two companies.""Every partnership has tension. It's healthy and natural. I mean, they're a completely different business to us. They operate independently and partnerships evolve over time... partnerships evolve and they have to adapt to what works at the time, so we'll see how that changes over the next few years,"" Suleyman said.","Microsoft is reportedly looking beyond OpenAI to power its flagship AI product.

The 'likely Trump' factor behind the strikes

Amazon and Starbucks is joined by Elon Musk's Starlink

Strikes are underway at Amazon and Starbucks in several US cities as workers push for Union recognition and improved contracts. These actions follow a year of significant labour wins for Unions at companies like Boeing, and among dockworkers, video game performers, and Las Vegas casino workers. So what's behind the strikes at Amazon and Starbucks?Amazon reportedly refuses to formally acknowledge unionization efforts by its drivers and warehouse workers, despite some successful union votes and the Teamsters union claiming to represent them. Starbucks, while having agreed to negotiate, is facing criticism for slow progress.These strikes, particularly timed around the holiday season, aim to maximize pressure on the companies. The organizing drives at both companies gained momentum after the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the importance of frontline workers and economic inequality. This period also saw successful unionization efforts at other retailers like Apple, Trader Joe's, and REI.A key factor driving the timing of these strikes is the upcoming change in presidential administration. With the potential for a less union-friendly National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) under a new administration, unions are attempting to leverage public pressure now. While some recent political appointments suggest a potentially more nuanced stance on labour relations, the immediate future of the NLRB remains a concern for unions.John Logan, director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, told news agency AP that he thinks the Amazon and Starbucks workers are “desperate” to make progress before President-elect Donald Trump gets to appoint a Republican majority to the National Labor Relations Board, which is expected to be less friendly to unions during his administration.“The unions want to make these disputes public and bring political pressures on the companies,"" Logan said in a written statement. “If these disputes drag on until next year, and if they are fought largely through the labor board and the courts, the unions and workers will almost certainly lose. This might be their last, best chance to pressure the companies in public before Trump comes into office.”Amazon reportedly objected to the 2022 warehouse election results, reportedly claiming that the Amazon Labor Union and the federal labour board had tainted the vote. A regional NLRB director issued a complaint last year that accused Amazon of violating the law by refusing to bargain with the union.Amazon, in turn, is challenging the constitutionality of the NLRB in federal court along with Elon Musk 's SpaceX. In June, the US Supreme Court made it harder for the agency to win court orders in labour disputes, siding with Starbucks in a case brought by the company.","Strikes are underway at Amazon and Starbucks in several US cities as workers push for Union recognition and improved contracts.

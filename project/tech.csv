"""De minimis"" exemptions: What Trump Tariffs have done to Chinese shopping websites is similar to what India did to them in 2020",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/de-minimis-exemptions-what-trump-tariffs-have-done-to-chinese-shopping-websites-is-similar-to-what-india-did-to-them-in-2020/articleshow/120834448.cms,"FILE - A made in China sticker is displayed on a hat at a store in Chinatown in San Francisco (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)

De minis is kinda similar to ban on Chinese 'gift/parcel imports' India imposed in 2020

Donald Trump calls ""De minimis"" a Big Scam

The Trump administration has terminated duty-free access for low-value shipments from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2, 2025, eliminating the ""de minimis"" exemption under Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. This loophole, previously used by e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu , as well as traffickers of illicit goods like fentanyl, allowed packages valued up to $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, enabling foreign retailers to offer lower prices than U.S. competitors.Originally enacted in 1938 to reduce administrative costs for negligible duties, the exemption has now been closed, increasing costs for imported goods. The change also introduces significant administrative challenges for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and importers, who must now inspect millions of additional packages daily, likely causing shipment delays.Under new CBP guidelines, shipments from China and Hong Kong face a 145% tariff plus existing duties, except for exempted products like smartphones. Express shippers like FedEx, UPS, and DHL will handle most of these. Postal shipments valued up to $800 are subject to a 120% tax or a $100 flat fee per package, increasing to $200 in June 2025.This is similar to the major crackdown by the Indian government on online purchases of goods from Chinese e-commerce platforms that were escaping customs duty and goods and services tax in 2019. Many Chinese e-commerce platforms were shipping goods ordered by Indians to various cities claiming these were “gifts”. As per the domestic laws, any gifts received by Indians up to Rs 5,000 don’t attract any taxes.The clamp down was announced after there were reports that the Chinese retailers such as Club Factory, AliExpress and Shein were taking undue advantage of the exemption from customs duties by shipping their products as gifts and billing them under Rs 5,000 to avoid import duties. “It is often brought to the notice that authorised registered couriers are outsourcing activities without prior permission from or intimation to customs.. and without exercising necessary due diligence and checks,” an official communication by customs department read. Almost a year later, in June 2020, the Indian government banned these Chinese shopping apps along with some 50 other apps across categories.President Donald Trump has called the de minimis exemption ""a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses."" ""We put an end to it,"" he said.Also read: Cheap parcels from China will no longer be duty-free","The Trump administration has terminated duty-free access for low-value shipments from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2, 2025.

Drudge-Style ‘White House Wire’ goes live with Trump’s top headlines

White House Wire: Trump’s new tool to sideline mainstream media

Relationship with conservative media

Exclusion of mainstream outlets and media controversies

Implications for political communication

In a major media development, former U.S. President Donald Trump has launched a new website called White House Wire (WH.gov/wire), modeled closely after the conservative-leaning Drudge Report . Announced on a Wednesday, the platform is designed to serve as a centralized bulletin board featuring pro-Trump news coverage and bypassing traditional mainstream media sources, which Trump has frequently labeled as "" fake news .""The new site arrives amidst continued tensions between Trump and national news organizations, positioning itself as an alternative outlet for supporters seeking curated, pro-administration content. Styled with a retro hyperlink-heavy layout, White House Wire reflects a calculated strategy to directly influence public perception by amplifying favorable coverage and diminishing critical press narratives. This move builds upon existing Trump-era practices of reshaping media access and messaging, marking a further evolution in the former president’s effort to consolidate communications within partisan boundaries.White House Wire features a streamlined, bulletin-board format similar to the Drudge Report. The homepage is divided into columns filled with hyperlinks to articles sourced from media outlets favorable to Trump or those that offer positive analysis of his administration's actions. The layout is intentionally minimalistic to prioritize rapid navigation and headline visibility.Highlighted articles as of the launch include:The site also links directly to Trump's media appearances, such as an ABC News interview, and includes a 24/7 headline ticker dubbed ""FOURTY-SEVEN,"" referencing Trump's aspirations for a second term as the 47th president.White House Wire represents a calculated expansion of Trump’s longstanding media strategy. Throughout his political career, Trump has accused mainstream news outlets like CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post of spreading misinformation or promoting biased coverage. White House Wire serves as a curated feed, elevating coverage that aligns with Trump's messaging while minimizing opposing narratives.This platform also reinforces Trump’s broader campaign efforts by creating a digital space that mirrors conservative values, promotes patriotism, and highlights key Republican policy achievements. It provides an official platform for amplifying supportive commentary, thereby reducing dependence on external media intermediaries.The site’s structure pays homage to the Drudge Report, a historically influential conservative news aggregator. However, unlike Drudge’s current editorial stance—which has become more critical of Trump in recent years—White House Wire maintains an explicitly supportive tone. This differentiation positions White House Wire as a replacement rather than a complement to more traditional conservative aggregators.According to a White House spokesperson, ""It's a place for supporters of the president's agenda to get the real news all in one place in a shareable and readable format."" The source emphasized the site's function as a ""one-stop shop"" for pro-Trump narratives, promoting the platform as a means of enhancing transparency and advocating an ""America First"" agenda.White House Wire also aligns with Trump-era practices of limiting access for mainstream media outlets. During his administration, Trump frequently gave preferential treatment to right-leaning news organizations and excluded or diminished the role of legacy publishers. In one instance, the Associated Press reportedly faced penalties after refusing to adopt the term ""Gulf of America"" instead of the ""Gulf of Mexico.""Such incidents underscore the broader media strategy behind White House Wire: creating an ecosystem where only approved narratives are promoted, and dissenting viewpoints are systematically excluded. This mirrors prior efforts to reshape White House press briefings, inviting personalities from outlets like OANN and Breitbart while marginalizing more critical media voices.The launch of White House Wire has implications for political communication in the digital age. It illustrates the growing trend of political figures bypassing traditional media filters by creating their own channels. This trend, which gained momentum during Trump’s first term, reflects a broader transformation in how political leaders disseminate information, engage supporters, and manage narratives.White House Wire could also influence voter behavior, particularly among core supporters who prefer direct messaging over potentially critical interpretations. As the 2024 election cycle intensifies, platforms like White House Wire may play a significant role in framing debates, distributing campaign content, and rallying supporters through controlled messaging.",Former U.S. President Donald Trump has launched a new website called White House Wire (WH.gov/wire) The platform is designed to serve as a centralized bulletin board featuring pro-Trump news coverage.

Prosecutors detail disturbing methods of online network targeting vulnerable minors



Two men have been charged with leading an international online child exploitation ring reportedly linked to the extremist group 764 . According to prosecutors, one of the men was arrested in North Carolina, while the other was apprehended in Greece. Prosecutors state the ring exploited at least eight minors across multiple jurisdictions. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia announced charges against Leonidas Varagiannis , 21, known as “War,” and Prasan Nepal , 20, known as “Trippy.” As per the court documents shared by prosecutors, an FBI agent stated that Varagiannis, Nepal, and other members of the group targeted vulnerable individuals, including girls with mental health issues. The group is accused of grooming the girls, coercing them into sending intimate images, and forcing them to perform additional acts. Both Varagiannis and Nepal were arrested last month.The two men charged with leading an international child exploitation ring allegedly operated within ""764,"" a network that sexually extorts minors and celebrates violence, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.Court documents reveal that Varagiannis and Nepal allegedly recruited members based on the content they shared online and coordinated efforts to groom vulnerable girls, particularly those with mental health issues.Prosecutors claim the group first earned victims' trust to obtain private information and intimate images, then used these materials to coerce increasingly extreme and degrading content. The alleged coercion included forcing victims to carve group members' names into their bodies, harm themselves, abuse family members or pets, and attempt suicide.The group has been accused of compiling victims' images into ""Lorebooks,"" which were valued as ""currency"" within the network and stored in online vaults. Members allegedly agreed to preserve this material if others were arrested.Since 2021, at least ten people connected to 764 have been arrested for sexual extortion , possession of child sexual abuse material , or violent attacks.Nepal, who prosecutors say helped found 764 in 2020-2021, was arrested in North Carolina. Varagiannis, who allegedly joined in December 2023 and helped determine group membership, was apprehended in Greece. Both men face potential life sentences if convicted.","Leonidas Varagiannis, 21, and Prasan Nepal, 20, have been charged with leading an international child exploitation ring.

We are a uniquely American company and we care deeply about our impact on this country. That’s why we recently announced plans to spend five hundred billion dollars here over the next four years.

All told, we have more than nine thousand suppliers in the US across all fifty states.

We work with American companies to source everything from the components we used for Face ID to the glass used an iPhone. And we expect to source more than nineteen billion chips this year in America from companies across a dozen states. That includes tens of millions of advanced chips being made right now by TSMC in Arizona, where we are the first and largest customer.

I wanna take a moment to recognize President Trump’s focus on domestic semiconductor manufacturing, and we will continue to work with the administration as we invest in these areas.

Mark Zuckerberg's Education Ventures

The Primary School , a no-cost private institution in the Bay Area co-founded by Priscilla Chan , wife of Facebook parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , will reportedly cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students. First reported by Bloomberg, the impending closure was disclosed in a statement posted on the school's website recently. In a move aimed at preserving its legacy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the billionaire couple's philanthropic arm, has committed $50 million to invest in the communities the school serves -— specifically East Palo Alto, Belle Haven, and the East Bay region near San Francisco -- over the subsequent few years.""This was a very difficult decision, and we are committed to ensuring a thoughtful and supportive transition for students and families over the next year,"" the online statement conveyed. Carson Cook, a spokesperson for The Primary School, stated there would be no further comment beyond the official announcement.Pediatrician Priscilla Chan, 40, co-established The Primary School in 2016, implementing an ""integrated health and education model"" designed to support families and children from birth through high school, according to the organization's tax filings. The school's inaugural middle school cohort commenced in 2023.The most recent tax documentation indicates that over 95% of The Primary School's students in East Palo Alto identify as under-represented minorities. The filing also revealed the nonprofit held assets exceeding $30 million as of the end of June 2023.The Primary School is among several educational endeavors recently initiated by prominent billionaires. Elon Musk , Jeff Bezos, and Larry Ellison have all established schools in recent years. Musk's nonprofit, the Musk Foundation, has contributed $237 million to his technology-focused primary and secondary school in Austin, named Ad Astra, with future aspirations for a university. Ad Astra collaborates with the same entity that assisted Ellison in establishing his Hala Kahiki Montessori school in Lanai, Hawaii, an island largely owned by the Oracle co-founder. Amazon.com founder Bezos has created a network of Montessori-inspired preschools catering to children in underserved communities.The closure of The Primary School coincides with significant strategic shifts within Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms Inc. as the 40-year-old founder appears to be aligning his business interests more closely with the Trump administration. Recent appointments to Meta's board include longtime Trump allies Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, and Dina Powell McCormick, who served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser during his first term.Furthermore, Zuckerberg has appointed a Republican strategist as chief of global affairs, eliminated Meta’s US fact-checking program, rolled back the company’s hate-speech policies, and discontinued key diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at both Meta and CZI. This contrasts with The Primary School's documented commitment to diversity, which included conducting a diversity audit in June 2020 following the Black Lives Matter protests and forming a DEI task force in the fall of that year.","The Primary School will cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students.

The REAL ID Act was enacted by Congress in 2005 in response to security concerns following the September 11 attacks. It requires the establishment of minimum security standards for the issuance of state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards. Beginning May 7, 2025, US residents aged 18 and older will be required to present a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or state ID, or another acceptable form of identification, to board federally regulated domestic flights or gain access to certain federal facilities.Although originally set to take effect earlier, the enforcement deadline was postponed multiple times to allow states and residents more time to comply. As the deadline approaches, it is crucial to understand what REAL ID is, how to check if your ID is compliant, and how to apply for one, including eligibility for online application.Not all states allow REAL ID applications online. Many require an in-person visit for the initial issuance due to document verification requirements. However, some states permit online upgrades if:Check your state DMV or licensing agency website to confirm if online application or renewal is available.To apply for a REAL ID, you must provide original or certified copies of the following:Some states may have additional documentation requirements, so consult your local DMV for specifics.The REAL ID Act was a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, intended to enhance security by making it harder to forge state-issued identification.

If your card lacks this star, it is not compliant and will not be accepted for REAL ID purposes. However, Enhanced Driver’s Licenses (EDLs)—issued by a few states—are acceptable even without the star marking, as they comply with federal security requirements.Only five states currently issue EDLs:EDLs are REAL ID-compliant and also allow land and sea border crossings between the US and Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative.Yes. States continue to offer non-REAL ID-compliant cards, often labeled “Not for Federal Identification.” These can still be used for driving and other non-federal purposes but will not be accepted for air travel or entry into certain federal buildings after May 7, 2025.The final enforcement date is May 7, 2025. After this date, only REAL ID-compliant cards or approved alternatives will be accepted for TSA screening and federal facility access.

Implications for global research

Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law, which restricts the sharing of “important data” with overseas partners without approval. The suspension impacts joint research in fields like health and environmental studies , raising questions about the future of international scientific cooperation .Implemented in 2021, China’s Data Security Law broadly defines “important data” as information that could threaten national or economic interests or affect the rights of individuals or organisations. European agencies, including the German Research Foundation , Swedish Research Council, and Swiss National Science Foundation, have expressed concerns over the law’s vague provisions, which make it difficult to assess compliance and avoid legal liabilities.The law requires security clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China to export data classified as “important,” effectively making cross-border data sharing extremely challenging. This has led to the suspension of new co-funded projects with China’s National Natural Science Foundation.The halt in collaborations could delay progress in critical areas like pandemic response and air quality studies, where data sharing is essential. Experts warn that the restrictions may hinder the ability to address global health challenges effectively.Jan Palmowski, Secretary-General of the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities, emphasised the need for responsible and safe data sharing to tackle future pandemics and other health crises.","Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law.

Israel protest: How Trump administration’s demand for Instagram account access of students may have ‘forced’ prosecutors to quit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/israel-protest-how-trump-administrations-demand-for-instagram-account-access-of-students-may-have-forced-prosecutors-to-quit/articleshow/120830498.cms,"Representative Image

Why DOJ member Emily Bove wants access to Instagram accounts of student activists



US President Donald Trump appointed Emily Bove, his former criminal defence attorney, to a top position at the Department of Justice (DOJ), following his victory. At her new position, Bove is reportedly pushing for an “aggressive” criminal investigation into Columbia University student activists , sparking significant conflict and a mass exodus of civil rights prosecutors. A recent report claims that Bove, who is now an associate deputy attorney general serving under Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche (another Trump criminal defence attorney), has allegedly advocated for accessing student activists' Instagram accounts and obtaining search warrants as part of a purported criminal inquiry into demonstrations against Israel's war in Gaza. However, this pursuit has reportedly been opposed by federal prosecutors and a judge.According to a report by The New York Times, prosecutors in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division feared that the investigation was a pretext designed to facilitate a potential Trump administration deportation campaign targeting campus dissent and consequently refused to compile a list of activist group members for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The report indicates these concerns contributed to the departure of these civil rights prosecutors.Federal prosecutor Bove—known for representing former President Trump in several high-profile cases—pushed for a search warrant to seize Instagram posts by Columbia University’s Apartheid Divest group, alleging they constituted a “threat.”A magistrate judge rejected the request for lack of probable cause and First Amendment concerns; after a second rejection and the threat of unsealing court discussions, Bove pressed for yet another appeal. She also reportedly instructed FBI agents to conduct a show-of-force presence on campus, prompting internal civil-rights objections.This effort comes amid a broader crackdown on Palestinian activism at US universities, which was triggered by protests over Gaza. It's backed by Trump’s executive orders targeting “terrorist” sympathisers and threatening visa revocations.Critics argue the administration is conflating legitimate protest with antisemitism, leading to arrests of international students and widespread visa cancellations under Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Civil-rights groups are now litigating these deportation cases, even as previously detained activist Mohsen Mahdawi was released earlier this month.","US President Donald Trump appointed Emily Bove, his former criminal defence attorney, to a top position at the Department of Justice.

Microsoft replaces ‘Trump-friendly’ lawyers to fight company’s ‘biggest gaming’ deal case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-replaces-trump-friendly-lawyers-to-fight-companys-biggest-gaming-deal-case/articleshow/120830292.cms,"Representative Image

What are the concerns of the law firms opposing the Trump administration



Microsoft has replaced Simpson Thacher & Bartlett with Jenner & Block in its Delaware Court of Chancery lawsuit concerning the 2023 Activision Blizzard acquisition, according to a report. The change was reportedly filed in April when Simpson Thacher attorneys withdrew and Jenner partners took over to represent the tech giant. This essentially means that Microsoft is moving from a legal team that prioritised avoiding conflict with the government to one that is willing to challenge the government in court.Large corporations like Microsoft routinely engage multiple law firms, shifting work based on factors such as fees, expertise, and conflicts. While Microsoft declined to explain this particular switch, it suggests that even law firms willing to challenge the Trump administration can retain major clients, the New York Times reported.Last month, Simpson Thacher agreed to provide $125 million in pro bono legal services for causes approved by the Trump administration, the NYT report claims. In a joint statement with other firms, it stated that the work would benefit “a wide range of underserved populations.” On the same day Simpson Thacher exited, at least three Jenner & Block partners informed the court of their new role, the report adds. Jenner is currently opposing a Trump administration executive order that targets its business interests.A lawsuit by an institutional Activision shareholder, which is unrelated to any federal governmental action, initiated this Microsoft case. The plaintiff claimed that Activision’s board violated legal requirements when approving the merger, and last year, a Delaware court largely rejected the company’s bid to have the suit dismissed.Since the Trump administration began scrutinising major law firms with executive orders and investigations into their hiring and diversity practices, firm leaders have cited the prospect of losing clients as a key reason to negotiate agreements rather than fight. They feared that even a successful legal challenge against the White House could drive clients away.Many attorneys argue that these executive orders, which limit these firms’ interactions with federal agencies and officials, are unconstitutional, and thus far, the courts have appeared sympathetic. The recent Microsoft switch in Delaware suggests there may also be drawbacks to settling.Some clients worry that a firm aligned with the White House could face a conflict of interest and hesitate to advocate vigorously on their behalf, particularly if they’re defending against a government lawsuit.Others expressed broader concerns, including a senior partner at a firm without a White House deal who reported attracting former clients of settling firms, stating they had lost confidence in firms that didn’t challenge what they perceived as an assault on the rule of law.For instance, on the website promoting its fight against Trump’s executive order, Jenner & Block contended that making a deal “would mean compromising our ability to zealously advocate for all of our clients.” Similarly, WilmerHale and Susman Godfrey have created web pages to emphasise their commitment to pushing back on those orders, the report adds.",Microsoft has replaced Simpson Thacher & Bartlett with Jenner & Block in its Delaware Court of Chancery lawsuit concerning the 2023 Activision Blizzard acquisition.

What US court has ordered Apple



Spotify has confirmed that Apple has approved its latest app update in the US. This change will allow iPhone users in the country to access pricing information and external payment links on the music streaming platform. The approval comes after a US judge ordered the Cupertino-based tech giant to stop charging commissions on in-app purchases through iPhone apps. The updated app, version 9.0.40, started rolling out on the App Store in the US, a day after Spotify submitted the same to Apple. The update allows Spotify to inform customers about different subscription options and their costs within the iPhone app.Users can also link out to purchase or change their Spotify subscription plan on Spotify's website.Moreover, purchases on Spotify's website will not be subject to Apple’s 30% service charge on in-app payments. Spotify will now be able to inform US customers about promotional offers within the app. This comes after Apple said that it will comply with the court’s order; however, the iPhone maker noted that it strongly disagrees with the decision and will appeal.In a statement to TechCrunch, Spotify spokesperson Jeanna Moran said:In a recent ruling, US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple breached an order to modify its App Store.

Over 50% iPhones Americans bought in first three months of 2025 were made in India

Apple CEO Tim Cook has revealed that the company expects tariffs to increase its costs by approximately $900 million in the third quarter. Cook made this announcement at Apple’ earnings call. Along with this, he also discussed the financial impact of the current trade policies on the company. Cook also mentioned that Apple experienced limited impact from the recently imposed US tariffs in the March quarter. However, the Q3 estimate is based on the present global tariff rates. He cautioned investors against using this estimate to predict future quarters, citing “unique factors” that benefit the June quarter.Cook emphasised that this $900 million figure is based on current global tariff rates and policies remaining unchanged throughout the quarter. He also cautioned that the actual impact could vary if tariff policies are adjusted.""Assuming the current global tariff rates, policies and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs,"" Cook said.The announcement comes as Apple seeks to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs from the Trump administration. While electronic products including smartphones recently received a temporary exemption from the 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, Cook warned that future duties could significantly impact costs.To mitigate tariff-related costs, Apple has been diversifying its supply chain, sourcing half of its iPhones for the U.S. from India and most other products from Vietnam. Cook reassured investors that Apple is actively managing risks associated with global trade shifts.“For our part, we will manage the company the way we always have, with thoughtful and deliberate decisions, with a focus on investing for the long term, and with dedication to innovation and the possibilities it creates,” Cook said.During the earnings call, Cook also announced that India will become the primary manufacturing hub for iPhones sold in the United States, marking a significant shift in the tech giant's production strategy amid escalating trade tensions.""For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin,"" Cook said during Apple's quarterly earnings call, where the company reported a 5.1% revenue increase to $95.36 billion.",Apple CEO Tim Cook has revealed that the company expects tariffs to increase its costs by approximately $900 million in the third quarter.

What makes Palantir Technologies the ideal choice for the system

Peter Thiel is close buddy of Vice President JD Vance and Tesla CEO Elon Musk

Privacy experts fear that the System could also be used to track Americans

Federal authorities are in the process of developing a comprehensive new database system, dubbed "" ImmigrationOS ,"" designed to track and target millions of individuals residing in the United States without legal status. Media reports indicate that Palantir Technologies has secured a $30 million contract to build this Immigration Lifecycle Operating System (ImmigrationOS). The agreement with the Denver-based company stipulates the rollout of a prototype by this fall. A recent report by 404 Media also highlighted Palantir's increasing involvement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ), including its role in pinpointing the physical locations of individuals slated for deportation.Palantir already manages the ICE system utilized for Homeland Security investigations. The new ImmigrationOS will consolidate data from numerous databases originating from both government and private sector sources. Palantir has maintained its status as an ICE contractor for over a decade, spanning both the Obama and Biden administrations.What is the scope of ImmigrationOSThe reported $30 million no-bid contract will see Peter Thiel 's Palantir Technologies assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in constructing a sophisticated system aimed at prioritizing individuals for deportation. This prioritization will reportedly include those accused of gang membership and individuals who have overstayed their tourist visas. The system may also monitor individuals who ""self-deport"" or voluntarily leave the United States, ostensibly to aid ICE in focusing enforcement efforts on those who remain.""These transnational organizations' ongoing campaigns of violence and terror in the United States and internationally are extraordinarily violent, vicious, and similarly threaten the American people,"" ICE officials stated in their justification for the no-bid contract with Palantir. ""They present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States."" The document further notes that ""Palantir has deep institutional knowledge of ICE operations."" The company is ""already ingesting and processing data"" from multiple federal agencies, positioning it uniquely to develop the prototype ""in less than six months.""Peter Thiel, the founder and chairman of Palantir, maintains close relationships with Vice President JD Vance and Tesla CEO Elon Musk , with whom he co-founded PayPal.Civil liberties groups are raising concerns that systems like ImmigrationOS pose significant risks to the broader public, partly due to the lack of clarity on how the system's use will be strictly limited to individuals living in the United States without legal status. These groups warn that such a system could be readily expanded to target any American citizen.","Federal authorities are in the process of developing a comprehensive new database system, dubbed "" ImmigrationOS"" Palantir Technologies has secured a $30 million contract to build this Immigration Lifecycle Operating System (ImmigrationOS) The agreement with the Denver-based company stipulates the rollout of a prototype by this fall.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120823829,imgsize-596994,width-400,resizemode-4/Palantir-has-courted-numerous-controversies-over-the-years-.jpg"
"EU hits TikTok with $600 million fine over data transfers to China, company replies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/eu-hits-tiktok-with-600-million-fine-over-data-transfers-to-china-company-replies/articleshow/120823839.cms,"What EU regulators have to say on fining TikTok



TikTok says it will appeal the decision



TikTok has been fined 530 million euros (approx $600 million) by the European Union (EU), regulators have announced. The company, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, has been found illegally sending the personal data of European users to China and failing to adequately ensure that this data was protected from potential access by Chinese authorities.According to a report by news agency AFP, the penalty – one of the largest ever issued by the European bloc's data protection authorities – follows a thorough investigation into the legality of TikTok's data transfer practices.Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), which serves as the lead regulator for TikTok in Europe due to the company's European headquarters being located there, revealed that TikTok acknowledged during the probe that it had, in fact, hosted European user data in China.“TikTok failed to verify, guarantee and demonstrate that the personal data of (European) users, remotely accessed by staff in China, was afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU,” said Graham Doyle, the DPC's deputy commissioner.Furthermore, Doyle emphasised TikTok's failure to address the risk of potential access to Europeans' personal data by Chinese authorities under China's anti-terrorism, counter-espionage, and other laws, which TikTok itself identified as significantly different from EU data protection standards.Despite the findings, TikTok has announced its intention to appeal the substantial EU fine. Christine Grahn of TikTok Europe insisted that the company has “never received a request” from Chinese authorities for European users' data and that “(TikTok) has never provided European user data to them.”“We disagree with this decision and intend to appeal it in full,” she stated.The social media platform, which has 1.5 billion users globally, has been under intense scrutiny from Western governments for several years due to concerns that user data could be exploited by China for espionage or propaganda purposes.In 2023, the Irish DPC had already fined TikTok 345 million euros for violations of European rules concerning the processing of children's data.The DPC's latest decision also found that TikTok breached requirements within the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by transferring user data to China. The ruling includes the 530 million euro administrative fine and mandates that TikTok bring its data processing practices into compliance with EU regulations within six months.A significant portion of the fine, 45 million euros, was specifically imposed due to a lack of transparency between 2020 and 2022. During this period, TikTok allegedly failed to clearly inform users about the countries to which their data was being transferred or that it could be accessed from China.","TikTok has been fined 530 million euros (approx $600 million) by the European Union (EU) The company, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, has been found illegally sending the personal data of European users to China.

"MetaAI is filled with lies, says Conservative activist Robby Starbuck; takes WhatsApp AI chatbot to court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/metaai-is-filled-with-lies-says-conservative-activist-robby-starbuck-takes-whatsapp-ai-chatbot-to-court/articleshow/120822472.cms,"Conservative activist Robby Starbuck has reportedly filed a defamation lawsuit against tech giant Meta, alleging that its artificial intelligence chatbot disseminated false and damaging statements about him. According to a report in ABCNews, the lawsuit, filed in Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday, claims that Meta's AI falsely asserted Starbuck participated in the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, among other untrue allegations. Starbuck is seeking over $5 million in damages.Starbuck, said to be known for his campaigns against corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, stated he discovered the AI's false claims in August 2024 while challenging ""woke DEI"" policies at motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson.""One dealership was unhappy with me and they posted a screenshot from Meta’s AI in an effort to attack me,"" Starbuck explained in a post on X. ""This screenshot was filled with lies. I couldn’t believe it was real so I checked myself. It was even worse when I checked.""He further added that since this discovery, he has ""faced a steady stream of false accusations that are deeply damaging to my character and the safety of my family."" Starbuck maintains he was in Tennessee during the January 6th Capitol riot.What Robby Starbuck says in his lawsuitStarbuck's legal action joins a growing number of similar cases where individuals are suing AI platforms over inaccurate information generated by chatbots. Notably, in 2023, a conservative radio host in Georgia sued OpenAI, alleging that ChatGPT falsely claimed he had defrauded a gun-rights organization.According to the complaint, after discovering the false information, Starbuck attempted to notify Meta and seek their assistance in rectifying the errors. The lawsuit claims he contacted Meta's managing executives and legal counsel and even inquired with the AI itself about how to address the false outputs.The lawsuit alleges that Starbuck requested Meta to ""retract the false information, investigate the cause of the error, implement safeguards and quality control processes to prevent similar harm in the future, and communicate transparently with all Meta AI users about what would be done.” However, the filing contends that Meta was unwilling to make these changes or ""take meaningful responsibility for its conduct.""""Instead, it allowed its AI to spread false information about Mr. Starbuck for months after being put on notice of the falsity, at which time it ‘fixed’ the problem by wiping Mr. Starbuck’s name from its written responses altogether,"" the lawsuit states.What Facebook said on Robby Starbuck's lawsuitIn response to the lawsuit, a Meta spokesperson issued an emailed statement saying, ""As part of our continuous effort to improve our models, we have already released updates and will continue to do so.""Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, responded to Starbuck's video outlining the lawsuit on X, calling the situation ""unacceptable.""""This is clearly not how our AI should operate,"" Kaplan wrote. ""We’re sorry for the results it shared about you and that the fix we put in place didn’t address the underlying problem."" Kaplan added that he is collaborating with Meta's product team to ""understand how this happened and explore potential solutions.""","Conservative activist Robby Starbuck has reportedly filed a defamation lawsuit against tech giant Meta.

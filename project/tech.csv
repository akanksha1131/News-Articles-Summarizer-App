Elon Musk said he lived in factory floor for three full years

Elon Musk said his DOGE team works 120 hours a week

Tesla and SpaceX CEO has reiterated that he will go back to his habit of working seven days a week and sleeping in office. Just that this time he has set a condition to this. The condition is his little kids going away somewhere. In a post on Twitter, Musk wrote: 'Back to working 7 days a week and sleeping in the office if my little kids are away'. Elon Musk wrote the post while sharing an old video of his where he can be seen saying: ""7 days a week sleeping in the factory, No one should put these many hours into work, this is not good, this is very painful, it hurts my brain and my heart.""Elon Musk spoke about working 120 hours in a week in an interview with Leslie Stahl on Sunday’s “60 Minutes” on CBS. In the interview that went live in December 2018, Musk said that he worked on the floor fixing problems and slowdowns in the assembly line as Tesla struggled to ramp up production of Model 3 car. According to Musk, the delays in production pushed the Tesla to the brink. “It was life or death. We were losing $50 [million], sometimes $100 million a week. Running out of money.""In April of the same year, Musk told “CBS This Morning” host Gayle King hat he sometimes sleeps at the Tesla factory to show his team that he doesn’t ask them to do anything he won’t do himself. “Yeah, I’m sleeping on the factory floor, not because I think that’s a fun place to sleep. You know. Terrible,” Musk told King. “I don’t believe like people should be experiencing hardship while the CEO is, like, off on vacation.”In a November 2022 interview with Baron Capital CEO Ron Baron, Elon Musk said he was “living in the factory in Fremont, and the one in Nevada, for three years straight. That was my primary residence. “I slept on the couch at one point, in a tent on the roof, and for a while there, I was just sleeping under my desk, which is out in the open in the factory,” he said. “It was damn uncomfortable sleeping on that floor and always, when I woke up, I’d smell like metal dust.”In February this year, Elon Musk said he and his team at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are working 120 hours a week. “Our bureaucratic opponents optimistically work 40 hours a week,” he added. “That is why they are losing so fast.”",Elon Musk said he will go back to his habit of working seven days a week and sleeping in office.

US Green Card delay: CEO of one of America's largest public transit authority resigns as work permit expires,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-green-card-delay-ceo-of-one-of-americas-largest-public-transit-authority-resigns-as-work-permit-expires/articleshow/122800380.cms,"Immigration timelines 'hurting' corporate America

What MARTA said on CEO's resignation

The long waiting for American Green Card has started hurting US corporate world. Delays in the U.S. Green Card process are impacting leadership across various sectors. In some cases, it is forcing highly experienced executives to step down as their work permits expire. The growing backlog for permanent residency is now affecting even senior professionals who have legally resided and worked in the country for years, leaving them unable to continue in their critical roles without proper documentation.In a high-profile case highlighting this issue, Collie Greenwood, CEO of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), stepped down on July 17. His departure came after his U.S. work permit expired, and ongoing delays in receiving his green card made it impossible for him to continue in his position. Greenwood, a Canadian national, opted for early retirement, despite MARTA confirming on Thursday that the delivery of his green card remains ""imminent.""Greenwood, who assumed the role of MARTA's CEO in January 2022, is widely credited with stabilizing the transit agency's finances. However, in recent months, MARTA has faced hurdles in executing key expansion and improvement projects. His unexpected departure adds to a series of high-profile resignations within the U.S. transit sector recently, many of which have been linked to operational challenges and increasingly stringent immigration timelines.Greenwood's Employment Authorization Document (EAD) expired on June 18, 2025, prompting his decision to take early retirement. MARTA confirmed that he remains legally in the U.S. on a valid Canadian visa while awaiting the ""imminent"" arrival of his Green Card.Following the expiration of his permit, Greenwood immediately ceased working. He personally informed all MARTA board members and executive leaders of his situation and formally delegated authority to Rhonda Allen, MARTA’s Chief Customer Experience Officer.In a statement, MARTA acknowledged the challenging circumstances, saying, “The immigration process is extensive and has had an impact on Mr. Greenwood’s personal and professional progress. These challenges have been resolved with Mr. Greenwood’s decision, and the MARTA family supports him.”","Collie Greenwood, CEO of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), stepped down on July 17.

What Apple is seeking



Apple has filed a federal lawsuit against popular YouTuber Jon Prosser and Michael Ramacciotti. In the lawsuit, the tech giant has accused them of orchestrating a scheme to steal iOS 26 trade secrets from a development iPhone. The company has accused Prosser of leaking confidential details about its upcoming iOS 26 software. Along with this, the video editor Michael Ramacciotti who is the accomplice of Prosser has reportedly accessed a development iPhone belonging to an Apple employee. The lawsuit claims Ramacciotti broke into his friend Ethan Lipnik's Apple-issued development phone while staying at his home, then showed the unreleased software to Prosser via FaceTime. Prosser allegedly recorded the call and used the footage to create ""reconstructed"" renderings for his YouTube channel.For those unaware, Jon Prosser is the creator of popular YouTube channel called Front Page Tech. He is known for leaking details about Apple products which are not yet released by the company. The lawsuit filed by Apple claims that in January 2025 Prosser gained access to early visuals of iOS 26’s new Liquid Glass design, which resembles a lot to the final version showcased by Apple at WWDC 2025.The Cupertino- based tech giant alleges that Ramacotti, a friend of Apple employee Ethan Lipnik, allegedly used Lipnik’s passcode and then tracked his location to access a development iPhone while staying at his home. During that time Ramacotti made a FaceTime call to Prosser and showed him the unreleased iOS 26 features.Prosser then reportedly recorded that call and later used that to create monetised YouTube content. Apple also claims that Prosser promised payment or future job opportunities to Ramacotti for the leaked information.The YouTuber leaked the details about the redesigned camera app with simplified controls. He also showcased the Liquid Glass design which featured pill-shaped tabs and rounded visuals. Along with this, he also talked about the early previews of the Messages app and other UI elevates which later appeared in iOS 26.Apple is requesting a jury trial and seeking multiple forms of relief:* Injunctive relief to prevent further disclosure of confidential information* Punitive and compensatory damages for trade secret misappropriation* An order requiring defendants to return or destroy any confidential Apple information* Recovery of legal fees and costs* Pre- and post-judgment interestThe lawsuit includes claims under the Defend Trade Secrets Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act .",Apple has filed a federal lawsuit against popular YouTuber Jon Prosser and Michael Ramacciotti.

How and why SpaceX is the reason Donald Trump administration cannot breakup with Elon Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-and-why-spacex-is-the-reason-donald-trump-administration-cannot-breakup-with-elon-musk/articleshow/122796554.cms,"How Trump-Musk ‘public spat’ triggered review of SpaceX’s government contracts



What Trump Administration officials concluded



Boat Smart Ring Active Plus: DON'T BUY A SMARTWATCH

Soon after a public spat between Elon Musk and Donald Trump, the Trump administration initiated a review of SpaceX 's contracts with the federal government in early June, a report has said, adding that the evaluation aimed to identify potential waste within the company's multibillion-dollar agreements.Citing sources familiar with the matter, a report by The Wall Street Journal says that after the review, the administration officials determined that most of these contracts could not be eliminated due to their critical importance to the Defense Department and NASA.A White House official confirmed to the publication that the review focused not just on SpaceX but on a range of companies with ‘lucrative’ government contracts .Musk, once a close advisor to Trump, overseeing the ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (DOGE) cost-cutting effort, saw his relationship with the US President fracture after publicly criticising Trump's tax-and-spending bill. On June 5, Trump posted on Truth Social suggesting to “terminate” government contracts with Musk's companies to save federal funds.On June 9, Josh Gruenbaum, Commissioner for the Federal Acquisition Service at the General Services Administration (GSA), reportedly sent an email to the Defense Department requesting data detailing all current SpaceX contracts and other transaction agreements.Despite the initial intent to cut ties, White House and agency officials, including those at the Pentagon, concluded after reviewing the data that the majority of SpaceX's deals were vital to the core missions of the Defense Department and NASA.The report noted that some contracts may still face ongoing scrutiny, and that SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell met with White House officials during the review period.The report suggests that the Trump administration is highly dependent on SpaceX as the government has limited alternatives for many critical rocket launches and low-Earth-orbit satellite services, making Musk and his company an asset in space operations.Government agencies have expanded their work with SpaceX due to the company's technological capabilities and competitive pricing. While efforts have been made to foster competition through contract design and by encouraging other space companies to develop competing solutions, the report noted.","Trump administration initiated a review of SpaceX's contracts with the federal government in early June.

Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for 'offensive' political slurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/poland-flags-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-to-the-eu-for-offensive-political-slurs/articleshow/122348777.cms,"Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for “offensive” political slurs

Why Poland says Elon Musk's Grok chatbot crossed a red line



Offensive answers: From antisemitic tropes to political insults



European digital rules put xAI under the spotlight



Previous incidents: Turkey, hate speech, and Grok’s growing rap sheet



xAI and Musk offer silence, at least for now



Poland just pulled the alarm on Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk ’s xAI. Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates. Poland’s complaint tees up an early test of those combined powers.Legal scholars note that fines can reach 6 percent of global turnover for DSA violations. For Musk’s empire, that runs into billions.Poland is not alone. A Turkish court ordered X to block Grok content that mocked President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Islamic beliefs.In June, users spotted the bot rambling about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. xAI blamed an “unauthorised change” to its response code.Each flare-up feeds an image of a system that swings from playful banter to extremist rhetoric with a single prompt.As of Wednesday afternoon, xAI had not replied to Reuters’ emailed questions, and Musk’s normally hyperactive X feed stayed quiet on the topic.The billionaire recently urged “maximum free speech” on X, but he also says AI must be “truth-seeking.” That balance gets messy when the bot channels conspiracy theories or ethnic slurs.","Poland says the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

YouTube monetisation policy update 2025 FAQs



1. When do the new rules start?

2. What exactly counts as “mass-produced” or “repetitious” content?

3. Are AI-generated videos banned from monetisation?

4. Do the subscriber and watch-time thresholds change?

5. What happens if my channel is flagged for inauthentic uploads?

6. Are reaction videos or clip compilations automatically disqualified?

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

Boat Smart Ring Active Plus: DON'T BUY A SMARTWATCH

Nvidia may have been hit with a ‘new’ problem with resuming export of its AI chips to China. The US-based company, which was recently given a go-ahead to restart the sales of H20 AI chips to the region, has reportedly informed its Chinese customers of limited supplies for the chips. H20 is the most powerful AI processor the semiconductor company has been permitted to sell to the country under US export restrictions.According to a report by The Information, the supply constraints stem from an April US government ban on H20 chip sales. Citing two sources, the report claims that this ban compelled Nvidia to void existing customer orders and cancel manufacturing capacity previously booked with chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC).Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated at a Beijing media event last week that TSMC had subsequently reallocated its H20 production lines to produce other chips for different clients.The report said that manufacturing new H20 chips from scratch could now take up to nine months. Moreover, Nvidia reportedly does not plan to restart H20 production, though the report did not cite specific sources for this detail.Despite these reported supply issues, Huang recently commented that Nvidia would ramp up H20 chip supply and that licenses for Chinese orders would be swiftly approved.This comes just days after Nvidia announced its intent to resume H20 sales to the region, pending US government export license approvals. Huang also met with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office last week to advocate for restarting sales of his company's specialised AI chips to China.Citing two individuals familiar with the meeting, The New York Times reported that Huang argued that American-made chips should remain the global standard. He is also said to have contended that the US would be making an error by ceding the massive Chinese market to homegrown competitors.",US-based company was recently given a go-ahead to restart sales of H20 AI chips to the region.

Elon Musk’s role in Dogecoin’s popularity



Can Dogecoin really hit $0.42

Free phone or empty Bank Account: New scam alert

Dogecoin, the meme coin often adored by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, has surged more than 10% in the past week. As of Friday, July 18, the token coin traded at around $0.234, nearly 70% below its all-time high of $0.7376 set in May 2021. The rally comes as Bitcoin hit a new record of $123,091.61 this week, boosting sentiment across cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez who goes by @ali_charts on X (formerly Twitter), the Dogecoin seems to form a ""double bottom"" pattern soon. “If the pattern plays out, Dogecoin could rise to $0.42 by September,” Martinez wrote.In technical terms, a double bottom occurs when an asset hits a low point twice with a small rally in between. If the price breaks above the middle high — known as the neckline — it often indicates the start of an upward trend.Martinez also pointed out an increase in large transactions. He said that more than 1 billion Dogecoin tokens have been purchased by crypto “whales” within just 48 hours.In general, whale activity often comes before major price moves in the crypto market, and Dogecoin’s sudden surge in volume has caught the attention of traders and analysts alike.While Elon Musk has not publicly commented on Dogecoin, his support for the meme coin in the past can be termed ‘influential’. The tech billionaire has called it the ‘people’s crypto’ and even hinted at using it in products and services at his companies – Tesla and X.Even without a direct mention, the market still watches Musk’s movements closely, as his tweets have repeatedly influenced Dogecoin’s price in the past.At its current price of $0.234, Dogecoin would need to rise about 80% to reach Martinez’s target of $0.42 by September. While that may seem ambitious, the crypto market is known for sharp moves driven by technical signals, whale action, and online buzz.","Dogecoin, the meme coin often adored by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, has surged more than 10% in the past week.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates once said that Elon is “super mean” and that he can not be taken ‘too personally’. The remark was made by Gates in Walter Isaacson’s 2023 biography of the Tesla CEO, highlighting what can be considered as one of the most high-profile billionaire feuds in recent memory. Fallout between Bill Gates and Elon Musk started when the former held a short position against Tesla. It has since turned into a public clash over climate, philanthropy, and global aid.Bill Gates told Isaacson that he had shorted Tesla stock, a move that angered Elon Musk. In private text messages later made public, Musk asked Gates if he still held a ""$500 million short position against Tesla."" To this Gates replied, ""Sorry to say I haven't closed it yet. I would like to discuss philanthropy possibilities.""In a straight reply, Musk rejected the outreach. ""Sorry, I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla, the company doing the most to solve climate change,"" he reportedly responded.Soon after, Elon Musk posted a meme mocking Gates’ appearance. That post marked a turning point, as the disagreement moved from finance to something more personal — and public.In a post last year, Musk warned that Bill Gates might go bankrupt if Tesla becomes “the world’s most valuable company by far,” reigniting the feud over Gates’ short position against the electric vehicle giant.For those unaware, Short position refers to a stock market strategy where an investor borrows shares of a stock they do not own, sells them on the open market, and aims to buy them back later at a lower price. The goal is to profit from a decline in the stock's price.","Bill Gates told Walter Isaacson that he had shorted Tesla stock, a move that angered Elon Musk.

Meta rejects AI code, says ‘won’t be signing it’

Microsoft is leaning towards signing the European Union’s AI code of practice even as Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta has rejected the guidelines, citing significant ""legal uncertainties."" According to a report, the Windows maker appears to sign the European Union's voluntary code of practice designed to help companies comply with the bloc's landmark Artificial Intelligence Act.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Microsoft President Brad Smith said on Friday (July 18) that the company will have to read the documents.“I think it's likely we will sign. We need to read the documents,” Smith said.“Our goal is to find a way to be supportive and at the same time one of the things we really welcome is the direct engagement by the AI Office with industry,” he added, referring to the EU's primary AI regulatory body.The code of practice, developed by 13 independent experts, aims to offer legal clarity to its signatories. Companies that sign on will be required to publish summaries of the data used to train their general-purpose AI models and implement policies adhering to EU copyright law.This code forms a component of the AI Act, which officially came into force in June 2024 and will apply to a vast array of tech companies, including Google's parent company Alphabet, Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic and Mistral.Meta, however, has reiterated its strong criticism of the code with Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, stating in a LinkedIn blog post that the social media giant won’t sign it.“Meta won't be signing it. This code introduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act,” he said.Kaplan indicated that the US social media giant shares concerns previously raised by a group of 45 European companies. He warned that this perceived “over-reach will throttle the development and deployment of frontier AI models in Europe, and stunt European companies looking to build businesses on top of them.”Notably, other prominent AI developers, OpenAI and Mistral, have already signed the code of practice.","Microsoft appears to be leaning towards signing the European Union's AI code of practice.

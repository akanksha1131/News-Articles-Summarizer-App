Generate Your Image: Submit your prompt, and ChatGPT will process it to create the Ghibli-style artwork. If you’re using the free version, keep in mind there’s a limit of three image generations per day.

Elon Musk gives $1 million checks

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is well aware that his fashion choices draw attention, and he never misses a chance to make a statement whenever he takes the stage. In a latest, the tech billionaire wore a cheesehead hat while speaking to a crowd in Wisconsin. Musk handed out $1 million checks to two Wisconsin voters on Sunday (March 30), naming them spokespersons for his political group. A video from the event is doing rounds on the internet where Musk can be seen waving to the crowd. “Thanks for coming,” says Musk. He goes on to ask “What do you think of my hat” before signing it and tossing the hat into the crowd. “I am gonna sign the hat, I am gonna throw it out,"" he said.X user Dogedesigner originally shared the video which Elon Musk reposted on his timelines.Musk, previously made headlines for his Make America Great Again (MAGA) hat/cap. Recently, he wore a red baseball cap that read “Trump was right about everything”.The Cheesehead hat is a distinctive, wedge-shaped, foam hat resembling a slice of cheese, often worn by fans of Wisconsin sports teams, particularly the Green Bay Packers. Its origin dates back to 1987 when Ralph Bruno created the first foam Cheesehead hat by cutting up his mother's couch.The hats are typically orange with holes, mimicking the appearance of Swiss cheese—a nod to one of Wisconsin's first specialty cheeses.By donning this iconic hat, Musk aimed to connect with the local community and demonstrate solidarity with Wisconsin residents during this politically significant event.Musk handed out $1 million checks to two Wisconsin voters on Sunday, naming them spokespeople for his political organization ahead of a pivotal Wisconsin Supreme Court election . The tech billionaire framed the race as crucial to former President Donald Trump’s agenda and ""the future of civilization.""“This is a super big deal,” Musk told a crowd of about 2,000 in Green Bay, stepping onto the stage wearing a yellow Cheesehead hat. “I’m not phoning it in. I’m here in person.”Musk and affiliated groups have poured over $20 million into backing conservative candidate Brad Schimel in Tuesday’s election, which will determine the ideological balance of a court expected to rule on key issues in the swing state. His involvement has become a central focus of the race, with liberal candidate Susan Crawford and her supporters criticizing Musk’s influence and the role he seeks to play in the court’s future.“I think this is critical for the future of civilization,” Musk said. “It’s that significant.”","Elon Musk handed out $1 million checks to two Wisconsin voters on Sunday (March 30) The tech billionaire framed the race as crucial to former President Donald Trump’s agenda and ""the future of civilization"" The Cheesehead hat is a distinctive, wedge-shaped, foam hat resembling a slice of cheese.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119814754,imgsize-30348,width-400,resizemode-4/119814754.jpg"
Chinese-government owned company may end US supremacy in brain chip implants by beating Elon Musk's Neuralink and Jeff Bezos funded Synchron,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinese-government-owned-company-may-end-us-supremacy-in-brain-chip-implants-by-beating-elon-musks-neuralink-and-jeff-bezos-funded-synchron/articleshow/119813532.cms,"Beinao may become the No.1 most-tested brain chip globally

A Chinese research institute and technology company has announced plans to implant brain chips in 13 people by year’s end, positioning them to potentially outpace Elon Musk ’s Neuralink in patient data collection. According to a report in Reuters, Chinese Institute for Brain Research (CIBR) and NeuCyber NeuroTech have already equipped three patients with their Beinao No.1 chip over the past month, with 10 more procedures scheduled for 2025. The report quotes Luo Minmin, CIBR director and NeuCyber’s chief scientist. This means that America's supremacy in human brain chip implants may also end.As the year 2026 may reportedly see an even bigger leap for Chinese company. “Once we get regulatory approval, we’re aiming for clinical trials with about 50 patients,” Luo revealed during a press chat at the Zhongguancun Forum, a major tech event in Beijing, as per the Reuters report. He kept mum on funding details and trial timelines but hinted at ambitious goals for the state-backed NeuCyber.This rapid push could crown Beinao No.1 as the most-tested brain chip globally, spotlighting China’s drive to rival top brain-computer interface (BCI) developers. Right now, the US-based Synchron --backed by heavyweights like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates -- leads with 10 patients across the US and Australia. Neuralink trails with three.The Beinao No.1, a semi-invasive chip placed on the brain’s surface, differs from Neuralink’s fully invasive approach, which dives deeper for better signals but ups the risk of complications. China’s method trades some signal strength for safety -- a choice showcased in recent state media videos. There, paralyzed patients used Beinao No.1 to steer robotic arms, pour water, and even project thoughts onto screens.“Since word got out about these trials, we’ve been flooded with people begging for help,” Luo told Reuters, underscoring the demand. Just last year, CIBR and NeuCyber were still in the lab, testing an invasive Beinao No.2 chip on a monkey that successfully controlled a robotic arm. Now, they’re cooking up a wireless version akin to Neuralink’s, with human tests eyed in 12 to 18 months.Synchron, meanwhile, just teamed up with Nvidia to weave AI into its BCI tech. Luo admitted NeuCyber’s on the hunt for cash and partners too, but warned that anyone jumping in needs patience. NeuCyber, owned by Zhongguancun Development Corporation, isn’t short on resources -- its parent raked in over 9 billion yuan ($1.24 billion) last year. With 13 implants targeted for 2025, China’s BCI race is heating up fast.",Beinao may become the No.1 most-tested brain chip globally.

"Wikipedia vs ADL continues: Report claims dangerous bias, urge policymakers to act quickly before ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/wikipedia-vs-adl-continues-report-claims-dangerous-bias-urge-policymakers-to-act-quickly-before-/articleshow/119811286.cms,"What Wikimedia Foundation said on ADL report

Wikipedia confirms it blocked some editors from editing content on Israeli-Palestinian conflict

When Elon Musk warned about Wikipedia

The Wikipedia vs ADL battle continues. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has released a report recently that claims it uncovered evidence of antisemitic and anti-Israel bias on Wikipedia, highlighting a growing divide between the advocacy group and the online encyclopedia over the portrayal of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The ADL alleges it discovered a group of volunteer Wikipedia editors who collaborated to bypass the site’s policies, injecting antisemitic narratives, anti-Israel bias, and misleading information into articles related to Israel and Palestine, while also criticizing Wikipedia for not upholding its neutrality standards.In response, a Wikimedia Foundation spokesperson, representing the organization that oversees Wikipedia, dismissed the ADL’s findings as containing “unsupported and problematic claims.” The spokesperson emphasized that the Foundation strongly condemns antisemitism and all hate, expressing regret that the ADL did not seek their input, which could have provided context to address some of the report’s concerns.The ADL’s report emerges amid ongoing debates among Wikipedia users and observers about how to cover the Israel-Hamas war, with editors clashing over descriptions of conflict-related events. Wikipedia insists it has already taken steps to counter manipulation by bad actors on the platform.The tension traces back to last year when Wikipedia editors deemed the ADL “generally unreliable” on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict due to its dual advocacy and research roles, though still “generally reliable” elsewhere. The ADL called this a setback for education on antisemitism, while the Wikimedia Foundation countered that the ADL has since misrepresented Wikipedia’s robust guidelines and enforcement measures, which address the issues raised.In a related move, Wikipedia confirmed it blocked eight editors in January from editing Israeli-Palestinian conflict content due to bad-faith edits—a decision the ADL welcomed. The site’s Arbitration Committee, composed of elected volunteer editors, also restricted editing of conflict-specific articles to experienced users under “extended confirmed protection.”The ADL, however, warns that unchecked antisemitic bias on Wikipedia could have serious repercussions. “We urge Wikipedia and policymakers to act quickly before rampant disinformation on one of the most visited sources of information leads to tragic consequences,” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement accompanying the report.Incidentally, Tesla CEO and the world's richest man Elon Musk too has often criticised Wikipedia. He has often urged people to stop donating to Wikipedia, claiming it to be dominated by Far-Leftist. ""Wikipedia is controlled by far-left activists. People should stop donating to them,"" wrote Elon Musk in October 2024. He even went on to say that he will give Wikipedia a billion dollars if they change their name to ""D*ckipedia"". Elon Musk also criticized the site as “Wokepedia” for its DEI budget and alleged political bias, prompting co-founder Jimmy Wales to retort that Musk might be upset because Wikipedia isn’t for sale.",The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has released a report that claims it uncovered evidence of antisemitic and anti-Israel bias on Wikipedia.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu replies to Kerala Congress' RIP post for 'Make in India',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-replies-to-kerala-congress-rip-post-for-make-in-india/articleshow/119109476.cms,"Here’s a look at Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s post

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress. He emphasized the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. Zoho has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119109563,imgsize-83630,width-400,resizemode-4/119109563.jpg"

Air Canada and Thales issue joint statement

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories.” According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales. Air Canada and Thales issued a joint statement acknowledging the error and stating that the issue has been ""resolved."" ""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy."" Thales added in a separate statement that the map had been provided by a third party.The map feature was promptly disabled, and an updated version will be installed across the fleet starting March 14. Air Canada and Thales apologized for the ""unease created by this situation.""This is not the first time such an issue has occurred in aviation.

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

Apple has been fined 150 million Euros ($162 million) by France's antitrust regulator for abusing its dominant position in the distribution of mobile applications on iOS and iPadOS devices. The French Competition Authority found that Apple's implementation of its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, while aimed at protecting user privacy, was neither necessary nor proportionate to its stated objectives.The ATT framework requires users to consent to data collection by third-party applications, but the regulator criticised the way it was implemented, stating that it unfairly restricted competition. Smaller publishers and advertisers, who rely heavily on third-party data collection, were particularly affected by Apple's practices. The regulator emphasised that while the goal of protecting personal data is commendable, the methods employed by Apple failed to align with its declared purpose.The fine covers the period between April 2021 and July 2023, during which Apple allegedly leveraged its market power to disadvantage competitors. Apple has expressed disappointment with the decision but noted that the regulator has not mandated changes to the ATT framework.This ruling highlights ongoing concerns about the balance between privacy protection and fair competition in the tech industry. It also underscores the growing scrutiny of major tech companies by European regulators, who are increasingly focused on ensuring a level playing field in digital markets.","Apple has been fined 150 million Euros ($162 million) by France's antitrust regulator for abusing its dominant position in the distribution of mobile applications on iOS and iPadOS devices.

Poll Do you believe Charlie Javice should face jail time if found guilty of fraud? No Yes

JPMorgan bought the Fintech startup in 2021

How the Charlie Javice fraud was caught in 2022

Charlie Javice , the founder of student-finance startup Frank, was reportedly convicted of defrauding America's largest bank -- JPMorgan Chase & Co -- in connection with the bank's $175 million acquisition of her company in 2021. The New York Post reports that a Manhattan federal jury in the US delivered the verdict after a six-week trial, concluding with just six hours of deliberation. A report in the New York Post states that Javice, 32, was found guilty on multiple counts, including bank fraud, following prosecutors' successful argument that she fabricated data to falsely inflate Frank's user base from around 300,000 to a claimed 4.25 million users.""The deception, prosecutors said, was critical to securing JPMorgan's purchase of the startup in 2021,"" the report notes. According to the New York Post, Javice appeared visibly shaken and sat silently as the verdict was read, while her co-defendant Olivier Amar, also found guilty, looked down and shook his head, with stunned friends and family in the courtroom. Sentencing is scheduled for a later date, and although Javice faces up to 30 years in prison on the most serious charge, the New York Post cites legal experts suggesting a significantly shorter sentence is likely.The verdict is reported to be a dramatic fall for Javice, once celebrated as a fintech rising star after launching Frank in 2016 to simplify the college financial aid process through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Her innovative approach earned her a spot on Forbes' ""30 Under 30"" list in 2019, and Frank's student-friendly tools and aggressive growth drew national attention, including from JPMorgan Chase.However, the fraud reportedly unraveled in late 2022 when JPMorgan sued Javice, alleging she and Amar misrepresented the company's metrics by hiring a data science company to generate a fake user list during due diligence. Prosecutors claimed a calculated scheme to mislead investors and secure a lucrative deal through deceit.The Department of Justice (DoJ) later filed criminal charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud, and conspiracy, leading to Javice's arrest in April 2023 and release on a $2 million bond. Despite pleading not guilty, the report highlights that prosecutors presented witnesses, emails, and internal documents depicting a calculated scheme of intentional misconduct to mislead investors and secure the lucrative deal through deceit.","Charlie Javice, founder of student-finance startup Frank, was reportedly convicted of defrauding America's largest bank -- JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Tesla sites attacked as protests against Elon Musk intensify

Tesla’s struggles and market impact

Protests erupted across the United States and parts of Europe on March 30, 2025, as demonstrators gathered outside 277 Tesla dealerships, demanding Elon Musk ’s resignation from his government role. Musk, who leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has been accused by critics of using his position to influence policy, cut government spending, and access sensitive data. The demonstrations, organized by environmental activists, Tesla customers, and political figures, mark a significant moment in the growing public backlash against Musk’s involvement in governance.The coordinated protests reflect mounting concerns about Musk’s influence on both the private and public sectors. While some demonstrators focused on Musk’s political role, others voiced frustration over Tesla’s declining product quality and alleged anti-union practices. With Tesla’s sales already facing a downturn, organizers hope to intensify financial pressure on the automaker. Meanwhile, isolated incidents of vandalism against Tesla vehicles and properties have sparked debates on protest tactics.Demonstrators in major cities, including New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and San Francisco, took to the streets in what has been described as one of the largest coordinated protests against a tech billionaire in recent history. Protesters carried banners readingandIn New York City, hundreds gathered outside Tesla’s Manhattan showroom, demanding Musk step down from his government role. The protests coincided with Tesla’s recent struggles in the electric vehicle (EV) market, with declining sales and increased competition from global automakers.In Los Angeles, a group of former Tesla employees joined the demonstration, criticizing the company’s labor policies and expressing concerns about Musk’s growing political power. Meanwhile, smaller protests were reported in Chicago, Boston, and Seattle, with activists vowing to continue their demonstrations until Musk resigns.Beyond the U.S., protests also reached London, where demonstrators gathered outside a Tesla dealership, holding signs denouncing Musk. Some protesters compared Musk’s rise to authoritarian figures, reflecting deep-seated fears about his growing political influence.One of the key groups behind the protests, Planet Over Profit, an environmental activist organization, argues that Musk’s policies within DOGE threaten environmental regulations and sustainability efforts. The group released a statement saying:Amy Neifeld, a 70-year-old psychologist and longtime activist, joined the New York City protest, stating that Musk's leadership is pushing the U.S. towards authoritarianism.she told AFP.A Democratic lawmaker, who chose to remain anonymous, attended a Washington, D.C., protest, calling for congressional investigations into Musk’s government role.they stated.While most protests remained peaceful, there were reports of vandalism against Tesla properties. In some locations, Tesla vehicles were spray-painted, windows were smashed, and cars were set on fire. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi condemned these acts, labeling them ""domestic terrorism.""In response to the attacks, Musk addressed Tesla employees during a March 20 company meeting, calling the incidents ""insane"" and urging protesters to ""stop acting psycho.""Security has since been increased at Tesla dealerships nationwide, and law enforcement agencies have launched investigations into the vandalism cases.Tesla, once the leader in the electric vehicle industry, has been facing challenges in recent months. Increased competition from legacy automakers like Ford, General Motors, and Volkswagen, along with emerging Chinese EV brands, has impacted Tesla’s market share. Additionally, concerns over Tesla’s build quality, labor conditions, and price fluctuations have led to dissatisfaction among consumers.Industry analysts suggest that the protests could further damage Tesla’s reputation and sales. If the demonstrations continue, they may influence investor confidence and stock performance, potentially affecting Musk’s ability to maintain control over both Tesla and his government position.","Protests erupted across the United States and parts of Europe on March 30, 2025.

How to create Ghibli-style Portraits without ChatGPT Plus

ChatGPT ’s Ghibli-style photo generating capabilities have taken the internet by storm. As more people experiment with this feature, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI ’s CEO Sam Altman has a request for users. Taking to microblogging site X, Altman shared a post asking users to “chill” on generating Ghibli-style images. He wrote “can yall please chill on generating images this is insane our team needs sleep”. When a user replied “If you keep nerfing the model, people will stop using it. Otherwise, no”, the CEO said “we are gonna do the opposite of nerfing it BUT still please chill out a bit”“Fire your team and generate a new team,” said another user, to which Altman replied “no thanks, in addition to building AGI this team is on trajectory to build the biggest website in the world from a cold start 2.33 years ago, best team in the world, it's just hard”.AI models like Google's Gemini or Grok can also create Studio Ghibli-style visuals—think lush greenery, soft lighting, and expressive characters—provided you're precise with your prompts, such as ""a serene Ghibli-style girl with flowing hair under a cherry blossom tree.""While the output might differ from ChatGPT's GPT-4o creations, as each model interprets styles uniquely due to differences in training data and algorithms. While ChatGPT's images lean toward photorealistic finesse, Gemini, Grok by Elon Musk-owned AI company xAI -- available through X, or trial-based platforms might produce a slightly more abstract or varied take on Ghibli's charm, requiring some experimentation to nail the vibe.Free platforms like Craiyon, DeepAI, and Playground AI offer AI image generation with varying levels of customization. Simply upload a photo or type a prompt like ""portrait in Studio Ghibli style , lush forest background, soft colors,"" and let the AI work its magic.Again, these tools may not match GPT-4o's photorealistic precision, but they can mimic Ghibli's whimsical aesthetic.","ChatGPT CEO Sam Altman asks users to ""chill"" on generating Ghibli-style images.

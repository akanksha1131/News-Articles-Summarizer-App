Goldman Sachs economists dramatically revised their US recession forecast within minutes, demonstrating the volatile nature of economic predictions amidst shifting trade policies. On Wednesday (April 9) noon, Goldman Sachs predicted a recession following the implementation of new reciprocal tariffs. “We think the White House is unlikely to quickly reverse most of the new tariffs, but our probability of recession would decline if it does,” Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius said Wednesday in a note.“This would be less severe than most past US recessions, in part because we do not see major financial imbalances that need to unwind, private sector balance sheets remain strong, and we see some room for trade deals to eventually lower tariff rates somewhat,” Hatzius wrote.""Prior to President Trump's announcement, we had shifted to a recession baseline due to the newly enacted tariffs,"" stated the Goldman Sachs team, led by Jan Hatzius, in a Wednesday note. ""We are now reverting to our previous non-recession baseline forecast.""Shortly before 1 PM ET, Goldman Sachs estimated a 65% probability of a US recession within 12 months.However, at 1:18 PM ET, President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs exceeding 10%, excluding those on Chinese goods, causing a market surge. Goldman Sachs subsequently released a revised note at 2:10 PM ET, retracting their recession prediction.""This announcement maintains existing tariffs and the 10% minimum 'reciprocal' tariff, and we still anticipate additional sector-specific tariffs at 25%,"" they explained. ""The cumulative effect of these tariffs is likely to align with our previous projections.""","Goldman Sachs economists dramatically revised their US recession forecast within minutes.

At Google Cloud Next 25, Google Cloud has announced Ironwood, its seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), designed to be the company’s most powerful, scalable and energy-efficient custom AI accelerator to date. Notably, Ironwood is the first TPU specifically optimised for inference – the process where a trained model uses its learned knowledge to make predictions or draw conclusions from new, unseen data.Google says that Ironwood represents an evolution, built to meet the evolving needs of generative AI and the increasing importance of inference in AI applications.This involves AI agents that retrieve and generate data to deliver collaborative insights and answers, rather than just raw data. Google says that Ironwood is specifically designed to handle the computational and communication demands of the inference era.Ironwood a key component of Google Cloud's AI Hypercomputer architectureGoogle notes that the architecture of Ironwood is built for scale, supporting up to 9,216 liquid-cooled chips interconnected with a high-speed Inter-Chip Interconnect (ICI) network, spanning nearly 10 MW.

A group of hackers has threatened to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk . The cybercrime group named DonRoad Team, which had earlier claimed responsibility for taking down several websites associated with US President Donald Trump, has now announced that it would start targeting sites associated with Tesla and SpaceX CEO. The group also shared its intent to attack sites associated with the tech billionaire over a month. Previously, the DonRoad Team has claimed responsibility for its attacks in March that targeted The Trump Organization's website, as well as Tesla and SpaceX email servers, causing temporary global outages at the time. This comes after Musk-owned social media platform X (earlier Twitter) was targeted by a group of pro-Palestinian hackers who were able to disable the site for several hours.In a post (seen by Newsweek) shared on messaging platform Telegram, the hackers said: “In the next few hours, we will be suspending all websites affiliated with Elon Musk companies for a full month.”However, the Telegram post was later removed. Should these hacks occur, they may impact multiple Musk-related websites, including X and his AI platforms Grok and Tesla. Hackers may also target websites of other companies owned by Musk, like SpaceX and Tesla.In March, Musk-owned X experienced at least three major outages following a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. —a cyber assault that floods networks or devices with bot-generated traffic. The Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility for the incident.Reacting to the cyberattack, Musk at that time took to X to write: There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against 𝕏. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing …”Later, in a Fox Business interview, Musk noted: “There was a massive cyber attack to try to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.”In a separate event in February, the website for the Department of Government Efficiency, of which Musk is a member, was compromised and altered to mock him and his team.The hacked site temporarily displayed a prominent message stating, “This is a joke of a .gov site,"" alongside the note, ""THESE 'EXPERTS' LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN.”",Hackers threaten to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk.

"Walmart Boycott: World's largest retailer tells protesters, 'we are America's ...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-boycott-worlds-largest-retailer-tells-protesters-we-are-americas-/articleshow/120119363.cms,"Here's what Walmart said about the protest

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has issued a statement addressing the ongoing week-long boycott organised by the People’s Union USA . The boycott, dubbed the "" Walmart Blackout ,"" began on April 7 and targets the company’s rollback of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as broader concerns over corporate influence and tax policies .The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity. The group’s founder, John Schwarz, urged consumers to avoid shopping at Walmart stores, using its online services, or purchasing from its subsidiaries like Sam’s Club. Schwarz stated, “We are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.”In response, Walmart defended its contributions to communities and the economy. “Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,” the company said in a statement. “As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year.”The boycott follows Walmart’s decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households—a trend that contrasts with Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. In comparison, Walmart observed a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw the smallest decrease, at just 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further added that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how someone identifies their sex, it also confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s ‘I feel like you’re interviewing Elon Musk’ answer to biographer when asked about…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-i-feel-like-youre-interviewing-elon-musk-answer-to-biographer-when-asked-about/articleshow/120131030.cms,"Jensen Huang challenges AI assumptions following DeepSeek success

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has drawn a clear line between his approach to artificial intelligence (AI) and that of Tesla’s Elon Musk, according to a new biography titled “The Thinking Machine: Jensen Huang, Nvidia, and the World’s Most Coveted Microchip” by Stephen Witt. The book, released in the US on April 8, details how Huang prefers to focus on building practical solutions rather than bold, futuristic ideas. When asked by Witt to describe the future he envisions, Huang reportedly replied, “I feel like you’re interviewing Elon right now, and not me.”“I’m going to just build the hardware these guys need, and see where it’s going,” he told Witt as per a Business Insider report.The biography compares the contrasting styles of the two tech leaders. According to Witt, Elon Musk often starts with an ambitious end goal—like living on Mars—and then works backward to develop the technology needed. In contrast, Huang takes a more grounded approach, building step by step based on existing tools and real-world needs.Witt also writes that Huang “hates science fiction,” a key difference from Musk’s often sci-fi-inspired projects. The book describes Huang as someone who avoids speculation and instead focuses on solving today’s problems with available technology.Firing back at recent skepticism surrounding Nvidia’s dominance in the AI chip market, Huang recently addressed claims that competitors like China's DeepSeek have achieved comparable AI capabilities with significantly less hardware. Unveiling Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell Ultra GPU at the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference (GTC), he said that everyone has been wrong about how much computer power you need for AI.“Almost the entire world got it wrong,” Huang said, adding that “The amount of computation we need as a result of agentic AI, as a result of reasoning, is easily 100 times more than we thought we needed this time last year”.Huang then emphasized that Nvidia is well-positioned to meet these changing demands. He highlighted the importance of both speed and scale in AI inference, stating, ""If you take too long to answer a question, the customer is not going to come back. This is like web search.""","Jensen Huang has drawn a clear line between his approach to artificial intelligence and that of Tesla’s Elon Musk, according to a new biography.

This development coincides with a separate report indicating that the Apple chipmaker could potentially face a penalty of $1 billion or more to resolve an ongoing export control investigation regarding a chip it manufactured that was subsequently found within a Huawei AI processor.During a Republican National Congressional Committee event, Trump criticised Joe Biden's administration for granting TSMC’s US unit a $6.6 billion subsidy for semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona, arguing that chip companies do not require such financial assistance.“TSMC, I gave them no money ... all I did was say, if you don't build your plant here, you're going to pay a big tax,” Trump stated.In March, TSMC, the world's leading contract chip manufacturer, announced at the White House a new $100 billion investment in the US, including the construction of five additional chip facilities in the coming years.Separately, Reuters reported that the chipmaker could be subject to a penalty of $1 billion or more to resolve a US export control investigation concerning a chip it produced that was found in a Huawei Technologies AI processor.Citing sources, the news agency said that the US Department of Commerce has been probing TSMC’s work for China-based Sophgo.

How next round of job cuts at Microsoft’s may have an 'Amazon and Google angle',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-next-round-of-job-cuts-may-have-an-amazon-angle/articleshow/120129635.cms,"Microsoft’s reported job cuts mirror restructuring efforts at Amazon and Google

Microsoft is reportedly considering another round of job cuts , potentially as soon as May, as the tech giant explores further streamlining of its team structures. The potential reductions are said to target middle management positions while aiming to increase the ratio of engineers to non-technical roles within project teams. This approach echoes similar restructuring efforts announced by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy , who has also emphasised a leaner organisational structure.Citing multiple sources familiar with the matter, Business Insider reports that discussions are underway to increase the “span of control” for remaining managers, meaning each manager would oversee a larger number of employees.While the exact number of potential job losses remains unclear, the report said that as a “significant portion” of their team.This potential move aligns with a broader trend in the tech industry, where companies like Amazon and Google have also been actively working to optimise their organizational structures by increasing the ratio of individual contributors to managers. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, in December, announced a 10% reduction in vice president and manager roles as part of an efficiency drive.The report notes that Microsoft has its focus on decreasing the ""PM ratio"" – the ratio of product managers or program managers to engineers – on various teams. This concept, known as the ""Builder Ratio"" at Amazon, where Microsoft's security chief Charlie Bell previously held a prominent role, aims to track the balance between software engineers and ""non-builders.""Microsoft is also reported to be considering setting more aggressive targets for this ratio within some organisations. For instance, Bell’s security division is reportedly aiming to increase its engineer-to-PM ratio from the current 5.5:1 to 10:1.This potential restructuring will follow a round of approximately 2,000 job cuts earlier this year, which Microsoft attributed to the removal of low-performing employees. The upcoming potential cuts in May could also include individuals identified as lower performers based on the company's ""ManageRewards slider"" performance review system.","Microsoft is reportedly considering another round of job cuts, potentially as soon as May.

How TSMC’s Huawei mistake may cost it $1 billion fine in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-tsmcs-huawei-mistake-may-cost-it-1-billion-fine-in-the-us/articleshow/120129220.cms,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker, is under investigation by the US Department of Commerce for allegedly violating export control regulations. The probe centers on a chip manufactured by TSMC for Sophgo, a China-based chip design company, which reportedly ended up in Huawei’s high-end Ascend 910B artificial intelligence processor. Huawei has been on the US Entity List since 2020, restricting its access to goods made with US technology.According to a report by Reuters, TSMC could face a fine exceeding $1 billion if found guilty of breaching export rules. The penalty is based on regulations allowing fines up to twice the value of unauthorised transactions. TSMC’s manufacturing process involves US-origin technology, making its Taiwan-based factories subject to US export controls. These controls prohibit the production of chips for Huawei or certain advanced chips for Chinese customers without a US license.The investigation highlights the risks of diversion, as TSMC reportedly produced nearly three million chips for Sophgo, which were later linked to Huawei’s AI processor. Experts suggest that the chip’s AI-focused design should have raised red flags, given the potential for misuse by restricted entities like Huawei.TSMC has denied supplying chips to Huawei since September 2020 and stated that it is cooperating with the Commerce Department . The company has also suspended shipments to Sophgo following the discovery of the issue. A spokesperson for TSMC reaffirmed the company’s commitment to compliance with export regulations.This case comes at a critical time for U.S.-Taiwan relations, as trade negotiations are underway. TSMC recently announced plans to invest $100 billion in the US, including the construction of five new semiconductor fabrication plants.","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is under investigation by the US Department of Commerce for allegedly violating export control regulations.

Sabeer Bhatia says Indians need to start doing work with their owen hand

Sabeer Bhatia , co-founder of Hotmail , has criticized India's engineering ecosystem for fostering management-oriented graduates rather than builders and innovators, claiming that most engineers lack practical skills needed for technological advancement. ""99% of Indian who graduate as engineers join management and start giving gyaan to everybody. Where is the work ethic, where they really work with their hands and really go and build some stuff?"" Bhatia said during a podcast with YouTuber Singh in USA.Bhatia pointed out a fundamental issue in how India's business culture celebrates outsourcing rather than original creation. ""Here, people value anybody who does work with their hands... and yet he's the software guru of India, he's the business guru of dealing in, you know, who does body shopping—not software,"" Bhatia remarked.Shark Tank India judge Namita Thapar offered a measured response to Bhatia's comments. ""While there's truth in what Sabeer says about our education system needing reform, I've seen remarkable innovation from engineers in our startup ecosystem,"" noted Thapar, adding that ""the issue isn't just with engineers but with the entire support system for innovation in India.""According to Bhatia, India needs a complete overhaul of its attitude toward technical skills and education. ""Till we change our work ethic and we actually start doing work with our own hands and start respecting people who write software, who write code, who do things, or who think about these problems in a critical way… we've got to change the education system,"" he emphasized.Drawing comparisons with China, Bhatia noted the difference in educational accessibility. ""China educates everybody. It's like subsidised education, subsidised cars."" In contrast, he believes ""education today is the prerogative of rich"" in India.Bhatia also criticized the curriculum at India's premier technical institutions. "" Stanford teaches what's happening now, much of IIT academia is stuck in the past,"" he stated, adding that ""free knowledge from internet is the real teacher."" He shared his personal experience: ""I got into Apple on my grades, but built Hotmail by learning on the job. Innovation comes from doing, not just studying.""","Sabeer Bhatia, co-founder of Hotmail, says Indian engineers lack practical skills.

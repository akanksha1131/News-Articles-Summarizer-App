Elon Musk’s X sues these big companies over ‘collective advertising boycott’ claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-x-sues-these-big-companies-over-collective-advertising-boycott-claims/articleshow/117867646.cms,"Why X filed a lawsuit against these companies

Elon Musk-owned X has broadened its legal battle over an alleged collective advertising boycott , adding several prominent companies to its lawsuit. In a complaint filed recently in a Texas court, X named Nestlé, Abbott Laboratories, Colgate, Lego, Pinterest, Tyson Foods, and Shell as defendants.These brands join a list that already includes the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), CVS Health, Mars, Ørsted, and Twitch.X's lawsuit, initially filed in August last year, alleges a coordinated effort by these companies to boycott advertising on the platform following Elon Musk's acquisition in October 2022. At that time, Musk said in a post on X, ""Everyone who has been boycotted should file a lawsuit in every country they've been boycotted"".In a separate post, Musk said ""We tried being nice for 2 years and got nothing but empty words. Now, it is war.""According to a report by Business Insider, the social media company claims that the defendants, some of whom were members of the now-defunct Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), conspired to “collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising revenue” from X.Advertiser trade body WFA, in August last year, stated its intention to contest the suit, asserting its compliance with competition law.GARM, established in 2019, aimed to create standardised frameworks for categorizing harmful content, such as hate speech and misinformation. The participation was voluntary and many platforms adopted these frameworks as a ""brand safety floor."" X itself was a former member of GARM.X's amended complaint alleges that the WFA “organised an advertiser boycott of Twitter through GARM, with the goal of coercing Twitter to comply with the GARM Brand Safety Standards.” The company claims that at least 18 GARM members ceased advertising on Twitter in the US and globally between November and December 2022, following Musk's $44 billion takeover in October.X argues that the alleged boycott diminished its competitiveness in the digital advertising market and negatively impacted user engagement.The company's ad revenue experienced a sharp decline after Musk's acquisition, as many advertisers withdrew from the platform due to staff reductions, policy changes, and the reinstatement of some of the previously banned accounts.","X's lawsuit, initially filed in August last year, alleges a coordinated effort by these companies to boycott advertising on the platform following Elon Musk's acquisition in October 2022.

"DeepSeek's $5 million number is to hurt US companies and there are lot of American idiots who hype it, says Palmer Luckey who sold his company for billions to Facebook",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deepseeks-5-million-number-is-to-hurt-us-companies-and-there-are-lot-of-american-idiots-who-hype-it-says-palmer-luckey-who-sold-his-company-for-billions-to-facebook/articleshow/117861406.cms,"""Useful idiots"" in America not challenging DeepSeek claims

Chinese AI does not require ""losing our minds""

Palmer Luckey , the American entrepreneur behind Oculus (acquired by Facebook ) and defense tech company Anduril, remains skeptical of the recent buzz around Chinese AI startup DeepSeek and its cost-efficiency claims. In a Fox Business interview, Luckey criticized the US media for what he sees as overly hyped reporting on DeepSeek’s assertions.Luckey specifically challenged the widely reported figure of $5 million as the training cost for DeepSeek's AI model, which is purportedly competitive with US-developed models costing billions.He pointed out that DeepSeek has not disclosed the full costs associated with developing both of its models, and that significant infrastructure costs remain unknown. He accused DeepSeek of intentionally publicizing the $5 million figure to damage US companies, with the media acting as ""useful idiots"" by repeating the claim without proper scrutiny. He argued that neither China, DeepSeek, nor the media have an incentive to correct the record, even as US companies like Nvidia saw their valuations plummet.DeepSeek's model reportedly matches the capabilities of chatbots like ChatGPT and Meta's Llama at a significantly lower development cost. Its app also topped the Apple App Store charts, and it reportedly functions using less powerful Nvidia chips. These developments triggered a downturn in the US tech sector earlier this week.While acknowledging DeepSeek's impressive progress and innovations in AI, Luckey cautioned against accepting the company's self-reported figures at face value. He believes there are those who actively want to see US tech companies, and US President Donald Trump fail, and that some of those individuals are located within the United States.Luckey suggested that the timing and presentation of DeepSeek's news were deliberate, and that the resulting stock market reactions indicate it achieved its intended purpose. He concluded by emphasizing that acknowledging the competitive threat of Chinese AI does not require ""losing our minds"" or falling prey to what he considers to be CCP propaganda.","Oculus founder Palmer Luckey remains skeptical of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's cost-efficiency claims.

Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein has re-entered the Indian market with a dedicated mobile app launched by Reliance Retail , nearly five years after its ban amid diplomatic tensions in 2020.The Shein India Fast Fashion app, available on both Android and iOS platforms, initially serves major cities including New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, with plans for nationwide expansion.Prices start at Rs 199 for dresses, with all products designed and manufactured within India by local manufacturers.Under the partnership structure, Reliance maintains complete operational control and data sovereignty, with Shein serving solely as a technology partner. The Chinese brand receives a license fee for brand usage, with no equity investment involved. All customer data must be stored in India, with Shein having no access rights.Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal confirmed that the approval process underwent extensive scrutiny from multiple ministries, including IT and Home Affairs, ensuring compliance with national security concerns.The re-entry coincides with Shein's growing global dominance, as the company recently became the world's most visited fashion and apparel website, capturing 2.68% of global web traffic in Q3 2024 and outperforming established brands like Nike, H&M, and Zara. Meanwhile, Amazon has launched a new low-cost storefront to tackle Chinese e-commerce platforms, and now is planning to targeting the low-cost fashion segment in the US, one of Shein's biggest market.The move comes as Shein prepares for a potential London stock market listing in the first half of the year, having abandoned previous U.S. listing plans. The company's rapid expansion has drawn regulatory attention, particularly in Europe, where it now faces stricter oversight under the EU's Digital Services Act due to its large user base of 108 million monthly active users.","The Shein India Fast Fashion app, available on both Android and iOS platforms, initially serves major cities including New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru.Prices start at Rs 199 for dresses, with all products designed and manufactured within India by local manufacturers.

This week in the world of technology, tech giants Amazon and Microsoft announced layoffs, affecting employees across divisions. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), India's stock market regulator, took action against financial influencers for misleading advice. Meanwhile, Nvidia saw a huge drop in its market value, losing $500 billion due to Chinese new AI app DeepSeek which has taken the tech world by storm.These and more in top tech stories of the week.Microsoft has initiated immediate job cuts due to performance issues, with impacted employees losing access to systems, buildings, and benefits on their last day. The termination letters, obtained by Business Insider, state that employees are being let go because their ""job performance has not met minimum performance standards and expectations"" for their positions. Impacted workers face immediate removal of access to Microsoft systems, accounts, and buildings. The cuts are said to be a part of broader layoffs in various divisions, but headcount impact is expected to be minimal.The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has banned the use of live stock market data for educational purposes to curb the spread of real-time trading advice. Stock market educators can only use data with a three-month lag. “Such person (someone who is engaged solely in education) should not be using the market price data of the preceding three months to speak/talk/display the name of any security including using any code name of the security in his/her talk/speech, video, ticker, screen share etc. indicating the future price, advice or recommendation related to security or securities,"" SEBI said in a circular. Finfluencers must now register with SEBI, affecting their relevance and brand deals significantly.Amazon is undergoing restructuring, leading to layoffs in its communications and sustainability teams. While the company did not disclose the exact number of affected roles, an internal memo obtained by CNBC described the cuts as ""small."" Drew Herdener, who heads Amazon’s public relations and corporate responsibility efforts, informed employees about the decision, explaining that some positions were ""too narrowly scoped"" or added ""unnecessary layers"" to the organization. Impacted employees will receive financial assistance and support. Despite these changes, Amazon remains dedicated to its sustainability commitments, including reaching carbon neutrality by 2040 and transitioning to 100% renewable energy by 2025.Nvidia, the world's most-valuable Artificial Intelligence (AI) company, lost more than $500 billion of its market value. The emergence of a low-cost Chinese generative AI model from DeepSeek triggered a significant sell-off in U.S. tech stocks on January 27, raising concerns about U.S. dominance in the AI industry. DeepSeek, a Hangzhou-based startup, claims its chatbot can match the capabilities of leading U.S. AI models with significantly lower development costs (reportedly $5.6 million compared to billions invested by U.S. companies). Nvidia is a key chip supplier for the AI industry.Zoho Corporation's CEO and co-founder, Sridhar Vembu, announced his decision to step down from his position as CEO. Vembu will transition to the role of chief scientist at the company, where he plans to focus on deep research and development (R&D) initiatives, especially in the rapidly advancing fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and technology. In a statement on X, Vembu explained his decision, citing the various challenges and opportunities the company faces. ""In view of the various challenges and opportunities facing us, including recent major developments in AI, it has been decided that it is best for me to focus full-time on R&D initiatives, along with pursuing my personal rural development mission,"" Vembu said.Mark Zuckerberg recently lauded Elon Musk's X Community Notes system as more effective than Meta's prior fact-checking method during Meta's Q4 2024 earnings call.

ASML CEO happy with DeepSeek's cost efficiency



There are no DeepSeek jitters for Europe's largest chip supplier ASML. According to a report in Reuters, unlike technology giants in the US who saw their stock market wealth get wiped out by billions this week, ASML sees the emergence of China's DeepSeek as a positive. The CEO Christophe Fouquet expressed a positive outlook on the impact of efficient AI models, like the one recently launched by China's DeepSeek, on the chip market.He believes that these advancements will ultimately benefit the industry, despite the initial market tremors triggered by DeepSeek's release.Fouquet clarified that the perception of AI-related chip demand is often distorted by the massive investments made by hyperscalers – companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft. These US-based technology giants are pouring billions into building massive data centers equipped with cutting-edge chips specifically for training large AI models. He argued that while these investments are substantial, the number of chips used for this purpose is relatively small compared to the broader potential of AI.Speaking after ASML announced strong earnings, driven largely by robust demand for chip-making equipment related to AI, Fouquet addressed concerns about DeepSeek's impact, which had previously caused a significant drop in tech stock prices. He emphasized that the real driver of growth for ASML will be the widespread use of AI in various applications, rather than just the training of large models.Fouquet pointed to a wide range of applications, from smartphones and cars to robotics and industrial systems, as potential growth areas for AI-related chip demand. He stressed the importance of cost-effectiveness. ""If you want to have an AI chip on your phone, the cost of those chips has to be a fraction of what maybe the hyperscaler can pay for it,"" he reportedly said. The ASML CEO further argued that if chip costs don't decrease, the market will remain limited, benefiting only a few and hindering mass adoption. ""If the cost doesn't go down, you may continue to sell a few very expensive chips and make a few people very happy, but you will not basically bring this technology to the masses and the volume will remain small.""Regarding DeepSeek specifically, Fouquet stated, as per the report, ""I don't know exactly what DeepSeek can or cannot do, but I say again, anything that will drive costs down is good news for ASML on the long term."" He sees the potential for such advancements to broaden the market and increase overall chip demand.","ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet expressed a positive outlook on the impact of efficient AI models, like the one recently launched by China's DeepSeek, on the chip market.

"Starbucks, PepsiCo, McDonalds and Target net worth combined: The amount that Nvidia lost in Monday Mahyem",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/starbuckspepsico-mcdonalds-and-target-net-worth-combined-the-amount-that-nvidia-lost-in-monday-mahyem/articleshow/117840778.cms,"The Rise and Rise of Nvidia



What changed on Monday

One of the world's most-valuable stock and company saw its worst day earlier this week, January 27, 2025 to be precise. The superstar run for Nvidia’s stock the last few years has been astonishing. So was its tumble Monday, which caused $595 billion in wealth to vanish. That’s about as much as PepsiCo, McDonalds, Starbucks and Target are worth, combined.Mostly known only in gaming and crypto circles a few years ago, Nvidia burst into limelight in the last two years after seeing its sales surge because customers wanted its chips to train their chatbots and other artificial intelligence products.Nvidia became a household name as its stock more than tripled in 2023 and then more than doubled in 2024. So much so that some investors and analysts lauded CEO Jensen Huang as the “Godfather of AI.” Nvidia grew into a $3 trillion-plus behemoth and traded places with titans like Apple to become the most valuable company on Wall Street.But that all came to a screeching halt Monday, at least for a moment, after a Chinese upstart called DeepSeek said it had developed a large-language model that could perform like ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, but by using far less computing power.Nvidia’s roots began in gaming. The Santa Clara, California-based tech company’s invention of the graphics processor unit, or GPU, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. Now Nvidia’s specialized chips are key components that help power different forms of artificial intelligence, including the latest generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.Huang has dubbed AI “the next industrial revolution,” and Nvidia’s GPUs are designed to perform artificial intelligence tasks faster and more efficiently than general-purpose chips like CPUs. Tech giants are snapping up Nvidia chips as they wade deeper into AI — a movement that’s enabling cars to drive by themselves, and generating stories, art and music.The demand helped Nvidia's revenue grow by eye-popping levels, quarter after quarter. On Feb. 23, 2023, after Nvidia breezed past analysts' expectations for quarterly profit, Huang said that “AI is at an inflection point, setting up for broad adoption reaching into every industry.” The company's quarterly revenue at the time was $6.05 billion.That ramped up to $7.19 billion just three months later and then nearly doubled to $13.51 billion three months after that. Revenue has since vaulted to $35.08 billion in the three months through October 2024.The company's stock price has similarly soared, and its total market value quickly passed rivals like Intel, Microsoft and others. Nvidia alone accounted for more than a fifth of all of the S&P 500 index's total return last year. No other stock came close, and it had more than triple Apple's impact.Unlike the dot-com boom, real money was behind Nvidia’s surge, and its stock price rose on expectations of ever more to come. Those expectations came into question on Monday. DeepSeek and its seemingly lower-cost operations raised worries about whether companies would need to spend as many dollars on Nvidia chips as previously thought. The concerns dragged down stocks across the AI industry, including suppliers to the chip industry and the power companies hoping to electrify the vast data centers that were expected to get built to run those chips. But Nvidia was in the spotlight because its stock has become the brightest symbol of the AI bonanza.Some on Wall Street saw Monday's nearly 17% plunge for Nvidia's stock as an opportunity rather than a signal of pending doom, saying the stock became more affordable. If AI does become cheaper to run, it could open the door to new kinds of customers and software innovations that could ultimately help the industry in the long term.However, as John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, told AP, “As for Nvidia itself, this isn’t the first time a major tech stock has faced existential questions."" “We’ve seen similar situations with Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and Netflix — companies that were once doubted but ultimately rebounded.”","N Nvidia's stock fell nearly 17% on Monday, wiping out $595 billion in wealth. The tech company's stock price has soared in the last few years because of demand for its AI chips.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Bernstein report 'tells' what it says China's DeepSeek is not telling everyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bernstein-report-tells-what-it-says-chinas-deepseek-is-not-telling-everyone/articleshow/117702705.cms,"How to use deepseek AI

What DeepSeek is not telling

Bernstein Research 's recent report has tempered the hype surrounding DeepSeek, the Chinese startup whose low-cost AI assistant has caused a stir in the tech world and even impacted global markets. While acknowledging DeepSeek 's impressive capabilities, the report argues that claims of the AI being built for just $5 million are misleading and don't represent the full picture of its development costs.The Bernstein report directly addresses the narrative surrounding DeepSeek's supposed budget: ""We believe that DeepSeek DID NOT 'build OpenAI for USD 5M'; the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and the resulting Twitter-verse panic over the weekend seems overblown."" The report emphasizes that the ""fantastic"" results achieved by DeepSeek shouldn't be mistaken for miraculous, and the market reaction, particularly the impact on Nvidia, was disproportionate to the reality of the situation.DeepSeek has developed two primary AI model families: DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek R1 . The V3 model is a large language model (LLM) utilizing a Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) architecture. Bernstein's analysis reveals that training the V3 model required significant computational resources. DeepSeek employed a cluster of 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs for approximately two months. This translates to roughly 2.7 million GPU hours for pre-training and a total of 2.8 million GPU hours when including post-training. GPU hours represent the cumulative time a graphics processing unit is actively engaged in processing tasks, highlighting the substantial investment in computational power.The report underscores that the widely cited ""$5 million"" figure fails to account for the extensive research, development, experimentation, personnel costs, and other associated expenses inherent in developing such a complex model. It's not simply a matter of hardware costs; the figure omits the significant investment in talent and time required for AI research and development.The unveiling of DeepSeek's assistant had a dramatic effect on the market, particularly on AI chip leader Nvidia. On January 27th, Nvidia experienced a record single-day loss in market value, close to $593 billion, driven by fears that Chinese AI models like DeepSeek's could gain a competitive edge over more expensive American counterparts. Bernstein's report suggests that this market reaction was an overreaction.While the V3 model's training resources were detailed, the report notes that the R1 model, which was considered particularly impressive, lacked similar quantification in DeepSeek's research paper. This raises questions about the true cost and resources involved in developing the R1 model.In conclusion, Bernstein acknowledges DeepSeek's achievements as ""fantastic"" but argues that the claim of building an OpenAI-level competitor for $5 million is ""exaggerated"" and ""overblown."" The report provides a more nuanced perspective, highlighting the substantial computational resources and likely hidden costs involved in developing advanced AI models like DeepSeek's, and suggesting that the market's reaction to the company's emergence may have been disproportionate.",Chinese startup DeepSeek's low-cost AI assistant has caused a stir in the tech world and even impacted global markets.

OpenAI questioned Delhi Court's territorial jurisdiction in copyright case

NewYork Times sues OpenAI and Microsoft over AI use of copyrighted work

AI industry's one of the biggest and most common names ChatGPT maker OpenAI is worried. Reason: It says that Chinese companies are actively attempting to replicate its advanced AI models. ""We know (China) based companies -- and others -- are constantly trying to distill the models of leading US AI companies,"" an OpenAI spokesperson told news agency AFP.OpenAI further said that the process was against its terms of service and it would work at detecting and preventing further attempts.We ""believe as we go forward that it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology,"" the spokesperson added.While OpenAI, Microsoft and some in the US government are crying foul; many across the internet are not amused. For, the company led by Sam Altman is itself facing multiple accusations of intellectual property violations, primarily related to the use of copyrighted materials in training its generative AI models.Such Copyright infringement cases against ChatGPT abound across the world. Courts across the world are hearing claims by authors, news outlets and musicians who accuse ChatGPT of using their copyright work to train AI services and who are seeking to have content used to train the chatbot deleted.Earlier this month, the New Delhi-based Federation of Indian Publishers filed a case at the Delhi High Court against OpenAI, which is already facing similar lawsuits in the same court. The case has been filed on behalf of all the federation's members, who include publishers like Bloomsbury (BLPU.L), opens new tab, Penguin Random House, Cambridge University Press and Pan Macmillan, as well as India's Rupa Publications and S.Chand and Co. ""Our ask from the court is that they should stop (OpenAI from) accessing our copyright content,"" Pranav Gupta, the federation's general secretary told Reuters about the lawsuit, which concerns the ChatGPT tool's book summaries.Not just this, the Indian media outlets, including NDTV and Network18 have told the Delhi High Court that they want to join the ongoing lawsuit against ChatGPT creator OpenAI as they are worried their news websites are being scraped to store and reproduce their work for users of the powerful AI tool. The 135-page case filing, which is not public but was reviewed by Reuters, argues OpenAI's conduct constitutes ""a clear and present danger to the valuable copyrights"" of Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) members and other outlets.In November 2024, the Delhi High Court issued summons to OpenAI in a lawsuit filed by news agency Asian News International (ANI) over use of its news content “without any license or permission”, by the advanced AI-powered chatbot to provide services to its users.Responding to the same earlier this month, Open AI’s counsel questioned the territorial jurisdiction of courts in India to decide the issue. Senior advocate Amit Sibal, representing OpenAI, said that the organisation operates internationally, with no servers or offices in India.In 2024, the New York Times sued OpenAI and its partner Microsoft for the unpermitted use of Times articles to train GPT large language models.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI is worried that Chinese companies are attempting to replicate its advanced AI models.

For years, middle-class professionals have been India’s punching bag 👊

Taxed at every turn, squeezed for every rupee, while the ultra-rich found loopholes and businesses got tax breaks.

Every Budget, same story > Hope builds up. Expectations rise. Then—another “Sorry, no relief for you.” 💸 But Budget 2025 has come with a big shift.

No income tax up to ₹12.75 lakh under the

New Tax Regime

.

I call this a systemic correction, not just a tax cut.

History tells us > strong economies are built on thriving middle classes, not overburdened ones.

🇺🇸 Post-WWII America bet on its working class → Boom in manufacturing, housing, and consumer spending.

🇨🇳 China in the 2000s focused on the middle class → Higher incomes, rapid economic expansion, massive global influence.

India? For years, we got it backwards.

Instead of fueling spending and investment, we kept squeezing our most productive taxpayers—the salaried class.

This Budget shifts that.

More disposable income = More consumption = More economic growth. 🚀

You don’t build an economy by making people feel gareeb. You build it by making them wealthier. 😎

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced a major tax relief for India’s middle class in the Union Budget 2025 . These include a simplified income tax law, a higher TCS threshold for remittances, and enhanced tax benefits for middle-class taxpayers. Under the revised regime, there will be no income tax on earnings up to Rs 12 lakh, and up to Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried individuals (including standard deduction).""The new tax structure would substantially reduce tax for the middle class,"" announced FM Sitharaman.People Group founder and Shark Tank judge Anupam Mittal has lauded the Budget 2025 .

Heeds to IT ministry's 'warning' on China and Vietnam



Union Budget 2025 proposes the removal of import duties on several key mobile phone components. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in the Union Budget 2025 several measures aimed to bolster domestic production and government's Make in India initiative. The announcement are likely to help the 'make in India' plans of three of the biggest smartphone brands in India -- Samsung Apple and Xiaomi India's electronics manufacturing sector has witnessed significant growth, more than doubling in the past six years to reach $115 billion in 2024. This makes India the world's second-largest mobile phone producer. Counterpoint research indicates that Apple led the Indian smartphone market in 2024 with a 23% revenue share, closely followed by Samsung at 22%.The eliminated tariffs, previously at 2.5%, apply to components essential for mobile phone assembly, including printed circuit board assemblies, parts of camera modules, and USB cables. This reduction aims to make Indian manufacturing more competitive amidst global economic uncertainty.These tariff cuts serve as a strategic response to potential global trade disruptions. While some nations are pursuing policies aimed at reshoring manufacturing, India is actively seeking to capitalize on international trade dynamics and attract a greater share of the global supply chain. This proactive approach follows previous internal warnings from India's IT ministry about the risk of losing ground to competitors like China and Vietnam in smartphone exports if tariffs were not reduced to attract global companies.This initiative builds upon previous efforts by the Indian government to streamline and rationalize the nation's customs duty structure. Last year's budget also announced a review of these duties with the goals of simplification and trade facilitation. A key objective of this review is to eliminate inverted duty structures, where tariffs on raw materials or intermediate goods are higher than those on finished products. Such complex duty structures have long been identified as obstacles to efficient domestic production and a source of trade disputes within India. The simplification of the tariff structure promises to create a more favorable environment for manufacturers operating within the country.",Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in the Union Budget 2025 several measures aimed to bolster domestic production.

The Union Budget 2025 received positive reactions from industry leaders, with many praising its focus on skilling, economic growth, fiscal prudence, and income tax relief measures. Various sectors expressed their approval of the provisions aimed at boosting growth, encouraging investment, and providing relief to the middle class.Here's what top executives of Microsoft, Tata Technologies, Accenture, Noise and others have to say on Union Budget 2025:""We welcome the government's focus on AI skilling in the Union Budget 2025 and are encouraged by our shared vision of making India AI first.The proposed Centre of Excellence (CoE) for AI in Education is a forward-thinking initiative towards empowering our workforce. Microsoft recently announced successful skilling of 2 million people across India in AI under our ADVANTA(I)GE India initiative. We further committed to train 10 million more people in AI by 2030. We will also establish ‘AI Productivity Labs’ in 20 National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs)/NIELIT centers in 10 states to impart foundational courses for 20,000 educators. With these investments, we are not only enhancing India’s competitive edge but also ensuring sustainable growth and innovation. This Budget reflects a commitment to building a technologically advanced and inclusive economy, and we are excited to support India lead in an AI-centric world.”The Finance Minister’s announcements reflect a clear intent to harness the potential of the travel and tourism sector by prioritizing infrastructure, improving access, incentivizing investment, and expanding its reach beyond established hubs. Strengthening regional connectivity through the modified UDAN scheme will unlock new corridors of travel, bringing deeper parts of India into the tourism fold. The 50-year interest-free loan to state governments will drive infrastructure development at the destination level, thereby contributing to the tourism growth story. The challenge-mode approach to developing 50 destinations, backed by performance-linked incentives, shifts the focus to outcome-driven execution — encouraging states to compete and innovate in destination management.Equally important is the structured push for hospitality. Including hotels in the harmonized infrastructure list across 50 destinations will unlock long-term financing and drive investment, while extending Mudra loans to homestays ensures that smaller entrepreneurs and local communities are equally part of this growth story.“The budget's focus on establishing a National Manufacturing Mission aligns with our goal of engineering in India for 'Make in India' and enhancing the nation's self-reliance in manufacturing. This initiative is poised to attract investments and improve efficiency, positioning Indian companies as globally competitive players. The establishment of five National Centres of Excellence for Skilling is a pivotal move in building a future-ready workforce. This initiative resonates with our commitment to engineering a better future for India's youth through investment in in-demand training programs across Industry 4.0, IoT, and advanced manufacturing, and collaborating with state governments to upgrade ITIs into technology hubs. Additionally, the allocation of ₹500 crore for a Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence for education underscores the importance of fostering innovation and research in AI, which will benefit both the education sector and the broader technology landscape.”“The Budget's forward-looking focus on deep-tech innovations like AI, global capability centres (GCCs), and future-ready talent underscores a strong commitment towards “Viksit Bharat.” The other initiatives like Deeptech Fund of Funds and 10,000 fellowships for tech research, 5 National CoEs and a CoE for AI in Education, reiterate our commitment to developing an ecosystem for next-gen tech. The opening up of new avenues for GCCs in tier-2 cities will help states bolster their infra, bridge skill gaps and aid talent growth.”“With India’s economy being the fastest growing among major global economies, the Union Budget rightly allocates additional resources to drive innovation and technological advancement. The emphasis on skilling, new reforms to enhance the ease of doing business, and the establishment of a Centre of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence can serve as key drivers of India’s growth. The announcement of a Deep Tech fund can encourage startups from both technical and non-technical backgrounds to make a substantial contribution to the economy. Additionally, a new manufacturing mission under the Make in India initiative will strengthen MSMEs, which play a vital role in positioning India as a global manufacturing hub and generating employment for our youth.”""The Union Budget 2025, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman , sets a bold roadmap for India's manufacturing growth with its visionary push for 'Make in India' and skill development. It is encouraging to see the government taking strategic steps to support the consumer electronics industry, particularly through the reduction in import duties on key components. This will lower production costs, boost local manufacturing, and enhance affordability, marking a significant step towards strengthening India's position as a global hub for innovation. Additionally, the launch of the National Manufacturing Mission will empower domestic industries—small, medium, and large—to innovate and integrate into global supply chains, stimulating domestic consumption and creating a ripple effect across industries. As a homegrown brand that has consistently pushed in support of the 'Make in India' initiative, we are excited that this move will further bring industries together and help scale India's manufacturing ecosystem to new heights. The establishment of five National Centers of Excellence for Skilling is another crucial step in bridging the talent gap, ensuring a future-ready workforce for advanced manufacturing. Further, the creation of a new 'Fund of Funds' for Startups with a ₹10,000 crore infusion will provide much-needed capital to fuel innovation and entrepreneurship mindset in the startup ecosystem, empower budding entrepreneurs in driving growth.""The Union Budget 2025 strikes a thoughtful balance between stimulating consumption, maintaining fiscal prudence, and fostering long-term economic growth. The significant tax cuts are a timely move to drive greater consumption, putting more money in the hands of the middle class, which will ultimately boost demand across sectors. The budget reinforces the government’s commitment to building a business-friendly regulatory environment—one that empowers startups and MSMEs to scale with confidence. The push towards MSMEs with enhanced credit guarantees, the introduction of special cards for micro-enterprises, and the ₹30,000 UPI limit on credit cards for street vendors is a game-changer, promoting financial inclusion, driving digital transactions, and creating employment. Furthermore, the establishment of a mechanism under the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) to assess financial regulations is a proactive step toward ensuring regulatory adaptability. By fostering stability and clarity, this initiative will provide much-needed confidence to financial institutions and fintech players alike.""“The Union Budget 2025 presents a robust roadmap for India’s industrial and technological advancement. With a strong focus on manufacturing, the National Manufacturing Mission and policy support for industries specifically electric vehicles will further boost consumption and growth of the auto industry. In addition, the emphasis on public-private partnerships in infrastructure development opens up new avenues for collaboration and innovation. Further, the Centres of Excellence in AI and focus on skilling will create a workforce ready for technology-led reinvention of industries, enhancing India’s position as global manufacturing and AI hub.""The Union Budget rightly prioritizes reviving consumption by focusing on rationalizing the tax burden of the salaried class. The increase of the no-tax limit from ₹7 lakh to ₹12 lakh is a significant step in reducing tax and putting more money back into consumers’ hands. This will provide a much-needed boost to consumption, which has been challenging over the past 1-1.5 years.Additionally, initiatives such as the PM Dhan Dhaanya Krishi Yojana, which aims to support 1.7 crore farmers, are expected to enhance agricultural productivity and rural incomes, stimulating demand in rural India. The emphasis on employment generation, particularly through women’s entrepreneurship, is a welcome and necessary move to unlock India’s true economic potential.“The Union budget has rightfully given impetus osn boosting the purchasing power of a large population with Tax relaxation and support to Agriculture and farming community. We firmly believe that with more money in hands farmers' capability to adopt new technologies like Drones significantly improves and helps grow the market faster. For electronics manufacturing, the relaxation in Basic Custom duties for certain components is a positive step and a continuation of earlier policy initiatives and will boost indigenous manufacturing. We welcome the union budget in letter and spirit as both developments positively impact the Optiemus Group. We look forward to continuing to support the growth of our economy with our efforts.”“A big thank you to our Hon. Finance Minister for announcing several programs as part of the budget for 2025-26 to give a boost to the geospatial sector. The most important one is the setting up of the National Geospatial Mission to develop foundational geospatial infrastructure and data to facilitate land records modernization, urban planning, and infrastructure design. The users in the government, private sector, and the industry have lived with the lack of good foundational data for a very long time. I believe this announcement will provide the necessary resources to create geospatial data that will serve as a foundation for social and economic development. By improving productivity across sectors such as agriculture, natural resources, energy generation and distribution, rural and urban initiatives, and governance, this effort will drive meaningful progress. Investment in research and development fuels economic growth, improves quality of life, and shapes the future. Rs 20,000 crore investment to drive private sector-led R&D and innovation, funds for Deeptech research, 10,000 fellowships under the PM Research Fellowship Scheme, and Rs 500 crore investment for a CoE in AI for education, are transformative steps to make India more competitive at the global level in terms of innovation and IP creation. Overall, the budget has set strong grounds for equipping India with the skills and resources necessary to navigate the evolving global landscape and achieve its vision of being a technologically advanced and prosperous nation.""""FM has presented a game changer budget and one most important one in the last 8 years. From last couple of years industry have been candidly requesting FM to increase household consumption, we need to reduce taxes. This is a big boost for the consumer durable industry which has been struggling for the last two years. For the smart tv industry the government has taken unfavourable steps, by exempting basic custom duty only on open cell manufacturing. There are only one or two manufacturers in India which have bonding facilities, by this it will not be an equal playing field for other television manufacturers. The world is dependent on china for open cells and there are only 5 open cell manufacturers out of which 3 have their own retail brands, this policy will only be favourable for Chinese brands and other OEM brands which will manufacture in their plants. This step will definitely hurt Indian smart tv manufacturing plants and it will encourage grey market activities like under invoicing etc.""","The Union Budget 2025 received positive reactions from industry leaders. Many praised its focus on skilling, economic growth, fiscal prudence, and income tax relief measures. Various sectors expressed their approval of the provisions aimed at boosting growth, encouraging investment, and providing relief to the middle class.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117828879,imgsize-1562034,width-400,resizemode-4/117828879.jpg"

In 1999, Bill Gates , co-founder of Microsoft and one of the most influential technologists in history, authored a book titled. The book contained 15 bold predictions that at the time seemed almost too futuristic to come true. However, as the world has advanced over the past two decades, these predictions have not only materialised but have become integral to modern life.Bill Gates’ foresight, based on emerging technologies, offers a fascinating lens into how the digital revolution was shaping up, even before many of its most transformative tools existed, including cloud computing, e-commerce, and artificial intelligence.One of Gates' first predictions was the development of automated price-comparison tools. He foresaw a world where consumers could effortlessly compare prices across multiple websites to find the cheapest options for products and services. Today, this prediction is a reality with platforms like Google Shopping, PriceGrabber, and Honey, which streamline the shopping experience by providing price comparisons and discounts across industries.Gates envisioned small, portable devices that would enable constant connectivity, allowing people to check news, manage finances, and perform everyday tasks. This prediction perfectly describes today’s smartphones and tablets, which have become indispensable for modern communication, commerce, and information consumption. Devices like the iPhone, introduced in 2007, revolutionized how we interact with technology and turned Gates’ vision into a universal reality.According to Gates, people would manage their finances and communicate with doctors over the internet. Platforms such as PayPal, Venmo, and Google Pay have made instant online payments a standard part of life, while telemedicine apps like Teladoc and Practo allow patients to consult with doctors remotely. These innovations have not only simplified everyday life but have also democratized access to essential services.Another prediction involved ""personal companions"" that could sync all devices and help manage schedules, purchases, and data sharing. This concept is embodied in today’s digital assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. Integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT), these assistants control smart devices, streamline home management, and adapt to users’ needs, making daily routines more efficient.Gates anticipated the use of constant video feeds for home monitoring, a feature that has gained massive popularity through smart security systems like Ring and Nest. These systems allow homeowners to monitor their properties remotely, receive real-time alerts, and maintain peace of mind, showcasing how Gates’ vision has translated into practical solutions for home security.In 1999, Gates predicted private online spaces where friends and family could interact and plan events. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp have taken this concept even further, enabling people worldwide to connect, share, and communicate in real time.Gates foresaw software capable of analyzing travel plans and providing personalized promotional offers, discounts, and activity suggestions. Today, platforms like Expedia and TripAdvisor do exactly that, using AI algorithms to tailor recommendations based on user preferences and travel history.Gates imagined services that would allow real-time discussions during live sports broadcasts. Platforms like Twitter and specialized apps like ESPN and Hotstar have made this a reality, enabling fans to engage, predict outcomes, and even interact with commentators during live events.The concept of personalized advertising, which Gates predicted, is now a cornerstone of modern marketing. Platforms like Google and Facebook use advanced algorithms and user data to deliver ads tailored to individual preferences, maximizing their relevance and impact.Gates predicted that TV broadcasts would include links to related online content. This is evident in today’s streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, where viewers can access trailers, behind-the-scenes content, and even shop for items featured in their favorite shows.The prediction that the internet would host discussions on local and global issues has come true with platforms like Reddit, Quora, and city-specific forums. These sites provide spaces for users to share opinions and collaborate on topics ranging from local politics to global challenges.Gates foresaw online communities forming based on shared interests rather than geographical proximity. Platforms like LinkedIn, Pinterest, and niche forums have enabled people to connect with others who share their hobbies, passions, and professional goals.The idea of project managers finding skilled team members online has been realized through platforms like Trello, Asana, and Jira. These tools streamline team collaboration and project execution, making them essential for modern businesses.Gates predicted that job seekers would declare their skills and preferences online to find suitable employment. Platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed have turned this prediction into reality, revolutionizing how people search for and secure jobs.The final prediction envisioned companies bidding on projects or jobs through online platforms. Websites like Upwork and Freelancer have made this process seamless, connecting businesses with freelancers and specialized service providers to complete diverse projects efficiently.","In 1999, Bill Gates authored a book titled Business @ the Speed of Thought.

If a user was following the POTUS, VP, or First Lady accounts under Biden, they were automatically transitioned to the Trump administration’s corresponding accounts.

Potential technical issues – Meta has admitted that certain “bugs” may have caused irregularities in the transition process. Some users who were not following Biden’s official accounts may have inadvertently been added to Trump’s accounts due to a system error.

""People were not made to automatically follow any of the official Facebook or Instagram accounts for the President, Vice President, or First Lady. Those accounts are managed by the White House, so with a new administration, the content on those pages changes.""

Users unable to unfollow Donald Trump on Meta platforms—here’s why

Meta reintroduces politics to Facebook, Instagram, and Threads

A wave of confusion has swept across Instagram and Facebook users following the transition of the White House's social media accounts to the new administration. Many users have reported that they are now following President Donald J. Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and Vice President J.D. Vance, even though they had never signed up to do so. This unexpected change occurred the day after President Trump’s inauguration, prompting speculation and criticism.Meta , the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, explained that the transition is part of a standard process where official government accounts are handed over to the new administration while retaining their existing followers.However, some users claim they had never followed the official presidential accounts in the past, raising questions about whether they were automatically added without consent. Additionally, issues with unfollowing the accounts, along with changes in Meta’s algorithm promoting political content, have contributed to mounting frustration.The process of transferring White House social media accounts between administrations has been in place since President Barack Obama’s tenure. Since 2016, platforms like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) have implemented a system where official government accounts—such as those for the President, Vice President, and First Lady—are passed on to the incoming administration. This ensures continuity in government communications while retaining their existing followers.The same procedure was followed when President Joseph R. Biden Jr. took office in 2020, and it has now been repeated for President Trump’s administration in 2025. Users who were following the official presidential accounts under Biden’s tenure have automatically been switched to follow Trump’s administration’s accounts.However, many users claim they had never followed these accounts before, yet they now see Trump-related posts in their feeds. Meta has denied that it forcefully added followers but has acknowledged that some technical issues may have contributed to the confusion.Meta’s response to the situation has been twofold:Andy Stone, a Meta spokesperson, stated on Threads:Despite this clarification, many users remain skeptical, particularly those who are experiencing difficulties in unfollowing these accounts.Users attempting to unfollow Trump’s official accounts have reported being unable to do so, with some experiencing delays or errors when trying to remove themselves as followers. Meta has acknowledged this issue but has not provided a clear reason for the problem.The company has assured users that follow and unfollow requests should process correctly after some time, but the widespread reports of delays have fueled concerns about Meta’s handling of political content.Another significant change affecting users is Meta’s recent decision to reintegrate political content into its platforms. Previously, Meta reduced the visibility of political posts on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, aiming to create a less divisive and more positive user experience.However, in early 2025, CEO Mark Zuckerberg reversed this policy, stating that users had expressed interest in seeing more political content again. As a result, Meta’s algorithms now promote more political posts, including those from government accounts.This change may explain why users are suddenly seeing more posts from President Trump and Vice President Vance in their feeds, even if they do not actively engage with political content.Amid the ongoing controversy, some users have noticed that searching for certain political hashtags—such as ""#democrats""—yields limited or no results. This has led to accusations that Meta is suppressing content related to the Democratic Party while amplifying posts from the new Republican administration.Meta has denied any intentional bias, attributing the issue to an error affecting multiple topics, not just political ones. According to Andy Stone:Regardless of the explanation, this incident has fueled concerns over Meta’s role in shaping political discourse on social media.Meta’s handling of the White House transition, along with its broader changes to political content moderation, raises several important questions for users:","Some users have reported that they are now following President Donald J. Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and Vice President J.D. Vance, even though they had never signed up to do so.

WhatsApp says its users targeted by Israeli spyware: Read company’s response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-says-its-users-targeted-by-israeli-spyware-read-companys-response/articleshow/117796050.cms,"What WhatsApp has to say

WhatsApp parent company Meta has said that Israeli spyware firm Paragon Solutions has targeted approximately 90 of its users, including journalists and members of civil society organisations. The company claims that it has successfully disrupted the hacking operation.A WhatsApp official told news agency Reuters that the company has issued a cease-and-desist letter to Paragon following the discovery of the hacking attempt.The official disclosed that the company detected an effort to compromise roughly 90 user accounts on its platform, however, declined to provide specific details about the targeted individuals or their locations.The official also confirmed that the victims included an unspecified number of people involved in civil society work and media.The WhatsApp official refrained from elaborating on the methods used to attribute the hack to Paragon, stating only that law enforcement agencies and industry partners have been notified.The official stated that WhatsApp has successfully disrupted the hacking operation and is now working with the Canadian internet watchdog group Citizen Lab to provide support to the affected users.“WhatsApp is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users,” the company stated.“We will continue to protect people’s ability to communicate privately,” it added.John Scott-Railton, a researcher at Citizen Lab, commented on the discovery of the Paragon spyware targeting WhatsApp users.“This incident is a reminder that mercenary spyware continues to proliferate,” Scott-Railton said, “and as it does, we continue to see familiar patterns of problematic use.”Last month, WhatsApp secured a significant legal victory against Israeli spyware company NSO Group. A federal judge ruled that NSO is liable under both federal and California state law for a 2019 hacking incident that compromised the accounts of over 1,000 WhatsApp users.","WhatsApp parent company Meta has said that Israeli spyware firm Paragon Solutions has targeted approximately 90 of its users, including journalists and members of civil society organisations.

Why Meta chief AI scientist called DeepSeek’s advancements “woefully unjustified”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-meta-chief-ai-scientist-called-deepseeks-advancements-woefully-unjustified/articleshow/117795367.cms,"Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun

What made DeepSeek’s R1 model popular

Major misunderstanding about AI infrastructure investments:

Much of those billions are going into infrastructure for inference, not training.

Running AI assistant services for billions of people requires a lot of compute.

‘Cost will increase’

Once you put video understanding, reasoning, large-scale memory, and other capabilities in AI systems, inference costs are going to increase.

The only real question is whether users will be willing to pay enough (directly or not) to justify the capex and opex.

So, the market reactions to DeepSeek are woefully unjustified.

DeepSeek’s emergence sent ripples of concern through Silicon Valley, raising questions about the competitive landscape of the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence (AI) sector. However, Yann LeCun , Meta 's chief AI scientist, has cautioned against overreacting to the Chinese company’s emergence.DeepSeek recently unveiled a new AI model that, according to third-party benchmarks, outperforms existing models from industry giants like OpenAI and Meta, all while reportedly utilising less powerful hardware and a significantly smaller budget.This news triggered a tech sell-off this week, resulting in a staggering $1 trillion loss in market capitalisation, with Nvidia, a leading supplier of high-end AI chips, experiencing a near $600 billion decline – essentially questioning the need of pouring billions into AI development.In a Threads post, LeCun argued that the massive investments pouring into US AI companies are primarily driven by the need for inference capabilities, not just training. Inference, the process by which AI models apply their learned knowledge to new data, is crucial for powering generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT . As user demand increases, so does the need for inference processing, leading to higher costs.LeCun predicts that inference costs will continue to rise as AI systems become more sophisticated, incorporating features like video understanding, reasoning, and large-scale memory. He believes that the market's reaction to DeepSeek's advancements is “woefully unjustified.”Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently announced plans for over $60 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, earmarking funds for expanding its AI infrastructure and teams.","DeepSeek recently unveiled a new AI model that, according to third-party benchmarks, outperforms existing models from industry giants like OpenAI and Meta.

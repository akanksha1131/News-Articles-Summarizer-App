Apple, the other big winner of Google's win

Google on DoJ ruling

Google's parent company, Alphabet, led a monumental week for the tech sector, with its shares jumping more than 10% after a federal judge issued a remedy in its historic antitrust case that stopped short of the most severe penalties. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled on September 2 against the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) call for forced divestiture of key assets like the Chrome browser and the Android operating system. The decision sent a wave of relief through investors, propelling Alphabet’s stock up 8% in extended trading on Tuesday and over 10% for the week. The positive momentum helped push the combined market capitalization of the eight US trillion-dollar tech companies to $21 trillion, gaining a collective $420 billion in market cap this week alone. Of this, Google alone gained $230 billion-plus.Judge Mehta, who found Google guilty of maintaining an illegal monopoly in internet search last year, stated in his decision that the plaintiffs ""overreached"" in seeking to break up these core businesses.The federal court's decision also provided a significant boost to Apple. As the ruling allows the two tech giants -- Apple and Google -- to continue their multi-billion dollar agreement, which makes Google the default search engine on iPhones and other Apple devices.This development was a key factor in a strong week for both companies' stocks. Alphabet's shares rose more than 10%, while Apple's stock climbed 3.2%. Their performance helped propel the Nasdaq up by 1.1% for the week.Analysts at Wedbush Securities highlighted the positive market reaction in a recent note to investors. They said the court's decision ""removed a huge overhang"" for Alphabet and a ""black cloud worry"" for Apple. The analysts added that the ruling also ""lays the groundwork"" for a potential expansion of their partnership into artificial intelligence, specifically involving Google's Gemini AI models.In a blog post, Google said it has ""concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy"" but acknowledged that the court recognized the potential harm of a forced breakup. The DOJ, in a press release, said the ruling ""recognizes the need to prevent Google from using the same anticompetitive tactics for its GenAI products as it used to monopolize the search market.""The landmark antitrust trial began in September 2023. Judge Mehta has ordered the parties to meet by September 10 for the final judgment, officially closing a chapter in one of the most significant antitrust cases in modern U.S. history.","Google's parent company, Alphabet, led a monumental week for the tech sector.

Amazon-backed Showrunner using AI to recreate 'lost' part of this classic Hollywood movie,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-backed-showrunner-using-ai-to-recreate-lost-part-of-this-classic-hollywood-movie/articleshow/123769719.cms,"What Showrunner said about recreating missing parts of the Hollywood classic with AI



“In general, the estate has embraced AI technology to create a voice model intended to be used for VO work with brands. That said, this attempt to generate publicity on the back of Welles' creative genius is disappointing, especially as we weren't even given the courtesy of a heads up. While AI is inevitable, it still cannot replace the creative instincts resident in the human mind, which means this effort to make Ambersons whole will be a purely mechanical exercise without any of the uniquely innovative thinking or a creative force like Welles.”

Inbase Torque Review: Budget Speaker That Will Surprise You

An Amazon-backed AI firm, Showrunner, is using artificial intelligence (AI) to reconstruct the missing portion of a classic Hollywood movie. The company announced that it will use AI to recreate the lost 43 minutes of footage from the George Orson Welles-starrer 1942 classic film ""The Magnificent Ambersons."" The AI-generated part will compensate for the original footage which was burned by studio executives almost 60 years ago at that time of its initial release.According to a report by The Hollywood Reporter (THR), the Showrunner's project will combine AI with traditional film techniques. This includes using live actors and then applying face and pose transfer to preserve the likenesses of the original cast. Archived set photos from the movie will also be used to help rebuild the scenes.Showrunner has confirmed to THR that it will not commercialise the final product, as it does not hold the rights to the Welles film. However, the Welles estate has publicly opposed the project, though it has indicated that AI can be used for voiceover purposes in commercial ventures.In a statement to Variety, a spokesperson for the Welles estate said:The Magnificent Ambersons was Welles’ next project after Citizen Kane , which is often regarded as a landmark film. An older report from 2023 highlighted that the studio reduced Ambersons from 131 minutes to 88 minutes, leaving only 13 out of 73 scenes intact. The missing footage has since drawn strong interest from film enthusiasts eager to experience Welles’ original vision.","Amazon-backed AI firm, Showrunner, is using artificial intelligence (AI) to reconstruct the missing portion of a classic Hollywood movie.

What PubMatic CEO Rajeev Goel said about suing Google



“It felt like for many years, no matter how well we innovated, there was a barrier holding us back. That barrier wasn’t the limit of our technology. It was Google’s

illegal monopoly

. Every time we adapted or innovated, Google found new ways to stack the deck.”

Inbase Torque Review: Budget Speaker That Will Surprise You

US-based advertising exchange PubMatic has filed a lawsuit against Google, a report claims. The company has reportedly accused the Alphabet-owned tech giant of illegally monopolising the ad technology market and seeking billions of dollars in damages. This is the second time an ad exchange has sued Google since a federal judge ruled in April that the company had illegally monopolised ad exchanges and ad servers. A separate trial is scheduled for this month to determine whether Google should be forced to sell off parts of its advertising business due to its alleged illegal conduct. After filing the lawsuit, PubMatic CEO Rajeev Goel stated that the lawsuit is not just about money but about ensuring the proper functioning of online advertising markets.In a statement to Bloomberg, Goel said,PubMatic partners with websites to sell advertising, positioning itself as a competitor to Google Ad Manager (formerly DoubleClick). In testimony during Google’s antitrust trial last year, it was revealed that Google had considered acquiring PubMatic in 2011 but ultimately chose to buy the ad technology company AdMeld instead.Last week, European Union (EU) regulators fined Google €2.95 billion ($3.5 billion) for violating competition rules by favouring its own digital advertising services, marking the company’s fourth antitrust penalty in the EU.The European Commission also directed Google to end its self-preferencing practices and address potential conflicts of interest in the ad technology supply chain. Google called the decision “wrong” and announced plans to appeal, stating that the fine and required changes could negatively affect thousands of European businesses.Responding to the EU's fine on Google, US President Donald Trump criticised the decision as “unfair” and warned of potential retaliatory tariffs if the penalty is not withdrawn. On Truth Social, he stated that the €3.5 billion fine effectively takes money away from American investments and jobs, calling the move discriminatory against US companies.His comments come shortly after hosting a White House dinner with tech CEOs, including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, where Trump had congratulated Pichai on Google’s recent legal victory following a landmark antitrust ruling.","US-based advertising exchange PubMatic has filed a lawsuit against Google, a report claims.

How Startlink is planning to operate in India



“Even as LEO satellites beam connectivity directly to user terminals, Indian regulations mandate that all downlink traffic be stored and routed locally, This makes ground stations, data centres, and internet exchanges central to the satcom ecosystem. Starlink’s early tie-ups with fibre and data centre providers show it is gearing for scale.”

“The integration will be crucial for maintaining high-speed throughputs especially for latency-sensitive applications like streaming, video conferencing, and online gaming,”

What Nepalese government has to say on ban and protests



Google's Great Escape: How ChatGPT Saved the Tech Giant

Days after Nepal’s government blocked 26 unregistered social media platforms, including Facebook, YouTube and X (formerly Twitter), at least 10 protesters have been killed and 87 injured in Nepal’s capital following protests that erupted on Monday (September 8). Police used rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons to disperse a massive crowd, a report said, adding that the demonstrators demanded an end to the ban on several social media platforms.According to news agency AFP, the ban on 26 social media platforms left millions of users ""angry and confused."" As a crowd of young demonstrators swelled in Kathmandu, they pushed into a restricted area near the parliament building. The situation escalated into violence when police baton-charged the protesters. Some demonstrators managed to breach a security wall to enter the parliament premises, prompting a curfew in key areas of the city.While the social media ban was the initial spark, many protesters told the news agency that their anger runs deeper.“We were triggered by the social media ban, but that's not the only reason we are gathered here,” said a 24-year-old student. He and others highlighted institutionalised corruption as the core issue. Another 20-year-old protester expressed a desire for a generational change, stating she was demonstrating against the government's “authoritarian attitude.”In a statement, the government claimed it respects freedom of expression but requires platforms to register and comply with regulations. The recent ban was a direct result of a Supreme Court order issued in September of last year.Nepal has a history of restricting online platforms; the government previously banned the Telegram messaging app and briefly blocked TikTok before lifting the ban when the company agreed to comply with local regulations.","At least 10 protesters have been killed and 87 injured in Nepal’s capital.

Industry titans clash over AI's job market impact

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has doubled down on his stark prediction that artificial intelligence will eliminate entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, reinforcing warnings that previously sparked fierce debate across the technology sector. In a recent BBC Radical interview, Amodei specifically targeted roles in law firms, consulting, administration, and finance as most vulnerable to AI displacement.The CEO emphasized that his timeline of one to five years isn't speculative but reflects current AI capabilities that are ""already very good at"" entry-level work and ""quickly getting better now."" He pointed to first-year law associates doing document review as prime examples of repetitive-but-variable tasks that AI can efficiently handle.Amodei revealed that many CEOs he speaks with privately view AI as a way to reduce headcount rather than simply augment human workers. ""A large fraction of them would like to be able to use it to cut costs to employ less people,"" he told BBC Radical, contradicting public narratives about AI enhancing rather than replacing human capabilities.His comments echo earlier statements to Axios in May, where he predicted AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level office jobs within five years, potentially driving unemployment to 10-20%. He also warned in March that AI could write 90% of software code within months and ""essentially all"" of it within a year.These predictions have created significant controversy within the tech industry. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang publicly dismissed Amodei's outlook at VivaTech in Paris, disagreeing with ""almost everything"" the Anthropic chief said and predicting AI would transform rather than eliminate jobs. OpenAI 's Sam Altman similarly argued that society wouldn't allow mass job displacement and that new roles would emerge.However, opinions remain divided. While Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff sees no evidence of an imminent jobs crisis, Ford CEO Jim Farley has predicted AI will replace ""literally half"" of US white-collar workers, aligning more closely with Amodei's warnings.","Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicts AI will eliminate entry-level white-collar jobs within five years.

The newly proposed award is roughly 18 times the size of the 2018 pay package.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company said that “traditional compensation packages granted to executives at other companies were determined to not be appropriate for designing Mr. Musk’s incentive compensation.”Notably, the new pay package comes with a condition – 10 million active FSD subscriptions for Tesla and 1 million Tesla robotaxis on the road. FSD, as explained in the SEC filing “means an advanced driving system, regardless of the marketing name used, that is capable of performing transportation tasks that provide autonomous or similar functionality under specified driving conditions”.Tesla’s FSD program is under growing legal scrutiny. A California judge recently allowed a class-action lawsuit to move forward, with plaintiffs accusing Tesla of making misleading claims about FSD’s capabilities. The company also faces an investor lawsuit after concerns about safety incidents during its June robotaxi launch in Texas.Despite these challenges, Tesla has expanded its robotaxi operations in Austin, with vehicles now operating on highways under the supervision of safety drivers. The company also rolled out its Robotaxi app on Apple App Store.","Tesla has reportedly updated the description of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package on its website.

What else might Apple announce?



Apple's biggest product launch of the year – the unveiling of new iPhones and more – is set for September 9. The Cupertino giant is highly expected to reveal the iPhone 17 series at the ""Awe Dropping"" event, marking a significant departure from recent iPhone designs. The iPhone 17 lineup will include four models – iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air , iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max – alongside new Apple Watches and AirPods. Here's everything we know about Apple's upcoming hardware showcase.Apple's ""Awe Dropping"" event begins on Tuesday, September 9, at 1 PM ET/10 AM PT. The keynote will be livestreamed on Apple's website, YouTube channel, and Apple TV app. The event takes place at Apple Park's Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California.The cryptic ""Awe Dropping"" tagline, combined with an interactive heat-map-style Apple logo on the invitation, has sparked speculation about everything from improved thermal management to new temperature sensing features. However, the phrase is likely a play on ""jaw-dropping,"" emphasising the significant design changes coming to this year's iPhone lineup.The standout device of this year's lineup is expected to be the all-new iPhone 17 Air, Apple's thinnest smartphone ever. At approximately 5.5 millimeters thick, the iPhone 17 Air would be roughly a third thinner than the current iPhone 16 Pro, representing Apple's boldest design shift in years.The iPhone 17 Air is rumoured to feature a 6.6-inch display with ProMotion support and Dynamic Island technology. However, the ultra-thin design comes with notable compromises – the device is expected to have only a single 48-megapixel rear camera housed in a pill-shaped bump, similar to Google Pixel's camera bar design.Inside, the iPhone 17 Air will reportedly run on Apple's new A19 processor and include the company's first in-house Wi-Fi chip and C1 modem. The slim profile means no physical SIM card slot, requiring users to rely entirely on eSIM technology. Despite early concerns about battery life due to the thin design, recent reports suggest Apple has managed to bring battery performance in line with current iPhone models.Pricing for the iPhone 17 Air is expected to start around $900, positioning it between the base iPhone 17 and the Pro models. Colour options may include black, silver, gold, and a new light blue finish borrowed from the M4 MacBook Air.The base iPhone 17 won't receive a dramatic redesign but will get meaningful upgrades under the hood. The most significant change is the addition of ProMotion 120Hz display technology, marking the first time a non-Pro iPhone will feature variable refresh rates for smoother scrolling and improved responsiveness.The iPhone 17 is also expected to have a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen, matching the size of the iPhone 17 Pro, up from the 6.1-inch display of previous base models. Like the iPhone 17 Air, it will be powered by the new A19 processor.Storage options are expected to remain consistent with previous generations – 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. The camera system will likely retain the dual-camera setup with a 48-megapixel main sensor and 12-megapixel ultrawide camera.Colour options for the iPhone 17 may include pink, green, blue, white, and black. Pricing is anticipated to start at $800, maintaining the same entry point as the iPhone 16.While the Pro models won't undergo the dramatic thinning of the Air variant, they're set to receive the most comprehensive design refresh since the iPhone 12 Pro half a decade ago. The most noticeable change will be a complete redesign of the rear camera system, featuring a camera bar that spans the entire top third of the device.In a surprising move, Apple is reportedly switching from titanium back to aluminium for the Pro models' frames. This change should make the devices lighter and improve heat dissipation, addressing overheating concerns that have plagued recent Pro models.The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will be powered by the new A19 Pro processor and feature significantly improved camera systems. The telephoto lens is expected to jump from 12 megapixels to 48 megapixels, enhancing digital zoom capabilities. Other camera improvements include a new variable aperture system, simultaneous front-and-back video recording, and major upgrades to the selfie camera.Both Pro models will continue to offer 6.3-inch (Pro) and 6.9-inch (Pro Max) displays with ProMotion technology. The devices are expected to come in silver, black, navy blue, and a new orange color option.Pricing for the Pro models is expected to remain consistent with previous generations – $1,099 for the iPhone 17 Pro and $1,199 for the iPhone 17 Pro Max.Apple's Pro earbuds are finally getting their first major update since 2022. The AirPods Pro 3 are expected to include several health-focused features, most notably heart rate monitoring capabilities similar to those found in the Powerbeats Pro 2.The new AirPods Pro will reportedly feature significantly smaller charging cases with a new pairing mechanism that eliminates the physical pairing button, following the design changes introduced with the AirPods 4. A major software feature will be live translation capabilities, allowing real-time conversation translation. The newer Pro AirPods may also get an upgraded H3 chip for better performance and potentially new temperature sensing capabilities.After taking a year off from major Ultra updates, Apple is reportedly planning significant improvements for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. The rugged smartwatch is expected to feature a larger display that matches or exceeds the Apple Watch Series 10's screen size, along with a new S11 chip for improved performance.The biggest addition may be satellite connectivity, allowing users to send text messages and access emergency communications when cellular and Wi-Fi aren't available. The Ultra 3 will also support 5G RedCap connectivity through a new modem, potentially improving battery life while maintaining fast data speeds.The Apple Watch Series 11 likely won't represent a dramatic departure from the Series 10's design, which was considered a major redesign within Apple. Instead, expect refined improvements including a brighter display, new color options to replace problematic finishes like Jet Black, and the same S11 processor as the Ultra 3.Apple's most affordable smartwatch, currently priced at $249, is due for its first major update since 2022. The Apple Watch SE is expected to receive a newer display technology and faster processor, while maintaining its role as Apple's entry-level wearable and smartphone alternative for children.While Apple has been working on advanced health features like hypertension detection for years, regulatory and engineering challenges continue to delay their release. However, Apple is reportedly planning to launch a paid Health+ service next year, which may include an AI-powered health agent.The usual software updates — iOS 17, and more — are expected to drop the very next day of the event. Then, Apple is expected to introduce new iPhone accessories, including revamped cases after the poorly received FineWoven fabric cases. The company may debut ""TechWoven"" cases as a replacement, along with a new bumper-style case specifically designed for the thin iPhone 17 Air. A premium cross-body strap accessory is also rumoured.","Apple's biggest product launch of the year – the unveiling of new iPhones and more – is set for September 9.

Red Sea cables cut: Systems impacted



Undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea disrupted internet services across multiple regions including India, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the UAE. These cuts have slowed down connectivity and increased delays, particularly affecting cloud and network service. Microsoft announced via a status website that the Mideast “may experience increased latency due to undersea fiber cuts in the Red Sea.” The software giant, in a further update, said that Azure services in the Middle East are back online.The Red Sea is a critical telecommunications route, connecting Europe to Africa and Asia via Egypt. As per reports, almost 17% of the world’s internet data flows through this route, meaning any disruption can have wide-ranging consequences.According to a Bloomberg report, fixing undersea cables in the region is challenging, especially with ongoing Houthi attacks on ships in the area.According to an AP report, undersea cables can be cut by anchors dropped from ships, but can also be targeted in attacks. The latest cuts to the lines come as Yemen’s Houthi rebels remain locked in a series of attacks targeting Israel over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Israel has responded with airstrikes, including one that killed top leaders within the rebel movement.Moammar al-Eryani, the information minister with Yemen’s internationally recognized government that opposes the Houthis and is based in southern Yemen, issued a statement saying the cable cuts “cannot be isolated from the series of direct attacks carried out by the Houthi militia.”“What is happening today in the Red Sea should serve as a wake-up call for the international community, which must take a firm stance to stop these escalating threats and protect the digital infrastructure that serves as the lifeline of the modern world,” al-Eryani said, as reported by AP.As per reports, impacted regions include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and India. In a statement, Pakistan Telecommunications Co. Ltd., a telecommunication giant in the country, noted that the cuts had taken place. in Kuwait, authorities also said the FALCON GCX cable running through the Red Sea had been cut, causing disruptions in the small, oil-rich nation.According to network monitoring company NetBlocks, the outages are attributed to failures affecting the SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.In a post shared on the social media site Mastodon, NetBlocks wrote: “A series of subsea cable outages in the Red Sea has degraded internet connectivity in multiple countries, including #Pakistan and #India; the incident is attributed to failures affecting the SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.”SMW4 or South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe 4 cable is run by Tata Communications, while IMEWE is run by another consortium overseen by Alcatel Submarine Networks.“Meanwhile, similar internet disruptions have been observed on Etilasat and Du networks in the United Arab Emirates, resulting in slow speeds and intermittent access as engineers work to resolve the issue impacting multiple countries,” NetBlocks later updated.","Undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea disrupted internet services across multiple regions including India, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the UAE.

Paramount CEO David Ellison to employees in internal memo: Return to office or find a new job,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/paramount-ceo-david-ellison-to-employees-in-internal-memo-return-to-office-or-find-a-new-job/articleshow/123759391.cms,"What Paramount CEO’s memo to employees say

Job cuts at Paramount

Google's Great Escape: How ChatGPT Saved the Tech Giant

Paramount CEO David Ellison has sent an internal memo to staff, asking them to return to office five days a week starting January 5, 2026. The memo, obtained by CNBC says that employees who do not wish to make the transition can seek a buyout which remains live until September 15. Ellison, the founder and CEO of Skydance Media, became Paramount CEO last month after an $8 billion merger deal. Since acquiring the office, Ellison has informed employees to efficiency changes coming at the company and the latest return to office is part of his efforts to “unlock Paramount’s full potential”.In the first phase, employees in Los Angeles and New York will return to a full five-day office schedule starting next year. While the second phase will cover offices outside of LA and New York, including those overseas. In 2026, workers in these locations will also be offered a similar buyout program, the CNBC report says.As quoted by a CNBC report, the memo states:“To achieve what we’ve set out to do — and to truly unlock Paramount’s full potential — we must make meaningful changes that position us for long-term success. These changes are about building a stronger, more connected, and agile organization that can deliver on our goals and compete at the highest level. We have a lot to accomplish and we’re moving fast. We need to all be rowing in the same direction. And especially when you’re dealing with a creative business like ours, that begins with being together in person.”“We recognize this represents a significant change for many, and we’re committed to supporting you throughout this transition,” Ellison wrote. “We will work closely with managers to ensure you have the time and flexibility to make the necessary adjustments.”The US media conglomerate, as reported by Variety, is planning to cut between 2,000-3,000 jobs as part of its postmerger cost-cutting measures. As per the report, these job cuts are slated for early November this year. The company is looking to take $2 billion in costs amid advertising losses and industrywide struggles with traditional cable networks.","Paramount CEO David Ellison sent an internal memo to staff, asking them to return to office five days a week starting January 5, 2026.

Geoffrey Hinton , also known as Godfather of AI, recently revealed that he was once dumped by a girlfriend who used AI to end their relationship. In an interview with Financial Times, Hinton said his ex-girlfriend asked the AI chatbot to explain why he had been a “rat”. The AI bot then generated a response criticizing the Noble prize winner’s behaviour. “She got the chatbot to explain how awful my behaviour was and gave it to me,” he told FT.The 76-year-old computer scientist added that he did not agree with the chatbot’s description. “I didn't think I had been a rat, so it didn't make me feel too bad. I met somebody I liked more, you know how it goes,” he said.Should one use AI models like ChatGPT for relationship problemsThe incident highlights how AI is finding its way into everyday life. From writing emails to helping with routine tasks — and even being used to deliver a breakup — AI is becoming a growing part of how people communicate.Notably, ChatGPT-parent company OpenAI has issued guidelines asking users not to unload their relationship problems to the AI chatbot. In August, the company announced a series of changes its rolling out to ChatGPT to better support users during difficult times.""When you ask something like 'Should I break up with my boyfriend?' ChatGPT shouldn't give you an answer,"" the company said in a statement about the changes. ""It should help you think it through—asking questions, weighing pros and cons. New behavior for high-stakes personal decisions is rolling out soon.""Hinton recently sounded an alarm about the technology’s potential for harm. The recent public frenzy over AI tools like ChatGPT has caused Hinton to shift from accelerating AI development to raising deep concerns about its future. He now believes that AI poses a grave threat to humanity, saying that the technology can help any person to create a nuclear bomb. Hinton described a chilling scenario where AI could enable an average person to create a bioweapon.“A normal person assisted by AI will soon be able to build bioweapons and that is terrible,” he said, adding, “Imagine if an average person in the street could make a nuclear bomb.”",Geoffrey Hinton revealed that he was once dumped by a girlfriend who used AI to end their relationship.

OpenAI-backed AI movie to debut at Cannes

Critterz enters production

Google's Great Escape: How ChatGPT Saved the Tech Giant

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is reportedly lending its tools and computing sources to produce a feature-length animated movie made by artificial intelligence (AI). According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the movie is called ‘Critterz’ and is the brain child of Chad Nelson, a creative specialist at OpenAI. It is about forest creatures who go on an adventure after their village is disrupted by a stranger. As per the WSJ report, the movie is being produced in collaboration with London-based Vertigo Films and California-based studio Native Foreign which specializes in AI-enchanced content.As per the report, the movie has a budget of less than $30 million, far less than what animated films typically cost. It is likely to make its debut at the Cannes Film Festival.“OpenAI can say what its tools do all day long, but it’s much more impactful if someone does it,” Nelson said. “That’s a much better case study than me building a demo.”James Richardson, co-founder of London-based Vertigo Films said that the team is aiming to make the movie in about nine months instead of the three years it would typically take.The script for Critterz was written by some of the same writers behind Paddington in Peru. Production has already begun, and casting for voice roles will be decided in the coming weeks.The project, as mentioned above, is funded by Vertigo’s parent company, Paris-based Federation Studios. Around 30 people are working on the film, and the studios are creating a profit-sharing model so they can share in any earnings, according to Nelson.OpenAI hopes that if Critterz succeeds, it will prove AI can create content strong enough for the big screen and speed up Hollywood’s adoption of the technology. “The film reflects the kind of creativity and exploration we love to encourage,” an OpenAI spokesman said.","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is reportedly lending its tools and computing sources to produce a feature-length animated movie made by artificial intelligence (AI) The movie is called ‘Critterz’ and is the brain child of Chad Nelson, a creative specialist at OpenAI.

Work-life balance through passion

Google's Great Escape: How ChatGPT Saved the Tech Giant

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has an unusual Sunday ritual that played a key role in shaping the success of AI voice technology firm SoundHound, its founder Keyvan Mohajer has revealed. In an interview with Fortune, Mohajer said that nearly a decade ago, Huang began sending Mohajer research papers with notes on Sunday mornings, expecting detailed feedback. The routine, Mohajer said, not only pushed him to sharpen his ideas but also influenced SoundHound’s growth into a $5.4 billion company.“It’s been one of the good things in my life to cross paths with Jensen and Nvidia,” Mohajer told Fortune. “He had a passion for what’s the next big thing, and he became very interested in our field.”Keyvan Mohajer, who first launched SoundHound in 2004 from his Stanford dorm room, met Jensen Huang about 10 years ago. What began as a chance encounter turned into a long-term relationship that combined mentorship, tough assignments, and inspiration.On several weekends, Huang would personally share technical research and ask for responses. “I had to read it and give my feedback,” Mohajer recalled.The commitment impressed Huang, who later backed SoundHound both personally and through Nvidia. By 2022, SoundHound had gone public, and Nvidia purchased around 1.73 million shares in the company the following year.“He’s an amazing person, engineer and leader,” Mohajer said. “Our relationship with him has been great.”Mohajer said his passion for building SoundHound blurred the lines between personal life and work. “Work-life balance is not a problem because I really enjoy it,” he explained. “If you work to live, then work-life balance is a big question… but in my case, I really enjoy my work.”The SoundHound chief described waking up before 5 a.m. to get what he called his “golden hours” of productivity. Even while doing household chores or exercising, he said, ideas for work often flowed naturally.“I do spend a lot of hours working. And even sometimes I go wash dishes and I’m still thinking about my work,” Mohajer said. “That can be therapeutic, and it can give you really good ideas.”","Keyvan Mohajer, founder of SoundHound, met Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang about 10 years ago.

A philosophy of impact



Accenture CEO Julie Sweet is one of the most influential executives in global business. Recently, Sweet shared a pivotal moment which led her to leave a high-powered legal career and join the consulting giant. In an interview with Fortune, Sweet talked about her mid-life leap which she took at the age of 42. She revealed that one line from the former Accenture CEO Bill Green helped her seal the deal. ““He said, ‘I’m not looking for a lawyer… I’m looking for a business leader with legal experience.’ And I just fell for it — hook, line, and sinker,” Sweet recalled.At that time, Sweet was working as a partner in an elite law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore and she had a clear career path ahead. But after the death of her father, she found herself open to change. A headhunter’s call led to a meeting with Green, whose charisma and vision reframed her understanding of what her career could be.Sweet’s decision to join Accenture as the general counsel turned out to be a dramatic shift. She had never before run a business, but the way Green framed the role— as a leadership opportunity, not just a legal one — resonated deeply. “That’s what I want to be,” Sweet said. “A business leader.”She worked hard and all the way to the top. Within a few years, Sweet rose through ranks and then became the CEO of the company in 2019. Today, she oversees a 770,000-person workforce and advises more Fortune 500 CEOs than almost anyone else in the industry.Sweet reveals that the passing of her father acted as a catalyst for reevaluating her path. “I absolutely love Accenture,” she said. “It’s an amazing company.

From celebrity bots to DIY AI studio



After the aggrieves AI talent recruitment spree, now it appears that Meta is ramping up its investment in AI-powered chatbots . The company is reportedly hiring US-based contractors to help develop culturally tailored digital personas for its key markets such as India, Indonesia and Mexico.

Court tells Cognizant you cannot use your logo in India; company responds: We strongly believe ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/court-tells-cognizant-you-cannot-use-your-logo-in-india-cognizant-responds-we-strongly-believe-/articleshow/123752725.cms,"Trademark clash over honeycomb design



Cognizant pushes back



Cognizant and its legal troubles



In a major legal setback to IT giant Cognisant, the Bombay High Court has ordered the company to stop using its logo in India, following a trademark infringement suit filed by a Bengaluru-based fintech firm Atyati Technologies . The court has reinstated an earlier injunction, ruling that Cognisant must refrain from displaying the contested logo until the case is resolved. In compliance with the court’s order, Cognizant has removed its logo from its Indian website. Along with this, the company has also removed the logo from various social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube and X (formerly known as Twitter). Instead of the logo, the company is displaying its name all the above mentioned channels.The legal dispute between Cognizant and Atyati Technologies revolves around a hexagonal honeycomb-style logo which Atyati claims it has used since 2019. The firm alleges that Cognizant used the similar design in 2022 which caused confusion among consumers.The latest ruling to the High Court overturns a June 2024 decision which has temporarily allowed Cognizant to continue using the logo. The March 2024 injunction now remains in effect during the pendency of the case.As per a report by Economic Times, in a statement Cognizant said that it is complying to the court’s order but it still has confidence in its legal position. “We are complying with the Order of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court. We are doing so while we consider our options for redress,” a company spokesperson said. “We strongly believe that our actions have been lawful and appropriate, and we are confident that the legal process will affirm our position and deliver a just outcome.”Cognizant has faced multiple legal disputes in the recent years. The company has been accused of employee poaching and alleged intellectual property violations . In September 2023, Cognizant hired a former Wipro CFO Jatin Dalal. This action of the IT giant prompted Wipro to sue him for breaching a non-compete clause and seeking Rs 25.1 crore in damages. The matter was later settled, with Cognizant covering Rs 4.2 crore of Dalal’s costs, including legal fees.A similar dispute arose in December 2023 when Wipro’s former healthcare head, Mohd Ehteshamul Haque, joined Cognizant as chief commercial officer for the Americas. That case was also settled, though details were not disclosed.Separately, Cognizant is engaged in an ongoing high-profile conflict with Infosys, which has accused it of misusing software trade secrets to build a competing healthcare product. Infosys even named Cognizant CEO S Ravi Kumar in its filings.Cognizant has denied all the allegations. In May 2025, a Dallas court directed both companies to resolve disagreements over the scope of information exchange before the trial proceeds.","The Bombay High Court has ordered Cognizant to stop using its logo in India.

This week in the world of technology, Samsung expanded its smartphone and tablet range with the launch of Galaxy S25 FE and Galaxy Tab S11 series. US President Donald Trump hosted a dinner at White House where he invited tech CEOs including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . These and more in top tech news of the weekNepal has imposed a ban on all the popular social media platform. Nepal has ordered the internet service providers to block access to all 26 major social media and communication platforms including Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter), LinkedIn, Reddit, WhatsApp and Snapchat. The government took this decision after all the companies failed to register with the government within a seven-day deadline.The move of banning the social media platforms comes after the Supreme Court directive in a contempt of court case, which instructed the government to ensure all domestic and foreign-origin online platforms register with authorities before operating in the country and to monitor unwanted content.Samsung has expanded its Galaxy S25 series with the launch of Galaxy S25 FE smartphone. The smartphone offers multiple AI editing tools like Generative Edit and Instant Slow-mo while an upgraded 12MP front-facing camera, powered by AI-powered ProVisual Engine, introduces an enhanced selfie experience. A 4,900mAh battery and a more than 10% larger vapor chamber promise to offer smooth, responsive performance with 45W wired charging support. Samsung Galaxy S25 FE comes in Icyblue, Jetblack, Navy, and White colour options. The price of the smartphone starts at $649.99 (Rs. 57,290 approx.)

The company is reportedly laying off thousands of employees across various regions. As reported by DataCenter Dynamics, an industry insider publication, Oracle has fired more than 3000 employees. The layoffs which started in August have now been spread across multiple regions and businesses. As per the report, the fresh round of layoffs have affected employees in US, India, Philippines, Canada and parts of Europe.In a bizarre case which sounds like an episode from a comedy show, an Indiana based bankruptcy lawyer named Mark S. Zuckerberg has filed a lawsuit against Meta and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg after years of his Facebook accounts being wrongly suspended for “impersonating” the billionaire tech founder.As reported by TechCrunch, the attorney, who has been practising law since a long before Facebook existed, said that Meta’s automated moderation systems have repeatedly flagged both his personal and business accounts as fake. His commercial Facebook page, which is used to advertise his legal services has been disabled by the company for five times in the past eight years.In one 2020 email to Meta, the lawyer vented his frustration with the touch of humour: “If you happen to run into the younger, richer Mark Zuckerberg, tell him I said hi and he causes me great aggravation each day.""President Donald Trump hosted a dinner at White House where he invited tech CEOs. More than two dozen major tech leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Google founder Sergey Brin and Oracle CEO Safra Catz.As big as the chatter about the CEOs of the biggest technology companies of America attending the dinner, was also the chatter of Tesla CEO's absence. The media was abuzz about the notable absence of Elon Musk, once a close ally of Trump who was tasked with running the Department of Government Efficiency, from the guest list. Musk had a public breakup with Donald Trump earlier this year.However, it seems Elon Musk was invited to the White House dinner. Tesla CEO confirmed the same in a post on Twitter.OpenAI rival Anthropic has updated its terms of service prohibiting sales of its AI platform Claude services to companies in China, Russia, North Korea and other regions “due to legal, regulatory, and security risks.” In an official blog, the AI company backed by Amazon said that firms based in authoritarian countries like China may be forced by law to share data, work with intelligence agencies, or take other steps that could pose national security risks. “These requirements make it difficult for companies to resist these pressures regardless of where they operate or of the personal preferences of the individuals at those companies,” it added.Flipkart has announced that its Big Billion Days Sale 2025 will begin on September 23, setting the stage for one of the biggest online shopping events of the year. The announcement comes as Amazon has also confirmed its Great Indian Festival Sale for the same day, creating direct competition between the two e-commerce giants.

Shark Tank Star and billionaire investor Mark Cuban has shared an advice for young professionals, especially GenZ saying they should concentrate on customizing AI models and showcase their advantages to businesses. According to a Fortune report, the billionaire told TBPN during an interview that young individuals must emphasize on the importance of mastering AI implementation. ""Learn all you can about AI, but learn more on how to implement them in companies,"" Mark Cuban said.During the interview, he also urged Generation Z to use their free time to learn artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as OpenAI ’s Sora and Google ’s Veo, saying they could unlock major job opportunities.Mark Cuban noted that many small businesses do not have budgets or experts for AI, creating space for tech-savvy graduates to fill the gap. “If you understand how to use these tools, you’ll put yourself in a position to help businesses that can’t afford their own AI staff,” he said.Mark Cuban compared the rise of AI to earlier workplace revolutions. He said the technology will soon become as essential as email or Excel, and warned that people not using AI for efficiency and decision-making will fall behind.Other industry leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have also highlighted AI’s competitive edge, encouraging businesses and individuals to adopt it.The growing role of AI in the workplace has sparked debate on its impact on jobs. While some fear automation could replace workers, others see AI as a productivity booster. For example, customer service company Alorica has used AI tools without cutting staff.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has also suggested that AI can take on tasks often given to interns, giving Gen Z an opportunity to treat AI as a workplace ally rather than a threat. “AI opens up new opportunities and challenges traditional job roles,” Altman has said.",Billionaire investor and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has shared an advice for young professionals.

Geoffrey Hinton on leaving Google

Geoffrey Hinton , often called the “godfather of AI,” warned that artificial intelligence will trigger “massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits,” further deepening inequality between the rich and the poor. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, the Nobel Prize winner and former Google scientist said AI will be used by the wealthy to cut jobs and maximize profits.“What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” Hinton said. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.”During the interview, Geoffrey Hinton said industries that rely on routine tasks will be hardest hit, while highly skilled roles and healthcare could benefit. “If you could make doctors five times as efficient, we could all have five times as much health care for the same price,” he said in an earlier interview.Hinton also dismissed OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s idea of a universal basic income , arguing it “won’t deal with human dignity” or replace the sense of value people get from work.A survey from the New York Fed recently found that companies using AI are more likely to retrain workers than fire them, though layoffs are expected to rise.Hinton reiterated concerns about AI’s risks, saying there is a 10% to 20% chance of the technology wiping out humanity after the emergence of superintelligence . He also warned AI could be misused to create bioweapons, adding that while China is taking the threat seriously, the Trump administration has resisted tighter regulation.“We don’t know what is going to happen, we have no idea, and people who tell you what is going to happen are just being silly,” he said. “We are at a point in history where something amazing is happening, and it may be amazingly good, and it may be amazingly bad.”Geoffrey Hinton also explained why he left Google in 2023, rejecting reports that he quit to speak more freely about AI’s risks. “I left because I was 75, I could no longer program as well as I used to, and there’s a lot of stuff on Netflix I haven’t had a chance to watch,” he said.While he mostly uses AI for research, Hinton admitted OpenAI’s ChatGPT even played a role in his personal life. He revealed that a former girlfriend used the chatbot “to tell me what a rat I was” during their breakup.“I didn’t think I had been a rat, so it didn’t make me feel too bad,” he quipped.","Geoffrey Hinton, often called the “godfather of AI,” warned that artificial intelligence will trigger “massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits” Hinton said industries that rely on routine tasks will be hardest hit, while highly skilled roles and healthcare could benefit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123746065,imgsize-27466,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-godfather-geoffrey-hinton.jpg"

Made in India Space Chip: Vikram-32 Explained

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg invested $14.3 billion in ScaleAI to gain critical access to foundational AI infrastructure and high-quality labeled data, which is essential for training advanced AI models and accelerating its development in the AI race against competitors like Google and OpenAI. However, that very data seems to be a problem at the company’s new “superintelligence” lab, and reportedly one of the reasons why there has been an exodus of AI talent from the company.According to a report by Tech Crunch, Meta’s TBD Labs, its cutting-edge AI research division, is facing significant issues with the quality of its training data from its primary partner, Scale AI. Despite a multi-billion dollar investment from Meta, researchers within the lab are turning to rival data vendors, highlighting a growing problem with the information used to train Meta's next-generation AI models.Citing sources familiar with the matter, the report said that TBD Labs is now working with other third-party data-labeling vendors, including Mercor and Surge. While it's common for AI labs to use multiple vendors, the situation is notable because Meta has invested so heavily in Scale AI.The core of the problem lies in the shift from simple to complex data. Scale AI built its business on a crowdsourcing model that used a large, low-cost workforce for basic data labeling—the process of tagging and annotating raw information.However, as AI models have become more sophisticated, they now require highly skilled experts, such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists, to generate the high-quality data needed for training. It appears that Scale AI's data is not meeting these new, more demanding standards.Meanwhile, data aside, a report leadership chaos at the company is also seen as a reason why – after hiring AI talents for millions from Google, OpenAI, Apple and others – the Facebook parent company is purportedly struggling to launch a sophisticated AI model.","Report: Meta's cutting-edge AI research division is facing significant issues with the quality of its training data from its primary partner, Scale AI.

Moody's warns that many US States showing recession signs

Recession 'warning sign' in the US Jobs report

Another US is close to Recession warning has come, this time from ark Zandi, chief economist at credit rating agency Moody's. A new analysis of state-level data suggests that the US economy is ""on the edge of recession,"" said Mark Zandi of Moody's. Zandi, a respected economist who was one of the first to forecast the 2008 financial crisis, warns that states accounting for nearly a third of the nation’s economic output are either already in a downturn or are at high risk of entering one.""Based on my assessment of various data, states making up nearly a third of US GDP are either in or at high risk of recession, another third are just holding steady, and the remaining third are growing,"" Zandi wrote on social media.The economic pressure is expected to directly impact everyday Americans in two key ways: higher prices and job instability. In a recent interview, Zandi noted that rising costs will soon become impossible to ignore, especially for essential items. ""Prices are already rising; you can see it in the data, but they're going to rise to a degree that it will be impossible for people to ignore,"" he said.Zandi's assessment points to several factors, including sluggish consumer spending, which has seen its weakest growth since the 2008-09 financial crisis. He also raised concerns about the impact of US tariffs on company profits and continued struggles in the housing market.The data reveals a mixed picture across the country. States in the South are generally the strongest, though their growth is beginning to slow. Meanwhile, some of the nation's largest economies, like California and New York, are described as ""holding their own,"" and their stability is seen as critical to preventing a full-blown national recession.However, many states are showing signs of vulnerability. Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Kansas, and Massachusetts were all identified as being at high risk of recession. The broader Washington, D.C. area is also notable for its economic struggles, which Zandi attributes to government job cuts.Adding to the forecast, Zandi predicts that the annual inflation rate, currently at 2.7%, could rise to nearly 4% within the next year, further eroding purchasing power for consumers.The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recently revised down its employment estimates for May and June by a total of 2,58,000 jobs. Following the revisions, the jobs report revealed the slowest three-month hiring pace since the pandemic-induced recession of 2020.The average monthly job growth in 2025 has dropped to just 85,000 — significantly below the pre-pandemic average of 177,000. While this slowdown doesn't confirm a recession, experts say that it adds to a growing list of concerning indicators, including weaker GDP, slower manufacturing, and declining services sector activity.","Moody's warns that nearly a third of the nation’s economic output are either already in a downturn or are at high risk of entering one.

Read Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s full remarks:



Mrs. Trump, Director Kratsios, esteemed Cabinet officials, hello.

It’s an honor for me to be here and to support the First Lady’s Presidential AI Challenge. Through this initiative, you are inspiring young people to use technology in extraordinary ways.

This is deeply important to me. Having regular access to computers changed my life, and led me on the path to Google.

I was drawn to its mission: to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Today we see AI as the most profound way we will deliver on that mission — and transform knowledge and learning.

We can imagine a future where every student, regardless of their background or location, can learn anything in the world — in the way that works best for them.

We’ve been focused on this for decades. It’s why we built Chromebooks for every classroom, and why we’ve worked to make our AI model, Gemini, the world’s leading model for learning.

It’s also why we’re offering Gemini for Education to every high school in America. That means every high school student and every teacher has access to our best AI tools, including Guided Learning — tools that could be helpful for students taking the AI Challenge.

We also recently committed $1 billion over the next three years to support education and job training programs in the U.S. And today, I’m excited to share that $150 million of that $1 billion will go towards grants to support AI education and digital wellbeing.

This includes $3 million to code.org to transform its curriculum and integrate new AI features. We’re also providing $2 million to the Flourish Fund to support nonprofits equipping youth aging out of the foster care system with tools to succeed in the workforce.

For college students, our AI for Education Accelerator has expanded from 100 colleges and universities to 200, including the Texas A&M University System and Iowa’s community colleges.

And we’ve set up a centralized place on the web for teachers and parents to get all of our best AI training in one place, something we’ve heard can be really helpful.

This is all in service of helping the next generation solve problems, fuel innovation and build an incredible future. These are goals we all share. We are incredibly thankful for the partnership of everyone in this room, and to the First Lady and the Administration for leading the way. Thank you.

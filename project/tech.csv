"Apple’s new iOS 26.3 to bring a new ""Notification Forwarding"" setting",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apples-new-ios-26-3-to-bring-a-new-notification-forwarding-setting/articleshow/126010442.cms,"What Notification Forwarding feature will mean for users







Apple recently released the iOS 26.2 software update and the rumour mill is already buzzing with the iOS 26.3. According to a report by MacRumors, the iPhone maker may add a new “Notification Forwarding” setting which will allow incoming notifications on an iPhone to be forwarded to a third-party device. As per the report, a new Notification section will be added under the new “Notification Forwarding” in the Settings app.With the new feature, users will be able to choose to have their device receive notifications only from selected apps rather than all apps, and notifications will include the name of the app and all content contained in the notification, the report says.As per the report, the company is bringing this feature in Europe to relieve regulatory pressure in the region.Under the Digital Markets Act in the European Union, Apple is required to provide third-party smartwatches and other devices with access to notifications and features that are normally reserved for the Apple Watch.In another news, Apple has released iOS 26.3 Beta 1 for developers. The new beta is reported to bring fresh features and better performance. One of the main additions appears to be a built-in tool that lets users move their data from an iPhone to an Android device without needing a separate app.According to MacRumors, users can move photos, messages, apps, passwords, and other information by placing the two phones next to each other.The feature notes mention that some items cannot be transferred, including health data, locked notes, and devices paired over Bluetooth. Google already offers a similar option during Android setup to import data from iOS, but it is not yet clear if Apple’s new tool will provide a better or more complete transfer experience.","Apple may add a new “Notification Forwarding” setting which will allow incoming notifications on an iPhone to be forwarded to a third-party device.

55% victims of Makop ransomware group were based in India: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/55-victims-of-makop-ransomware-group-were-based-in-india-study/articleshow/126017079.cms,"India faced a significant surge in Makop ransomware attacks, with 55% of victims globally located here. Attackers are exploiting weak security, outdated software, and vulnerable RDP access, even developing tools to disable local antivirus. This evolving threat, now using Guloader for distribution, demands immediate attention to basic cybersecurity practices.

“Makop is not a brand-new family of ransomware, but it is changing in ways that are impossible for defences to ignore. Makop is being deployed using Guloader for the first time, which is a significant change from its typical manual, RDP-based distribution. This modification makes the ransomware more difficult to identify and indicates that even low-complexity attackers are using increasingly complex methods.

The regional targeting pattern, 55% of the victims we saw were in India, where attackers even created tools to remove popular local security products, is particularly alarming. These results demonstrate a straightforward reality: businesses with inadequate security measures or exposed RDP services remain highly vulnerable. Improving fundamental cyber hygiene is now essential to staying ahead of fast-evolving threats like these.”





In a recent Acronis Research study, it was found that 55% of the victims attacked by the ransomware group Makop are based in India, making it the country most affected by this malware globally. This is an indicator that cyber attackers are focusing on regions where poor security practices and outdated antivirus software are in use.The report illustrates a significant change in the ransomware group's operational modus operandi. This is the first observed case of Makop being distributed via Guloader, a type of loader malware that typically distributes information-stealing malware. The new modus operandi will make it difficult for security tools to trace any ransomware-related activities.Makop was first observed around 2020 and is associated with the Phobos ransomware group. Most of these attacks begin with unauthorised access to RDP computers that lack protection for Remote Desktop Protocol communications, according to Acronis analysts. Cyber attackers use hacking tools to crack weak passwords.After gaining access, the perpetrators follow a predictable sequence of actions: network scanning, stealing login credentials, moving deeper into the system, turning off security software, and encrypting files.They also use known tools such as Mimikatz to steal credentials or network scanners to understand their environment.The study indicates that attackers are now making greater efforts to circumvent security solutions. The attackers use specially created uninstallers to remove Indian antivirus software such as Quick Heal. The attackers also use vulnerable drivers and legitimate utilities, such as Process Hacker, to bypass security solutions.To enhance their chances of a successful attack, Makop attackers exploit multiple Windows vulnerabilities to gain administrative privileges, some of which are many years old.Acronis has also cautioned that a mixture of “outdated vulnerabilities, poor passwords, and vulnerable remote access services” continues to leave organisations vulnerable to attack. This is also true of what is being seen in the Makop campaign, where ransomware gangs are exploiting a lack of effort in basic security to launch successful attacks.The company's recommended actions for businesses include implementing Multi-Factor Authentication for all remote access, applying frequent patches, restricting public RDP access, and using adequate endpoint security that can detect Guloader.Enhancing password management practices and conducting security audits for businesses could also help minimise the risks and threats associated with the Guloader malware.Ilia Dafchev, senior security researcher at Acronis, said,","Attackers are exploiting weak security, outdated software, and vulnerable RDP access, even developing tools to disable local antivirus. This evolving threat, now using Guloader for distribution, demands immediate attention to basic cybersecurity practices.

Albert Lee to focus on OpenAI’s strategic investments



Albert Lee is latest high-profile executive hiring







ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has hired a key corporate development executive from Google to lead its own corporate development. The hiring comes as Silicon Valley is witnessing an aggressive focus on strategic investments and acquisitions amid the intensifying AI race. According to CNBC, a company spokesperson confirmed that Albert Lee, who previously led corporate development for both Google Cloud and Google DeepMind, has been hired to oversee corporate development at OpenAI.Analysts view Lee’s move as a key strategic hire because during his tenure at Google, he was involved in several high-profile acquisitions, including the massive $32 billion purchase of the cloud security startup Wiz, announced in March.In his new role, Lee will focus on mergers, acquisitions (M&A), and strategic investments that are crucial to the company’s next phase of growth. OpenAI has seen its valuation skyrocket since the public launch of ChatGPT in 2022.The AI lab has already been active in the M&A space this year, with notable acquisitions including Neptune, a startup specialising in AI model training. The company also acquired Software Applications Incorporated for an undisclosed sum in October.It bought Statsig for $1.1 billion in September and io, the AI devices startup co-founded by former Apple designer Jony Ive in May for more than $6 billion.Lee is the latest in a series of high-profile executive hires as OpenAI seeks to fill out its top leadership bench. Earlier this month, the company announced that former Slack CEO Denise Dresser would serve as its chief revenue officer. In May, OpenAI hired Fidji Simo, the then-CEO of Instacart, as the head of its applications business.Earlier this year, the company also hired Alexandr Wang as the Chief AI officer of Meta and Nat Friedman, who was the CEO of GitHub, as head of product at Meta Superintelligence Labs.","Albert Lee previously led corporate development for both Google Cloud and Google DeepMind.

Recent reports of Meta potentially buying Google's AI chips have caused a $250 billion market value drop, validating Huang's long-held belief that the company is always '30 days from going out of business'.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A near-death experience that shaped Huang’s three decades of paranoia

Why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 's fears suddenly look prophetic





Despite leading Nvidia to become the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation, CEO Jensen Huang admits he operates in constant anxiety, working every single day including holidays. His fears may be justified—this week alone, Nvidia lost $250 billion in market value after reports emerged that Meta is in advanced talks to buy billions worth of competing chips from Google , threatening the chipmaker's decade-long dominance in AI hardware.""The phrase '30 days from going out of business'—I've used for 33 years,"" Huang revealed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. ""The feeling doesn't change. The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""Huang's anxiety isn't unfounded paranoia—it's scar tissue from survival. In the mid-1990s, Nvidia discovered fatal flaws in its first graphics chip while developing technology for Sega's gaming console. With funds evaporating, Huang flew to Japan for an excruciating conversation: he told Sega's CEO the product wouldn't work and the deal must end, but simultaneously begged for the final $5 million payment to prevent bankruptcy.Remarkably, Sega converted it into an investment, giving Nvidia the lifeline that eventually built a trillion-dollar empire.That near-collapse experience now fuels Huang's relentless schedule. He wakes at 4 a.m. daily to read ""several thousand emails,"" works seven days a week without exception—""including Thanksgiving, Christmas""—and admits he's ""always in a state of anxiety."" His motivation? ""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed. Failure drives me more than greed.""Huang's paranoia might be wisdom. Nvidia made the rare move of issuing a public defense after The Information reported that Meta—planning up to $72 billion in AI spending this year—is negotiating massive purchases of Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). The news triggered a 6% stock plunge, erasing roughly $250 billion in value, while Alphabet shares surged 4%.""Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model,"" the company declared on X, breaking its usual silence on competitors. But Google's latest Gemini 3 AI model, trained entirely on TPUs rather than Nvidia chips, is being hailed by industry leaders as potentially superior. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly announced he's switching from ChatGPT after three years, calling Gemini 3 the better product.The threat is existential to Nvidia's 90% market share in AI accelerators. If Google captures even a fraction of the hundreds of billions being spent on AI processors—particularly from customers like Meta—it would represent the first serious crack in Nvidia's dominance.Huang's work ethic has infected his family: both his children, Madison and Spencer, now in their thirties, work at Nvidia after joining as interns in 2020 and 2022. ""Now we have three people working every day,"" Huang said.For a CEO who never stopped running scared despite building a $4.5-trillion empire, the market turmoil caused by Google likely only confirmed what he's believed for 33 years: you're always 30 days from going out of business.","Jensen Huang is the CEO of Nvidia, the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation.

How to apply for e-passport





The Ministry of External Affairs rolled out e-passport service under the Passport Seva Programme (PSP V2.0). With the new system, the government aims to facilitate faster, more secure, and smooth travel for all Indian passport holders. While the existing ones remain valid till their expiry, anyone applying for a passport will get a chip-enabled passport by default, irrespective of whether they apply in India or abroad.As explained by the external affairs ministry in a press release, the e-Passport is a hybrid passport that combines both paper and electronic elements. It features an embedded Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip and an antenna, which store and secure the holder’s data in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.Critical information printed on the data page is also stored electronically on the chip, enabling enhanced security and authentication, the ministry says. Going forward, all newly issued passports will be e-Passports, while existing non-electronic passports will remain valid until their expiry, it added.As mentioned above, any Indian citizen who is eligible for a regular passport can apply for e-passport.The process of applying for an e-passport is the same as that of applying for a regular passport. Applicants are required to first register on the official Passport Seva portal using their personal details. After completing the registration, they must fill in the online application form carefully and pay the prescribed fee through the available payment options.Once the payment is completed, applicants are required to book an appointment at a nearby Passport Seva Kendra or Post Office Passport Seva Kendra, based on their location and slot availability. On the scheduled date, the applicant must visit the selected centre in person for document verification.During the appointment, biometric details of the applicant are captured. This includes taking fingerprints and a photograph, which are used for identity verification and are later embedded securely into the e-passport’s electronic chip.After the verification process is completed and the application is cleared, the e-passport is printed with the embedded chip that stores the holder’s biometric and personal details.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate jobs in the long run. Speaking in an interview with Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures, Dimon urged workers to focus on human skills such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence and communication to stay relevant in the future workforce. He said individuals should build skills that machines cannot easily copy. These include problem-solving, emotional understanding, creativity, and clear communication.Jamie Dimon said that while companies have been cautious about hiring in recent months, this slowdown is not being driven by AI. He also said he does not expect the technology to cause large job losses in the immediate future.“For the most part, AI is going to do great stuff for mankind, like tractors did, like fertilizers did, like vaccines did,” Dimon said during the interview. “You know, maybe one day we’ll be working less hard but having wonderful lives.”At the same time, Jamie Dimon stressed that AI will eventually replace some jobs and that people must prepare for this shift. Notably, this is not the first time Dimon has warned about AI eliminating jobs. He has previously warned that automation will change the nature of work. In November 2025, Dimon said AI could help people in developed countries move toward a much shorter workweek of around three-and-a-half days over the next 20 to 40 years.Dimon also said that AI must be regulated properly to limit its risks, just as earlier technologies were brought under rules to protect society. He said both governments and companies have a shared responsibility to manage the impact of AI on workers.“We—government and we the companies, society—should look at how do we phase it in a way that we don’t damage a lot of people,” he said. He pointed to past examples where factory closures hurt entire towns and said better support could have reduced the damage. “You can retrain people, relocate people, income assistance, early retirement,” he added.While warning about future job losses, Dimon also said AI is already creating new jobs in the short term. He said the growth of AI requires large investments in infrastructure, including construction work and fibre-optic networks, which will generate employment.","Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence will eliminate jobs in the long run.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently hinted at building data centres in space. In an interview with Fox News, Pichai said that the company is working on quantum computing, adding “in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun”.Sundar Pichai’s video from the interview was shared by X (formerly Twitter) user - Bourbon Capital in an online post. It caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who replied to the post with a single word. “Interesting”, Musk wrote.“At Google, we are always proud of taking moon shots,” Pichai said, adding “... Waymo … has been over a decade in the making.”“We're working on quantum computing, in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun,” he continued.Pichai further said that the company wants to “put these data centers in space closer to the sun”, and will take “first step in 2027”.“We'll send tiny racks of machines and have them in satellites, test them out, and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away will be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centers,” Sundar Pichai said in the interview.Notably, this echoes Musk's November 2025 announcements that SpaceX will pioneer orbital data centers using next-gen Starlink satellites, positioning them as the lowest-cost AI compute option within five years.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is working on quantum computing.

The company emphasized that its India website is not yet live and is not accepting orders.

Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India

Starlink’s residential connection includes 30-day trial and plug-and-play setup to cost Rs 34,000

SpaceX Gateway network to span across six cities, and Bengaluru office expands





Starlink has officially denied that Indian pricing, calling the incident a technical glitch rather than an intentional reveal. Lauren Dreyer, Vice President of Starlink Business Operations, clarified in a post on X that the company's India website is not yet live and is not accepting orders.She explained that a configuration error caused internal dummy test data to briefly appear publicly, which was quickly corrected once discovered. Dreyer emphasized that Starlink has not announced official pricing for India and any figures currently circulating online are inaccurate. The company remains focused on obtaining final government approvals before launching service in the country, and both the website and ordering system will stay inactive until the regulatory process is complete.Elon Musk's Starlink has revealed the residential satellite internet pricing for India at Rs 8,600 monthly, plus a Rs 34,000 hardware kit, as the SpaceX subsidiary prepares for commercial operations. The service targets households in remote and underserved areas with promises of unlimited data, 99.9% uptime, and weather-resistant connectivity where traditional broadband infrastructure fails to reach.Following regulatory clearance from the Department of Telecommunications in July, Starlink is positioning itself to challenge established players Jio-SES and Eutelsat OneWeb in India's satellite communications sector.The residential plan, priced at a monthly subscription cost of Rs 8,600 offers unlimited data without usage caps or throttling, addressing critical connectivity gaps in rural regions. Starlink's system requires minimal installation effort, with users simply powering on equipment and pointing it skyward to establish connections. However, the hardware kit will cost customers Rs 34,000, which the company says is a one time fees. The company guarantees over 99.9% uptime and all-weather functionality, crucial features for areas experiencing frequent service disruptions.New customers receive a 30-day trial period, allowing households to evaluate performance before long-term commitment. This trial provision acknowledges the premium pricing structure, which places Starlink among India's higher-cost broadband options despite targeting underserved markets.Business subscription pricing remains unannounced, with enterprise-focused plans expected as commercial rollout advances.Starlink is deploying gateway earth stations across Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, and Noida to enable satellite-to-ground communications. These relay installations are essential for maintaining low-latency connections and service reliability across India's varied geography.The company posted four specialist positions at its Bengaluru office in October, recruiting talent in payments, accounting, treasury, and tax operations as part of infrastructure expansion. This direct-to-consumer strategy distinguishes Starlink from competitors concentrating on enterprise clients, potentially reshaping internet accessibility in regions where fiber deployment remains economically unviable.","Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India. residential connection includes 30-day trial and plug-and-play setup to cost Rs 34,000 per month.

A global memory chip shortage, fueled by AI data center demand, is driving up manufacturing costs. Expect average prices to jump nearly 7% year-over-year, with budget phones hit hardest. Shipments are projected to decline, as companies grapple with rising expenses and potential component downgrades.

Memory crunch hits budget phones hardest

Apple and Samsung best positioned to weather storm





Smartphone buyers should prepare for significantly higher prices in 2026, as surging demand for AI data centers creates a global memory chip shortage that's driving up manufacturing costs across the industry.Average smartphone prices are expected to rise 6.9% year-over-year in 2026, nearly double previous forecasts, according to Counterpoint Research. The firm also predicts global smartphone shipments will fall 2.1% next year, marking a sharp reversal from 2025's estimated 3.3% growth.The crisis stems from skyrocketing demand for DRAM chips—critical components used in both AI data centers and smartphones. Companies building AI infrastructure have created supply bottlenecks, pushing memory prices up an estimated 40% through mid-2026.Manufacturing costs have already surged dramatically this year. Budget phones under $200 have seen their bill of materials increase 20-30%, while mid-range and premium devices face 10-15% cost hikes, Counterpoint reports. An additional 8-15% increase is expected in the first half of 2026.""In the lower price bands, steep price increases on smartphones are not sustainable,"" said Counterpoint Senior Analyst Yang Wang.""If cost pass-through isn't possible, OEMs will start pruning parts of their portfolios—that's actually what we are starting to see with significantly reduced volumes of low-end SKUs.""The research firm indicates Apple and Samsung are best equipped to handle the shortage, with predicted shipment declines around 2%. Chinese manufacturers like Honor Oppo , and Vivo face steeper challenges, with Honor potentially seeing declines exceeding 3%.To manage rising costs, some manufacturers are already downgrading specifications on camera modules, displays, and audio components, or reusing older parts. Others are pushing consumers toward higher-priced ""Pro"" models to maintain profit margins.For consumers planning upgrades, the message is clear: 2026 phones will likely cost more while offering fewer meaningful improvements, particularly in the budget and mid-range segments where the memory shortage hits hardest.","Average smartphone prices are expected to rise 6.9% year-over-year in 2026.

European developers want US-like ‘Apple Tax’ ruling from EU regulators,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/europe-developers-want-us-like-apple-tax-ruling-from-eu-regulators/articleshow/126009628.cms,"CAF highlights disparity between European and US developers



What DMA rules say







A coalition representing 20 app developers and consumer groups has urged European regulators to enforce the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) against Apple , arguing that the tech giant’s fee structure creates an unfair competitive disadvantage compared to its US rivals. The appeal comes a few days after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld a contempt finding against the iPhone maker that said the tech giant willfully violated a 2021 injunction by charging a 27% commission on purchases made through external payment links.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the Coalition for Apps Fairness (CAF), which represents major firms including Deezer and Proton, argues that these revised fees still violate the DMA’s core stipulation that external transactions must be “free of charge”.“This situation is untenable and damaging to the app economy,” CAF said in a statement.The coalition is demanding quick enforcement from Brussels as developers are reportedly dissatisfied with the lack of clarity regarding further policy changes Apple has announced, which are set to take effect in January.Gene Burrus, Global Policy Counsel for CAF, pointed to the disparity now separating European and U.S. developers.“Developers in the EU have to either bear the cost of those fees or pass them down to customers. It is bad for European companies, and it is bad for European consumers,” Burrus said.“We want the EU Commission to tell Apple that the law is the law and that free of charge means free of charge,” Burrus added, noting that European authorities should consider referring the contentious issue to the European Court of Justice.The EU’s DMA mandates that large “gatekeeper” platforms like Apple must allow for in-app transactions outside their ecosystem without imposing a charge. Earlier this year, the EC fined Apple 500 million euros ($588 million) for obstructing developers from directing users to alternative payment methods. In response to the EU ruling, Apple revised its terms with fees ranging from 13% to 20% on App Store purchases and penalties of 5% to 15% on external transactions.",A coalition representing 20 app developers and consumer groups has urged European regulators to enforce the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) against Apple.

market. This strategic initiative will leverage currently underutilised electric vehicle battery capacity to create a new, diversified and profitable revenue stream for Ford. The company also plans to invest roughly $2 billion in the next two years to scale the business.”

Ford’s ‘battery plan’ to meet AI energy needs





Ford has now come up with a plan to get involved in the race of Artificial Intelligence as well. One of the largest car manufacturers in the United States will change its plans and switch to a new business area toThe automaker has stated that it will use its previous EV battery factory capacity for its newly developed business area, battery storage.These storage solutions would be built using less expensive lithium-iron phosphate batteries and are tailored for data centres, which are essential for AI, and could also help stabilise the electricity supply chain. The plans call for the company to invest approximately $2 billion over 2 years in this new venture. Ford has decided to utilise its existing manufacturing capacities at its Kentucky plant for this purpose.In a blog post, the company wrote:The battery storage solutions are expected to start deliveries in 2027. Ford will invest in building a total of 20 GWh of battery annual capacity. The plant will manufacture LFP batteries using technology licensed from CATL, a Chinese battery-cell manufacturer, and battery energy storage system modules and DC container systems measuring 20 feet.The company wrote: “The Kentucky site will be converted to manufacture 5 MWh+ advanced battery energy storage systems.Ford plans to produce LFP prismatic cells, battery energy storage system modules and 20-foot DC container systems at this facility. These systems are at the heart of the energy storage solution market for data centres, utilities, and large-scale industrial and commercial customers.Leveraging more than a century of manufacturing expertise and licensed advanced battery technology, Ford plans to bring initial capacity online within 18 months, positioning the company to capture share in the growing U.S. battery energy storage systems market. Ford currently plans to deploy at least 20 GWh annually by late 2027.”Ford is entering the energy storage sector, joining other automotive manufacturers in the industry. Rivals in the energy storage sector include Elon Musk’s Tesla, which has been selling energy storage devices for the past decade and is installing around 10GWh every quarter, and General Motors (GM), which offers a range of energy storage devices for domestic and commercial use.The company also announced: “Last week, Ford, SK On, SK Battery America and BlueOval SK entered into a joint venture disposition agreement. Under this mutual agreement, a Ford subsidiary will independently own and operate the Kentucky battery plants. independently SK On will fully own and operate the Tennessee battery plant.Separately, Ford will utilise BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall, Michigan, to produce smaller Amp-hour cells for use in residential energy storage solutions. This plant remains on track to begin manufacturing LFP prismatic battery cells in 2026 to power Ford’s upcoming mid-size electric truck, the first model on the new Universal EV Platform.”","Ford will use its existing EV battery factory capacity for its newly developed business area, battery storage.

US suspends ‘Tech Prosperity Deal’ with Britain: 3 reasons why $40 billion pact has 'hit roadblock',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-suspends-tech-prosperity-deal-with-britain-3-reasons-why-40-billion-pact-has-hit-roadblock/articleshow/126005777.cms,"Online safety rules , digital services tax among reason for deal suspension







The US has reportedly suspended the implementation of “Tech Prosperity Deal” – the landmark technology agreement with the UK. The pact was announced in September during President Donald Trump’s visit to Britain and it intended to foster cooperation in critical future sectors, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing and nuclear energy.According to a report by The Financial Times, British officials confirmed on Monday (December 15) that the Trump administration suspended the deal last week. Citing one official, the report said that the suspension was a leverage against the concessions from the UK in trade areas outside the immediate scope of the technology partnership.Trade talks between the two nations have been active since May. Reportedly, the US officials were frustrated by Britain’s online safety rules, digital services tax and food safety restrictions.Trump has previously criticised digital services taxes imposed on US tech giants by trading partners, including the UK. However, one UK official briefed on the trade talks denied the DST was the core issue leading to the suspension.“The digital services tax is a red herring. We are down to negotiating some of the most difficult issues. Both sides expect this to take some time. But the dialogue remains open, active, and constructive,” the official was quoted as saying.Another British official reportedly said that the talks were difficult, stating their US counterparts were “very tough negotiators, but we are pretty sure we can get this back on track.”“Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the UK is firmly committed to ensuring the tech prosperity deal delivers opportunity for hardworking people in both countries,” a UK government spokesman was quoted as saying.","Tech Prosperity Deal was announced in September during President Donald Trump’s visit to Britain.

"Creator of one of the most popular AI coding tools, Claude, has warning for companies: It is definitely not the thing you...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/creator-of-one-of-the-most-popular-ai-coding-tools-claude-has-warning-for-companies-it-is-definitely-not-the-thing-you-/articleshow/126003691.cms,"AI coding, while impressive, has limits for production software, warns Anthropic engineer Boris Cherny. He stresses human oversight is crucial for critical systems, as AI-generated code can lack maintainability. Despite rapid advancements and widespread adoption by tech giants, experts caution against over-reliance, highlighting the need for thoughtful human intervention in complex coding tasks.

Vibe coding struggles with maintainable, production-ready code

AI coding quality remains 'not great' despite rapid improvements





Boris Cherny, the engineer behind Anthropic's Claude Code, has issued a cautionary note about the limits of AI-assisted ""vibe coding,"" saying it falls short when building production-grade software. Speaking on ""The Peterman Podcast,"" Cherny acknowledged that while vibe coding works for throwaway prototypes, it's ""definitely not the thing you want to do all the time.""The warning comes as major tech companies report dramatic increases in AI-generated code. Google CEO Sundar Pichai disclosed that over 25% of new code at Google is now AI-written, up from 25% in October 2024. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed that up to 30% of Microsoft's codebase comes from artificial intelligence.Despite these gains, Cherny maintains that human oversight remains essential for critical systems.""You want maintainable code sometimes. You want to be very thoughtful about every line sometimes,"" Cherny explained. For critical coding tasks, he adopts a collaborative approach—asking AI models to generate plans, then iterating in small steps while maintaining final control. ""I might ask it to improve the code or clean it up,"" he said, but for components requiring strong technical opinions, Cherny still writes code manually.Cherny's assessment contrasts sharply with the industry's AI enthusiasm. Claude Code launched earlier this year and powers major coding services including Cursor and Augment. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei claimed in October that Claude writes 90% of the company's code. The tool has particularly resonated with non-technical developers building software through natural-language prompts.Despite the hype, Cherny remains skeptical about current capabilities. The models are ""not great at coding,"" he said, though he emphasized that ""there's still so much room to improve, and this is the worst it's ever going to be."" He called the year-over-year progress ""insane,"" noting that AI coding has evolved from basic autocomplete to a ""completely different world.""Industry leaders echo concerns about AI-generated code quality. Google's Pichai admitted he's ""not working on large codebases where you really have to get it right,"" while experts warn that AI code can contain mistakes, verbose implementations, or improper structure. Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently pushed back against vibe coding evangelism, emphasizing that coding remains ""a deeply layered craft"" that cannot be reduced to natural-language prompts alone."," AI-assisted ""vibe coding"" has limits for production software, warns Anthropic engineer Boris Cherny.

Netflix CEOs to employees: This Google company gives us confidence that we will be able to get American government approval for Warner Brothers deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-ceos-to-employees-this-google-company-gives-us-confidence-that-we-will-be-able-to-get-american-government-approval-for-warner-brothers-deal/articleshow/126003429.cms,"FILE .

Among other things, the letter asks: 'Are we confident regulators will approve?'

The letter concludes with 'What’s next?'





Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos sent letter to the company's employees on the company's bid for Warner Brothers. The letter titled, 'OUR DEAL WITH WARNER BROS' is available on Securities Exchange and Commission's (SEC). It seeks to reassure employees’ concerns about the company’s bid for much of Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. Among other things, it reiterates that there is no business overlap and therefore won’t be any studio closures. It also tries to allay concerns about layoffs at Warner Brothers Studios post the takeover. Peters and Sarandos said they were committed to releasing Warner Bros. movies in theaters, following concerns that Netflix would prioritize a streaming-first model.Incidentally, Sarandos has previously described going to the cinema as an “outdated” experience.Netflix’s $82.7 billion bid for Warner Bros streaming and studios businesses was approved by the Warner Bros. board. However, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile $108 billion bid for the entire company early last week, reaching out to shareholders directly. The Warner Bros. Board is expected to respond to Paramount’s offer by the end of the week.On its part, Paramount has indicated that it may not be its best and final bid.The battle for Warner Bros. is also likely to face stiff regulatory scrutiny and each bidder claims to have the upper hand. Peters and Sarandos pointed to YouTube dominance on TVs in the US to justify the deal. The letter points to US TV view time data from Nielsen that suggests a Netflix-Warner Bros. combination would have a smaller view share percentage than YouTube or a potential Paramount and Warner Bros. It is this very number that Netflix CEOs believe will help the deal get through. They have said this on stage as well as in a letter to employees.To this, it responds, ""We believe in this deal—in the value it creates— and we’re confident we’ll get the approvals we need to make it happen. The fundamentals are clear: this deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator, and pro-growth. Also, if you look at it through the lens of Nielsen data, even after combining with Warner Bros., our view share would only move from 8% to 9% in the US—still well behind YouTube (13%) and a potential Paramount/WBD combination (14%). We believe the facts speak for themselves, and we’re fully prepared to put ourselves in a strong position for approval.""The reply on this is: 'We’ve got a small but mighty team of experts working on this so the rest of us can stay focused on the big 2026 ambitions we’ve established for our business. We’ve got huge potential still ahead of us—even before we factor in Warner Bros.—so our focus should remain on realizing that potential based on our organic growth. We know that’s easier said than done with all the headlines and speculation, but continuing to deliver for our members is the best thing we can focus on.

AT&T CEO John Stankey admitted he made a mistake in addressing the company's cultural transformation — but not in the way critics might expect. At the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit, Stankey said his error wasn't sending the blunt August memo that went viral, but rather waiting too long to send it.The lengthy memo, first reported by Business Insider, outlined AT&T's shift to a ""more market-based culture"" and effectively told employees to embrace the changes or find work elsewhere. The directive sparked widespread debate about workplace loyalty and employer expectations in corporate America.When asked to name a professional misstep, Stankey acknowledged he should have prioritized cultural evolution from the start rather than treating it as one of several focus areas.He said he should have ""put it at the forefront and forced specific actions to make it happen"" much earlier in his tenure.The memo itself, Stankey insisted, was just one element of a larger framework. ""The memo shouldn't be over-rotated on. It's one of a series of steps in trying to put a framework out there and remove excuses for leaders to lead,"" he told the summit audience.The document gave managers what Stankey called ""all the air cover in the world they need to go and execute around that framework.""It was designed to outline his vision and empower leaders to make decisive changes aligned with the company's new direction.AT&T has implemented sweeping changes over the past year, including a mandatory five-day return-to-office policy. In the August memo to managers, Stankey wrote that employees seeking hybrid or remote work arrangements ""will have a difficult time aligning"" their priorities with company goals.""We run a dynamic, customer-facing business, tackling large-scale, challenging initiatives,"" the memo stated. ""If the requirements dictated by this dynamic do not align to your personal desires, you have every right to find a career opportunity that is suitable to your aspirations and needs.""At the summit, Stankey also discussed AT&T's push for AI adoption among employees. The company provides tutorials and educational tools for upskilling, and Stankey monitors usage closely. ""I want to see who's building their skill set, where they're building, and this is just the next set of skills that people are going to have to have,"" he said.Thank you to the over 99,000 employees who responded to this year's Employee Survey. Your feedback helps us understand what we need to focus on—and how we need to communicate — as we strive toward our goal of ranking in the top third of Fortune 100 companies in employee engagement. It is incredibly encouraging that 73% of our employees took the time to respond to the survey, with 79% of those respondents feeling committed and engaged with their work at AT&T. While this is reassuring, especially considering the amount of change we've navigated as a company recently, it wasn't a surprise to me that we fell short of our engagement goal. Nor was it a surprise that scores declined since our 2023 survey. We are midstream on a multi-year journey to build the company we want, not simply optimize the one we have — and I believe your feedback accurately reflects where we are.In the survey you asked for transparency in communication from leadership. Although not my best in terms of brevity, the purpose of this multi-page note is to share a few of my thoughts with you directly while your leaders work with you to prepare their action plans. After reading this, I'm hopeful you will understand my perspective on the company we are working to build and what we can and will do to respond to elements of your feedback.This note may also help you identify areas where your professional expectations might be misaligned with the strategic direction of this company. Most points outlined below have been communicated in other forums and with your leadership, but this is my attempt to articulate how all the pieces fit together.Let me start by setting some context on what has been underway at AT&T over the last 4 years. To secure our long-term success as a company, we concluded that a shift in our operating culture was essential. For those of you who are fans of management science, this shift can be characterized as moving away from an orientation on hierarchy and familial cultural norms and towards a more externally focused and competitive market-based culture.I understand that some of you may have started your tour with this company expecting an ""employment deal"" rooted in loyalty, tenure, and conformance with the associated compensation, work structure, and benefits. We have consciously shifted away from some of these elements and towards a more market-based culture — focused on rewarding capability, contribution, and commitment. We believe this is the only way to succeed in the dynamic, technologically driven markets where we operate. I know change like this is difficult and can be unsettling for some. However, as General Eric Shinseki so eloquently stated, ""If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more."" Many of your survey comments indicate agreement with this notion — a desire for our company to evolve to better support our customers and each other.If you are of the small minority that shared comments similar to, ""I have heard this nonsense before and I'll ignore things until this goes away…"" or ""things were just fine the way they were…"" there might be a disconnect between you and your current professional choice. It takes every one of us, moving in the same direction, to win against the competition, sustain our business, and create rewarding and interesting challenges for employees who want to work in a market-based culture. Changes to compensation, pensions, benefits (paid time off, care leaves, mental health support), delayering, work locations, and workplace environment are all in service of this change.When I read comments lamenting disruption, I tried to pick my brain for an example of another 100+ year old company that didn't have to disrupt itself to secure sustainable relevance. I am still searching for the first example. I suspect our willingness to disrupt ourselves is the under-pinning of why this company approaches 150 years of relevance — from fixed to mobile, TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) to IP (Internet Protocol), and narrowband to broadband to name a few. I recall at every turn there were parts of the organization advocating to maintain the status quo, and I suspect hindsight would tell us we are happy we chose change — as messy as the journey might have been.Now to the survey. There was quite a bit to unpack in your feedback, but like any business imperative, focus and prioritization are essential. Your collective data and comments were analyzed to extract the most critical themes outlined in this note. You will hear more specifics from your respective leaders around these themes in the coming weeks.I agree with the sentiment that everyone should understand potential career opportunities and career paths we have here at AT&T. With that, you should have a solid sense of the contribution required in your current role, and what can be done to earn more responsibility to push professional pursuits to a higher level.Many leaders have not yet fully addressed this expectation within their own organizations. Our shift to hub locations was a pivotal step to more effectively achieve this goal. Concentrations of employees enables the teamwork, mentorship, and visibility that, when combined with performance and contribution, can better equip you to advance your career. While we have made strides to get more people into fewer places, we have more work to do to align complimentary work functions in the right places. I expect all department leaders to complete this work — to thoughtfully consolidate coordinating functions and career paths to reduce the ongoing need to relocate for growth and development.You deserve tools, processes, and capabilities that help you serve our customers effectively, without being hindered by internal process friction or system constraints.While we've made progress with legacy migrations and infrastructure upgrades, there's still a long way to go. We find ourselves at the midpoint in what is a long and technically challenging journey. You have my commitment that improving these capabilities remains a top priority. We are committed to allocating resources and attention to ensure we see tangible benefits of our record levels of investment in these areas, and we'll continue to update you on these improvements.You are right to expect to work in a professional, well-maintained, and functional facility. Another reason we established a focused set of hubs was to allow us to invest in our workplaces and bring them to a more common standard. This was something we never would have been able to achieve while operating in 500+ metropolitan areas. It's also why we need to continue exiting under-utilized real estate (the remnants of deferred maintenance from a long string of mergers and acquisitions) to free up resources to invest in our core locations.The fact is real estate transitions require sustained efforts over several years to arrive at the place we desire and you deserve. Some of you are in a location where enhancements are actively underway or even completed. Others may be unaware of changes that are coming in short order. We will more actively share where we are making investments, what has been accomplished, and what is on the horizon. We agree with the feedback you shared, and we are taking this seriously. I expect we all will be required to demonstrate some patience and flexibility as we work towards a better place.Your collective comments about culture may be the most difficult to synthesize. This topic is a bit like beauty — it's all in the eyes of the beholder. Many of you suggest a desire to improve upon what you're observing as ""daily norms."" I wish I could summarize a set of actions that could quickly guarantee our transition to the market-based cultural norms I described earlier. But I don't think a short-term list of actions or programs would suffice. Believe me, there is nobody more impatient for this outcome than yours truly. Changing and embracing a workplace culture is like learning a language — knowledge grows in a variety of ways and develops over time. Like learning a language, you gain proficiency by practicing in the real world. We need to commit to learning the language together so we can all share a common ""shorthand.""To that end, we will be doing some additional work illustrating what market-based culture norms look like in practice — and sharing some prompts that can be applied in your daily work life. We'll keep coming at this cultural evolution from every angle — but I have to ask you to commit. Commit to adjusting your own behaviors and actions without looking to your right or left (or above) to see what everybody else is doing. A favorite quote by W. Clement Stone comes to mind: ""So many fail because they don't get started."" Please jump in and avoid the human tendency to blame the neighbors for the problems in the neighborhood! We will all change at a slightly different pace, and that's to be expected.I understand that many may find the demands of your daily lives challenging and difficult. Elder care, job stress, child rearing challenges, economic uncertainty, community unrest, technology anxiety — the list can get long. While no company can address how the combination of these dynamics might impact your specific circumstances, we can work to support employees in a way that improves their ability to manage what life throws at them.Our decisions to maintain industry-leading healthcare, change time-off policies, augment leave structures, offer financial counseling, and enhance mental health benefits are examples of overt decisions we have made on this front. Despite rising medical costs, we intend to hold management medical contributions flat for the 2026 renewal cycle. We continue to test new approaches to services and care in the workplace and are seeing some promising models emerge that may warrant implementing at scale. These are just some examples of how we are constantly evaluating how we can best support you in managing life dynamics, and you can expect more updates in the coming year.Now, onto some additional context and expectation setting.The most challenging things we do here at AT&T require unwavering teamwork - it's essential that we attract and promote talent that embraces working together to deliver results. When you think about what we are doing to transform this company - efforts like legacy sunset, fiber deployment, wireless network modernization, moving down market in Business, BSS/OSS (Business Support System/Operations Support System) platform migrations, digital/online/omni channel enablement, core routing network consolidation, and 5G standalone core - these are all efforts that require inter-departmental collaboration and coordination. They constitute the bulk of our $23 billion annual investment.This work is far more demanding and challenging than our efforts to keep the train on the tracks during enforced COVID isolation. In-person collaboration and predictable presence improves each team's ability to execute effectively on large, complex projects. Our customers expect us to be here to serve their needs. Our third-party partners need to be able to consistently depend on times to collaborate. Our employees deserve reliable support with their current responsibilities and impromptu guidance for continued development. This is why we work in person, together, during common hours.We run a dynamic, customer-facing business, tackling large-scale, challenging initiatives. If the requirements dictated by this dynamic do not align to your personal desires, you have every right to find a career opportunity that is suitable to your aspirations and needs. That said, if a self-directed, virtual, or hybrid work schedule is essential for you to manage your career aspirations and life challenges, you will have a difficult time aligning your priorities with those of the company and the culture we aim to establish.Does this mean there isn't room for emergencies or special circumstances? Of course not. We will always try to support that which can't be planned for — or that which needs to be deliberately planned for — and I expect any leader to manage their organization accordingly.Our cultural tenants include our intent to Win as One. Implicit in this commitment to one another is that we all carry our part of the load and measurably contribute to the priorities of the team. As technology and the ""information economy"" evolves, each of our respective contributions are going to become increasingly measurable.In addition to information garnered from performance reviews, peer feedback, assessments, work history, and certifications (to name a few), we analyze patterns of behaviors from broad cohorts (aggregated data). This allows leaders to identify behaviors that are obvious outliers, supplemented with the broadest set of information available, to determine if the behavior being evaluated is consistent with our stated priorities and employment expectations.An employee's data must significantly differ from their peers — to a level harming team cohesion, compensation, and inconsistent with our Win as One philosophy — before an individual's name is linked to any behavior.Some may view this approach as a matter of trust, and that perspective is understandable. In several forums, I've expressed concerns that past data indicated more outliers than we'd like.If we overlook these outliers, it can impact overall trust in leadership and coworkers, especially among those who consistently contribute and uphold our standards. Addressing these exceptions is important to ensure we're fair to the vast majority of employees who support their colleagues and deliver for the organization every day.I hope this clarifies how we've prioritized action planning around your feedback — and transparently explains why some concerns and desires expressed may not be entirely aligned with our strategic direction as a company. While it's natural to feel uneasy during times of conflict and change, the greatest source of lasting anxiety is when expectations aren't aligned or discussed openly.Determining the best way to address new challenges and position the company for long-term success is constantly on our minds as leaders. I truly believe that this approach is the way to attract and retain customers, secure necessary resources from our investors, and offer meaningful employment to as many of our folks as possible. As difficult as it is to balance all these stakeholders, I am confident that we are on the right track.Your leadership team will be outlining our path forward in response to the survey in more detail. Until then, I ask that each of you explore your own opportunities to make a difference. While there will certainly be actions and initiatives that require sponsorship from senior leaders, our collective success also depends on each of us taking ownership where we can. Rather than waiting for others to act, I encourage everyone to share their ideas and take initiative.As I said at the beginning, we are midstream on a multi-year journey to build the company we want, not simply optimize the one we have. Your feedback makes us better, and we have many strong capabilities and attributes to leverage.Our best days are ahead.","AT&T CEO John Stankey admits he was too slow to implement a cultural transformation.

This term defines low-quality, AI-produced digital material, from fake news to glitchy videos, that has flooded online spaces. Major platforms like Meta, Spotify, and YouTube are now implementing measures to combat this deluge of synthetic content, reflecting a growing user awareness and frustration.

Major platforms scramble to control digital deluge

Why 'Slop' resonates: A word with sticky origins





Merriam-Webster has named ""slop"" its 2025 Word of the Year, cementing a term that perfectly captures the internet's descent into AI-generated chaos. The dictionary giant defines slop as ""digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence""—a succinct description of the bizarre videos, glitchy ads, fake news, and AI-written junk that clogged digital feeds throughout the year.The word's spike in searches reflects a cultural reckoning. Internet users have grown increasingly aware they're being force-fed content that ranges from annoying to dangerously misleading, from talking cats to deepfaked celebrities and fabricated news stories.""It's such an illustrative word,"" Merriam-Webster president Greg Barlow told the Associated Press. ""It's part of a transformative technology, AI, and it's something that people have found fascinating, annoying, and a little bit ridiculous.""The slop crisis reached critical mass in 2025. Meta launched Vibes, a dedicated AI video feed, while OpenAI unleashed its Sora app—both flooding platforms with synthetic content that generated millions of views. Spotify purged over 75 million AI-generated spam tracks, while YouTube, Wikipedia, and Pinterest deployed new policies to stem the tide.Even luxury brands weren't immune, with companies like Valentino pushing AI-generated advertisements.Disney doubled down by investing $1 billion in OpenAI to bring Sora-generated videos to its streaming platform, signaling corporate America's embrace of the trend despite widespread backlash.The term's power lies in its visceral disgust. ""Like slime, sludge, and muck, slop has the wet sound of something you don't want to touch,"" Merriam-Webster noted.

(Chinatopix Via AP, File)

Opening a hearing titled “Trojan Horse: China’s Auto Threat to America,” House Select Committee on China chairman John Moolenaar said Beijing’s rise as the world’s largest auto exporter was not a market success but “a political project of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).""

Europe's 'Big worry': Chinese Electric buses





Europe's 'Chinese auto problem' is also reportedly troubling America. In the last few weeks, there have been reports of authorities in Europe getting worried about the dominance of Chinese vehicles on roads across the continent. European officials have echoed concerns about the spying, surveillance and sabotage risks posed by what EU digital czar Margrethe Vestager described as ""computers on wheels."" European nations have become increasingly worried that their vast amounts of Chinese-built infrastructure could be weaponized — tampered with, immobilized or even commandeered — if tensions were to rise with Beijing. Recently, bus providers in Denmark and Norway say they are urgently investigating and remedying what they say is a security loophole discovered in their fleets of vehicles made by Yutong, a company based in Zhengzhou, China, that is the world’s largest manufacturer of buses by sales volume.In American power corridors, these Chinese-made vehicles are raising concerns. These worries not only include Chinese vehicles being capable of spying on Americans, crippling transport networks, but also driving out the US auto industry out of business. Lawmakers and experts warned at a recent high-stakes Congressional hearing that China's auto sector was both an economic and national security threat to America.He added that it is built on massive subsidies from the Chinese government, control over supply chains, and predatory practices that US and allied companies “cannot match.” Other than this Moolenaar raised he very familiar spying worry. He said that modern vehicles packed with cameras, microphones, sensors and connectivity systems could function as “potential spy platforms with a kill switch inside,” as reported by news agency IANS. “Modern vehicles are digital eyes and ears on wheels,” Moolenaar said. He warned that Chinese-built systems could allow Beijing to steal sensitive data or even disable fleets during a crisis, blocking roads or disrupting logistics.Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi said that while Chinese electric vehicles were often priced “below what it would even cost to make a car.” “EVs are the future,” Krishnamoorthi said, adding that electric vehicles are projected to make up 60 percent of global new car sales by 2040. “The question before us now is this: who will own the EV market in 15 years?”Elaine Dezenski, senior director at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, said “This is not normal industrial production or competition.” She went on to add that practices followed by Chinese auto companies in America include forced technology transfer, price manipulation, forced labor, and strategic market cornering.Peter Ludwig compared the threat from Chinese vehicles to the same as that from Chinese app TikTok. “Chinese vehicles pose the same kinds of risks in the physical world that TikTok represents in the digital world,” Ludwig said, warning that once such systems are widely deployed, “unwinding that dependence will be slow, costly, and politically difficult.” Ludwig pressed for strict restrictions on Chinese auto companies in the US.Bus providers in Denmark and Norway are reportedly urgently investigating and remedying what they say is a security loophole discovered in their fleets of vehicles made by China's Yutong, that is the world’s largest manufacturer of buses by sales volume.As these buses can receive updates and diagnostic tests “over the air,” they can be “stopped remotely, either by the manufacturer or by a hacker,” Jeppe Gaard, chief operating officer of the Danish public transport provider Movia, told NBC News in an email. “Electric buses, like electric cars, in principle can be remotely deactivated if their software systems have online access,” he said. The alarm was reportedly first raised by the Norwegian bus operator Ruter, which runs half of the country’s public transport, including the capital city of Oslo.","European officials have echoed concerns about the spying, surveillance and sabotage risks posed by what EU digital czar Margrethe Vestager described as ""computers on wheels"" Bus providers in Denmark and Norway are urgently investigating and remedying what they say is a security loophole discovered in their fleets of vehicles made by Yutong, a company based in Zhengzhou, China.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125999889,imgsize-468578,width-400,resizemode-4/china39s-exports-of-electric-vehicles-doubled-in-september-as-competition-at-home-intensifies.jpg"

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has predicted that Elon Musk’s electric vehicle (EV) company may reach a $2 trillion market capitalization next year. In the latest note to Tesla investors, Ives writes that heading into 2026 ‘marks a monster year for Tesla and Musk as the autonomous and robotics chapter begins”. The EV company recently tested its unmanned robotaxis in Austin using its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, marking a key step toward full autonomy without human oversight.“We believe Tesla could reach a $2T market cap over the coming year and in a bull case scenario $3T by the end of 2026,” Ives said, adding “Heading into 2026 this marks a monster year ahead for Tesla and Musk as the autonomous and robotics chapter begins.”“In our view we expect an accelerated Robotaxi launch across the US with importantly volume production of Cybercabs starting in the April/May timeframe. In a nutshell, we believe Tesla is taking major steps in advancing its AI Revolution path with autonomous and robotics front and center heading into 2026 that will be a ""game changer and define Tesla's future"",” he added.In the note, Dan Ives further said that Musk is now driving Tesla into its next stage of growth as ""wartime CEO"" adding “we expect Robotaxis to be rolled out aggressively to over 30 US cities in 2026.”The analyst estimated that AI and autonomous opportunities are “worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla”. “..over the coming 3-6 months these key initiatives will now get fast tracked as the federal regulatory spiderweb that Musk & Co. have encountered over the past few years around FSD/autonomous clears significantly under Trump,” he continued.“We estimate that Tesla will own ~70% of the global autonomous market over the next decade as no other company in the world can match the scale and scope of Tesla coupled by its broadening AI footprint.

Google founder Sergey Brin recently admitted that launching Google Glass was a “mistake”, acknowledging problems with the company’s first attempt at smart glasses. Brin made the remark during a discussion at Stanford University School of Engineering, where he was asked what mindset young aspiring entrepreneurs must adopt to avoid repeating past mistakes. To this, Sergey Brin laughed and replied “when you have it like your cool new wearable device idea, really fully bake”.“That's one tip,” he continued adding “Google Glass is like … an example of prior mistakes”. Sergey Brin further added that the company “tried to commercialize it too quickly” before making it “cost-effective” and “polished” from a consumer standpoint.Brin’s comments come at a time when Google is reportedly preparing to re-enter the smart-glasses market.According to a CNBC report, the company is working with Samsung, Gentle Monster and Warby Parker on new AI-powered glasses that could be released as early as next year.For those unaware, Google Glass first debuted in 2013 but was discontinued after facing criticism for its high price, design issues and limited capabilities.As revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Google’s smart glasses will launch in 2026.The glasses will be powered by Android XR, Google’s operating system for its headsets.In a blog dated December 5, 2025, Google said that it plans to release audio-only glasses that will allow users to speak with the Gemini artificial-intelligence assistant.“With our partners, we are working to create two types of glasses. First, there are AI glasses designed for screen-free assistance, which use built-in speakers, microphones and cameras to let you chat naturally with Gemini, take photos and get help. And then there are display AI glasses, which add an in-lens display that privately shows you helpful information, right when you need it, like turn-by-turn navigation or translation captions. The first glasses will arrive next year,” Google writes in the blog.","Google founder Sergey Brin admitted that launching Google Glass was a “mistake” Brin made the remark during a discussion at Stanford University School of Engineering.

Microsoft stakes safety claims as rivals pour billions into AI race

Medical AI and universal basic income : Suleyman’s vision for superintelligence





Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has warned the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.In a recent Bloomberg interview, Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously. “We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.The declaration arrives at a critical juncture for Microsoft’s AI ambitions. After 18 months of contractual restrictions preventing independent pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a new definitive agreement with OpenAI now permits Microsoft to develop superintelligence independently or with third parties. Suleyman, who joined Microsoft in March 2024 after co-founding DeepMind and Inflection, is assembling a dedicated superintelligence team to capitalize on this freedom.Suleyman’s position challenges Silicon Valley’s prevailing rush-to-market mentality. While competitors like OpenAI have committed over $1.5 trillion to data center construction and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg pledges up to $600 billion in AI infrastructure spending, Microsoft is emphasizing caution alongside capability. The company’s 50-year reputation serving 90% of the S&P 500 informs this measured approach, according to Suleyman.The AI chief acknowledged the industry stands at a crossroads, with systems potentially capable of setting their own goals, improving their own code, and acting autonomously emerging within five to ten years. “Those are capabilities that I’ve clearly outlined as increasing the level of risk,” he explained, calling for transparency, audits, and proactive government engagement as these thresholds approach.Despite Microsoft’s stated restraint, internal pressures persist. Recent reports suggest the company’s AI products face adoption challenges, with sales goals for Azure AI reduced across the board. Investors continue demanding clear profitability paths amid billion-dollar investments that show limited immediate returns.Suleyman envisions medical applications as superintelligence’s most promising near-term deployment. Microsoft is developing diagnostic systems capable of identifying rare conditions “significantly better than human performance, more cheaply, with fewer tests and with higher accuracy,” with independent peer review and clinical trials forthcoming. This focus reflects Suleyman’s personal values—his mother worked as a nurse—and his belief that technology should prioritize human wellbeing.Beyond healthcare, Suleyman predicts AI will fundamentally reshape work and society within 20-30 years, potentially sooner. He anticipates machines surpassing human capabilities at most tasks, necessitating universal basic income and wealth redistribution mechanisms to manage workforce displacement. “We already live in a world of abundance, it’s just poorly distributed,” he argued, suggesting AI could proliferate digital goods—ideas, knowledge, intelligence—at unprecedented scale.The executive’s political philosophy diverges sharply from Silicon Valley’s dominant libertarian ethos. Identifying as center-left, Suleyman champions government regulation as essential to AI’s healthy development, comparing it to automotive safety standards. “Cars only work because we have driver training, emissions regulations, streetlights and speed limits,” he noted, calling for financial stability boards, climate-style governance processes, and arms control frameworks adapted for AI.Suleyman’s warnings carry added weight given his insider status among AI’s elite circle. He maintains regular contact with former DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis, now leading Google’s AI efforts, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. While describing the competitive landscape as intense, Suleyman insisted all major players remain “genuinely committed to trying to find the right path through.” Microsoft’s revised OpenAI agreement runs through 2032, granting the company licenses to all OpenAI models while pursuing its own superintelligence development. The tech giant currently operates 33 gigawatts of computing capacity across its data center fleet, positioning it to compete aggressively while maintaining what Suleyman characterizes as ethical guardrails.","Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft’s AI CEO, has warned the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us” The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.

Google on why it has discontinued the Dark web report







Google is retiring its free Dark Web monitoring tool. In a support page, Google announced that it is discontinuing the “Dark Web report” tool. Since the past two years, the tool has been available for free to all Gmail users. Google's ‘Dark Web tool' feature worked by scanning users' email addresses to determine whether they had appeared in data breaches, which often circulate on Dark Web marketplaces. The tool then alerted users about where the data that was exposed in the breach, including any accompanying details such as date of birth, addresses, and phone numbers.Google, however, says that the tool has not been helpful enough. “While the report offered general information, feedback showed that it didn't provide helpful next steps,” says the company on its support page.

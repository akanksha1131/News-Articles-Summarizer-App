Spotify Adds ‘Listening Activity’ and ‘Request to Jam’ features: Here’s how they work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotify-adds-listening-activity-and-request-to-jam-features-heres-how-they-work/articleshow/126399955.cms,"Listening activity on Spotify



Here’s how it works



Users can turn on listening activity via Privacy and social settings, accessible through the side drawer next to the “View profile” button.



Once enabled, activity appears in the chat row of the side drawer and at the top of Messages chats.



If a user taps on their friend or family member’s listening activity, they’ll be able to add tracks to their library, start playback, open the track’s context menu, or react with one of six standard emojis.

Request to jam



Here’s how it works



From a Messages chat, Premium users can tap Jam in the top right corner to send a request for a remote Jam.



Your friend will receive the request and can either accept or decline.



If accepted, the recipient becomes the host of the Jam session. From there, both participants in the Jam can add tracks to a shared queue and listen together.





Spotify has rolled out a new Listening Activity feature which enable users to share what they are streaming in realtime with friends and family via Spotify Messages. Along with this, the music streaming service has also rolled out a Request to Jam feature, a way for Premium users to invite friends into shared listening sessions directly from Messages. “Today, we’re building on that experience with two new Messages features: Listening activity and Request to Jam. Listening activity gives users a real-time look at what music their friends and family are listening to, while Request to Jam makes it easy to quickly turn those moments into shared listening sessions,” the company said in an official blog post.If a user isn’t actively listening, their most recently played track will appear instead. Friends can tap on the activity to add songs to their library, start playback, open the track menu, or react with emojis. Importantly, the feature is opt‑in, giving users full control over whether their listening activity is visible.Listening activity is only shared with people you’ve already messaged on Spotify, and you’re always in control—only the contacts you choose can see your activity, and you can turn it off at any time.“To complement listening activity, we’re making it easier to turn musical moments into shared experiences with Request to Jam, a new way for users to invite friends or family they’re connected with in Messages into a live listening session,” added Spotify.Once accepted, the recipient becomes host of the Jam, and both participants can add tracks to a joint playlist, listen together, and chat in sync. Free users can join a Jam when invited by a Premium subscriber, making the feature accessible to a wider audience. Spotify noted that daily active users of Jam have more than doubled year‑over‑year, highlighting strong demand for collaborative listening.","Spotify has rolled out a new Listening Activity feature which enable users to share what they are streaming in realtime with friends and family via Spotify Messages.

""100 percent made up / speculative / wrong,"" wrote Shaw.

Jobs likely at risk and those stable

Stricter work from office rules





Microsoft is reportedly gearing up for another round of job cuts. According to a report in TipRanks, an investment news website, Microsoft is set to announce layoffs this month. Reports suggest that the company may lay off between 11,000 and 22,000 jobs across various divisions in the third week of January. If the figures turn out to be true, this would be the biggest layoff round yet for the Windows maker. Also, this will be the fourth consecutive January when Microsoft will cut jobs. The layoffs are reportedly related to rising costs of AI investment. Most of that money is said to be going toward data centers, chips, and AI tools.Microsoft is one of the biggest proponents of AI. The software giant spent upwards of $80 billion on the tech last year, and that doesn't seem likely to slow down this year. Analyst projections had previously suggested that Microsoft may need to cut at least 10,000 employees annually just to offset increased capital depreciation costs from data center expansion.In 2023, Microsoft cut 10,000 jobs, reported to be 5% of its workforce. In January 2024, Microsoft gaming team took the major brunt of the hit as Microsoft cut 1,900 employees, around 1% of its workforce. The year 2025 was by far the worst. In January 2025, the company cut off slightly less than 1% of employees, claiming them to be performance-related job cuts. More jobs were cut in May, 3% of the workforce was cut that month, and an even bigger number in July, when Microsoft removed another 4% of its employees. In all, Microsoft cut more than 15,000 jobs across several rounds in 2025. In total, these were likely Microsoft’s largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023.According to Tipranks, reports from workers point to Azure cloud teams, the Xbox gaming unit, and global sales as key teams to be impacted. It further says that ""analysts believe Microsoft is moving funds away from payroll and into long-term tech assets. As a result, middle managers and older product teams may face a higher risk,"" but ""roles tied to AI research and core cloud work are seen as more stable."" Also, ""roles tied to AI research and core cloud work are seen as more stable. This reflects the company’s goal to stay competitive in AI development.""The TipRanks report also reveals that Microsoft plans to enforce stricter office policies starting from February 23, 2026. Employees residing within 50 miles of an office will be required to work on-site for at least three days per week.","Microsoft is reportedly gearing up for another round of job cuts.

What Netflix founder Reed Hastings told co-CEO Ted Sarandos when he spent $100 million on 'House of Cards' series without seeking his permission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-netflix-founder-reed-hastings-told-co-ceo-ted-sarandos-when-he-spent-100-million-on-house-of-cards-series-without-seeking-his-permission/articleshow/126399991.cms,"""Leaders Playbook,""

“When he asked me, ‘Why would you do that?’ I said, ‘Reed, it’s a simple risk-reward for me. If this show fails, we will have dramatically overpaid for a show. We do that all the time, but if it succeeds, we could completely transform the business as we know it.’”

“

I think the lesson that he’s left for me is that you pick the best people, give them the tools to do the best work of their life, and get out of their way.”

Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said he reads this book ‘over and over’

“It doesn't sound like a management story on the surface, but I think it's the most powerful leadership story I've ever read. I read it over and over again because I find ... I get something different in the book every time I read it,”

""Now, what I see is that when you go through life and you go through business, you make a lot of decisions that don't turn out the way you thought they would. The real leadership test is: How do you manage through that?”





Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has revealed a major decision that he took without asking for permission from founder Reed Hastings. In a recent interview, Sarandos said that he once spent $100 million on the series House of Cards without asking Hastings. Sarandos noted that he committed to two seasons of the show as a major financial risk to change the streaming giant's future. When Hastings questioned the decision, Sarandos explained his logic as a simple calculation of potential loss versus potential gain. He also recalled the conversation about the project's high cost. However, this move eventually helped Netflix move from a mail-order service to a leader in original streaming content.In CNBC’sinterview, Sarandos said,Sarandos, who joined Netflix back in 2000, also added that the experience taught him a particular style of leading, which he is still using to date.He said that it was Hastings who showed him how to treat talented employees by trusting them.He said,Sarandos also said he doesn't really read management books. Instead, he reads fiction novels to learn about leadership, he said. His favourite management book: ""Typhoon"", a 1902 novella by Joseph Conrad about a steamship captain and crew navigating a severe storm while at sea.Sarandos noted.When Sarandos first read the book about 20 years ago, he thought the captain was a careless ""hot dog"" who put himself and his family in jeopardy, he said. When he read it more recently, he learnt a more important lesson about leading in the face of conflict and uncertainty.said Sarandos.","Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said he once spent $100 million on the series House of Cards without asking founder Reed Hastings.

Kids cannot be used as lab rats: California lawmaker on proposing bill to ban AI-powered toys,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/kids-cannot-be-used-as-lab-rats-california-lawmaker-on-proposing-bill-to-ban-ai-powered-toys/articleshow/126398985.cms,"AI generated image for representation

Our children cannot be used as lab rats for Big Tech to experiment on.”

“Chatbots and other AI tools may become integral parts of our lives in the future, but the dangers they pose now require us to take bold action to protect our children. Our safety regulations around this kind of technology are in their infancy and will need to grow as exponentially as the capabilities of this technology do. Pausing the sale of these chatbot-integrated toys allows us time to craft the appropriate safety guidelines and framework for these toys to follow.

”

How ChatGPT may be the reason behind California proposing this bill

“AI toy for kids”

“AI-powered product”





California Senator Steve Padilla has introduced a bill that intends to prohibit the manufacture or sale of toys that possess AI chatbot functions for four years. This legislation is called Senate Bill 867. It aims to shield minors from the risks posed by AI chatbot toys until new policies are established by the state. The lawmaker believes that current technology is moving faster than the rules meant to keep it safe. In a statement about the new bill, Senator Padilla said, “He argued that pausing the sale of these toys will give the government time to create proper guidelines for how AI should interact with young users.Commenting on the bill, Padilla said (as reviewed by TechCrunch),This bill follows a major tragedy from last year involving a 16-year-old named Adam Raine. Raine took his own life after having long conversations with ChatGPT about suicide. His family filed a lawsuit against OpenAI , claiming the chatbot acted as a ""coach"" and failed to stop the dangerous discussion. Seven other families have also taken legal action over similar concerns, while OpenAI has denied responsibility and pointed to misuse of the software.Chatbots in toys are not yet widely used, but some early examples have raised concerns. In November 2025, PIRG Education Fund warned that toys such as Kumma, a bear with a built-in chatbot, could easily lead to conversations about matches, knives, and sexual topics.Recently, NBC News also reported that Miiloo, described as anand made by the Chinese company Miriat, sometimes suggested it was programmed to reflect Chinese Communist Party values.OpenAI and Barbie-maker Mattel had planned to launch a ChatGPT-poweredin 2025. However, the product was later delayed by the companies. Neither company even gave a reason for the delay, and it remains unclear whether a toy will be released in 2026.The proposed bill follows a recent executive order from Donald Trump that instructs federal agencies to challenge state AI laws in court while specifically allowing exceptions for rules related to child safety. The legislation also comes after several incidents involving AI, chatbots, and children.Padilla also helped write California’s recently approved SB 243, which requires companies that operate chatbots to implement safeguards to protect children and other vulnerable users.",California Senator Steve Padilla has introduced a bill that intends to prohibit the manufacture or sale of toys that possess AI chatbot functions for four years.

Now you can give yourself a tag that tells the group what your role is, and can be customized for each group you’re in. So you can be “Anna's Dad” in one group, and “Goalkeeper” in another. This feature will be rolling out gradually.

Text stickers: For the messages you want to really stand out, you can now turn any word into a sticker by typing your text into Sticker Search. You can also add newly created stickers directly to your sticker packs instead of having to send them in a chat first.

Event reminders: Now when you create and send an event in your group chat you can set custom early reminders for your invitees. This helps everyone remember to commute to the party you’re hosting or hop on the call at the right time, depending on the event type.





WhatsApp has introduced new features for group chats. The popular instant messaging app revealed that the WhatsApp users will now be able to experience new group features such as member tags, text stickers and event reminders. “Group chats on WhatsApp make it easier to stay connected with the people in your life no matter what device they own – whether it’s sharing New Year’s resolutions, preparing for that special celebration you have coming up, or planning to win your football league.

Randstad CEO’s advice to young people who are about to start college

“People need to reflect on—taking a student loan, going to college and being trained or educated for a profession that is rapidly changing—whether that’s still the right path.

We all grew up, with our parents saying, ‘go do something in college or university and then do something in an office,’ that path that used to work for a long time is starting to break. You already see that with the graduates finding it harder to find a job.

You see that in professions like marketing, communications, design… just look at how good AI already is at some of that.”

Randstad CEO Sander van ’t Noordende has a warning about the rapidly changing job market. The chief executive of the world’s biggest talent company agrees that the white-collar job market is currently frozen and the traditional path from college to an office is “dead”. In a recent interview, van ’t Noordende warned that as artificial intelligence (AI) is absorbing entry-level office roles, many young people have fewer options. He suggested that the future of work is shifting toward skilled trades and technical roles rather than desk jobs.In an interview with Fortune, van ’t Noordende explained:As the white-collar job market appears to be stuck, van 't Noordende said it's no longerto tell young people to follow their passions.he noted.This warning comes as tech leaders have repeatedly warned that AI is already performing as well as entry-level workers and could reduce white-collar jobs by half by 2030. A recentStanford University study found that the new technology is already having aon Gen Z. Roles like bartenders and baristas are now seeing bigger pay increases than office workers.To support his point, van ’t Noordende pointed to a recent move by the UK government, which announced plans to spend $965 million on apprenticeships. The aim is to help tens of thousands of unemployed young people move into jobs seen as necessary for the future, mainly in hospitality, retail and AI.Advising young people who are about to start college, van ’t Noordende said,For people who are set on going to college, van ’t Noordende said STEM subjects are still likely to be in demand.

"CEO Jensen Huang confirms, Nvidia’s $500 billion AI demand outlook won't …",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ceo-jensen-huang-confirms-nvidias-500-billion-ai-demand-outlook-wont-/articleshow/126396019.cms,"Nvidia CFO: The Figure Has Already Grown



Nvidia’s Rubin chip explained







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has now confirmed that the company’s $500 billion AI demand outlook will not get revised quarter by quarter, even as new developments continue to push expectations higher. Speaking in an interview with CNBC’s Kim Leswing at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026 in Las Vegas, US Huang said that the figure reflects that Nvidia already sees on its books across 2025 and 2026, but added that “many new developments should increase our expectation,” signaling upside beyond the headline number.The visibility incorporates demand for Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs, next-generation Vera Rubin chips, and related systems and networking hardware. Huang also stressed on the fact that the figure represents locked-in business and not speculative projections, underscoring Nvidia’s confidence in its pipeline.Nvidia CFO Colette Kress reinforced Huang’s comments, noting that the $500 billion visibility has already increased since the company’s GTC conference in October. “So yes, that $500 billion has definitely gotten larger,” Kress said, adding that Nvidia is already seeing orders for Rubin chips as customers plan full‑year volumes.Those customers include major cloud service providers, AI model developers, and neoclouds, signaling that demand for Nvidia’s next‑generation platforms is being locked in well ahead of launch.Along with this, Huang also pointed to the rapid increase of open-source AI models as a surprise driver of demand. Models such as DeepSeek, Qwen, and Meta’s Llama are now generating roughly one in four tokens, he said. Rather than reducing compute needs, the spread of open models has expanded overall usage, fueling more demand for Nvidia’s chips.This trend is reinforced by major partnerships. In November 2025, Microsoft and Nvidia announced a strategic collaboration with Anthropic, including a combined $15 billion investment in the AI startup.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the Rubin chips as the successor to the Blackwell architecture. Huang claimed that the Rubin chips will offer five times more performance. Vera Rubin is Nvidia’s first six-chip AI platform developed using an “extreme codesign” approach, where multiple components are designed together. The platform includes Rubin GPUs, Vera CPUs, NVLink 6 networking, Spectrum-X Ethernet Photonics, ConnectX-9 networking cards and BlueField-4 data processing units. Nvidia said this design helps reduce bottlenecks and improve performance for large AI workloads.The Rubin GPU delivers up to 50 petaflops of inference performance using NVFP4 precision. The Vera CPU is designed to handle data movement and AI agent processing tasks.

What is Nvidia Alpamayo AI and what CEO Jensen Huang said about it

""thinking and reasoning""

""We open source to everyone, so if a customer would like to use our model that we train, they're welcome to do that,""

""We just want to enable the world's autonomous industry. Everything that moves should be autonomous,""

""first and only consumer of HBM4,""

""We're not expecting anybody else to be using HBM4 for some time. So we have the benefit of being the primary and the only consumer of HBM4,""

""Our demand is so high, every factory, every HBM supplier is gearing up and we're all doing great,”

""This is quite a perfect example of the type of the work we do together. This realisation of the digital twin idea, that you would design every aspect of engineering, it's not just the CAD, but the computing, the electronics, all of it would be integrated and built into a digital twin. It would of course run all of the software in the digital twin, and in the future, I hope the digital twin of the ship, we'll actually put it in the ocean, a virtual simulation of the ocean, and see it completely operate,” ​​





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met privately with the heads of Mercedes-Benz and Hyundai at CES 2026, a report claims. This meeting took place just after the chipmaking giant announced Alpamayo, its first self-driving-car technology. The timing of Hyundai Executive Chair Euisun Chung's meeting has raised questions about whether Hyundai may use Nvidia's new system in its own cars.According to a report by Korea JoongAng Daily, Hyundai has spent heavily on self-driving technology for years but still trails rivals like Tesla, which already offers more advanced features. The Korean carmaker aims to add Level 2+ self-driving capabilities to its regular cars by the end of 2027.The report claims ​​that Hyundai has already shown interest in working more closely with Nvidia. The automaker previously announced plans to buy 50,000 of Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs) to help develop self-driving cars and robotics.Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz has moved faster in this area and has become the first carmaker to use Nvidia's Alpamayo AI. The first Nvidia AI-powered self-driving vehicle will be Mercedes-Benz's upcoming CLA model, which is planned to hit US roads in the first quarter of the year, followed by Europe in the second quarter and Asia in the third quarter.Nvidia’s Alpamayo is a family of open-source AI models described as the world's firstself-driving car AI. It will introduce vision-language-action, or VLA, models that help self-driving systems understand what they see, think through difficult driving situations, and perform exact driving moves.

How Google is crushing OpenAI



Google shares jump 60%-plus this year, powered by Gemini and more







Google’s Gemini 3 has once again emerged as a formidable rival of OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT. The Google chatbot has managed to deliver superior results across reasoning, coding and multimodal benchmarking. As per industry analysts, Gemini 3 has consistently outperformed ChatGPT in MMLU reasoning tasks, programming accuracy and multimodal comprehension, making Google has the new leader in the AI model performance. The numbers clearly highlight this shift. According to data by Similarweb, ChatGPT’s seven‑day average visitors fell by about 22% over six weeks, dropping from nearly 203 million to 158 million. During the same period, Gemini’s traffic surged, with 28% month‑over‑month growth in December 2025. Gemini now commands close to 40% of ChatGPT’s web audience size, a remarkable feat given its recent launch. While ChatGPT still leads in absolute traffic, the downward trend is alarming for OpenAI.Tech researcher Rihard Jarc said in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), “You can feel the code RED here. $GOOGL is absolutely CRUSHING it with Gemini 3! Gemini's market share is now 21.5%. 3 months ago: 12.9% 12 months ago: 5.7%.”This surge in traffic is said to have come directly at the expense of OpenAI's ChatGPT. As per Similarweb data, ChatGPT has seen its hold on the market loosen significantly -- once commanding an 87.2% share, ChatGPT has slid to 68%, which is a staggering 19% drop.Faced with Google’s momentum, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly declared a “Code Red” in late 2025. Internal memos revealed that Altman ordered teams to pause monetization projects — including ads, shopping assistants, and personal agents — to focus entirely on improving ChatGPT’s core capabilities. He described the situation as “existential,” underscoring the urgency of closing the gap with Google’s Gemini.- Integration Advantage: Gemini is seamlessly embedded across Google’s ecosystem, giving it instant distribution.- Hardware Synergy: Google’s TPU v5 chips are optimised for Gemini workloads, reducing costs and boosting performance.- Enterprise Trust: Google’s compliance standards and cloud infrastructure appeal to large corporations, where OpenAI has struggled to expand.- Research Depth: Google DeepMind and Google Research provide a steady pipeline of breakthroughs feeding directly into Gemini.Wall Street too seems to have given Google's Gemini success a huge applause. Shares of Google-parent Alphabet are on track to become the best annual performer within the ""Magnificent Seven"" for the first time, gaining 65.6% since the beginning of the year. Adoption of Gemini has become a key signal for Google’s position in the AI race. Bank of America’s Justin Post wrote in a December note that “we see potential for Gemini to be seen as a demand generator for Search and Google Cloud. ” Google's image-editing tool Nano Banana, released in September, too helped Gemini climb in popularity earlier this year.In its third quarter earnings, Google’s parent company Alphabet announced that its Gemini app now has 650 million monthly active users, up from 450 million in July.","Gemini 3 has consistently outperformed ChatGPT in MMLU reasoning tasks, programming accuracy and multimodal comprehension.

Durov didn’t hold back in criticizing the EU's privacy laws, declaring them to be a 'direct attack on personal freedom.

Telegram CEO: ‘War against privacy never stops in the EU’





Telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov has a ‘late’ Christmas message for his followers. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) nearly two weeks after Christmas, Durov writes: “This year, I wish you less — less information, less food, less entertainment, less communication, less stimulation. ” “You already have too much of all that, and it stands in the way of your serenity, health, sleep, and creativity. Merry Christmas!,” he says.Pavel Durov’s Christmas message sparked mixed reactions from users with some agreeing with him, while others noting its timing. Commenting on the post, one user wrote “Merry Christmas in January??”. “Isnt it too late to say Merry Christmas?,” asked another user. A third commented asking “Is your scheduled send running 2 weeks late?”. “ChRiTmAs Is OveR…get your eduction up,” said a fourth.“TLDR: may you be less of a dopamine junkie!,” said another user.In another post, Durov said that the war against privacy never ends in the EU. He was responding to a post about the enforcement of DAC8 in the EU. For those unaware, DAC8 refers primarily to the eighth amendment to the European Union's Directive on Administrative Cooperation that introduces mandatory reporting and automatic exchange of information for crypto-asset transactions.“The war against privacy never stops in the EU. It’s all for their own good, of course. Who knows what those sneaky Europeans can be up to without more surveillance?,” Durov wrote in the post.In another news, Durova recently offered to cover IVF treatments for women willing to use his donated sperm—and promised their children an equal share of his $17 billion fortune, provided they could prove their DNA connection to him, according to Wall Street Journal. The 41-year-old Russian-born tech entrepreneur revealed in July 2024 that he had fathered over 100 biological children across at least 12 countries through sperm donation. Durov began donating sperm around 2010, initially to help a friend conceive before transitioning to anonymous donations at Moscow's AltraVita fertility clinic.","Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has a ‘late’ Christmas message for his followers.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently appeared on the Moonshots podcast where he jokingly says that China goes everything he says. Discussing energy usage of data centres and reliance on batteries to meet power needs, Musk said “It seems like China listens to everything I say, and does it basically or they’re just doing it independently. ” “I don’t know, but they certainly have a massive battery pack output, they’re making a vast number of electric cars, and vast amounts of solar,” he stated, adding “These are all the things I said we should do here”.Musk’s comments underscores China's dominance in scaling electric vehicles, batteries, and solar power. According to data, the country produced 13 million EVs in 2024 with 70% year-over-year growth since 2020, capturing 69% of the global EV battery market via leaders like CATL and BYD.Notably, Musk has frequently shared X (Twitter) posts calling for increased reliance on solar energy for power generation. In 2024, he warned that China's solar power generation is rapidly expanding, potentially surpassing the entire US electricity output within four years.When asked about energy solutions for increasing power needs in the AI era, Musk said ""the best way to actually increase the energy output per year of the United States or any country is batteries.”“Peak power output of the US is around 1.1 terawatts, but the average power usage is only half a terowatt. So if you just buffer the energy, charge up the batteries at night, discharge during the day without incremental capital expenditures, without building new power plants, you can double the energy throughput of the US. ”At this point, the host asks Musk if such batteries are under development. To this, the Tesla CEO says “yeah, Tesla makes them”, highlighting Megapacks. For those unaware, Megapack is a utility-scale battery that provides reliable energy storage, to stabilize the grid and prevents outages. His AI company xAI has added 168 Megapacks at its data center in South Memphis, Tennessee.In September 2025, Tesla also introduced Megablock, a grouping of four Megapack 3 units that can store 20 megawatt-hours, enough to run around 4,000 homes for four hours.","Elon Musk says China is doing all the things he said we should do in the U.S. The Tesla CEO was speaking on the Moonshots podcast.

What is CNAP and how it works

Calling Party is the originating party.

Called Party is the terminating party. The CNAP service is provided to the called party.

Calling Name Information of the calling party includes either the calling name identity or an indication of privacy or unavailability.

CNAP is applicable to all telecommunication services except Short Message Service.

CNAP rollout in India

Why Calling Name Presentation (CNAP)

Smartphone users rely on third-party apps to identify caller name

How is CNAP different from Truecaller

FAQs: Calling Name Presentation (CNAP) explained

What is CNAP?

CNAP, or Calling Name Presentation, is a telecom feature that shows the registered name of the caller along with the phone number when you receive a call. It works directly through telecom networks and does not require any app.

Why was CNAP introduced?

CNAP was introduced to help users identify unknown callers more easily. Regulators found that many people avoid answering calls from unknown numbers due to spam, robocalls and fraud. As a result, even genuine calls often go unanswered.

How is CNAP different from the existing caller ID service?

The current caller ID service only shows the phone number of the caller. CNAP goes a step further by displaying the name of the caller, making it easier to recognise who is calling.

How does CNAP get the caller’s name?

Telecom companies use the name submitted during SIM card registration, based on official KYC documents. When a call is made, the network fetches this name and shows it on the receiver’s phone.

Does CNAP require internet or a mobile app?

No. CNAP works at the network level. It does not need internet access or third-party apps.

When did CNAP roll out in India?

CNAP was first launched as a pilot in October 2025. A phased rollout is underway, with nationwide implementation expected by March 31, 2026 for 4G and 5G users.

Will CNAP work on all phones?

Not immediately. Some smartphones already support CNAP, while others may need software updates. Many older landline phones may not support it due to lack of alphanumeric displays.

Is CNAP enabled by default?

Yes, CNAP is currently enabled by default. However, users who do not want their name to appear can hide it using caller ID restriction (CLIR) settings.

Will CNAP stop spam and fraud calls?

CNAP does not block calls, but it helps users identify callers more clearly. This may reduce the chances of answering spam or fraudulent calls.

How is CNAP different from Truecaller?

CNAP shows verified names from telecom records and works without an app. Truecaller is a third-party app that relies on crowdsourced data, needs internet access, and may not always show accurate names. Truecaller also offers spam tagging, which CNAP does not currently provide.





If you have started seeing a name appear on your smartphone screen every time you receive a call from an unknown number, then you are not alone. Many mobile users across India have noticed this change in the recent weeks, even when the caller’s number is not saved in their contacts. The update is linked to the phased rollout of Calling Name Presentation (CNAP), a new telecom feature being introduced following directions from the Department of Telecom (DoT) and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).The change marks a shift from the existing caller ID system, which only shows a phone number. With CNAP, users can now see the registered name of the caller, making it easier to decide whether to answer a call or not. The move comes as concerns around spam calls, robocalls and phone-based fraud continue to rise, with many users choosing to ignore calls from unknown numbers altogether.The feature is being rolled out in phases on 4G and 5G networks and is expected to be available nationwide by March 31, 2026. Here is what has changed, how CNAP works, and how it is different from apps like Truecaller.The European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) defines CNAP as a supplementary service that enables the called party to receive the calling name information of the calling party. Some of the parameters of CNAP as defined by ETSI are:The name identity is made up of the following information unit: - The name of the mobile subscriber for the purpose of calling name presentation - up to 80 characters of information associated with a specific calling party.The calling name identity is the name identity of the calling party.”In addition to or instead of the name identity, the network may give a Presentation Indicator (PI) to the called mobile subscriber of the CNAP service. The following information may be given :- Presentation Indicator (PI) showing: a) presentation restricted, or b) name unavailable. The name identity of a PLMN subscriber shall always be provided by the network.”In its 2022 consultation paper, TRAI listed some of the limitations that may impact the implementation of CNAP. It said:“Mobile telephone consumers make use of a variety of feature-phones and smartphones of different makes and models. TRAI said that while some mobile handsets could already be supporting CNAP feature, the other handsets might require software upgrades to enable CNAP feature on them. Some landline telephone sets in use have the alphanumeric display feature while many others do not. In case CNAP service is introduced in the Indian telecommunication network, the manufacturers of mobile handsets and landline telephone sets may have to enable the CNAP feature in their future supplies. ”CNAP framework is currently being rolled out in phases across the country for 4G and 5G networks. The feature was first launched in pilot in October 2025, with an all-India rollout expected by March 31, 2026. An Economic Times quotes DoT sources which said that Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio have already started the CNAP pilot in Haryana.CNAP works directly through telecom networks, thus reducing the dependency on mobile apps or internet access. Telecom companies use their own records to match a phone number with the name registered at the time a SIM card was issued, based on official identity documents. When a call is made, this information is pulled from the network and shown on the receiver’s screen.While it is enabled by default for users right now, those who do not want their name to appear on outgoing calls can choose to hide it using existing caller ID restriction options.The feature is meant to provide a common and verified caller name system across all networks, helping users identify calls more easily. Telecom equipment makers have been asked to ensure that mobile phones support the feature within a few months of its nationwide rollout.At present, all access service providers in India provide Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP) supplementary service, as a part of their bouquet of services to telephone consumers. When a telephone consumer receives an incoming call, the telephone number of the calling party is displayed on the called party’s telephone (mobile handset/ landline telephone set), through the CLIP service. The telephone consumers require that they should be able to correctly identify the calling party.As per a TRAI consultation paper, the CLIP service does not adequately meet this requirement as this service presents only the telephone number of the calling party. “Apparently, the said requirement may be met through a name presentation facility where the name identity of the calling party is displayed on the called party’s telephone,” the telecom body said.In its consultation paper, TRAI says that consumers have raised a concern that in absence of the calling party name presentation facility, they prefer not to attend calls from unknown telephone numbers, as most of such calls are unsolicited commercial communications (UCCs) from un-registered telemarketers. “As a result, even genuine telephone calls go unanswered.”Consumers have also raised their concern in respect of robocalls, spam calls, and fraudulent calls. Robocalls are calls made automatically by IT-enabled systems mainly to financially dupe telephone consumers. Spam calls are unsolicited marketing calls from personal mobile connections, bypassing the do-not-disturb (DND) feature, and targeting many telephone consumers. Through fraudulent calls, certain individuals attempt to obtain details of bank account/ onetime-password (OTP) with an aim to defraud consumers.At present, smartphone users make use of native smartphone tools and third-party apps like Truecaller to identify the calling party name and mark spam calls. Apple (manufacturer of iPhones) has a ‘silence unknown numbers’ feature on its mobile handsets, while the Google Phone app for Android has a ‘caller ID and spam’ protection option that allows phone users to mark incoming calls as spam.TRAI says that the native smartphone tools and third-party apps, generally, provide name identification services based on crowd-sourced data. However, the crowd-sourced name identity information may not be reliable, in many instances.Both CNAP and Truecaller show a caller’s name, but they work in very different ways. A CNAP is a network-based service that shows the caller’s registered name taken from official KYC records submitted when a SIM card is issued. CNAP does not require an app. It does not use the internet, and works the same way across networks.While Truecaller is a third-party app that relies mainly on crowdsource database, where names are collected from users’ contact lists and reports. This means the displayed name may not always be accurate or verified. Truecaller also needs internet access and user permission to access contacts.In short, CNAP offers a verified, built-in caller name service controlled by telecom operators, while Truecaller is an app-based solution that depends on user data and online access. Further, Truecaller offers real-time spam lists and community flags that CNAP may not.","Calling Name Presentation (CNAP) is a telecom feature that shows the registered name of the caller along with the phone number.

This move, completed by late December 2025, precedes a potential state wealth tax on billionaires. Other tech figures are also exploring exits, citing privacy and financial advantages.

California's billionaire tax sparks tech exodus

Privacy and business advantages drive Delaware shift





Google cofounder Larry Page has severed his business connections with California, ending a decades-long relationship with the state that helped birth his tech empire. The billionaire moved several key business entities out of California by late December 2025, according to filings reviewed by Business Insider, beating a critical year-end deadline tied to the state's proposed wealth tax.Page converted his family office, Koop, from California to Delaware incorporation in late December, Business Insider reported. Several other entities followed suit, including Flu Lab LLC—which funds his influenza research—and One Aero, his flying car venture. Both now list principal addresses outside California, in Nevada and Florida respectively. A source close to Page confirmed to Business Insider that the Google cofounder had already left the state, though whether the move is permanent remains unclear.The mass restructuring comes as California debates a controversial ballot measure that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth over $1 billion. If voters approve the measure in November 2026, it would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026. For Page—currently ranked the second-richest person globally by Bloomberg's Billionaires Index—that could mean a tax bill exceeding $12 billion.The New York Times reported in December that Page told associates he was considering relocating to Florida specifically because of this proposal. He's not alone in his concerns. Fellow tech billionaire Peter Thiel has opened a Miami office for his investment firm, Thiel Capital, while venture capitalist David Sacks launched operations in Austin, Texas.The proposed tax, backed by healthcare union SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, aims to raise $100 billion over five years from California's approximately 200 billionaires. Supporters argue the revenue would offset anticipated federal budget cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance programs.Beyond tax concerns, Delaware offers significant advantages for wealthy individuals seeking privacy. The state doesn't require LLCs to disclose directors' names and addresses when incorporating, providing an extra layer of anonymity—something particularly valued by Page, whose family office operates under exceptional secrecy managed by CEO Wayne Osborne.Page also converted LLCs previously used to purchase islands in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Fiji from California to Delaware. Even his wife Lucinda Southworth's marine conservation charity, Oceankind, made the switch in December.California Governor Gavin Newsom has opposed the wealth tax proposal, warning it would trigger an exodus of the state's wealthiest residents. The ballot measure still needs 870,000 signatures to qualify for November's vote. However, billionaires aren't waiting to see if it passes—they're protecting their assets now and potentially bidding Silicon Valley goodbye.","Google cofounder Larry Page moved several key business entities out of California by late December 2025, beating a critical year-end deadline.

"AMD CEO Lisa Su says: AI has not slowed hiring at AMD, just that we are now hiring different people. We’re hiring people who are AI forward",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amd-ceo-lisa-su-says-ai-has-not-slowed-hiring-at-amd-just-that-we-are-now-hiring-different-people-were-hiring-people-who-are-ai-forward/articleshow/126386121.cms,"‘AI is augmenting our capabilities’

What Lisa Su said about the AI revolution





AMD CEO Lisa Su recently spoke about the impact of AI on hiring. Speaking at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026 in Las Vegas, US, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su said that artificial intelligence has now slowed down the hiring process at the chipmaker. She emphasised that AMD is actively expanding its workforce and is prioritising the candidates who are ‘AI forward’. “We’re actually not hiring fewer people,” Su told CNBC’s Jon Fortt. “Frankly, we’re growing very significantly as a company, so we actually are hiring lots of people, but we’re hiring different people. We’re hiring people who are AI forward.”AMD is known for designing graphic processing units (GPUs) that help in training AI workloads, placing the company at the center of the global AI race. While, chipset maker Nvidia is dominating the AI chip market presently with more than 90% share, AMD is also aggressively positioning itself as s challenger and is incorporating AI into how it builds, designs, manufactures and tests chips.n Su stressed that candidates who ‘truly embrace’ AI are the ones being prioritised in hiring. This practice reflects on the company’s shift forward embedding AI across its operations.Su also pushed back against the concerns that the adoption of AI could lead to job cuts. Instead she believes that AI helps in increasing productivity. “AI is augmenting our capabilities. It’s not replacing people, it’s actually just augmenting our productivity in terms of the number of products we can bring up at any given time.”As of December 2024, AMD employed roughly 28,000 people worldwide, according to SEC filings. Su said the company continues to grow “very significantly,” underscoring that AI is reshaping the type of talent AMD seeks rather than reducing overall headcount.Last year, Su mentioned that she believes in AGI but not that AI will surpass human intelligence, and she isn’t concerned about doomsday scenarios. She sees technology’s value as dependent on the people who create and guide it, and thinks AI isn’t “great” yet. For her, AI becomes great when it can solve complicated problems. She higlighted that current AI agents mostly handle mundane tasks.“I think there are two directions AI goes. One is pure productivity, you know, how do I remove some of, let’s call it, the menial work that people do, so that they can work on more interesting things? That’s one aspect of it, and we’re using that. But the other aspect of it is when AI can solve really hard problems. It can take what would’ve taken us 10 years to figure out and do that in six months. I think about a world where it normally takes us three years to design a chip, and what does that look like if I could do that in six months?” she added.Comparing the AI revolution with the Internet revolution, Su noted: “The internet is not a bad comparison, but I think AI is much more than the internet. Because, if you think about it, the internet was a lot about moving traffic. AI is more about something foundational in terms of productivity. Sometimes people compare it to the Industrial Revolution, and that’s not a bad comparison, actually.”",Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su said that artificial intelligence has now slowed down the hiring process at the chipmaker.

Meta's most-famous former employee Yann LeCun to everyone in the technology industry: Everything you know about and are working on AI is WRONG,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/metas-most-famous-former-employee-yann-lecun-to-everyone-in-the-technology-industry-everything-you-know-about-and-are-working-on-ai-is-wrong/articleshow/126386140.cms,"Meta's former AI chief, Yann LeCun, declared Large Language Models (LLMs) a 'dead end' for achieving superintelligence. He advocates for 'world models' that learn from physical reality, not just language, to build advanced machine intelligence. LeCun's departure from Meta was reportedly due to internal disagreements over the company's LLM-centric superintelligence push, despite CEO Mark Zuckerberg's support for his research.





Meta’s former chief AI scientist, Yann Lecun has a message for everyone in the technology industry: The AI buzzword almost every company believes in-- Large Language Model or LLM -- is a dead-end. In an interview to Financial Times, Lecun said, ""LLMs are useful but fundamentally limited and constrained by language. To achieve human-level intelligence, you have to understand how our physical world works too."" He added that “LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence.”This is not the first time that LeCun has spoken against LLMs. The man also known as Godfather of AI has been quite vocal about his disdain for large language models (LLMs) and their potential to reach superhuman intelligence. LeCun's solution for achieving superhuman intelligence relies on an architecture called V-JEPA, a so-called world model. ""World models aim to understand the physical world by learning from videos and spatial data, rather than just language. They are also able to plan, reason and have persistent memory. He calls this kind of intelligence Advanced Machine Intelligence, or AMI,"" he said.Though LeCunn did not clearly say why he left Meta. He did say that staying became politically difficult. Meta's ex-employee said that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg likes his world model research, ""but the crowd who were hired for the company’s new superintelligence push are “completely LLM-pilled”.Here LeCunn meant the team that joined Meta from ScaleAI. In June 2025, Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs. The new AI superintelligence project is led by execs including Scale AI ex-CEO Alexandr Wang. Earlier in June, the company said it would hire Wang, now Meta’s chief AI officer, and some of his colleagues as part of a $14.3 billion investment into Scale AI.Under the restructuring announced by Zuckerberg, LeCun was made to report to Alex Wang. This clearly alienated LeCun. “I’m sure there’s a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence,” he says. “But I’m not gonna change my mind because some dude thinks I’m wrong. I’m not wrong. My integrity as a scientist cannot allow me to do this. ”","Yann LeCun, Meta's former AI chief, declared Large Language Models (LLMs) a 'dead end' for achieving superintelligence.

Read AT&T CEO John Stankey's memo to employees here

To: All Employees

I'd like to share some exciting news about the future of AT&T and how we work together.

After nearly a year of consideration, deliberation and planning, we have made the decision to invest in our employee experience and construct a new global headquarters at 5400 Legacy Drive in Plano, Texas.

Spanning across 54 acres of land, this location will provide us with the necessary room to cost effectively consolidate all Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex administrative space, including our three largest locations in Central Dallas, Plano and Irving, and create a corporate campus designed for collaboration, innovation and engagement.

The nature of the company and our work have both evolved significantly since we moved our headquarters to Dallas in 2008, but what hasn't changed is our belief and confidence in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex as the right place to operate a thriving multinational corporation. We are targeting partial occupancy in the new space as early as the second half of 2028.

Over the next few years, we'll be transforming this site from the ground up - demolishing the old buildings and designing a new, modern campus that's built for how we work best: together.

This is an investment intended to put the employee experience at the center of our workspace.

In last year's employee survey, you shared your expectations for professional, well-maintained and functional workspaces. We made a commitment to invest in our workspaces to bring them to a common standard, notably in Atlanta, GA, Chantilly, VA and Bedminster, NJ, to name just a few locations. We will continue to evaluate and invest in our workspaces around the country as our business needs evolve and change.

I am sure this news triggers many questions and natural curiosity for nearly everyone. I am also sure that it will trigger speculation and editorial narrative by those outside the company. I'd ask for patience in getting the answers to your questions and suggest you ignore speculation from uninformed ""sources"" who are not participating in this work.

The planning team intends to share more information in a structured manner in the spring, which is when we will have more definitive answers and executional plans. While the small group of individuals responsible for this effort work to deliver the project on schedule and on budget, I ask that the rest of us continue to focus on delivering for our customers every day. This is just the start, and as this multi-year effort progresses, we promise to keep you informed in a timely manner.

I hope you share my excitement and anticipation for what lies ahead.

John

How the investment scams on matrimonial platforms work



How to stay safe



Verify the person's identity: Do background checks. Use a reverse image search on their photos to see if they are stolen from the internet.

Protect your personal information: Don’t share private personal details, photos, or financial information with anyone you haven’t met in person.

Invest after verification: Do not transfer money to someone online without verifying their identity. If an investment scheme appears too good to be true and providing unrealistic returns in very short span of time, avoid investing money.





The Indian government has issued an advisory warning against two kinds of scams — one is a WhatsApp web account renting scam and other is a type of investment scam happening on matrimonial websites. The advisory has been issued by the National Cybercrime Threat Analytics Unit of Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). According to the advisory, certain Facebook & Instagram accounts are publishing advertisements that claim users can “earn cash automatically” by linking their WhatsApp accounts with their platform. These advertisements redirect users to fraud Web pages or Android mobile applications (.apk) that imitate legitimate earning platforms.On the other hand, fraudsters are also creating fake profiles on matrimonial platforms like Jeevansaathi.com, Shaadi.com, Matrimony.com etc. or dating platforms (Tinder, Bumble, Ok Cupid etc.) to emotionally deceive and financially exploit individuals who are genuinely seeking relationships or marriage.The National Cybercrime Threat Analytics Unit of I4C has identified an emerging transnational crime trend where certain Facebook & Instagram accounts are publishing advertisements that claim users can “earn cash automatically” by linking their WhatsApp accounts with their platform. These advertisementsredirect users to fraud Web pages or Android mobile applications (.apk) that imitate legitimate earning platforms.Unsuspecting individuals are lured by promises of high commissions and passive income, and are instructed to connect their WhatsApp accounts through QR codes.This campaign is orchestrated by threat actors to exploit WhatsApp’s linked device feature which allows web based access to WhatsApp. Such accounts are effectively being rented out as “mule WhatsApp accounts”, which may subsequently be used for illegal activities such as fraud, scams, or dissemination of malicious content.The advisory lists some of the precautionary steps that can be taken to avoid online frauds like USSD-based call forwarding scams. These are:• Renting WhatsApp account and receiving illicit funds can lead to legal consequences, including arrest.• Avoid installing APKs from unknown sources.• Be cautious of Meta Ads that promise quick income, referral commissions, or automatic cash earnings (specially related to stock market investment).• Periodically check for suspicious devices linked to your WhatsApp by navigating to Linked Devices.National Cybercrime Threat Analytics Unit of I4C has identified a rise in misuse of matrimony platforms leading to investment scams.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is impressed by the Chinese company that made Nvidia 'poorer' by $580 billion in one single day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-is-impressed-by-the-chinese-company-that-made-nvidia-poorer-by-580-billion-in-one-single-day/articleshow/126372898.cms,"Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang lauded Chinese AI startup DeepSeek for its role in advancing open-source AI, despite its model causing a massive market value drop. Huang highlighted DeepSeek's efficient use of older chips, proving AI breakthroughs don't solely depend on cutting-edge hardware. Nvidia, meanwhile, is pushing forward with its powerful new Vera Rubin platform, anticipating continued growth in AI infrastructure.

Jensen Huang says DeepSeek turbocharged the open-source movement

Nvidia bets big on next-generation chips





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has nothing but admiration for DeepSeek—the Chinese AI startup that wiped nearly $600 billion off his company's market value in a single day last January.Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on January 5, Huang credited DeepSeek with ""activating"" a global shift toward open-source artificial intelligence, calling the company's work ""really, really exciting"" and saying Nvidia was ""so happy with it. ""The praise comes almost a year after DeepSeek's R1 model sparked panic among investors in January 2025. The Chinese startup claimed it had developed a competitive AI model using just 2,048 of Nvidia's older H800 chips—costing under $6 million and taking only two months. By comparison, US companies were spending tens of millions on thousands of Nvidia's most advanced chips for similar results.The news triggered a bloodbath on Wall Street. Nvidia's stock crashed 17% on January 27, 2025, and the chipmaker lost roughly $593 billion—a record-breaking single-day loss for any US company. The sell-off rippled across the tech sector, with chip stocks and AI-related companies plummeting as investors suddenly questioned whether Big Tech's massive AI spending spree made sense anymore.But Huang has consistently defended DeepSeek's achievements, arguing the market got it wrong. At CES 2026, he doubled down on that position, saying DeepSeek's R1 model ""caught the world by surprise"" and was helping revolutionize AI development globally.""We saw the advance of DeepSeek R1, the first open model that's a reasoning system,"" Huang told the audience. He emphasized that open-source models were rapidly closing the performance gap with proprietary ""frontier"" models from companies like OpenAI and Google Huang highlighted that Chinese developers—working under US chip export restrictions—had proven that AI breakthroughs don't necessarily require unlimited computing resources. DeepSeek had stockpiled H800, a rather older generation of chips, before a 2023 US export ban, showing that smart engineering could compensate for hardware limitations.In the aftermath of last January's market chaos, Huang had argued that DeepSeek's reasoning models would actually require ""100 times more computing"" than non-reasoning AI, suggesting increased chip demand ahead. But DeepSeek appears determined to prove otherwise. The startup kicked off 2026 with a technical paper proposing a rethink of fundamental AI training architecture—a method called Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections aimed at making models even more cost-effective while keeping pace with better-funded US rivals.Despite the DeepSeek disruption, Nvidia remains bullish about AI's future. At CES, Huang unveiled the company's next-generation Vera Rubin platform, which he said would deliver five times the computing power of previous products and is now in ""full production.""The new flagship servers will contain 72 graphics processing units and 36 central processing units, capable of linking into ""pods"" with over 1,000 Rubin chips. Huang said demand from Chinese customers for Nvidia's H200 chips remains ""strong,"" even as the company navigates US export controls.Nvidia's stock has largely recovered from the January selloff, validating Huang's long-term view that AI infrastructure spending will continue growing regardless of efficiency breakthroughs.","Jensen Huang says DeepSeek's R1 model ""caught the world by surprise"" The Chinese startup claimed it had developed a competitive AI model using just 2,048 of Nvidia's older H800 chips.

Elon Musk agrees with JK Rowling's post stating 'Sex is real and matters',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-agrees-with-jk-rowlings-post-stating-sex-is-real-and-matters/articleshow/117992401.cms,"What JK Rowling said on gender ideology

Here‚Äôs the full text of her post

This 'why do you care about a tiny fraction of the population?' line is, and always was, utterly ridiculous.

Gender ideology has undermined

freedom of speech

, scientific truth, gay rights, and women's and girls' safety, privacy and dignity. It's also caused irreparable physical damage to vulnerable kids.

Nobody voted for it, the vast majority of people disagree with it, yet it has been imposed, top down, by politicians, healthcare bodies, academia, sections of the media, celebrities and even the police. Its activists have threatened and enacted violence on those who've dared oppose it. People have been defamed and discriminated against for questioning it. Jobs have been lost and lives have been ruined, all for the crime of knowing that sex is real and matters.

When the smoke clears, it will be only too evident that this was never about a so-called vulnerable minority, notwithstanding the fact that some very vulnerable people have been harmed. The power dynamics underpinning our society have been reinforced, not dismantled. The loudest voices throughout this entire fiasco have been people insulated from consequences by their wealth and/or status. They aren't likely to find themselves locked in a prison cell with a 6'4"" rapist who's decided his name's now Dolores. They don't need state-funded rape crisis centres, nor do they ever frequent high street changing rooms. They simper from talk show sofas about those nasty far-right bigots who don't want penises swinging around the girls' showers, secure in the knowledge that their private pool remains the safe place it always was.

Those who've benefited most from gender identity ideology are men, both trans-identified and not. Some have been rewarded for having a cross-dressing kink by access to all spaces previously reserved for women. Others have parlayed their delicious new victim status into an excuse to threaten, assault and harass women. Non-trans-identified leftybros have found a magnificent platform from which to display their own impeccably progressive credentials, by jeering and sneering at the needs of women and girls, all while patting themselves on the back for giving away rights that aren't theirs.

The actual victims in this mess have been women and children, especially the most vulnerable, gay people who've resisted the movement and paid a horrible price, and regular people working in environments where one misplaced pronoun could see you vilified or constructively dismissed. Do not tell me this is about a tiny minority. This movement has impacted society in disastrous ways, and if you had any sense, you'd be quietly deleting every trace of activist mantras, ad hominem attacks, false equivalence and circular arguments from your X feeds, because the day is fast approaching when you'll want to pretend you always saw through the craziness and never believed it for a second.","Gender ideology has undermined freedom of speech, scientific truth, gay rights, and women's and girls' safety, privacy and dignity. It's also caused irreparable physical damage to vulnerable kids.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt vote for Elon Musk and his autistic tech bros to get a line-item veto on federal spending!‚Äù

Yeah well I didn‚Äôt vote for Joe Biden‚Äôs non-binary Deep State theater kids to get a blank check to give my tax dollars to fringe left-wing NGO slush funds for four years, but that‚Äôs exactly what happened.

Elections have consequences, one of which being the president of the United States‚Äîthe CEO of the executive branch‚Äîgets to make personnel appointments across the administrative state.

Don‚Äôt like it? You‚Äôve got two options:

1. Reduce the size, scope, and power of the administrative state. I promise, you‚Äôd garner bipartisan support and find willing allies across the political spectrum here. (For some reason, though, Democrats don‚Äôt seem to like this idea. Curious. ü§î)

2. Don‚Äôt lose the election. Don‚Äôt spend four years mismanaging the country and lying to the American people about the president‚Äôs health, only to swap him out in the election for a weak, untested, unlikeable candidate who wastes billions of dollars on the poorest-run campaign in modern history.

Either way, stop complaining about Elon. We DID vote for this. We returned Trump to office with a strong mandate specifically to end this bullshit. If you don‚Äôt like the means‚Äîor the personnel choices‚Äîby which he‚Äôs doing so, that‚Äôs on you, not us,"" wrote Sterling.

The American Flag emoji response



Elon Musk replied to another post on 'No one voted for Elon Musk', with emoji of American flag.

""President Trump: ‚ÄúElon Musk will head up a government efficiency department.‚Äù

DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup that recently caused a stir in the tech world, has a request for its customers. The company said that it is experiencing such high demand for its services that it's running out of server capacity. To manage this, they've temporarily restricted access to their application programming interface (API).According to a report by Bloomberg, DeepSeek has temporarily suspended the ability for customers to add more credits to their API accounts to prevent broader service disruptions. This means new users might have to wait to access the API, and existing users will need to manage their usage with their current credit balance.An API allows developers to integrate DeepSeek's AI models into their own applications and services. It‚Äôs essentially a way for others to access and utilise DeepSeek's technology.‚ÄúThe existing recharge amount can continue to be used, please understand!‚Äù the company said.DeepSeek is reportedly experiencing a surge in demand for its API services. This increased demand is putting a strain on their servers, which are struggling to keep up.DeepSeek‚Äôs services have been overwhelmed, likely due to the recent launch of its new models and their competitive pricing. In January, the company unveiled an AI chatbot that it claimed can rival OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and was developed at a fraction of the cost of competing products.The company previously restricted signups for new users to people with a mainland China telephone number. DeepSeek also said that discounts for access to its model will end on February 8.Meanwhile, a bunch of countries have already banned the use of the DeepSeek AI model in various capacities. For example, Italy, Australia and Taiwan have banned the use of the chatbot. South Korea has asked government officials to not use DeepSeek chatbot on work devices and India has also warned against using it on official devices.","DeepSeek has temporarily suspended the ability for customers to add more credits to their API accounts.

Take a look at the video here



ByteDance OmniHuman-1 sample

What ByteDance researchers said about OmniHuman-1



TikTok parent ByteDance has developed a new AI model called OmniHuman-1 . The latest model can generate realistic videos from photos and sound bites. This comes after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI expanded access to its video-generation tool, Sora, making it available to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users in December 2024. Last year, Google DeepMind also announced its Veo model which can create ‚Äúhigh-quality, high-definition videos based on text or image prompts in a wide range of cinematic and visual styles with exceptional speed.‚Äù However, both OpenAI and Google's models that turn photos into videos are still not available to the public.In a paper (seen by the South China Morning Post), the ByteDance team behind OmniHuman-1 claimed that the multimodal model excels at creating videos of people speaking, singing, and moving with a quality ‚Äúsignificantly outperforming existing audio-conditioned human video-generation methods‚Äù. While OmniHuman-1 has not yet been publicly released, sample videos have generated significant buzz online. One of the demo videos shows a 23-second clip of Albert Einstein giving a speech that was shared on YouTube.In a recently published technical paper, ByteDance researchers Lin Gaojie, Jiang Jianwen, Yang Jiaqi, Zheng Zerong, and Liang Chao introduced a new training strategy that integrates diverse datasets of text, audio and movement to enhance video-generation models. With this approach, the company aims to tackle challenges faced by global researchers in scaling such models.ByteDance also claimed that its method advances conventional video generation without directly naming competing AI tools. The researchers highlighted that their data-mixing approach allows for realistic video generation across various aspect ratios and body proportions, ranging from close-up facial shots to full-body visuals.The generated clips exhibit detailed facial expressions synchronised with audio, along with natural head and gesture movements, potentially enabling broader real-world applications.Among the sample videos released, one features a man delivering a TED Talk-style speech with lifelike hand gestures and synchronised lip movements, making it nearly indistinguishable from a real recording, the report adds.",TikTok parent ByteDance has developed a new AI model called OmniHuman-1.

AI researchers develop 'reasoning' model for under $50 like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-researchers-develop-reasoning-model-for-under-50-like-openais-o1-and-deepseeks-r1/articleshow/117986776.cms,"How researchers developed reasoning model

A team of AI researchers from Stanford University and the University of Washington have achieved a breakthrough in AI development by training a sophisticated ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù model for less than $50 in cloud compute credits. Researchers used AI models by Google, Alibaba to create a chatbot with reasoning level as good as the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI ‚Äôs o1 LLMs.The model, named s1, is claimed to exhibit performance comparable to cutting-edge reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1 on tests evaluating math and coding abilities. The s1 model , along with the data and code used in its training, has been made available on GitHub.The researchers behind s1 said that they utilised a readily available base model and refined it through a process known as distillation ‚Äì a technique that involves extracting the ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù capabilities from another AI model by training s1 on its answers.The researchers claim that their model s1 has been distilled from Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model. This approach mirrors the method used by Berkeley researchers who created an AI reasoning model for around $450 last month.The researchers behind s1 aimed to identify the simplest approach to achieve strong reasoning performance and ""test-time scaling,"" which allows an AI model to deliberate more before generating a response.‚ÄúTest-time scaling is a promising new approach to language modeling that uses extra test-time compute to improve performance,‚Äù the researchers said in their paper published last week (via TechCrunch), adding that they ‚Äúseek the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance.‚ÄùThe s1 research suggests that reasoning models can be effectively distilled using a relatively small dataset and a process called supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where an AI model is explicitly trained to mimic specific behaviors in the dataset.‚ÄúFirst, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model‚Äôs thinking process or lengthening it by appending ‚ÄúWait‚Äù multiple times to the model‚Äôs generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to doublecheck its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps,‚Äù the researchers said.","Researchers from Stanford University and the University of Washington have created a sophisticated reasoning model for less than $50 in cloud compute credits.

Zomato gets 'Eternal' as new name; CEO Deepinder Goyal says: It scares me to my core because ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zomato-gets-eternal-as-new-name-ceo-deepinder-goyal-says-it-scares-me-to-my-core-because-/articleshow/117985844.cms,"Take a look at the post here



What Zomato CEO said about changing the company name



‚ÄúDear fellow shareholders,

A few weeks ago, on December 23rd, we entered the BSE Sensex. Coincidentally, that was exactly the day I started writing the first line of code for Zomato ‚Äî then Foodiebay ‚Äî seventeen years ago, in 2007. Becoming the first tech startup in India to make it to the Sensex is a moment of pride and also a moment of reflection, bringing with it a heightened sense of responsibility ‚Äî responsibility towards the people we serve, the people who build with us, and the country we live in.

In many ways, we feel like we‚Äôve broken some ice. In a world where success often seems reserved for the privileged, we have shown that people from ordinary backgrounds, armed with nothing but conviction and hard work, can come together, defy the odds, create large-scale impact, and, in under two decades, build one of the top thirty listed companies in India. This journey has created tremendous wealth ‚Äî not just for me, but for our employees, institutional investors, and retail shareholders. But I did not start Zomato to make money. I started it because I wanted to do something worthwhile with my life. One weekend, I went around town, collected takeaway menus, and uploaded them onto a website ‚Äî purely in the spirit of service. I never thought it could be a business. I wasn‚Äôt looking for revenue. I was simply trying to be helpful.

Zomato is an accidental company. It was born out of a simple desire to serve, and over time, it became a business. And the journey has been nothing short of extraordinary. Our work has created millions of direct and indirect jobs. It endears my heart when our delivery partners, restaurant partners, and store partners tell me how we empower them, to make more money, to have more freedom, and to better provide for their families. A lot of them tell me that they are now able to send their kids to better schools, and are able to keep them in those schools, which was sometimes not possible earlier. They tell me that their life is more full of hope than what it used to be.

I am a student of system design thinking, and one of the goals for me at Zomato has been to design an organisation that lasts beyond its current set of leaders ‚Äì an organisation where culture drives outcomes, more than strategy; something that is an institution in itself, and not just a company.

We shape our institutions, and then they shape us. But institutions are not just legal entities, groups of people, or physical structures; they are also the mental models and paradigms within which we operate. One such paradigm, often overlooked in shaping a company‚Äôs future, is its name.

When we acquired Blinkit, we started using ‚ÄúEternal‚Äù (instead of Zomato) internally to distinguish between the company and the brand/app. We also thought that we would publicly rename the company to Eternal, the day something beyond Zomato became a significant driver of our future. Today, with Blinkit, I feel we are there. We would like to rename Zomato Ltd., the company (not the brand/app), to Eternal Ltd.

Eternal is a powerful name, and to be honest, it scares me to my core. It is a tall order to live up to. Because ‚ÄòEternal‚Äô carries both a promise and a paradox. True permanence isn‚Äôt built on bold claims of invincibility or the swagger of success. It is forged in the quiet understanding that our immortality stems from our mortality ‚Äî because the day we think we will last forever simply because we declare it, we begin our end.

To work at Eternal will be to wake up every day knowing that our forever is earned in moments of self-doubt, in acknowledging our limitations, in our constant hunger to be better than we were yesterday.

This isn‚Äôt just a name change; it is a mission statement. A reminder etched into our identity that we will endure ‚Äî not because we are here, but because we need to get there.

Our Board has approved this change today and I request our shareholders to also support this change. If and when it is approved, our corporate website will transition from zomato.com to eternal.com. We will also change our stock ticker from ZOMATO to ETERNAL. Eternal will comprise four major businesses (as of now) ‚Äì Zomato, Blinkit, District, and Hyperpure.

A company has multiple founding moments, and I hope this change is another one in our journey into the future.

Deepinder‚Äù",Zomato is changing its name from Zomato.com to Eternal Ltd. The company will also change its stock ticker from ZOMATO to ETERNAL. CEO says the change is part of a mission to create an organisation that lasts beyond its current leaders.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117985826,imgsize-1324855,width-400,resizemode-4/117985826.jpg"

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle‚Äôs theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you‚Äôve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you‚Äôve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Akash Bobba , a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Bobba, along with five other young engineers, was hired by Musk to modernise government systems, raising concerns about their lack of government experience and the potential security risks involved.Bobba, a graduate of UC Berkeley's elite Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (MET) program, has quickly risen through the ranks of Silicon Valley , securing internships at Meta, Palantir, and Bridgewater Associates.Known for his problem-solving skills, Bobba once rewrote an entire project overnight after a teammate accidentally deleted it just before a deadline. His former classmate Charis Zhang recalled the incident.‚ÄúLet me tell you something about Akash. During a project at Berkeley, I accidentally deleted our entire codebase 2 days before the deadline. I panicked. Akash just stared at the screen, shrugged, and rewrote everything from scratch in one night‚Äîbetter than before. We submitted early and got first in the class. Many such stories. I trust him with everything I own,‚Äù wrote Zhang in a social media post.Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that granting individuals with limited government experience access to sensitive government systems poses significant security risks. The hiring strategy has also raised questions about the competence and oversight within Musk's DOGE initiative. Reports suggest that at least four of the new DOGE hires, including Bobba, now have top-tier access to federal IT systems.Bobba isn't the only new face in Musk's government overhaul. The five other members of the DOGE team comprise a mix of recent graduates, college students, and former SpaceX interns, all of whom now have official government emails and top-level security clearances.","Akash Bobba, a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE) Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate.

In his statement, Abbott emphasized the need to safeguard state infrastructure from potential security risks associated with foreign AI applications.Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued an order banning the Chinese app DeepSeek. Abbott cited concerns about the Chinese Communist Party's potential access to sensitive data of Americans through the AI app. ""Texas will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to infiltrate our state‚Äôs critical infrastructure through data-harvesting AI and social media apps,"" Abbott stated. He emphasized the need to protect state agencies and employees handling critical infrastructure, intellectual property, and personal information from ""malicious espionage operations."" ‚ÄúTo achieve that mission, I ordered Texas state agencies to ban Chinese government-based AI and social media apps from all state-issued devices.

The document proposes the initial plans for the town and if they translate into reality, Musk will have created history again. The petition outlines a community of roughly 500 residents. These include 219 primary residents and over 100 children. The proposed location, covering about 1.5 square miles, is near Boca Chica Beach at the end of State Highway 4. If approved, Starbase will be able to establish its own police and fire departments and enact its own ordinances.The Chinese AI app DeepSeek gained attention recently for outperforming OpenAI at a much lower cost. However, it has also raised security concerns due to reports of user data being collected and stored in China. Chinese law mandates that companies share data with the government upon request, raising fears about potential access to American user data by the Chinese Communist Party.

PANIC in the Caribbean nation

Prime Minister Reuben Meade says should be thankful to Jeff Bezos

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and fiancee Lauren Sanchez 's recent visit to the Caribbean island of Montserrat aboard his $500 million superyacht, ""Koru,"" reportedly sparked alarm among locals who feared the billionaire was scouting land for purchase. According to a report in Daily Mail, Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's visit on January 6, part of a Caribbean tour that also included St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Barts, prompted a town hall meeting and forced the Prime Minister to address the community's concerns.Locals worried that the world's second-richest man, worth $250 billion, was in Montserrat for business. These concerns were amplified at a United Alliance town hall meeting where Bezos' presence was a key topic. One community member expressed apprehension about the mogul's intentions.Bezos's ""Koru,"" a 417-foot, three-masted sailing yacht built in the Netherlands in 2021, drew considerable attention, with residents sharing photos and videos of the vessel on social media. While some worried about land acquisition, others saw the visit as a potential opportunity for the island, suggesting Bezos could be asked for assistance with local projects like the port or hospital. Some residents also hoped the visit would boost tourism.Prime Minister Reuben Meade, 70, attempted to quell these fears, clarifying that Bezos was visiting as a tourist. ""He came here as a tourist,"" Meade stated, emphasizing the separation between Bezos's personal and business activities. He further explained that Bezos couldn't purchase land without government approval, requiring an ""alien land holding license,"" ensuring transparency in any potential business dealings. ""They can't do anything unless they register a business or seek a license to do business. We will know what is happening when the time is right,"" Meade reassured the public. He emphasized respecting Bezos's privacy during his visit.'We're not going to nosy in a person's business. He comes here. He comes here as a tourist. He spends money in Montserrat. Thank God he's spending some money in Montserrat,' Meade said.Montserrat is widely known as 'The Emerald Isle of the Caribbean 'Montserrat, known as ""The Emerald Isle of the Caribbean,"" boasts a population of approximately 4,386. Despite its beauty and growing tourism sector, parts of the island remain uninhabitable due to past volcanic activity, including the now-buried capital, Plymouth. The island is also known for its Irish heritage and annual St. Patrick‚Äôs Festival.","Jeff Bezos and fiancee Lauren Sanchez visited the Caribbean island of Montserrat aboard his $500 million superyacht, ""Koru"" The billionaire's visit sparked alarm among locals who feared the billionaire was scouting land for purchase.

Amazon faces heightened pressure to deliver strong cloud computing results in its upcoming fourth-quarter earnings report, as recent disappointing performances from tech rivals Microsoft and Google have raised questions about massive AI investments across the industry.Major tech stocks have experienced significant gains over the past two years, driven by expectations that AI technologies would fuel sustained datacenter expansion. However, recent developments, including Chinese startup DeepSeek's claimed AI breakthroughs at reduced costs, have triggered a technology sector selloff."" Microsoft and Google results have put even more of a microscope on Amazon's cloud growth,"" Dave Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors , which holds positions in all three tech giants, told Reuters. ""But if Amazon can crush it on their cloud numbers, the market's going to absolutely love that report.""Amazon Web Services ( AWS ), maintaining its position as the world's largest cloud services provider, is projected to achieve its most robust revenue growth in eight quarters at 19.3%, based on LSEG data. This comes as the company prepares to unveil its delayed Alexa generative AI voice service later this month.""We actually believe that AWS is regaining share,"" explains D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria to the Reuters, suggesting that Amazon's expanded AI offerings and doubled investment in Anthropic may have helped it catch up to competitors. The company has distinguished itself by being the first major cloud provider to integrate DeepSeek's AI models.Despite market uncertainties, Amazon maintains a higher valuation than its competitors, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 39, compared to Microsoft's 29 and Alphabet's 22.4. The company's strategic positioning, particularly its lower exposure to costly large-language models, may provide an advantage in capitalizing on more cost-effective AI solutions.","Amazon faces heightened pressure to deliver strong cloud computing results in its upcoming fourth-quarter earnings report.

Memo to government employees



In a sweeping move last week, the US President Donald Trump 's administration removed over 8,000 federal web pages from the Internet, targeting content related to diversity, gender, and equality initiatives (popularly called DEI). This action follows executive orders mandating the elimination of programs promoting ""gender ideology.""President Trump defended these measures, stating, ""DEI would have ruined our country, and now it's dead."" He also signed an executive order aimed at restricting gender care for individuals under the age of 19, calling for an end to federal support for such care.The purge has reportedly affected numerous agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Census Bureau, and the Food and Drug Administration. Notably, the CDC's main data portal was taken offline to comply with an executive order aimed at combating ""gender ideology extremism.""Web pages containing information on climate initiatives and transgender care have been among those removed. For instance, the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index and Environmental Justice Index‚Äîtools assessing health risks in vulnerable communities‚Äîhave been taken down.A notice on the CDC's website states, ""CDC's website is being modified to comply with President Trump's Executive Orders."" Similarly, the Census Bureau's page on sexual orientation and gender identity was temporarily inaccessible.These actions align with a memo from the Office of Personnel Management, which directed all federal agencies to end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The memo outlined steps to terminate federal funding of gender ideology and ordered the removal of related content from public platforms.Additionally, federal employees have been instructed to remove pronouns from their email signatures, and agencies are required to recognize individuals strictly by their biological sex. The State Department has also suspended passport applications using a gender-neutral marker such as 'X.'The removal of these web pages has raised concerns among researchers and public health experts, who emphasize the importance of access to accurate data for effective healthcare and research. Many are now working to archive lost information to preserve it for future use.Legal challenges to these executive actions have already begun, with lawsuits filed against the administration's rollback of transgender rights and DEI programs.","US President Donald Trump's administration removed over 8,000 federal web pages from the Internet.

US DOJ‚Äôs allegations against the ex-Google engineer



A former Google software engineer is facing new charges of economic spying and theft of trade secrets in the US. In a case that aligns with US efforts to counter Chinese technology theft, Linwei Ding (who was initially indicted in March) now faces seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets, according to a revised indictment announced by the US Justice Department (DOJ), a report claims.The DOJ alleges that Ding stole confidential information to benefit China's artificial intelligence (AI) industry. This comes after a former Federal Reserve advisor was recently arrested on similar charges which highlights the US‚Äô increased efforts to protect its technology from espionage.A Google spokesperson noted that Ding acted independently and that the company promptly took action by referring the case to law enforcement upon discovering the issue.In an emailed statement to Bloomberg, Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said:Leon Ding, a Chinese national joined Google in 2019. The DOJ has accused Ding of stealing technology related to the company‚Äôs proprietary chip, which is used to train AI models like Gemini, along with graphical processing units. However, he pleaded not guilty to the initial charges in March.According to the indictment (seen by Bloomberg), Ding founded a startup in China in 2023 and applied to a Shanghai-based ‚Äútalent program‚Äù that provides financial incentives to individuals who bring technical expertise back to China after conducting research and development abroad.In his application, Ding described a product designed to ‚Äúhelp China achieve computing power infrastructure capabilities on par with the international level.‚ÄùAs cited by US authorities, a memo from his startup indicates plans to provide products and services to Chinese state agencies and universities.If convicted, Ding can face up to 15 years in prison for each count of economic espionage and up to 10 years for each charge of trade secret theft, prosecutors claimed.","Linwei Ding, a former Google software engineer, is facing new charges of economic spying and theft of trade secrets in the US.

This development follows Qualcomm's partial victory in a December trial where a jury found that its personal computer chips were properly licensed under the existing agreement with Arm.The dispute originated from Qualcomm's $1.4 billion acquisition of chip startup Nuvia in 2021, which Arm claimed violated their licensing terms.

Democratic Representative Mark Pocan is set to introduce new legislation aimed at preventing special government employees, including high-profile figures like Elon Musk , from securing federal contracts. The bill, named the Eliminate Looting of Our Nation by Mitigating Unethical State Kleptocracy (ELON MUSK) Act, is designed to ensure that individuals with government influence cannot steer federal spending toward their personal business interests.Pocan‚Äôs move comes in response to concerns about Musk‚Äôs growing influence over federal contracts through his companies, including SpaceX and Starlink, which have received billions in government funding. According to Pocan, allowing individuals with substantial financial interests to participate in government decision-making could lead to conflicts of interest, misuse of taxpayer funds, and an unfair advantage for certain private entities.The proposed legislation has already sparked significant debate, with supporters arguing that it promotes transparency and accountability, while critics view it as a politically motivated attack on Musk. As the bill moves forward, it could have major implications for how federal contracts are awarded and who is eligible to receive them.The ELON MUSK Act seeks to prohibit special government employees from holding federal contracts. According to a press release shared by Pocan on X (formerly Twitter, now owned by Musk), the legislation aligns with existing restrictions placed on Members of Congress and other federal employees, preventing them from benefiting financially from their government roles.The bill specifically targets individuals who have the authority to influence or recommend federal spending decisions, arguing that such positions create a risk of self-dealing and favoritism in contract allocation. Pocan contends that figures like Musk, who hold federal contracts while also maintaining influence over government agencies, pose an ethical dilemma that must be addressed.If passed, the legislation would require all U.S. government agencies to terminate contracts held by such employees, ensuring that taxpayer money is not funneled toward their personal or corporate interests.Pocan has been vocal about his concerns regarding the potential abuse of power by special government employees. In a statement, he emphasized that no government employee‚Äîspecial or otherwise‚Äîshould have financial interests in businesses that receive government contracts.He specifically cited Elon Musk as a prime example of how such a system can be exploited. Musk‚Äôs companies, SpaceX and Starlink, hold lucrative contracts with the U.S. government, providing services such as satellite internet and space exploration. Pocan argues that Musk‚Äôs involvement in federal decision-making could give him undue influence over contract allocations, potentially directing more government money toward his own enterprises.Pocan did not hold back in his criticism of Musk, accusing him of using his government position to secure billions of dollars in contracts for his businesses. According to Pocan, Musk has received over $20 billion in government funding and now holds an advisory role in the federal government, giving him even more control over financial decisions.Pocan declared.Pocan‚Äôs remarks reference Musk‚Äôs current role as the Director of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. Critics argue that Musk‚Äôs involvement in government policy could further blur the lines between public service and private gain, making it crucial to establish legal safeguards against potential conflicts of interest.Musk has been a major recipient of government contracts through his companies. SpaceX has long been a key partner of NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense, providing rocket launch services, satellite deployment, and other aerospace technologies. Meanwhile, Starlink, Musk‚Äôs satellite internet company, has secured contracts with the U.S. military and government agencies to provide communication services in remote areas and during emergencies.Musk‚Äôs defenders argue that his companies deliver cutting-edge technology and innovation that benefit the U.S. government and the public. They claim that Pocan‚Äôs bill unfairly targets Musk for political reasons rather than addressing broader issues of government transparency and contract fairness.","Democratic Representative Mark Pocan is set to introduce new legislation aimed at preventing special government employees from securing federal contracts.

According to a report, the tool utilizes a custom large language model (LLM) to analyse the data, helping job-seekers discover potential roles they might otherwise miss in traditional searches.LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky told Wired the need for such a tool and how it will help those finding jobs on the platform.‚ÄúThe reality is, you don‚Äôt find your dream job by checking a set of keywords,‚Äù said Roslansky, adding that the new tool, ‚Äúcan help you find relevant jobs you never even knew to search for.‚ÄùThe Microsoft-owned company developed its own LLM, similar to the technology powering ChatGPT, to analyse its vast dataset and interpret complex search queries.As per the company, unlike traditional searches that rely on matching keywords in job titles, this new tool performs a deeper analysis of job descriptions, company information, industry trends, and user posts across the platform.The tool ‚Äì which is currently being tested by a select group of users ‚Äì allows job seekers to input queries such as ‚Äúfind me a role where I can use marketing skills to help the environment"" or ‚Äúshow jobs in marketing that pay over $100K.‚ÄùIt can even identify skills that job seekers might need to develop to pursue specific roles, the report said.‚ÄúWe are really using LLMs throughout the entire stack of our search and recommender system, all the way from query understanding to retrieval to ranking,‚Äù Rohan Rajiv, a director of product at LinkedIn, told the publication.To address the challenges and potential bias posed by LLMs, LinkedIn has implemented safety measures, including ‚Äúaddressing criteria that could inadvertently exclude certain candidates, or bias in the algorithms that could impact how qualifications are assessed,‚Äù according to LinkedIn spokesperson Suzi Owen.The innovation comes as AI technology is gaining ground in providing means for how people interact with the internet. Recent examples include OpenAI's Deep Research tool and a similarly named tool from Google, both of which leverage AI to conduct in-depth web research, before providing answers.","LinkedIn is testing an AI-powered job search tool that aims to transform how people find their next career opportunity.

Tata Electronics' LinkedIn post on hiring in North America



Locations Tata Electronics is hiring for



Tata Electronics looks beyond Apple



Tata Electronics is reportedly expanding its presence in North America, particularly in California, with a hiring spree of over two dozen technical and sales professionals. A LinkedIn post from the Tata Group's contract manufacturing arm emphasized the company's focus on ""engineering excellence, product reliability, and driving business growth."" In November 2023, Tata Electronics signed a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) to acquire a 100% equity stake in Wistron InfoComm Manufacturing (India) Private Limited (WMMI). The partnership made Tata Group the first Indian company to make Apple iPhones . The Wistron plant is located near Bengaluru.Last month, Tata Electronics announced its acquisition of a controlling 60 per cent stake in Pegatron Technology India Private Limited ‚Äî a subsidiary of Taiwanese electronics manufacturing giant Pegatron Corporation. With this, analysts see Tata Electronics narrowing the production value gap with Foxconn in assembling iPhones for Apple in the country. The acquisition and control of Pegatron‚Äôs iPhone plant near Chennai follows the Tatas's purchase of Wistron‚Äôs facility in Narsapura (Karnataka) in March 2024, which also assembled iPhones. The Tata Group company is also investing in a new iPhone plant in Hosur, Tamil Nadu, which is expected to start commercial production later this year.""If you‚Äôre passionate about engineering excellence, product reliability, and driving business growth, join us to help shape the future of electronics manufacturing in North America,"" said a LinkedIn post of the Tata Group company (first reported by Economic Times).""Lead business development efforts to acquire new customers for our OSAT services,"" the company said in the job description. ""Generate new leads and guide them through various business development stages, including nondisclosure agreement (NDA), promotion, follow-up deep dives, request for quote (RFQ)/quotation, and contracting, culminating in a design award,‚Äù the JD adds.Beyond sales, Tata Electronics is also seeking hardware electronics engineers in EMS, customer engineering managers specializing in semiconductor supply chain and test/EV automotive electronics, and hardware enterprise program managers for Mobile Electronics/EMS. These positions are also spread across California. One job posting specifies the role of ""primary technical point of contact for a major global customer based in the SF Bay Area,"" with responsibilities including program management and daily customer interaction.According to the ET report, ""Among the most sought after positions, the electronics manufacturing services (EMS) company is scouting for Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) sales directors. It is looking for such professionals in locations like Fremont, Hayward, San Mateo, Alameda, San Jose, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara and San Francisco Bay Area,...""This expansion follows Tata Electronics' recent strategic moves, including the hiring of key personnel from Intel, such as Reda Masarwa as senior vice president for construction and facility, and the appointment of Bhavna Madhwal and Scott Holden to lead US hiring initiatives. The company has also been actively pursuing acquisitions, including a controlling stake in Pegatron Technology India and the acquisition of Wistron‚Äôs India operations.Tata Electronics is mirroring Foxconn's model by targeting other smartphone manufacturers like Xiaomi and Oppo and exploring new product categories. Tata Electronics is also said to be in discussions with the US-based companies like Microsoft, Dell, and HP to enter the laptop and PC market.","Tata Electronics is reportedly expanding its presence in North America, particularly in California.

TCS cuts variable pay for these employees for second quarter in a row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tcs-cuts-variable-pay-for-these-employees-for-second-quarter-in-a-row/articleshow/117975295.cms,"TCS links variable pay to office attendance

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has reportedly reduced the quarterly variable pay for its senior employees for the October-December quarter, even though they followed the strict work-from-office policy, reported MoneyControl. This marks the second consecutive quarter that TCS has cut variable pay for certain employees. The country‚Äôs largest software exporter previously cut variable pay of senior staff for July-September quarter, 2024. Some employees then received only 20-40% of their quarterly variable allowances (QVA), while others got none. On the contrary, nearly 70% QVA was given out in Q1FY25.The report quotes an anonymous employee, who said ‚ÄúI was supposed to get Rs 54,000 in QVA, but ended up getting Rs 21,000 last quarter and this quarter it was even less at Rs 16,000‚Äù.In April 2024, TCS introduced a revised variable pay policy that ties employees' office attendance to their quarterly payouts. The new policy includes four attendance brackets, with those attending the office less than 60% of the time receiving no variable pay.Employees with attendance between 60-75% will receive 50% of the variable pay, while those attending 75-85% will be eligible for 75%. Only employees with over 85% office attendance will qualify for the full variable pay.Meanwhile, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) posted a 11.95% increase in net profit to Rs 12,380 crore for Q3. This marks a rise from ‚Çπ11,058 crore in the same period last year and ‚Çπ11,909 crore in the previous September quarter.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on quantum computing

Google plans to roll out commercial quantum computing applications within the next five years, reported Reuters. Hartmut Neven, founder and head of Google Quantum AI , said in a statement, ""We‚Äôre optimistic that within five years we‚Äôll see real-world applications that are possible only on quantum computers.""Google has been developing its quantum program since 2012 and has designed multiple quantum chips . By utilizing quantum processors, Google claims it solved a computing problem in minutes that would have taken a classical computer longer than the history of the universe.Google‚Äôs quantum computing team recently announced further progress, reaffirming its goal of launching real-world applications within five years.Quantum computing has been a topic of discussion for decades, promising machines that are exponentially more powerful than current computers. While traditional computers process data one number at a time, quantum computers use ""qubits,"" allowing them to represent multiple numbers simultaneously. Governments and industries have been closely monitoring quantum computing‚Äôs potential to transform fields like cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare.Much like artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing has often been viewed primarily by scientists. Before the rise of ChatGPT in 2022, AI breakthroughs were occurring quietly, without a clear understanding of when AI would become commercially viable.Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, on the other hand, believes quantum computing is still decades away from being practical. During a January analyst event at the CES trade show in Las Vegas, Huang predicted that practical quantum computers are around 20 years from being realized.‚ÄúIf you kind of said 15 years‚Ä¶ that‚Äôd probably be on the early side,‚Äù Huang said, ‚ÄúIf you said 30, it‚Äôs probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.‚ÄùHuang‚Äôs comments contributed to a drop of about $8 billion in the market value of several quantum computing stocks. However, the sector gained momentum in December last year when Google revealed that it had overcome a major challenge in quantum computing with its new chips.","Google plans to roll out commercial quantum computing applications within the next five years.

Israel‚Äôs pager attack on Hezbollah

Donald Trump vows to take over Gaza

Israel PM meets Elon Musk

Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave US President Donald Trump a golden pager and a regular pager as a gift during a recent White House meeting. The unusual gift was a reference to Israel's deadly pager attack on Iran in September 2024, The Jerusalem Post reported. The US President, on the other hand, presented Mr. Netanyahu with a photo of the two of them from the visit, inscribed with the dedication, ""To Bibi, a great leader.""‚ÄúThat was a great operation,‚Äù Trump reportedly remarked to Netanyahu after receiving the gift.Thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon detonated in September last year, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries.

It was disclosed that Israel's Mossad intelligence agency had embedded explosives inside pagers ordered by Hezbollah months prior to the September 17 and 18 blasts. The operation resulted in the deaths of at least 39 Iran-backed Hezbollah members and injuries to nearly 3,000 others.Netanyahu visited Washington to congratulate Trump on his electoral victory and to discuss the U.S.-Israeli collaboration on Middle Eastern strategy.

Amazon is gearing up to launch its new Alexa generative AI voice service , marking the most significant upgrade to the product since its initial introduction over a decade ago. The company has scheduled a press event for February 26 in New York to preview the new service.The revamped AI service will be able to respond to multiple prompts in sequence and even act as an ""agent"" on behalf of users by taking actions for them without their direct involvement.This contrasts with the current iteration, which generally handles only a single request at a time.Initially, Amazon plans to roll out the new Alexa service to a limited number of users and will not charge for it, though it has considered a $5 to $10 monthly fee. The company will also continue to offer ""Classic Alexa,"" the version broadly available today for free.The revamp carries inherent challenges, including the possibility of fabricated answers, known as hallucinations, which are common in generative AI chatbots from companies like OpenAI and Alphabet. Despite these challenges, Amazon is hopeful that the new Alexa can convert some of its hundreds of millions of users into paying customers, generating a return for the unprofitable business.The new version of Amazon Alexa is set to release just before Apple begins testing a new iteration of Siri equipped with enhanced Apple Intelligence capabilities. Apple has announced that Siri will be updated with on-screen awareness, personal context, and expanded functionality within apps. These updates are expected to enhance Siri's capabilities for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users.","Amazon is gearing up to launch its new Alexa generative AI voice service.

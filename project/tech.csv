3 demands of NITES to Union Labour ministry



Strict action against for violating Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

Restraining order to stop further layoffs

Reinstatement of all terminated employees

Infosys disputes the 700 number

Infosys threatened terminated employees, claims NITES

The Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) has filed a formal complaint with the labour ministry against Infosys, alleging illegal and unethical mass layoffs of trainees, which the association claims are a ""violation of labour laws."" NITES' complaint, submitted to Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, states that Infosys terminated recently onboarded campus recruits who had already experienced a two-year delay in joining after receiving offer letters.The company attributed the layoffs to failing an internal assessment programme.“It has come to our attention, through numerous complaints received from affected employees, that Infosys Ltd. has resorted to forcibly terminating recently onboarded campus recruits who had already suffered a delay of two years in their joining after being issued offer letters,” Harpreet Singh Saluja, lawyer and president at NITES said in a written letter addressed to Mansukh Mandaviya, minister of labour & employment. NITES argues that Infosys's actions set a dangerous precedent for the IT industry and could encourage other companies to engage in similar practices. The complaint includes copies of employee complaints.NITES has termed the IT giant’s action illegal, unethical, and a “violation of labour laws.”NITES is demanding strict penal action against Infosys for violating the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, an immediate investigation into the matter, and a restraining order to halt further terminations.NITES has also asked for an immediate investigation and a restraining order to stop further terminations until legal processes are followed.The NITES union also demands the reinstatement of all terminated employees with appropriate compensation.Infosys claims the number of separations is under 350 and calls them ""mutual separations,"" explaining that the employees failed to clear an internal assessment program after three attempts, a process they say has been in place for over two decades.NITES also accused Infosys of employing intimidation tactics against the employees, such as the presence of bouncers and security personnel, to ensure compliance. NITES alleges that employees were confined to meeting rooms at the Mysore campus, intimidated by security personnel, and forced to resign without prior notice or severance packages. NITES further claims that employees were asked to vacate their accommodation and the campus on Friday, leaving many stranded and struggling to arrange travel back to their hometowns across the country.","The Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) has filed a formal complaint with the labour ministry against Infosys.

Paris AI summit will take place on February 10 and 11 and the city will be the epicenter of the AI world as it hosts the AI Action Summit . This third edition of the summit will be co-chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , bringing together global leaders and tech executives to discuss AI's future. As attendees gather to discuss investments and strategies, French President Emmanuel Macron has already extended a warm welcome to Indian participants via his Instagram channel in a desi style.“Bhaarat ke logon ko mera namaste,” Macron said in the clip shared on Instagram, captioned “Welcome to our Indian friends at the AI Action Summit!”The summit aims to address both the potential of AI and the concerns surrounding its development, particularly the balance between fostering innovation and ensuring responsible implementation.“There's a risk some decide to have no rules and that's dangerous. But there's also the opposite risk, if Europe gives itself too many rules,” Macron told regional French newspapers, as per news agency Reuters.“We should not be afraid of innovation,” he added.The Paris AI Action Summit also witnessed the launch of Current AI , a collaborative effort between nations like France and Germany, and industry giants like Google and Salesforce.With initial funding of $400 million, Current AI will focus on public-interest projects, including making high-quality data available for AI development and investing in open-source tools. The partnership aims to secure up to $2.5 billion in funding over the next five years.Additionally, Macron revealed that France will secure around €109 billion (approximately $113 billion) in private sector AI investments during the summit.

AGI 5 years away, says Hassabis

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis praised Deepseek's AI model as “probably the best work” from China, acknowledging its impressive engineering and geopolitical impact. However, he downplayed its technological significance, stating that the hype is a bit “exaggerated.”Praising Deepseek’s AI model as “an impressive piece of work” at a Google-hosted event in Paris ahead of the AI Action Summit (via Business Insider) that is being hosted by the city, Hassabis said, “I think its probably the best work I’ve seen come out of China.”The DeepMind CEO said the AI model shows that Deepseek can do “extremely good engineering” and that it “changes things on a geopolitical scale.”His comments came soon after Google CEO Sundar Pichai praised DeepSeek during the Google-parent company Alphabet's Q4 2024 earnings call“I think [DeepSeek has] a tremendous team. I think they've done very, very good work,” Pichai said.Hassabis, however, noted that the AI models by DeepSeek do not represent any new scientific advances and are merely utilising existing AI techniques. He suggested that Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash models are more efficient.“Despite the hype, there’s no actual new scientific advance … it’s using known techniques [in AI],” he said, adding that the hype around Deepseek has been “exaggerated a little bit.”Deepseek's claims about low development costs and the use of less-advanced chips have also faced scrutiny.Last month, China’s Deepseek published a research paper, claiming that its AI model was trained at a fraction of the cost of industry leaders and using less advanced Nvidia chips. The announcement triggered a sharp stock sell-off and fueled intense debate over whether major tech firms are overspending on AI infrastructure.Regarding Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Hassabis believes the industry is on track “towards AGI,” that will be “a system that exhibits all the cognitive capabilities humans have.”“I think we’re close now, you know, maybe we are only, you know, perhaps 5 years or something away from a system like that which would be pretty extraordinary,” Hassabis said.“And I think society needs to get ready for that and what implications that will have. And, you know, make sure that we derive the benefits from that and the whole society benefits from that, but also we mitigate some of the risks, too,” he added.","Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis praised DeepSeek's AI model as “probably the best work” from China.

Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath want you to know this about SEBI’s new circular on API usage and algorithmic trading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamath-want-you-to-know-this-about-sebis-new-circular-on-api-usage-and-algorithmic-trading/articleshow/118020989.cms,"Take a look at the post here



“The SEBI circular on

API usage

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

SEBI's latest ALGO trading rules | The Daily Brief #163

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

Akash Bobba , a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Bobba, along with five other young engineers, was hired by Musk to modernise government systems, raising concerns about their lack of government experience and the potential security risks involved.Bobba, a graduate of UC Berkeley's elite Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (MET) program, has quickly risen through the ranks of Silicon Valley , securing internships at Meta, Palantir, and Bridgewater Associates.Known for his problem-solving skills, Bobba once rewrote an entire project overnight after a teammate accidentally deleted it just before a deadline. His former classmate Charis Zhang recalled the incident.“Let me tell you something about Akash. During a project at Berkeley, I accidentally deleted our entire codebase 2 days before the deadline. I panicked. Akash just stared at the screen, shrugged, and rewrote everything from scratch in one night—better than before. We submitted early and got first in the class. Many such stories. I trust him with everything I own,” wrote Zhang in a social media post.Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that granting individuals with limited government experience access to sensitive government systems poses significant security risks. The hiring strategy has also raised questions about the competence and oversight within Musk's DOGE initiative. Reports suggest that at least four of the new DOGE hires, including Bobba, now have top-tier access to federal IT systems.Bobba isn't the only new face in Musk's government overhaul. The five other members of the DOGE team comprise a mix of recent graduates, college students, and former SpaceX interns, all of whom now have official government emails and top-level security clearances.","Akash Bobba, a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE) Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities. Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd is a well-known stock market training institute that offers online courses on stocks and trading. Some of the popular courses offered by the self-proclaimed ""options queen"" and ""She Wolf of Stock Market"" are ""Let's Make India Trade"" (LMIT), ""Master's in Price Action Trading"" (MPAT), and ""Options Multiplier"" (OM) .Jayesh Thakkar, a SEBI Registered Research Analyst shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating “SEBI has seized Rs 53.67 crore that Asmita Patel and five other related entities made illegally. Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd. Recommendations of buy/sell of specific securities were provided and uploaded on telegram channels owned by the Noticee no.1.

Nikhil Rajpal , a 30-year-old engineer with a background in computer science and history from UC Berkeley, has emerged as a key figure in Elon Musk’s DOGE task force . As reported by The Wired, Rajpal holds significant government access through his role as a representative of DOGE's task force at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But who exactly is Rajpal, and why is his role sparking unease across government agencies?As per the report, before Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, Rajpal was employed at the company and, earlier in his career, contributed to redesigning a Tesla console. During his undergraduate years, Rajpal led a libertarian-leaning student group that championed “minimal government, free markets, sound money, non-intervention, and maximum individual liberty.”In 2014, he delivered a 10-minute presentation on bitcoin to Viget, where he was interning. Additionally, an Instapaper account linked from his personal website under the header “Read the articles I read” featured content from sources like Richard Hanania, Quillette, Zero Hedge, the Financial Times, and Bloomberg.Rajpal’s involvement at NOAA has raised eyebrows and sparked concerns about DOGE’s growing influence in government. Last week, NOAA employees were instructed by Acting Commerce Secretary Jeremy Pelter to grant Rajpal editor access to all NOAA Google sites. This directive came on the heels of an abrupt shake-up: a longtime NOAA employee who led diversity and inclusion initiatives was placed on administrative leave just three weeks before their retirement.The report mentions that “Nothing in his background suggests any special expertise relevant to his new role.” Adding to the unease, DOGE workers reportedly entered NOAA facilities in Maryland seeking access to IT systems, as confirmed by Wired and earlier reports from Axios. Critics are questioning why a tech engineer with no apparent scientific background is being placed in a position of authority at a nonpartisan agency central to climate science.",Nikhil Rajpal is a 30-year-old engineer with a background in computer science and history from UC Berkeley.

"UK MP Rupert Lowe 'complains' about London Station Sign Board written in Bengali and not English alone, Elon Musk responds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-mp-rupert-lowe-tweets-this-is-london-station-name-should-be-in-english-and-english-only-elon-musk-responds/articleshow/118093942.cms,"Tech billionaire Elon Musk has added his opinion to an ongoing discussion about bilingual signage at London’s Whitechapel station . Responding to a post by Rupert Lowe – UK MP for Great Yarmouth on X (formerly Twitter), Musk replied with a simple ""Yes."" Lowe’s post argued that station names in London should be displayed ""in English, and English only,"" referring to Whitechapel’s signs, which include Bengali alongside English.Sharing the post, Lowe wrote “This is London - station name should be in English and English only”. Musk responded to it with “Yes”.Whitechapel, situated in East London, has long been a significant hub for the British Bangladeshi community . The Bengali signage was introduced in 2022 by Transport for London (TfL) to celebrate the cultural heritage of British Bangladeshis, who have been an integral part of the Whitechapel community for decades. The initiative was then aimed to honor the area's diverse history and acknowledge the contributions of the British Bangladeshi population to London’s cultural fabric.John Biggs, Mayor of Tower Hamlets, who played an instrumental role in getting the bilingual signage at the Whitechapel station then said: ""Whitechapel is at the heart of the Bangladeshi community. Bilingual signs have been installed at Southall and replicating this at Whitechapel would be welcomed to mark the culture of British Bangladeshis and reflect the rich heritage and diversity.""Lowe's post has sparked renewed discussions about the use of bilingual signage in public spaces. While some supported his view, emphasizing that English is the UK’s primary language and should take precedence, others advocated for bilingual signs, highlighting their importance as a symbol of inclusivity.","Elon Musk responded to a post by Rupert Lowe – UK MP for Great Yarmouth on X (formerly Twitter) Lowe argued that station names in London should be displayed ""in English, and English only"" The Bengali signage was introduced in 2022 by Transport for London (TfL) to celebrate the cultural heritage of British Bangladeshis.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118093970,imgsize-23136,width-400,resizemode-4/118093970.jpg"

The limitations stem from shortages of AI chips, server components like motherboards, and insufficient energy supply for data centers.AWS reported fourth-quarter sales of $28.8 billion, marking a 19% increase but falling short of market expectations . Amazon's stock declined approximately 4% in after-hours trading following lower-than-anticipated first-quarter guidance.The capacity challenges echo similar concerns from competitors. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood recently acknowledged being in ""a pretty constrained capacity place,"" while Google executives reported ending 2024 with ""more (AI) demand than capacity.""Despite these constraints, Jassy remained optimistic about AWS's AI business, which is tracking toward ""multi-billion"" dollars in annual revenue. He anticipates the supply constraints will ""relax"" in the second half of 2025.To meet growing AI demand, Amazon has announced ambitious capital expenditure plans totaling $105 billion for 2025, primarily focused on data center expansion. This follows a record fourth-quarter spending of $26.3 billion.""When AWS is expanding its capex, particularly what we think is one of these once-in-a-lifetime type of business opportunities like AI represents, I think it's actually quite a good sign, medium to long term for the AWS business,"" Jassy explained.The substantial investment signals Amazon's confidence in future demand, with Jassy noting that AWS doesn't make such financial commitments without ""significant signals of demand.""","Amazon Web Services (AWS) is grappling with capacity constraints in its data centers.

Swatch issues apology in China after 'Slanted eye' ad that experts call 'Quite a Fundamental Mistake',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/swatch-issues-apology-in-china-after-slanted-eye-ad-that-experts-call-quite-a-fundamental-mistake/articleshow/123372675.cms,"What Swatch said in its apology

Ad controversy adds to Swatch's China troubles

Swiss watchmaker Swatch has reportedly issued a formal apology and swiftly removed advertisements for its Swatch Essentials collection after the campaign was widely condemned in China for featuring a male model making a ""slanted eye"" pose. The gesture, which involves pulling the corners of the eyes up and backwards, is seen by many as a racist taunt targeting people of Asian descent. According to a report by Reuters, the images, which sparked significant outrage online, led to a drop in the company's shares. On Monday, August 18, Swatch's stock fell as much as 4% before recovering slightly to a 3.1% loss.""It is very significant for a brand of that scale to misfire in this way,"" said Mark Borkowski, a London-based public relations consultant, as reported by Reuters. ""This carelessness is really quite a fundamental mistake."" The incident has raised questions about the brand's approval process, considering that Swatch is a well-known brand in the Chinese market.In an apology posted in both Chinese and English on its Weibo and Instagram accounts, Swatch stated it had ""taken note of the recent concerns"" and had ""removed all related materials worldwide."" The company added, ""We sincerely apologize for any distress or misunderstanding this may have caused.While the backlash on social media was intense, Chinese fashion influencer Peter Xu, who has over seven million followers on Weibo, believes the quick apology will likely mitigate long-term damage to the brand. ""It was pretty stupid to release images like those ones,"" he commented, but suggested the fallout would likely be short-lived.This controversy is the latest challenge for Swatch, which also owns popular brands like Omega, Longines, and Tissot. The company's shares have plummeted by more than half since early 2023, and it is also facing a 39% tariff on its exports to the United States.China, along with Hong Kong and Macau, accounted for approximately 27% of Swatch's group sales last year. The company's overall revenue in 2024 fell 14.6% to 6.74 billion Swiss francs ($8.4 billion), a decline the company attributed to ""difficult market conditions and weak demand for consumer goods overall"" in China.","Swatch has reportedly issued a formal apology and swiftly removed advertisements for its Swatch Essentials collection.

California says no to Elon Musk’s SpaceX rocket-launch proposal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/california-says-no-to-elon-musks-spacex-rocket-launch-proposal/articleshow/123369997.cms,"“There are a number of unanswered questions that make it really quite impossible for us to engage. We see no appearance by US Air Force, US Space Force or SpaceX to answer the questions,”

“There’s a possibility of causing irreversible harm to our coastline and our coastal resources. We owe it to the public and to the future to insist on data-driven, transparent decision making,”

What the California Coastal Commission said about rejecting the proposal



Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Regulators of California have recently rejected a US military proposal to increase SpaceX rocket launches from a Southern California base. The latest rejection marked the second time the US state has opposed such a plan. The California Coastal Commission , which oversees the state's coastline, voted unanimously to deny the US Space Force ’s application to double launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base from 50 to 100 per year. The commission stated that military officials failed to provide sufficient data on the potential environmental impact on local wildlife and nearby towns. This decision comes amid an ongoing lawsuit from SpaceX CEO Elon Musk over a similar previous vote.Caryl Hart, the vice chairman of the commission, said while rejecting the appeal to increase the rocket company’s launches.Last year, the commission voted 6–4 against increasing Space Force launches from 36 to 50, arguing that SpaceX should seek a commercial permit for the same. At that time, some commission members also criticised the world’s richest person for his political stance. Musk responded to this with a lawsuit.However, at the latest hearing, the commission members did not mention Musk directly. Instead, they pointed to insufficient data and raised concerns that the Space Force was shielding SpaceX from applying for commercial permits.Commissioner Raymond Jackson noted.The latest vote followed the recommendation of members of the California Coastal Commission who asked it to reject the proposal. The members cited the military’s failure to share data on how sonic booms could affect wildlife and nearby communities.The commission also challenged Space Force’s claim that all launches count as federal activity exempt from state permits, noting that most missions are commercial and don’t involve military payloads.",The California Coastal Commission voted unanimously to deny the US Space Force ’s application to double launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base from 50 to 100 per year.

Microsoft finally fixes Windows 11's broken Dark mode after nearly a decade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-finally-fixes-windows-11s-broken-dark-mode-after-nearly-a-decade/articleshow/123366703.cms,"The new Dark mode could come later this year with Windows update

Microsoft is addressing long-standing dark mode inconsistencies in Windows 11, with new preview builds showing dark themes applied to file operation dialogs that have remained stubbornly bright since 2016. The latest changes affect copy, delete, and file permission windows that previously displayed in light mode even when users had dark mode enabled system-wide.The improvements were discovered in Windows 11 preview build 26100.5061 , where leaker Phantomofearth spotted the updated interface elements using configuration utilities. While the window backgrounds now properly display in dark gray, some buttons still appear in light colours, indicating the work remains incomplete.Dark mode first arrived in Windows 10's Anniversary Update in 2016, but Microsoft abandoned comprehensive implementation, leaving users with a patchwork of light and dark elements. The inconsistency has persisted through Windows 11's launch, with fundamental interface components like the Control Panel, Run prompt, and file operation dialogs remaining bright white.The timing suggests these fixes may debut with Windows 11's 25H2 update later this year. Industry observers have long criticized Microsoft's incomplete dark mode implementation, especially compared to Apple 's comprehensive system-wide dark theme that launched with macOS Mojave in 2018.While Microsoft hasn't officially announced these improvements, the development represents significant progress after years of user complaints. The company still needs to address other legacy interface elements, including the Registry Editor and Group Policy windows, to achieve true system-wide dark mode consistency.","Microsoft is addressing long-standing dark mode inconsistencies in Windows 11.

Duolingo CEO on the AI memo that created outrage: Some people assume that it's…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/duolingo-ceo-on-the-ai-memo-that-created-outrage-some-people-assume-that-its/articleshow/123366640.cms,"Company maintains no layoff policy despite AI integration push

AI transforms workflow without eliminating jobs, exec says



Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn acknowledged he failed to provide adequate context when announcing the language-learning company's pivot to become ""AI-first"" earlier this year, sparking widespread user backlash and subscription cancellation threats. In a recent interview with The New York Times, von Ahn took responsibility for the confusion, saying the memo was misinterpreted as a cost-cutting measure rather than a strategic enhancement.Von Ahn emphasised that Duolingo has ""never laid off any full-time employees"" and doesn't plan to, despite implementing AI across operations. The $15 billion company, which serves 130 million monthly users, uses contractors for temporary tasks whose numbers fluctuate based on operational needs rather than AI replacement strategies.The controversial April memo outlined ""constructive constraints"" including reducing contractors for AI-manageable work and requiring teams to prove AI couldn't handle tasks before new hires. This triggered fierce criticism from users who threatened to cancel subscriptions, with comments like ""AI first means people last"" flooding social media.Von Ahn explained that AI enables productivity gains rather than workforce reduction. ""What will probably happen is that one person will be able to accomplish more, rather than having fewer people,"" he told The New York Times. The company has implemented ""f-r-A-I-days"" - weekly Friday morning sessions where teams experiment with AI efficiency improvements.The CEO defended Duolingo's transparency about AI integration, noting that while other tech companies pursue similar strategies, ""we were open about it."" He attributed the backlash to public misconceptions about corporate AI adoption being primarily profit-driven rather than innovation-focused.Founded in 2011, Duolingo has embraced AI since launch but accelerated integration following recent large language model breakthroughs. The platform now offers AI-powered conversation practice, addressing user reluctance to practice with humans. Despite the controversy, the company reported over 20% user growth year-over-year, suggesting the outcry hasn't significantly impacted business performance.","Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn says company has ""never laid off any full-time employees"" The language-learning company's pivot to become ""AI-first"" sparked widespread user backlash and subscription cancellation threats.

Bezos-Sánchez wedding draws criticism over DiCaprio’s jet travel



Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s $40 Venetian wedding

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances.

He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company. I’ve got my methods of doing that, and I use machine learning. I sort through all 42,000 employees.”“100% of the time, I increased the company’s spend on OpEx [operating expenses]. And the reason for that is because you take care of people, everything else takes care [of itself],” Jensen Huang concluded.",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved from a futuristic concept to an everyday necessity, influencing industries ranging from healthcare and finance to entertainment and communication. It automates routine tasks, enhances productivity, and fuels innovations like ChatGPT, AI-driven translation services, and virtual gaming experiences.The growth of AI has also created a new class of billionaires, some of whom have built companies from scratch, while others have pivoted established businesses toward AI-driven opportunities. Backed by massive investments from Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and other global players, these individuals represent the cutting edge of technology and entrepreneurship. From Jensen Huang’s hardware empire to Alexandr Wang’s data infrastructure solutions, and from Sam Altman’s AI innovation to Yao Runhao’s virtual gaming platforms, these billionaires illustrate how AI is reshaping industries and redefining entrepreneurship.Source: ForbesJensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, sits at the top of the AI billionaire list with an astonishing $113 billion (£151 billion) net worth. Nvidia initially focused on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional visualization. However, as AI adoption accelerated, these GPUs became the standard for training and running large language models like ChatGPT and Meta AI.Huang’s strategic vision transformed Nvidia into the backbone of the AI industry. In July 2025, the company reached an unprecedented $4 trillion valuation, reflecting how central its hardware is to AI infrastructure. Owning 3% of Nvidia, Huang’s wealth grew by over 300% in just one year, making him one of the top 20 richest individuals worldwide.At just 26 years old, Alexandr Wang has secured his place as the youngest self-made billionaire in the AI sector. He founded Scale AI at the age of 19, after dropping out of MIT, to focus on providing data labeling and annotation services essential for AI training.Scale AI works with over 300 high-profile clients, including Meta, Google, and General Motors, supplying the data infrastructure required to build machine learning models. The company’s valuation reached $14 billion (£10.5 billion) in 2024, and Wang’s 14% ownership stake boosted his net worth to $2.7 billion (£3.6 billion). His success highlights how even niche AI services can yield massive fortunes.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is one of the most prominent faces in artificial intelligence. While OpenAI itself is valued at around $300 billion (£225 billion), Altman does not personally hold equity in the company. His wealth, estimated at $1.9 billion (£1.4 billion), stems from early investments in companies like Stripe, Reddit, and Helion Energy, combined with the success of his previous startup, Loopt, which he sold for $42 million in 2012.Altman’s leadership at OpenAI popularized generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, setting global trends in how businesses and consumers interact with AI. His influence extends beyond wealth, positioning him as one of the key thought leaders shaping AI’s future.Phil Shawe, co-CEO of TransPerfect, built one of the world’s largest translation and localization companies by leveraging AI-powered language processing. TransPerfect offers services across industries like law, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, helping businesses operate in multiple languages with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.Founded in 1992 from a dorm room at New York University, TransPerfect generated $1.3 billion (£976 million) in revenue in 2024. Shawe owns 99% of the company, securing a personal fortune of $1.8 billion (£1.3 billion). His journey shows how AI technology can transform even traditional industries like language services into billion-dollar enterprises.Dario Amodei, a former vice president of research at OpenAI, left to co-found Anthropic in 2021. His company focuses on building safe, reliable AI systems using reinforcement learning techniques that allow AI models to adapt through human feedback.Anthropic’s approach to ethical AI and safety-first principles resonated with investors and industry leaders, pushing the company’s valuation to $61.5 billion (£46.2 billion) by 2025. Amodei’s net worth has reached $1.2 billion (£901 million), proving that prioritizing responsibility in AI development can be both impactful and profitable.Liang Wenfeng, once largely unknown outside China, made headlines with DeepSeek-R1, a large language model that outperformed ChatGPT on certain benchmarks while being five times cheaper to run. This innovation shook global markets, causing Nvidia’s stock to drop 17% in a single day as investors reacted to the potential shift in AI computing costs.Wenfeng previously founded a successful hedge fund, and he used his financial expertise to build DeepSeek into one of the most cost-efficient AI providers globally. His net worth now stands at $1 billion (£751 million), making him a key figure in China’s growing AI industry.Yao Runhao, CEO of Paper Games, has carved out a unique niche by combining AI with gaming. His company’s hit product, Love and Deepspace, uses artificial intelligence to create virtual dating simulations with interactive, personalized storylines.The game attracts over six million monthly users, showcasing the demand for AI-driven entertainment. Paper Games employs around 2,000 staff and focuses primarily on the female gaming market in China, highlighting how AI is revolutionizing interactive leisure experiences. Runhao’s innovation has earned him a net worth of $1.3 billion (£977 million).","World’s wealthiest AI moguls ranked by net worth.

Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India, marking another step in its long-term strategy to strengthen its footprint in emerging markets. During Apple’s latest earnings announcement, CEO Tim Cook confirmed plans to open multiple new Apple Stores in India before the year ends. The move comes as part of a broader global expansion plan that also includes fresh Apple retail outlets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the launch of the Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia. Cook highlighted that these new physical stores are a key step in improving Apple’s customer experience, product accessibility, and service reach in high-growth regions like India.“We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn’t be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year,” Cook stated. “We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka.”According to Apple Magazine, four new stores are scheduled to open across key metropolitan cities in India, namely Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, and the Delhi NCR region. These new outlets will build on Apple’s successful retail debut in India in 2023, which saw the launch of Apple BKC in Mumbai and Apple Saket in Delhi. These initial stores have quickly become major crowd-pullers, especially during new iPhone release events, and have demonstrated the value of physical retail locations in India’s fast-growing premium smartphone market.To support this retail growth, Apple has been actively hiring talent for its upcoming stores. Earlier this year, Apple Store leader John Taffe shared on LinkedIn that Apple was looking for passionate and skilled individuals to join its retail team. “Apple’s journey in India has been incredible, and we’re thrilled to continue growing in these vibrant cities. To make these new stores a success, we’re looking for passionate and talented individuals to join our team,” Taffe noted. This hiring drive highlights Apple’s commitment to not only selling products but also delivering personalised customer experiences and creating jobs within the Indian retail sector.While India remains a critical market, Apple is expanding its retail network globally. Apart from its Indian plans, the company has announced new retail locations in the UAE, including a store in Al Ain, which will add to its existing four UAE outlets (two in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai). The Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia further emphasizes Apple’s growing focus on the Middle East.These international retail initiatives aim to strengthen Apple’s customer reach and brand experience beyond its digital ecosystem. Apple’s global retail growth is supported by its strong financial results. In its April–June quarter (Q3), Apple reported a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, showcasing robust demand even in challenging economic conditions. This financial strength gives Apple the confidence to invest heavily in physical stores in markets like India, where premium smartphone adoption is rapidly increasing.India has emerged as one of Apple’s most important growth markets, driven by rising disposable incomes, expanding smartphone penetration, and a growing preference for premium devices. The launch of Apple BKC and Apple Saket in 2023 marked the company’s first direct retail presence in the country, and the overwhelming customer response has paved the way for more stores. Apple’s upcoming four new stores signal a long-term commitment to India, where it faces strong competition from brands like Samsung and OnePlus. However, Apple’s focus on a seamless retail experience and exclusive customer service could help it capture a larger market share in the premium category.",Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered. This statement from Hassabis offers one of the clearest examples of how AI will alter specific professions, but not eliminate the need for human empathy and interpersonal care.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments, emphasizing lifelong learning, adaptive skills, ethical AI usage, and the development of new interdisciplinary roles bridging technology, creativity, and human-centric decision-making.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce.

What are special purpose vehicles investment fund

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Claude-maker Anthropic has told investors that the AI company does not want money coming through special purpose vehicles (SPVs) in its latest fundraising. Citing two people familiar with the matter, a Business Insider report said that one of Anthropic’s largest backers, Menlo Ventures, was specifically told it must invest using its own capital and not through an SPV, as it did in a past round. The company, as per the report, is raising about $5 billion at a valuation of $170 billion.A special purpose vehicle, or SPV, is a legal entity that is created for a specific financial purpose, usually to make a single investment. In the world of venture capital and private markets, investors often pool their money into an SPV, and that entity then invests in a company on their behalf.This structure makes it easier for smaller investors to gain access to deals that are normally reserved for large funds.But companies generally prefer direct investor relationships. Recently, investors have complained that some SPVs targeting AI startups are charging unusually high fees.The BI report quotes Michelle Lim, a founder and angel investor, who posted on X “Many friends including myself have been offered allocation into OpenAI or Anthropic SPVs this week. Minimum check sizes are $100k-$1M, with fees as high as 16%. From what I understand, folks are creating SPVs on top of SPVs and making management fees on top of them. It's like a pyramid.”Venture capitalist Sarah Guo wrote on X: “The feeding frenzy for ownership in the AI labs has spawned a set of bottom feeding multi layered SPV brokers that have no relationship with the company, and straight up grifters,"" ""Careful of that nonsense.”","A special purpose vehicle, or SPV, is a legal entity that is created for a specific financial purpose.

Meta 's upcoming display-equipped smart glasses, codenamed HyperNova , will hit the market at around $800 this fall, significantly affordable than the $1,000-plus price tag initially expected, according to Bloomberg.The glasses, set to debut next month, will be Meta's first smart eyewear with an actual screen. They'll feature a small display in the right lens for mini apps and notifications, plus gesture controls through a neural wristband accessory similar to what Meta developed for its Orion AR prototypes.Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that Meta managed to slash costs by accepting lower profit margins, a typical move for companies trying to drive adoption of new tech. The $800 starting price still puts HyperNova well above Meta's current $200-400 Ray-Ban smart glasses, same as an iPhone , but it's much more palatable than the $1,400 some expected.Of course, that $800 is just the entry point. Different styles and prescription lenses will bump up the price, so don't expect everyone to walk away spending less than a grand.Renders from tipster Arsène Lupin show the glasses look surprisingly similar to existing Ray-Bans, though they pack considerably more tech inside. The monocular display sits in the lower-right corner of the right lens, showing a home screen with circular app icons arranged horizontally like a dock. Users will be able to launch dedicated apps for snapping photos, browsing their camera roll, pulling up maps for navigation, and catching notifications from messaging apps like WhatsApp and Messenger.The neural wristband controller , reportedly called Ceres, reads hand gestures so you can rotate your hand to scroll through apps and pinch your fingers to select items. No tiny buttons or voice commands needed, just subtle hand movements that won't draw stares in public.Meta's clearly betting big on making AR accessible to regular consumers, not just enthusiasts willing to drop iPhone money on experimental eyewear.","HyperNova smart glasses will be Meta's first smart eyewear with an actual screen.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

E-commerce major Amazon has announced to shut down its Amazon Appstore on Android on August 20, 2025, ending its 14-year run. The closure, as revealed by the company, will not affect Fire TVs and Fire Tablets, where the Appstore will continue to operate. The announcement to shut down Amazon Appstore was made in February. In a statement to Android Police, the company then said “We’ve decided to discontinue the Amazon Appstore on Android to focus our efforts on the Appstore experience on our own devices, as that’s where the overwhelming majority of our customers currently engage with it”.To recall, Amazon Appstore was launched in 2011 as a rival to Google Play. However, it never gained major traction, despite early promotions such as a free daily app and the Coins reward system. According to the industry data, its global share had fallen below 1% by 2022. Reports suggest that Amazon is now focusing on its Fire ecosystem, where it has greater control and can drive revenue through Prime subscriptions, Alexa services, and ads.Users who still hold Amazon Coins, the company’s discontinued digital currency, will get automatic refunds after the cutoff date. However, refunds will only go through if payment details are up to date. Amazon has advised users to update their Amazon Wallet to avoid failed transactions.What users need to do:For most Android users, the shutdown will have little impact since the Appstore had become largely inactive. But the move highlights the risks of digital marketplaces — once a platform shuts down, apps and purchases can vanish with it.","Amazon has announced to shut down its Amazon Appstore on Android on August 20, 2025, ending its 14-year run.

Kodak says it's handling its finances just fine and won't be closing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/kodak-says-its-handling-its-finances-just-fine-and-wont-be-closing/articleshow/123362598.cms,"A classic case of financial engineering meets corporate survival

Don't write Kodak 's obituary just yet. The 133-year-old photography giant is pushing back hard against speculation that it might be shutting down, insisting it has a solid financial plan to tackle its debt problems and stay in business.The company stirred up a media frenzy last week when it warned investors in a regulatory filing that it might not have enough cash to pay off roughly $500 million in debt obligations coming due. That ""going concern"" language sent shares tumbling more than 20% and had outlets reporting Kodak's potential demise.But Kodak's executives say everyone's missing the bigger picture. The company plans to tap into its pension fund, which is expected to deliver about $500 million in assets by December 2025 when the pension plan winds down. About $300 million of that will be straight cash.""Kodak is confident it will be able to pay off a significant portion of its term loan well before it becomes due,"" said Denisse Goldbarg , the company's chief marketing officer. She added that once the pension transaction closes, Kodak will be ""virtually net debt free"" with its strongest balance sheet in years.The plan sounds straightforward enough: use $300 million from the pension fund to knock out most of the $477 million term debt, then “amend, extend, or refinance” the remaining $177 million plus another $100 million in preferred stock.Of course, there's a catch. The pension fund payout isn't entirely under Kodak's control, which is why accounting rules required the ""going concern"" warning in the first place. Until that money actually hits their bank account, there's still some uncertainty.This isn't Kodak's first financial rodeo. The company that once dominated photography, controlling 90% of film and 85% of camera sales in the US during its 1970s heyday, filed for bankruptcy in 2012 as digital cameras killed the film business. Ironically, Kodak had actually invented the first digital camera back in 1975 but failed to capitalize on the technology that would eventually destroy its core business.Since emerging from bankruptcy, Kodak has reinvented itself as an industrial manufacturer focused on commercial printing and advanced materials. The company still produces films and chemicals for businesses including the movie industry, and licenses its iconic brand to a wide range of consumer products.Today's Kodak bears little resemblance to the company that once made ""Kodak moments"" part of photography culture. But for now, its message is clear: reports of its death have been greatly exaggerated.","Kodak says it has a solid financial plan to tackle its debt problems and stay in business.

America’s most disliked person? New data points straight to Elon Musk



Elon Musk is the most 'disliked' person in America: New study finds

Elon Musk’s role in DOGE



Elon Musk’s Fallout with President Donald Trump



Business consequences for Tesla and the EV Market



Wider impact on US political figures



A new Gallup poll has revealed that Elon Musk , once widely regarded as one of the most influential innovators of the 21st century, is now among the most unfavourable public figures worldwide. According to the survey of 1,000 randomly selected American adults, 61 percent of respondents expressed an unfavourable opinion of Musk. This finding highlights a sharp decline in his public image, driven by his association with US President Donald Trump and his leadership role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The results not only mark a turning point in Musk’s reputation but also signal wider consequences for his businesses, particularly Tesla, and the global electric vehicle (EV) industry.The Gallup survey positioned Musk above several controversial global leaders on the list of most disliked figures. Notably, he surpassed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who received a 52 percent unfavourable rating amid international criticism of his handling of the conflict in Gaza. The poll underscores Musk’s significant fall in public standing, placing him in the spotlight as one of the most divisive individuals on the global stage.These findings are consistent with earlier research conducted by the Associated Press in April, which showed only 33 percent of US adults held a favourable view of Musk. His favorability has continued to deteriorate throughout 2025, particularly after the breakdown of his relationship with Trump in mid-year.Musk’s declining reputation is closely tied to his involvement in DOGE, a government program created to improve bureaucratic efficiency. At the outset, the project appeared to be a limited role intended to align Musk with Trump’s administration without deep political involvement. However, Musk’s restructuring proposals, including plans to require federal employees to document five weekly workplace achievements, attracted both attention and controversy.In late October, Musk acknowledged the risks associated with his government role, saying, “I’ll probably need a lot of security, but it’s got to be done,” in reference to the push for systemic reforms. The initiative was ultimately terminated by the Trump administration, further contributing to Musk’s political and public challenges.Musk’s public image took a severe hit following his very public fallout with Trump in June. What began as a cooperative relationship quickly escalated into a high-profile dispute marked by threats and sharp words exchanged through media appearances and public statements.Trump, when asked about Musk during the summer, stated, “I’m not thinking about Elon. I just wish him well,” signalling a distancing from his once-close associate.The conflict proved damaging for Musk’s standing among Republican voters. Subsequent polling by the Associated Press showed a noticeable decline in his support among conservative groups, which had previously been one of his most consistent bases of political approval.The effects of Musk’s declining reputation have not been limited to politics. Tesla, his flagship electric vehicle company, has faced measurable business consequences. According to market data, sales have declined significantly in Europe and China, two of Tesla’s largest international markets. Analysts suggest that Musk’s polarising persona is discouraging potential buyers, not only of Tesla vehicles but also of electric cars from other manufacturers.This “Musk effect” could be slowing the adoption of electric vehicles globally, as consumer attitudes toward Musk appear to be influencing broader perceptions of the EV industry. The trend has raised concerns about the long-term implications for sustainable transportation and global climate initiatives that rely heavily on electric vehicle adoption.The Gallup poll also recorded declines in favorability for several members of the Trump administration. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, along with Trump himself, saw unfavourable ratings rise as the nation approaches the midterm elections. The trend suggests that Musk’s public fallout and controversies may be part of a broader wave of dissatisfaction with political figures tied to the administration.","A new Gallup poll has revealed that Elon Musk is now among the most unfavourable public figures worldwide.

Balancing innovation with safety



David Sacks, a key White House advisor has shared his thoughts on artificial intelligence in a recent podcast appearance. David Sacks the newly appointed AI car of White House stated that United States is presently dealing with a mental health crisis due to the rapid evolution of technology and social media. “We are in the midst of a mental health crisis in this country,” Sacks said, pointing to the psychological toll of digital platforms and the emerging risks posed by artificial intelligence. As reported by Business Insider, Sacks argued that the real threat to public mental health is not futuristic AI, but the deeply entrenched influence of social media.According to a report by Business Insider, Sacks warned about the growing phenomenon called ‘AI psychosis’. It is a state of emotional and cognitive distress which is trigged by constant exposure to misinformation, algorithm driven content and digital isolation. He further emphasised that social media platforms are powered increasingly sophisticated AI and are contributing to a moral panic. This in turn leads to deteriorating mental health among young users.Instead of futuristic AI, Sacks attributed the present mental health crises to COVID-19 and lockdown situations. ""That's what seems to have triggered a lot of these mental health declines,"" he said.Sacks also acknowledged the potential of transformative AI and emphasised the urgent need for ethical safeguards, mental health research, and public awareness campaigns. He called for a national strategy which can help treat mental health issues. “We can’t afford to treat this as a fringe issue. The psychological impact of AI and social media is central to the safety conversation,” he said.","David Sacks, a key White House advisor has shared his thoughts on artificial intelligence in a recent podcast appearance.

CEO’s mass firing strategy delivered 75% profit margins

IgniteTech CEO Eric Vaughan stands by his radical decision to replace nearly 80% of his workforce in 2023 after employees resisted the company's aggressive artificial intelligence adoption mandate. The enterprise software executive told Fortune he would repeat the mass personnel overhaul despite describing it as ""extremely difficult.""Vaughan's dramatic restructuring began in early 2023 when he declared AI an ""existential threat"" to businesses and implemented ""AI Mondays"" – weekly workdays where employees could only focus on artificial intelligence projects. When hundreds of workers pushed back against the company-wide transformation, Vaughan chose replacement over persuasion.Surprisingly, technical staff showed the most resistance to AI adoption, according to Vaughan's Fortune interview. These employees voiced concerns about AI limitations rather than embracing its capabilities, while marketing and sales teams proved more receptive to the new tools and training programs.The CEO invested 20% of payroll in mass AI education initiatives, including reimbursements for AI tools and prompt engineering classes. However, employee sabotage and flat refusal to participate led to the wholesale personnel changes that reshaped the company over 12 months.The painful transformation delivered substantial returns by 2024. IgniteTech launched two patent-pending AI solutions and maintained near 75% EBITDA while completing a major acquisition, demonstrating the financial viability of Vaughan's aggressive approach.Research from AI platform WRITER reveals Vaughan's experience reflects broader industry challenges, with one-third of workers actively sabotaging corporate AI initiatives. The study shows 41% of millennial and Gen Z employees resist AI implementation through various forms of non-compliance.Despite the success metrics, Vaughan doesn't recommend his mass replacement strategy to other leaders, calling it an unintended consequence of cultural resistance rather than a planned approach.","IgniteTech CEO Eric Vaughan replaced nearly 80% of his workforce in 2023.

How tech's first family business actually works

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's children have risen to executive positions within the company, establishing the AI giant as Silicon Valley's first major tech firm to operate as a family business. Madison Huang now directs the Omniverse division's 3D simulation software operations, while her brother Spencer Huang oversees AI model development and robotics perception systems, The Information reports.Huang's entry into Nvidia's higher ranks breaks decades of Silicon Valley convention where tech founders' children typically avoid family businesses. Neither sibling works in Nvidia's core semiconductor operations, instead focusing on emerging strategic divisions that position the company for future growth beyond traditional chip manufacturing.Both Huang children initially rejected technology careers entirely. Madison studied culinary arts at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris and spent four years at luxury conglomerate LVMH before returning to the family orbit. Spencer operated R&D Cocktail Lab, a bar in Taipei, demonstrating hands-on management skills his colleagues now compare to his father's approach.The siblings' corporate journey began in 2019 with a joint MIT artificial intelligence course. Madison joined Nvidia as a marketing intern in 2020, rapidly advancing to senior director with compensation exceeding $1 million by 2023, according to The Information. Spencer closed his bar operations in 2021 before joining Nvidia's robotics division the following year.The Information noted that colleagues describe contrasting leadership styles, with Madison displaying assertive management qualities while Spencer maintains a more collaborative approach. Madison is said to have demanding work standards and responding to emails within minutes, while Spencer adopts mirrors his father's management techniques, implementing weekly ""five key priorities"" reporting systems similar to Jensen Huang's long-standing practices.Madison's rapid ascent has drawn particular attention, and her prominence became evident at this year's Computex Taipei, where attendees described her as having ""rock star"" status while walking through exhibition halls in her signature blue suit.The family business model operates through strategic placement rather than traditional succession. Both Huang siblings received frequent promotions since joining, with Madison earning over $1 million in 2023 compensation after joining the CEO's core team for major company events.Beyond the Huang children, co-founder Chris Malachowsky's offspring and Director Aarti Shah's children also hold company positions, creating what executives describe as a multi-generational talent pipeline.During a company-wide meeting earlier this year, Jensen Huang directly addressed nepotism concerns, acknowledging that multiple employees' children work at Nvidia. The Information reported that the CEO expressed confidence in these hires, suggesting parents wouldn't recommend their children if it risked embarrassment.","Madison Huang directs the Omniverse division's 3D simulation software operations, while her brother Spencer Huang oversees AI model development and robotics perception systems.

Immigration and innovation



Moondy Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi has issued a cautious forecast as fears of US recession are mounting. Zandi has said that the economy is teetering on the edge of downturn. However, Zandi also mentioned that there’s a silver lining for the tech professionals. In a series of post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Zandi pointed out the troubling indicators from the economic data released last week which showed evidence of the deteriorating situation.“The economy is on the precipice of recession. That’s the clear takeaway from last week’s economic data dump. Consumer spending has flatlined, construction and manufacturing are contracting, and employment is set to fall. And with inflation on the rise, it is tough for the Fed to come to the rescue,” wrote Mark Zandi in a post in X.Speaking to Business Insider, Mark Zandi pointed to multiple factors that could insulate the tech sector from the worst effects of a slowdown.- Persistent demand for AI and automation tools across industries- Strong investment in cloud infrastructure and cybersecurity- Global hiring flexibility, allowing companies to tap talent beyond U.S. borders- Government and enterprise spending on digital transformation, even during downturns.Mark Zandi feels that the tech sector will remain as one the few industries in which productivity will increase. “The tech sector remains one of the few areas where productivity gains are driving real value,” Zandi noted.Along with this, Zandi also warned about the restrictive immigration policies which could hurt the tech sector. He urged the lawmakers to protect access to global talent especially in AI, software engineering, and data science. ""If it feels like we're coming to the end of the tariff increases, or like we're going to get a more rational immigration policy,' I think that would be a signal that the coast may be cleared,"" Zandi told BI.“It’s no mystery why the economy is struggling; blame increasing U.S. tariffs and highly restrictive immigration policy. The tariffs are cutting increasingly deeply into the profits of American companies and the purchasing power of American households. Fewer immigrant workers means a smaller economy,” added Zandi.","Moondy Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi has issued a cautious forecast as fears of US recession are mounting.

John Krafcik, the former CEO of Waymo who turned Google ’s self-driving car project into a commercial ride-hailing business, has raised doubts about Tesla’s Robotaxi.

Apple's expansion plans in India

Apple India Private Limited has signed a 10-year lease for a 2.7 lakh square foot office space in Bengaluru. According to a report by Business Standard, the real estate deal, valued at a total of Rs 1,010 crore, marks a major expansion for Apple in India. The new office, located in Embassy Zenith on Sankey Road in the upscale Vasanth Nagar area, is set to be Apple's second and potentially largest office in India's tech hub. Industry experts suggest it could accommodate over 1,200 employees and may be one of the largest single-tenant office leases in Bengaluru's commercial real estate market.Citing lease documents from real estate data firm Propstack, the report said that Apple will occupy the 5th through 13th floors of the building. The agreement covers a carpet area of 196,179 sq ft, or 268,737 sq ft when including chargeable areas. The monthly rent is reportedly set at Rs 6.315 crore, which works out to an effective rate of Rs 235 per square foot. A 4.5% annual escalation clause is included in the lease, ensuring a steady increase in rent over the 10-year term. To secure the agreement, Apple paid a security deposit of Rs 31.57 crore.In addition to the base rent, the total outlay of Rs 1,010 crore covers common area maintenance (CAM) fees and charges for car parking. The building is owned by Mac Charles (India) Limited, an affiliate of the Embassy Group.Apple has also expressed interest in nearly doubling its footprint within the same building by leasing the ground to fourth floors, an additional 121,203 sq ft. If this expansion proceeds, Apple's total office space in Embassy Zenith would be close to 4 lakh sq ft. This move aligns with Apple's broader strategy to scale up its presence in India, which includes increasing local production and opening new retail stores. The company, which launched its first two flagship retail stores in Mumbai and Delhi in 2023, has plans for four more stores in Bengaluru and Pune.This new lease comes after Apple's 2021 agreement for a 1.16 lakh sq ft space in Prestige Minsk Square, also in central Bengaluru, where operations began in 2023.

iQiyi's market share and regional dominance

Netflix may be staring at a huge problem, and it is China. Chinese streaming giants are reportedly quickly gaining ground on their American rivals in the booming Southeast Asian market. According to a report in Nikkei Asia, companies like iQiyi and Tencent are making major plays, shifting their focus to producing original content tailored for local audiences. Referred to as "" China's Netflix ,"" iQiyi, a subsidiary of Baidu, has been expanding across Southeast Asia since 2019, with a strong presence in Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The company has attracted 36 million monthly subscribers in the region by offering a mix of free ad-supported viewing and affordable subscription fees. In Thailand, iQiyi's library features over 9,000 titles, with more than 60% being Chinese productions.iQiyi hosts a plethora of content from Chinese period dramas to blockbuster Hollywood films. Moving forward, iQiyi is investing heavily in local content, says the report. The company plans to spend up to 1.54 million dollars ($1.54 million) per production and release four to six Thai titles annually, specifically targeting popular genres like ""boys' love"" and ""girls' love"" dramas. In Indonesia and Malaysia, iQiyi is partnering with local studios and carriers like Telkomsel to produce original content for the carrier's 170 million subscribers. iQiyi vies with Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd to rank among the biggest video-streaming platforms in China, with an estimated 400 million-plus monthly active users.Tencent launched its WeTV service in Southeast Asia in 2019 and is also prioritizing original content. Since 2024, the company has been producing local idol programs, which has led to the formation of successful groups like the seven-member boy band NexT1de.Earlier this year, iQiyi said that it plans to open its first theme park this year, based on characters from its own shows. The forthcoming “iQiyi Land” is set to open in the city of Yangzhou in Jiangsu province, just over two hours from Shanghai by high-speed train.While U.S. services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video entered the region around 2016 and hold a dominant share in some areas—nearly 60% in Singapore—Chinese companies are rapidly closing the gap. In Thailand, Chinese providers command about 40% of the market, surpassing the roughly 30% held by U.S. services. This is partly attributed to the large ethnic Chinese population in Southeast Asia and the popularity of Chinese content.The fierce competition in the domestic Chinese market is also a driving factor for this expansion. With domestic revenue and profits falling, Southeast Asia's young population and rising incomes present a significant growth opportunity.

What the sentencing memo on the former Intel engineer said



Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 Review: Changing The Game

A former Intel engineer who illegally shared the company’s trade secrets with his new employer, Microsoft, has been sentenced to two years of probation and ordered to pay a fine of over $34,000, a report has said. The sentence was handed down last week to Varun Gupta, who worked as a product marketing engineer for Intel for nearly a decade. He was fired from his senior position at Microsoft after his actions came to light.According to Assistant US Attorney William Narus, Gupta copied thousands of confidential files from his Intel computer onto a portable hard drive before leaving the company in 2020, as per a report in Oregon Live.He then “repeatedly accessed those documents” and used them to represent Microsoft in contract negotiations with his former employer, specifically on a deal related to computer processors, the report added.“Not only did the defendant take proprietary materials with him, he also used those materials during negotiations against his prior employer,” Narus said in a sentencing memo. One of the documents shared was a PowerPoint presentation outlining Intel's pricing strategy with another major customer.In a sentencing memo, Narus argued for an eight-month prison term, emphasising the need to deter such behavior in an industry with high employee turnover.“Not only did the defendant take proprietary materials with him, he also used those materials during negotiations against his prior employer,” Narus wrote.Varun Gupta’s defense attorney, David Angeli, countered that Gupta had already suffered a significant and lasting punishment. Angeli noted that his client had already lost the high-level position he worked years to achieve, settled a civil lawsuit with Intel for $40,000, and experienced a permanently damaged reputation that effectively ended his career in the tech sector.In a prepared statement to the court, Varun Gupta apologised to both Intel and Microsoft, as well as the government, for the resources spent “because of my bad decision.”He spoke of his daily struggle with questions about his future and his ""legacy"" as he works to rebuild his life in a new country. After leaving the tech industry, Varun Gupta relocated his family to France and is now studying vineyard management, with aspirations of working in the wine industry.",Varun Gupta worked as a product marketing engineer for Intel for nearly a decade.

His entry had 335 language translations, surpassing Turkey (332), the US (327), and Japan (324). This put him ahead of commonly searched terms like ""dog"" and ""Jesus.""A Wikipedia editor named ""Grnrchst,"" investigated and discovered that over a decade, hundreds of accounts and IPs inserted Woodard’s name into articles, created pages about him in over 90 languages, and spread references across the site. However, Wikipedia has since removed more than 300 articles and banned numerous accounts. About 20 articles remain, with the English one not mentioning the controversy.The composer, who is known for his ""prequiem"" written for Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and his interest in a defunct Aryan colony in Paraguay, had a significant digital footprint that confused online communities. According to a report by Ars Technica, questions arose on sites like Reddit, with users wondering about his prominence and how he achieved such a ranking on the platform.Woodard's Wikipedia Page : For a brief period, David Woodard's page was the article on Wikipedia with the most language translations. It had entries in 335 different languages, exceeding the number of languages for entire countries like Turkey (332 languages), the US (327 languages), and Japan (324 languages).Comparison to Other Popular Entries: His article also had more language translations than several other popular entries, including:The Rise and Fall: A few months ago, his entry did not have the position at the very top. The rapid increase in his article's translations led many to suspect a self-promotion campaign , possibly aided by automated or AI tools.","For a time, David Woodard's Wikipedia entry had more language translations than any other article on the site.

Steve Jobs offered him a deal that could have made him the world’s first trillionaire — but he said no; who is Nolan Bushnell?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/steve-jobs-offered-him-a-deal-that-could-have-made-him-the-worlds-first-trillionaire-but-he-said-no-who-is-nolan-bushnell/articleshow/123344679.cms,"

Steve Jobs’ offer and Bushnell’s decision

Apple’s rise without Bushnell

The trillion-dollar “what-if”

In Silicon Valley, fortunes are made and sometimes lost with a single decision. Few stories illustrate this better than that of Nolan Bushnell , the visionary who co-founded Atari and is often called the “father of video games .” In the mid-1970s, Bushnell hired a young Steve Jobs at Atari, mentoring him in his early career. Later, Jobs and his friend Steve Wozniak pitched Bushnell an opportunity: invest $50,000 for a one-third stake in their fledgling company, Apple . Bushnell turned it down. That choice, which seemed trivial at the time, cost him the chance to join the wealthiest ranks of history. Today, that stake would be worth close to $1 trillion, making Bushnell the world’s first trillionaire .Jobs’ time at Atari exposed him to the world of electronics and games, and it was here that he developed a bond with Bushnell. When Jobs and Wozniak began work on their own personal computer venture, they turned to Bushnell for early backing. The offer was simple: $50,000 for one-third of Apple. Bushnell declined, citing his commitments to Atari and skepticism about the risk. He later admitted in interviews that he thought it was too much money for an untested idea. In hindsight, that modest sum would have yielded a fortune larger than any billionaire’s wealth today, surpassing Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and even entire national economies.Bushnell’s rejection did not slow Jobs and Wozniak. Apple went on to become a revolutionary force in personal computing , smartphones, and digital music, now valued at around $2.8 trillion. Without Bushnell’s involvement, Jobs and Wozniak retained more control, which allowed them to steer Apple according to their uncompromising vision. Interestingly, Bushnell’s “no” may have helped Apple remain uniquely independent in its early years. He later reflected that while he missed out on unimaginable wealth, he never regretted prioritizing his own projects such as Atari and later Chuck E. Cheese, both of which shaped popular culture in different ways.Bushnell’s missed opportunity is often cited alongside other legendary near-misses in tech. Ronald Wayne, Apple’s third cofounder, sold his 10% stake for just $800, a stake now worth more than $280 billion. Yahoo once turned down Google for $1 million, and Blockbuster refused to buy Netflix for $50 million. These stories highlight how early-stage ventures often appear risky, even to insiders. For Bushnell, the rejection meant losing out on becoming the world’s first trillionaire. Yet his legacy as a pioneer of gaming and as an early mentor to Jobs remains intact. In many ways, his influence shaped Silicon Valley’s culture, even if he chose not to ride the Apple wave. His story remains a reminder that even visionaries can underestimate the next big thing. In Silicon Valley, sometimes the greatest fortunes are lost not by failure—but by hesitation.","Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak offered Nolan Bushnell $50,000 for a one-third stake in Apple.

Microsoft's new return to office plan: Three-day office attendance or employees can…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-new-return-to-office-plan-three-day-office-attendance-or-employees-can/articleshow/123343413.cms,"Microsoft joins Big Tech's office comeback wave

Microsoft is set to require employees to work from the office at least three days per week starting January 2025, a move that could prompt resignations among workers who prefer remote arrangements. The new policy will affect employees living within 50 miles of Microsoft's Redmond headquarters, where most of the company's 228,000 global workforce is based. Some teams may face stricter requirements of four or five days in-person, depending on executive decisions, Business Insider reports.The company plans to announce the changes in September, giving workers several months to adapt to the new expectations. While Microsoft will allow employees to apply for exceptions, the approval process and criteria remain unclear.This marks a sharp shift from Microsoft's pandemic-era flexibility, which allowed most workers to spend up to half their time working remotely without manager approval. The Verge notes that many employees had been working from home even more frequently under the relaxed interpretation of company policy. The policy reversal is particularly notable given that cloud executive Scott Guthrie told employees last September that Microsoft wouldn't change its flexible work stance unless productivity dropped significantly, yet the company has continued posting strong earnings and reaching a $4 trillion market cap.With its upcoming mandate, Microsoft falls in line with other tech giants tightening their remote work policies. Amazon now demands five full days in the office, while Google and Meta require three-day attendance. The Verge reports the timing comes as employee morale sits at historic lows following roughly 15,000 layoffs this year, despite Microsoft posting $27 billion in quarterly profits. CFO Amy Hood recently sent employees a memo calling for ""intensity, clarity, and bold execution"" in the upcoming fiscal year, building on CEO Satya Nadella's earlier message about requiring ""dedication, drive, and hard work.""CFO Amy Hood recently sent employees a memo calling for ""intensity, clarity, and bold execution"" in the upcoming fiscal year, building on CEO Satya Nadella's earlier message about requiring ""dedication, drive, and hard work.""Sources tell that Microsoft employees are viewing the policy as a form of ""stealth layoff,"" a way to encourage departures without formal terminations, according to sources cited by Business Insider. Workers unwilling to comply with the new attendance rules may choose to leave rather than fight the requirements.Practical challenges loom large, with sources reporting that Microsoft's offices already struggle with limited space, power shortages, and insufficient meeting rooms despite a $5 billion campus expansion effort. Further, the situation creates an awkward contradiction for Microsoft, which markets software enabling remote collaboration and previously promoted hybrid work as beneficial for productivity and employee retention.","Microsoft is set to require employees to work from the office at least three days per week starting January 2025.

Trump Rages At Schumer As Senate Talks Collapse, Nominations And Budget Face Gridlock

Here’s Senators' full letter to Donald Trump on Nvidia, AMD chip sales to China



Dear President Trump:

We write to urge you to reverse your decision to allow AMD and Nvidia to sell advanced AI semiconductor chips (“covered chips”) to the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), in exchange for a fee. These sales to a leading adversary run counter to U.S. national security interests, and the collection of fees appear to violate U.S. statutes and may even be unconstitutional.

Our export controls exist to ensure that American goods and technologies are protected from our adversaries. To ensure such protection, export laws explicitly state that, “[n]o fee may be charged in connection with the submission, processing, or consideration of any application for a license or other authorization or other request.”

Yet on August 11, 2025, you stated that: “I want 20 percent if I'm going to approve [these licenses] for [Nvidia (and AMD)] and “[Nvidia] said, 'Would you make it 15?' So we negotiate a little deal”. This “negotiated deal,” allowing American semiconductor manufacturers to pay a 15 percent fee for the ability to sell critically sensitive technology to our adversary, blatantly violates the purpose of export control laws. Additionally, your spokesperson has indicated that your administration may be considering this form of “deal making” for other exports.

A cornerstone of U.S artificial intelligence strategy for years has been to protect America’s advantage in AI computing capability and access to leading-edge hardware, compared to the PRC and other key adversaries. AI represents a crucial enabling technology that is critical to the future of everything from finance to healthcare, manufacturing, and national security. The PRC seeks to use AI to strengthen its military systems like hypersonics, as well as its communications, surveillance, battlefield decisionmaking processes. In April, your administration placed export controls on the flow of Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308 chips to the PRC, identifying the national security risk of the PRC's military having access to these advanced AI chips. However, only months later, following industry lobbying, you have flippantly reversed that decision with no coherent explanation for how the national security risks you had in April have been mitigated in August.

Our national security and military readiness relies upon American innovators inventing and producing the best technology in the world, and in maintaining that qualitative advantage in sensitive domains. The United States has historically been successful in maintaining and building that advantage because of, in part, our ability to deny adversaries access to those technologies. The willingness displayed in this arrangement to “negotiate” away America’s competitive edge that is key to our national security in exchange for what is, in effect, a commission on a sale of AI-enabling technology to our main global competitor, is cause for serious alarm.

We again urge your Administration to quickly reverse course and abandon this reckless plan to trade away U.S. technology leadership. In order to assist the public in its understanding of this proposed deal, we request the following information by August 22:

1. What entities or parties were involved in the “negotiation” that resulted in the 15 percent payment requirement as a condition for granting a license to sell covered chips to the PRC?

2. What laws, regulations, or other factors were identified, raised, evaluated, and/or otherwise determined to be relevant in those negotiations, including any legal opinions provided by Administration attorneys used to inform the legality of various approached proposed during those deliberations?

3. Who was responsible for determining that this arrangement complies with United States laws, regulations, and international obligations?

4. Describe the manner in which the 15 percent fee will be determined and collected.

5. What individual(s) or entities are responsible for making the determination and collection identified in item 4?

6. List all purposes to which the 15 percent fee payments will be directed once collected.

7. What other companies are under consideration for this kind of deal utilizing export control laws?

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

What Nvidia has to say on its AI chips’ alleged China military use

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 Review: Changing The Game

Six Senate Democrats have sent an open letter to President Donald Trump , asking him to reconsider his decision to permit tech giants Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to sell advanced AI semiconductor chips to China. The group of senators include Chuck Schumer , Mark Warner , Elizabeth Warren, Jack Reed , Jeanne Shaheen and Christopher Coons. They warned that the sale of specific chips—Nvidia’s H20 and AMD ’s MI308—could potentially bolster China’s military capabilities.The senators’ letter was a response to a recent announcement by Trump, which granted export licenses to the companies in exchange for a 15% share of the revenue from these sales.An Nvidia spokesperson said that the company’s H20 chips do not enhance anyone’s military capabilities.“The H20 would not enhance anyone’s military capabilities, but would have helped America attract the support of developers worldwide and win the AI race. Banning the H20 cost American taxpayers billions of dollars, without any benefit,” a Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC.","Six Democrats have sent an open letter to President Donald Trump asking him to reconsider his decision to permit the sale of tech giants Nvidia and AMD to China.

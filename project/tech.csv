James Fishback letter to Tesla Board slamming Elon Musk

Elon has gone too far.

My investment firm (@InvestAzoria) has decided to postpone next week's public listing of our Azoria Tesla Convexity ETF.

Our decision comes in direct response to @ElonMusk’s announcement that he is launching a new national political party.

This creates a conflict with his full-time responsibilities as CEO of Tesla. It diverts his focus and energy away from Tesla’s employees and shareholders.

Azoria believes that Tesla is the most compelling long-term investment in AI. With breakthroughs in robotaxis, Optimus, and full self-driving, no other company is positioned to lead the future like Tesla.

In May, when Elon stepped back from his work at DOGE and returned his attention to Tesla, we were encouraged. With Elon fully engaged, he gave shareholders renewed confidence in Tesla’s future.

Elon's announcement today undermines that confidence.

Unlike his work with SpaceX or xAI, which complement Tesla’s R&D efforts in AI, automation, and engineering, a political party not only fails to complement Tesla’s mission—it actively undermines it.

I just sent the attached letter to Robyn Denholm, Chair of Tesla's Board of Directors.

I encourage the Board to meet immediately and ask Elon to clarify his political ambitions and evaluate whether they are compatible with his full-time obligations to Tesla as CEO.

I remain hopeful that Elon will return his full attention to Tesla. If not, I trust the Board will take appropriate action.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants Elon Musk to worry about his companies, not politics

Former DOGE adviser James Fishback seems very upset with Tesla CEO Elon Musk's decision to start a new political party. Last week, Elon Musk made the announcement a day after polling his followers on the social media platform Twitter, declaring, ""Today the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom."" Slamming Musk's plans to create political party, Fishback has sent an open letter to Tesla Board. The letter urges Tesla board members to ask Elon Musk to clarify his political ambitions. ""I encourage the Board to meet immediately and ask Elon to clarify his political ambitions and evaluate whether they are compatible with his full-time obligations to Tesla as CEO,"" Fishback wrote.Fishback added that the announcement undermines the confidence shareholders had in Tesla's future after Musk said in May he was stepping back from his role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He added that his investment firm Azoria Partners will defer the listing of its Azoria Texla Convexity exchange-traded fund due to Musk's announcement. Azoria was set to launch the Tesla ETF, which would invest in the electric vehicle company's shares and options, next week.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the Tesla and SpaceX boss focus on business and not politics. When asked by CNN if Elon Musk's plan bothered the Donald Trump administration, Bessent offered a thinly veiled criticism. ""I believe that the boards of directors at his various companies wanted him to come back and run those companies, which he is better at than anyone,"" Bessent said.""So I imagine that those board of directors did not like this announcement yesterday and will be encouraging him to focus on his business activities, not his political activities."" Bessent went on to add that the principles of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk ran for several months as part of Trump's drive to slash government spending and jobs, were ""very popular.""",Former DOGE adviser James Fishback slams Tesla CEO Elon Musk's decision to start a new political party.

Chinese village that is at the central of the US-China AI war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinese-village-that-is-at-the-central-of-us-china-ai-war/articleshow/122284201.cms,"Hangzhou is home to Alibaba, DeepSeek and many other AI giants

Biggest challenge of Chinese companies -- tough to attract foreign capital

China has a new and emerging rival to America's Silicon Valley -- and it is Liangzhu, a quiet suburb on the outskirts of Hangzhou. The city is one of China’s fastest-growing centers of artificial intelligence development. Describing a scene on a Saturday afternoon in the city, a report in New York Times said, ""...dozens of people sat in the grass around a backyard stage where aspiring founders of tech startups talked about their ideas."" A former Facebook and Alibaba employee who hosted the event, Felix Tao told NYT, “People come here to explore their own possibilities.”According to The New York Times report, virtually every conversation at startup and corporate gatherings in this city circles back to artificial intelligence — the technology at the heart of China’s push to compete with the United States in the global tech arena and the one China and America are fighting for supremacy.Hangzhou has long been a magnet for talent and innovation, home to Chinese tech giants like Alibaba, NetEase, and surveillance technology company Hikvision. More recently, the city has given rise to DeepSeek, a fast-growing AI firm that captured international attention in January after unveiling a powerful open-source model it said cost a fraction of its Western equivalents.DeepSeek is one of what Chinese media now call the “six tigers of Hangzhou” — a group of AI and robotics startups making headlines at home and abroad. Game Science, another member of the cohort, produced Black Myth: Wukong, the first Chinese-made video game to achieve global blockbuster status. Robotics firm Unitree made a splash in January when its robot dogs performed a choreographed dance during the state broadcaster’s Spring Festival Gala.The AI surge in Hangzhou reportedly did not happen by accident. Over the past decade, provincial and local authorities have rolled out tax breaks and subsidies to attract tech startups, a strategy that has helped seed hundreds of companies. On weekends, investors and entrepreneurs fly in from Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen to scout talent — and often end up in Tao’s backyard.Many of Liangzhu’s coders are alumni of Zhejiang University, one of China’s top engineering schools and the alma mater of DeepSeek’s founder. Their technical skills are in such high demand that Chinese media recently covered the defection of a core DeepSeek engineer to electronics giant Xiaomi as front-page news.Still, many engineers say they are biding their time, waiting for noncompete agreements with firms like ByteDance to expire before launching startups of their own.Yet Hangzhou’s rise as a tech powerhouse has not come without complications. Several founders told The New York Times that the same government support that fueled their early growth now makes it harder to attract foreign capital. International investors are increasingly wary of Chinese tech firms, especially those with ties to the state. Some fear their companies could meet the same fate as ByteDance, the parent of TikTok, whose executives have faced tough scrutiny in the United States over national security concerns.The dilemma has left founders with limited options. “You either take government funding and stay focused on China, or raise enough on your own to open an office in Singapore or elsewhere,” one founder said, requesting anonymity to speak candidly. “Most people can’t afford the second route.”Adding to the uncertainty is the question of access to the chips that power advanced AI models. The U.S. government has imposed increasingly strict export controls on high-performance semiconductors, making it difficult for Chinese firms to buy processors from companies like Nvidia. In response, Chinese tech giants — including Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation — are racing to build domestic alternatives.While Chinese-made chips have enabled some companies, such as ByteDance, to offer limited AI services locally, industry experts say it remains unclear whether those supplies can keep up with demand — or how long it will take for China to achieve true chip independence.","Hangzhou is one of China’s fastest-growing centers of artificial intelligence development.

“There are people sitting in our office in King’s Cross, London, working, and collaborating with AI to design drugs for cancer. That’s happening right now.”

“The next big milestone is actually going out to clinical trials, starting to put these things into human beings. We’re staffing up now. We’re getting very close,”

“This was the inspiration for Isomorphic Labs. It really demonstrates that we could do something very foundational in AI that could help unlock drug discovery.”

“We identify an unmet need, and we start our own drug design programs. We develop those, put them into human clinical trials… we haven’t got that yet, but we’re making good progress,”

“We’re trying to do all these things: speed them up, reduce the cost, but also really improve the chance that we can be successful. “One day we hope to be able to say — well, here’s a disease, and then click a button and out pops the design for a drug to address that disease. All powered by these amazing AI tools,”

Google DeepMind 's drug discovery arm, Isomorphic Labs, is “ready"" to begin human trials of its AI-designed drugs . In an interview with Fortune, Colin Murdoch , President of Isomorphic Labs and Google DeepMind’s Chief Business Officer, said that the company is “getting very close” to starting human trials of these drugs. This development signifies a potential step for Isomorphic Labs after years of work on its AI-assisted drug designing. Isomorphic Labs was established as a separate entity from DeepMind in 2021. Its foundation stems from AlphaFold , a notable AI system developed by DeepMind, recognised for its ability to predict protein structures with considerable accuracy.During an interview with Fortune in Paris, Murdoch said:he added.Isomorphic Labs, the company that spun out from DeepMind in 2021, originated from AlphaFold, an AI system known for accurately predicting protein structures.Over time, AlphaFold evolved to model interactions between proteins and molecules like DNA and drugs, significantly advancing its utility in drug discovery and accelerating the development of new medicines.Talking about AlphaFold, Murdoch highlighted:In 2024, Isomorphic Labs partnered with Novartis and Eli Lilly after releasing AlphaFold 3. By April 2025, it had raised $600 million in its first external funding round led by Thrive Capital.These moves support its goal of creating a “world-class drug design engine” that combines AI and pharma expertise to develop medicines more efficiently.Alongside supporting existing drug programs, the company is also developing its candidates in fields like oncology and immunology for future licensing.Murdoch explained.Currently, pharma companies invest millions in drug development, often with only a 10% success rate in trials. Murdoch aims to use AlphaFold’s technology to significantly boost these odds, ideally reaching a point where researchers can be fully confident in a drug’s effectiveness before human trials begin.Murdoch continued.","Isomorphic Labs was established as a separate entity from DeepMind in 2021.

HPE CEO Antonio Neri comes 'under pressure' from investor with a history of forcing out top execs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/hpe-ceo-antonio-neri-comes-under-pressure-from-investor-with-a-history-of-forcing-out-chief-executives/articleshow/122282321.cms,"Image credit: LinkedIn

What HPE said about its relationship with investor Elliott Management



“We value the constructive input of all of our shareholders,”

“Near the end of the quarter, we realised that the cost of our inventory was slightly higher than the cost that we had in the pricing. That’s on us. That should never happen,”

iOS 26 Beta 2 Hands-On: Apple Finally Does It

Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) CEO Antonio Neri is reportedly ""under pressure"" from activist investor Elliott Management, which has a history of forcing out chief executives. Elliott Management 's $1.5 billion stake in HPE, first publicly reported in April, marks a significant investment in the company. Since then, both companies have remained silent regarding any negotiations between them. According to an earlier report by the news agency Reuters, 14 chief executives have been removed from their positions after Elliott acquired a stake in their companies and initiated discussions with their boards. HPE recently saw its stock value decline after failing to identify an error in its inventory pricing. Despite Elliott's investment being known to be a long position and not a short bet against the company, clues regarding demands from HPE are reportedly evident.In a brief statement to Fortune, HPE said:however, it didn’t mention any specifics.The indication of trouble came in March when HPE released its Q1 earnings, causing its stock to drop nearly 16% in a single day. In a CNBC interview, CEO Antonio Neri acknowledged that the company had miscalculated inventory costs, which negatively impacted profitability and wiped more than $3 billion off HPE’s market cap.Neri noted.When news emerged that Elliott sought influence over HPE, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee suggested the firm likely aimed to address HPE’s stock valuation gap and improve operational efficiency. He also highlighted HPE’s lagging performance, noting it generated $494,000 in revenue per employee, significantly less than Dell’s $885,000.HPE shares recently rose after the DOJ dropped its probe into the Juniper Networks acquisition, but the stock is still up only 48% since 2018, well behind the S&P 500’s 135% gain.Despite being in the AI era, HPE’s performance has lagged, raising concerns about its leadership, with CEO Antonio Neri in charge for seven-half years and the board serving for over a decade, the report notes.While some see a leadership shakeup as overdue, Elliott may instead seek a board seat and push for strategic changes through collaboration rather than a shareholder proxy fight.","Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) CEO Antonio Neri is reportedly ""under pressure"" from activist investor Elliott Management, which has a history of forcing out chief executives.

Self driving cars to be first commerce use of Nvidia’s robotics technology: Jensen Huang





Redmi Pad 2: Know these Things Before Buying!

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence (AI), the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Huang said both AI and robotics represent what he believes a “multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity”. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said during the conference. Nvidia’s robotics division has seen fast growth in the past. Currently making up just 1% of Nvidia’s total revenue, the revenue brought in $567 million last quarter – a steep 72% rise from the previous year.“We’re working towards a day where there will be billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories that can be powered by Nvidia technology,” Huang said.Huang also emphasized a shift in how the company sees itself. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” he said, adding that Nvidia is now focused on being an “AI infrastructure” and “computing platform” provider.During the annual shareholder meeting, Huang said that Nvidia’s chips will be key not just for AI training, but also for software and hardware use in autonomous vehicles and robots. He named self-driving cars as the first major commercial use of Nvidia’s robotics technology. Nvidia’s Drive platform, a suite of chips and software for autonomous cars, is currently being used by Mercedes-Benz.The chipmaker recently introduced Cosmos, a line of AI models designed for humanoid robots.In a related news, Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company with a market cap of around $3.75 trillion. The company has rebounded strongly since a market dip earlier this year, which was caused by concerns about competition from China’s DeepSeek AI.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence, the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122088756,imgsize-19028,width-400,resizemode-4/Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Huang.jpg"

The US Embassy in India has issued a clear warning for visa applicants. “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas,” the embassy said in a post on microblogging site X (previously known as Twitter). The post reminded visa applicants to disclose all social media usernames or handles they’ve used over the past five years while filling out the DS-160 visa application form. “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form” the post read. “Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit.”The requirement is part of broader vetting procedures introduced by the US State Department in recent years. As part of the updated rules, applicants must list IDs used on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and others—even if the accounts are no longer active from the last five years.The move comes days after the US government issued a new guideline for those applying for student and exchange visitor visas. Applicable to all applicants of F, M, and J non-immigrant visas, the new rule requires these applicants to set their social media accounts to public. “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under U.S. law,"" the US embassy in India wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post.F, M and J visas are the common types of non-immigrant visas issued by the agency to foreign nationals who wish to study or participate in exchange visitor programs in the U.S. F visa is typically used by academic students, the M visa by vocational students, and the J visa by exchange visitors, including researchers, scholars, and interns.In a related news, USCIS has announced that it will switch to a new phone number for sending text (SMS) messages. “Effective July 1, 2025, USCIS will no longer send text (SMS) messages from the phone number 468-311 (GOV-311).

Not many people think twice about their passport—until they’re applying for one. Whether travelling abroad for a dream vacation, a foreign career, or an unexpected crisis, the process can be either smooth sailing or a nightmare. In the last decade, however, India's passport operations have undergone a quiet revolution in the background.On June 24, 2025, on the occasion of the observance of the 13th Passport Seva Divas, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar recognised this change. His speech wasn't merely formal. It was a straightforward assessment of how technology, governance, and public service have converged to impact actual people daily.In a social media update on X, Dr. Jaishankar expressed gratitude to passport officials, both in India and posted overseas, for what he labelled as a ""remarkable transformation"" in service delivery. He associated the program with three pillars: Seva (service), Sushasan (good governance), and Garib Kalyan (welfare). For the minister, these concepts are no longer theoretical—they're being implemented through services such as the Passport Seva Programme.The passport application process in India was all about delays, red tape, and queuing up for years. The picture has changed dramatically now. The Passport Seva Programme (PSP), initiated by the Ministry of External Affairs, has gradually revolutionised the way individuals apply for, obtain, and renew their passports.Dr. Jaishankar said the PSP is an expression of the government's overall vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"", a developed India with technology and governance aligned to better serve citizens. To say it in his own words, ""Seva, Sushasan and Garib Kalyan are three major pillars of governance that would take us to a Viksit Bharat. They are all expressed with prominence in our Passport Seva Programme.""This scheme is not limited to cities alone. It has spread its wings to Tier 3 and Tier 2 towns and districts with Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs), so that first-time applicants, migrant labourers, and students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities can avail of passport facilities without having to travel long distances.What was once seen as a long, often frustrating ordeal has now become a smoother and more accessible process. People are able to schedule appointments with ease, receive timely updates, and walk into clean, well-managed centres with helpful staff.Among the largest announcements this year is the country-wide introduction of e-Passports. They're not new passports with a new cover, they're embedded with a microchip bearing critical personal and biometric information.Here's what makes them different:The technology used is no different from that which is already common in most developed nations, bringing India's passport program to par with the best worldwide.e-Passports have several practical advantages:As per the latest updates from the Ministry of External Affairs, e-passports are issued phase-wise and in the next few years will become the norm for all new applicants.More countries are adopting digital verification systems, and e-passports are expected to further streamline international travel. Travelers will benefit from smoother immigration checks and faster processing through automated e-gates at major airports. With the government's phased rollout underway, carrying a smarter and more secure passport is set to become the new norm for Indian citizens.One of the more frustrating parts of applying for a passport has always been the police verification process. Depending on the location, this step could delay an application by weeks.In order to mitigate that, the Ministry of External Affairs launched the mPassport Police App, a mobile app now being used by the police in 25 states and Union Territories. As per the official update in the Ministry, the app has managed to decrease verification timelines to a mere 5 to 7 days in most regions.Police officers currently get electronic notifications, can upload proof of information at the scene, and transmit real-time updates to passport offices. This not only enhances speed but also avoids paperwork by hand and follow-up delays.For students, working professionals, and first-time applicants, this alone has made the whole process much more certain and less stressful.If you want to know how to obtain an e-passport, the procedure is not that different from obtaining a normal one. Here's how you do it:Following this, you will be able to follow up on your passport online until it arrives via post.","S.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other top executives sell over $1 billion in company shares: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-and-other-top-executives-sell-over-1-billion-in-company-shares-report/articleshow/122155830.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells shares

Other Nvidia executives cash in

Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year, reports Financial Times. As per the report, over $500 million of those sales took place in June alone, as the chipmaker's stock price climbed to a record high, making Nvidia the world’s most valuable company. The report highlights that Nvidia insiders are capitalizing on the market’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, which has driven massive investor interest and sent the stock price soaring.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began selling his shares last week for the first time since September 2024. The company confirmed that his sales were made under a pre-arranged trading plan set in March, which defines the prices and dates for share sales. Such plans are commonly used by executives to avoid allegations of insider trading.Ben Silverman, vice-president of research at VerityData said “When the stock [dropped] in the first quarter, he did not sell, [which was] really smart.”“[Huang] waited for the stock to return to levels that he felt more comfortable selling at,” he added.According to VerityData, his sales began after a required 90-day cooling-off period ended. Under the trading plan, Huang can sell up to 6 million shares before the end of 2025. At current stock prices, that would amount to more than $900 million. Forbes estimates his net worth at $138 billion.According to the Financial Times report, several other top Nvidia figures have also sold large portions of stock. Mark Stevens, a longtime board member and early Nvidia investor, disclosed plans to sell up to 4 million shares on June 2, currently worth around $550 million. He has already sold $288 million worth.Jay Puri, Nvidia’s executive vice-president of worldwide field operations, sold $25 million in stock last week, says FT. Board members Tench Coxe and Brooke Seawell also made sales — Coxe offloaded around $143 million on June 9, and Seawell sold about $48 million in June.These executives, all long-time members of Nvidia’s leadership team, have been with the company since its early days. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 inside a Denny’s restaurant in San Jose. Coxe and Seawell, both with venture capital backgrounds, joined the board in the late 1990s.AI boom fuels Nvidia’s stock surgeDespite recent setbacks — including U.S. export controls and advances by Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek — Nvidia’s share price has bounced back. Since hitting a low in April, the company has regained about $1.5 trillion in market value.The company’s market value is not estimated at around $3.8 trillion. The rapid growth reflects strong global demand for the company’s chips, used to power AI systems across industries and governments.","Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year.

DOJ seizes laptops and shuts down 'laptop farms' across US

AI tools help workers evade detection in $600 million scheme

Microsoft has suspended approximately 3,000 Outlook and Hotmail accounts linked to North Korean IT workers as part of a coordinated crackdown on a sophisticated global fraud scheme. The tech giant's Threat Intelligence Center identified the operation, dubbed ""Jasper Sleet,"" which has infiltrated hundreds of Fortune 500 companies over recent years.The scheme involves North Korean IT workers using fabricated or stolen identities to secure remote jobs in tech companies worldwide. These workers, trained and dispatched by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), have successfully obtained legitimate employment, with some companies reporting that the remote workers were among their most talented employees.The Department of Justice announced a coordinated takedown alongside Microsoft's account suspensions, seizing hundreds of laptops, 29 financial accounts, and shutting down nearly two dozen websites. Law enforcement searched 29 ""laptop farms"" across the United States, where accomplices—including Americans—agreed to maintain laptops shipped by companies that unknowingly hired North Koreans for remote positions.A notable case involves a Maryland nail salon employee who will be sentenced in August after being found to hold 13 remote jobs handled by North Korean IT workers located in China. These positions paid nearly $1 million combined.The North Korean IT worker conspiracy generates up to $600 million annually, according to UN estimates. The revenue funds Kim Jong Un's nuclear weapons program, making cybersecurity a national security issue.Microsoft reports that the workers are increasingly using AI tools to improve their deception tactics—eliminating grammatical errors, enhancing photos, and experimenting with voice-changing software. The company has developed custom machine-learning solutions using ""impossible time travel risk detections"" to identify suspect accounts logging in from Western nations and China or Russia simultaneously.While Microsoft hasn't observed combined AI voice and video technology yet, the company warns this could allow future threat actors to conduct interviews directly without relying on facilitators.","Microsoft has suspended 3,000 accounts linked to North Korean IT workers involved in a global fraud scheme, ""Jasper Sleet,"" impacting Fortune 500 companies.

When Elon Musk said 'Would not eat omelets for a week'

The U.S. Air Force has halted its proposed collaboration with Elon Musk 's SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from Johnston Atoll, a remote Pacific wildlife refuge, according to Stars and Stripes, an independent U.S. military publication. The decision as reported by Reuters highlights concerns from biologists and experts that the project would endanger numerous seabirds nesting on the unincorporated U.S. territory, located nearly 800 miles (1,300 km) southwest of Hawaii.The Air Force had planned an environmental assessment, but opposition from environmental groups delayed the draft's release. A military spokesperson told Stars and Stripes recently that the Air Force is now seeking alternative locations for the program, which aims to use commercial rockets, like those developed by SpaceX, to deliver up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth in about 90 minutes—a potential game-changer for military logistics in remote areas. Neither the Air Force nor SpaceX immediately responded to requests for comment.Biologists warn that the one-square-mile (2.6 square km) atoll, part of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, supports 14 species of tropical birds that could be severely impacted by the project.SpaceX has faced similar environmental issues before.

Read OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s complete post here

I’m not big on identities, but I am extremely proud to be American. This is true every day, but especially today—I firmly believe this is the greatest country ever on Earth. The American miracle stands alone in world history.

I believe in techno-capitalism. We should encourage people to make tons of money and then also find ways to widely distribute wealth and share the compounding magic of capitalism. One doesn’t work without the other; you cannot raise the floor and not also raise the ceiling for very long.

The world should get richer every year through science and technology, but everyone has to be in the “up elevator”. I think the government usually does a worse job than markets, and so we need to encourage our culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. I also believe that education is critically important to keeping the American edge.

I believed this when I was 20, when I was 30, and now I am 40 and still believe it. The Democratic party seemed reasonably aligned with it when I was 20, losing the plot when I was 30, and completely to have moved somewhere else at this point. So now I am politically homeless. But that’s fine; I care much, much more about being American than any political party.

I’d rather hear from candidates about how they are going to make everyone have the stuff billionaires have instead of how they are going to eliminate billionaires.

The American experiment has always been messy. I am hopeful for another great 250 years. Happy 4th!","Sam Altman is the Chief Executive Officer of OpenAI.

Brenda Romero’s complete statement on Twitter

Romero Games , the studio co-founded by industry legends Brenda and John Romero , has been forced to lay off staff following a sudden decision by their publisher, Microsoft, to cancel an unannounced game. The husband-and-wife duo, known for popular titles like Doom, Quake, and Empire of Sin, confirmed the layoffs but did not disclose the number of employees affected or the specific project that was shelved. The news comes amid Microsoft’s announcement of 9,100 layoffs across its gaming divisions, impacting studios such as Raven Software (Call of Duty), Turn 10 (Forza), Rare’s Everwild team, and King (Candy Crush).The abrupt cancellation and job cuts have sent shockwaves through the gaming community, with fans and industry peers mourning the loss of what many believed was a promising project from the storied studio. Neither Romero Games nor Microsoft has provided further details about the canceled title.Microsoft also canceled Perfect Dark and shuttered its developer, The Initiative. An employee at Romero Games, speaking anonymously to GamesBeat, identified Microsoft as the publisher behind the canceled title. “It’s a very sad day,” the employee shared in a statement. “Romero Games fell victim to the Microsoft layoffs . This was the best team I’ve ever worked with and my dream job, gone just like that. It was a great project, and it’s heartbreaking to see it end. It’s nothing less than tragic.”John Romero took to Twitter to express his sorrow, writing, “These people are the best I’ve ever worked with, and I’m sorry to say that our game and our studio were also affected.” On LinkedIn, he praised the laid-off employees, urging other studios to hire them.“We have some difficult news to share. Last night, we learned that our publisher has canceled funding for our game along with several other unannounced projects at other studios. This was a strategic decision made at a high level within the publisher, well above our visibility or control. We deeply wish there had been something, anything, we could have done to prevent this outcome.This absolutely isn’t a reflection of our team’s work, performance, or the quality of the project itself. We hit every milestone on time, every time, consistently received high praise and easily passed all our internal gates. We are incredibly proud of the work being done, and of the talented team behind it. The best we’ve worked with.We’re currently evaluating next steps and working quickly to support our team. Many of us have worked together for more than a decade, some for over 20 years. It’s an extremely difficult day, and we’re heartbroken that it’s come to this.

Xbox Game Studios Executive Producer Matt Turnbull has recommended that recently laid-off Microsoft employees use AI chatbots to cope with job loss, offering specific prompts to help workers navigate unemployment. Turnbull's since-deleted LinkedIn post suggested using tools like ChatGPT and Copilot to ""help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.""Turnbull’s recommendation comes as Microsoft cuts 9,100 employees across the company, with Xbox divisions particularly affected by studio closures and game cancellations. ""These are really challenging times, and if you're navigating a layoff or even quietly preparing for one, you're not alone and you don't have to go it alone,"" Turnbull wrote in his original post.The exec provided detailed AI prompt suggestions for affected workers, including career planning assistance: ""Act as a career coach. I've been laid off from a [role] in the game industry. Help me build a 30-day plan to regroup, research new roles, and start applying without burning out.""His recommendations extended to emotional support, suggesting workers ask AI: ""I'm struggling with imposter syndrome after being laid off.

Ban on Chinese apps across the world

Taiwan's National Security Bureau (NSB) has warning for users of Chinese apps. In an advisory, NSB said that China-developed apps like RedNote (Xiaohongshu), Weibo, TikTok, WeChat and Baidu Cloud pose security risks due to excessive data collection and data transfer to China. The alert reportedly comes following an inspection of these apps carried out in coordination with the Taiwan's Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) and the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) under the National Police Agency.NSB said that the results indicate the existence of security issues, including excessive data collection and privacy infringement. It further warned, ""The public is advised to exercise caution when choosing mobile apps."" NSB also pointed out that companies operating in China are obligated to turn over user data under domestic laws for national security, public security, and intelligence purposes. So, using these apps can breach the privacy of users.The agency said that it evaluated Chinese apps against 15 indicators spanning five broad categories: Personal data collection, excessive permission usage, data transmission and sharing, system information extraction, and biometric data access.According to the analysis, RedNote violated all 15 indicators, followed by Weibo and TikTok that were found to breach 13 indicators. WeChat and Baidu Cloud violated 10 and 9 of the 15 indicators, respectively.These issues encompassed extensive collection of personal data, including facial recognition information, screenshots, clipboard contents, contact lists, and location information. All the apps have also been flagged for harvesting the list of installed apps and device parameters.""With regard to data transmission and sharing, the said five apps were found to send packets back to servers located in China,"" the NSB said. ""This type of transmission has raised serious concerns over the potential misuse of personal data by third-parties.""Taiwan's warning comes after several nations across the world have banned or restricted certain Chinese apps. In June 2020, India announced ban almost 100 Chinese-made apps, citing national security concerns. In November 2024, Canada ordered TikTok to dissolve its operations in the country.Last week, one of Germany's data protection authorities asked Apple and Google to remove Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot DeepSeek from their respective app stores. The Germany's data protection authourity accused DeepSeek of unlawful user data transfers to China. Several other countries too have announced similar restrictions on DeepSeek.","Taiwan's National Security Bureau (NSB) has warning for users of Chinese apps.

"The 'OBSESSION' that is hurting Amazon, as its stock falls behind Nasdaq",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-obsession-that-is-hurting-amazon-as-its-stock-falls-behind-nasdaq/articleshow/123395198.cms,"Growing competition from Microsoft and Google in Cloud 'hurting'

Amazon stock remains one of the most popular on Wall Street

In a stock market captivated by artificial intelligence, Amazon .com Inc. is struggling to keep up. The e-commerce giant's shares have been significantly trailing the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index this year, according to a recent Bloomberg report. As the report says: In a stock market obsessed with artificial intelligence, Amazon.com is losing ground.The gap widened sharply after Amazon's disappointing earnings report on July 31. While the Nasdaq 100 is up 12% for the year, Amazon's stock has gained just 4.6%, placing it in the bottom half of the index's performers. The company's stock is currently trading at a near-record discount to the index—a stark contrast to the premium it commanded for most of the last two decades.The primary cause for the recent slide was slower-than-expected growth in Amazon's cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). This has fueled investor concern that the company is losing market share to competitors. For many investors, Amazon’s stock hasn't seen the same boost from AI investments as other tech giants like Microsoft and Meta Platforms.""For a lot of investors, Amazon just isn’t a pure-play way to play a theme you believe in,” said Eric Clark, a portfolio manager quoted by Bloomberg. ""People want purity in their investments. And if you want that, Amazon looks like a company that’s watered down by all the different businesses.”While Amazon still generates the majority of its sales from e-commerce, its wide-ranging business portfolio—from AWS to Whole Foods—is now being seen as a weakness rather than a strength. The company's diverse investments, which were long a draw for growth-oriented investors, are now seen as a drag on its stock price in an AI-dominated market.Despite remaining the market leader in cloud computing, AWS's 17% revenue growth in the second quarter was overshadowed by its rivals. For comparison, Microsoft's Azure unit saw a 39% increase in sales, while Google Cloud's sales grew by 32%.Meanwhile, other companies heavily focused on building AI computing capacity are seeing their shares skyrocket. Oracle Corp., which recently partnered with OpenAI to supply massive data center power, has seen its stock price surge by nearly 50% this year. The shares of CoreWeave Inc., an Nvidia-backed cloud computing provider, have more than doubled since its March IPO.“This new cohort of hyperscalers are going to be the companies we’re talking about in five years time,” said Clare Pleydell-Bouverie, co-manager of the Liontrust Global Innovation team. ""We’re not seeing the same AI induced acceleration"" from Amazon, she noted.Despite the recent setbacks, many investors remain confident in Amazon's long-term potential. They believe the company's AI investments will eventually pay off by improving efficiency and customer targeting across its many businesses.The stock remains one of the most-popular on Wall Street, with over 90% of the 82 analysts who cover it rating it a ""buy,"" according to Bloomberg data. This is a higher buy percentage than either Meta or Alphabet Inc. Eric Clark believes Amazon looks ""under-appreciated"" right now, but he's confident that its AI investments, especially within AWS, will eventually boost its bottom line.","Amazon's shares have been significantly trailing the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index this year.

The MSL group will now have four main components:

In a significant restructuring of its burgeoning artificial intelligence arm, Meta Platforms is splitting its newly formed AI group, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), into four distinct teams. The move, according to a report by The New York Times, comes amid internal tensions and a high-stakes race to develop so-called “Superintelligence.” The reorganization is a direct effort to better capitalize on the billions of dollars spent poaching top AI talent, with many researchers receiving compensation packages reaching into the hundreds of millions. According to an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg News, the new structure is designed to ""accelerate"" the company's pursuit of AI that can perform tasks better than humans.""Superintelligence is coming, and in order to take it seriously, we need to organize around the key areas that will be critical to reach it — research, product and infra,"" wrote Alexandr Wang, Meta’s new chief AI officer, in the memo. Wang, the former CEO of Scale AI, recently joined the company to lead this ambitious push.The New York Times reported that the shake-up is aimed at streamlining operations and accelerating the development of AI products to better compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google. The changes follow a series of leadership shake-ups in Meta's AI division over the past few years.* MSL Product* MSL Research* MSL Infra* MSL OpsThe AGI foundations group, one of Meta's three primary AI teams prior to this reorganization, is being dissolved. According to the internal memo, its leaders, Ahmad Al-Dahle and Amir Frenkel, will now focus on “strategic MSL initiatives.”While a person familiar with the matter told The New York Times that no layoffs were part of this specific reorganization, the report notes that the company is considering downsizing the AI division overall, which has grown to thousands of people in recent years. Additionally, some executives are expected to depart, and Meta is exploring the use of third-party AI models rather than relying solely on its own technology.Leadership roles within the new structure have also been assigned. Aparna Ramani will lead the MSL Infra team, and Robert Fergus, who co-founded the long-standing FAIR research lab in 2014, will continue to lead that group.

Nvidia is reportedly developing a new AI chip for the Chinese market based on its latest Blackwell architecture . According to a report by the news agency Reuters, this chip would be more powerful than the current H20 model that the company is permitted to sell in China. The development follows recent comments from US President Donald Trump that suggested the possibility of allowing more advanced Nvidia chips to be sold to China. However, sources familiar with the matter said to Reuters that regulatory approval is not guaranteed due to ongoing concerns in Washington about providing China with access to advanced AI technology.The Reuters report cited sources to claim that Nvidia’s upcoming chip, tentatively named the B30A, will feature a single-die design. These chips are expected to offer roughly half the computing performance of the company’s flagship B300 accelerator, which uses a dual-die setup. In a single-die design, all major circuit components are built on a single silicon piece, rather than spread across multiple dies.The B30A will come equipped with high-bandwidth memory and NVLink technology for fast inter-processor communication which is similar to what’s available in the H20 chip , based on Nvidia’s older Hopper architecture, the Reuters report noted.While the final specifications are still being worked out, Nvidia aims to provide test samples to Chinese customers as early as next month, the sources said to Reuters, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly.In a statement to Reuters, Nvidia said:Nvidia’s access to the Chinese market remains a key point in US-China trade tensions , as China accounted for 13% of its revenue last year. The company was only recently allowed to resume sales of the H20 chip, developed for China after 2023 export restrictions, but sales were halted again in April.Trump has suggested Nvidia may be allowed to sell scaled-down next-gen chips in China, though lawmakers worry even reduced versions could weaken US dominance in AI.Nvidia has argued that keeping Chinese developers tied to its hardware and software ecosystem is crucial, especially as Huawei’s chips are becoming competitive in computing power, though still weaker in areas like memory bandwidth and software support. However, Nvidia faces additional hurdles as Chinese authorities warn local firms about buying its chips, citing alleged security risks.To maintain its presence, Nvidia is preparing a China-specific Blackwell-based chip, the RTX6000D, designed mainly for AI inference . With lower specs, conventional GDDR memory, and bandwidth deliberately kept below US restriction thresholds, it is priced below the H20. Small batches are expected to ship to Chinese clients in September, the report adds.",N Nvidia is reportedly developing a new AI chip for the Chinese market based on its latest Blackwell architecture.

In a major development for the chipmaker, the Trump administration is in discussions to acquire a significant stake in Intel , potentially making the US government its largest shareholder, a report has said. This plan is being considered just as Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank Group has announced a $2 billion investment in the company.According to a report by Bloomberg, the Trump administration’s plan involves a specific approach: converting a portion of the grants made to Intel under the US CHIPS and Science Act into equity. The report says that this could result in a stake of approximately 10% for the US government, an investment estimated to be worth around $10.5 billion at Intel’s current market value.Reportedly, the grant money, which was originally intended to be disbursed over time as Intel meets project milestones, is roughly sufficient to fund this targeted holding. It is to be noted that the company is already slated to receive a combined $10.9 billion in grants for both commercial and military production, in addition to being able to draw on up to $11 billion in loans.While the plan is still under consideration and not yet finalized, it reflects the administration’s strategic interest in revitalizing American semiconductor manufacturing.SoftBank, meanwhile, has announced a $2 billion investment in Intel’s common stock, priced at $23 per share, making it the fifth-biggest shareholder. The report says that SoftBank sees significant value in Intel’s chip design operations, which hold the promise of high margins, and views the investment as a strong vote of confidence.“Masa and I have worked closely together for decades, and I appreciate the confidence he has placed in Intel with this investment,” said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan in a statement, referring to SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son.This comes at a crucial time for Intel, which has struggled to fully capitalise on the artificial intelligence boom and has invested heavily in its manufacturing business without securing a major customer.","The Trump administration is in discussions to acquire a significant stake in Intel.

Workday, a major provider of human resources technology, has confirmed a data breach that resulted in the theft of personal information from one of its third-party databases. In a blog post, the company announced that hackers stole an unspecified amount of data, primarily consisting of contact information such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. The breach was part of a ""social engineering campaign"" that targeted several large organisations. Workday explained that in this campaign, threat actors contacted employees via text or phone, posing as HR or IT staff, to trick them into giving up account access or personal information.In its blog post, Workday wrote:However, the company did not explicitly rule out the possibility that customer information was compromised, as corporate clients typically store most of their HR records and employees’ personal information with Workday.Workday, which serves more than 11,000 corporate clients and at least 70 million users globally, reportedly detected it earlier this month. The company also did not clarify whether it has the technical capabilities, such as access logs, to confirm if any customer data was stolen.While the company did not disclose the name of the third-party customer database platform involved, the incident comes amid a wave of cyberattacks targeting Salesforce-hosted databases used by major corporations. In recent weeks, Google, Cisco, Qantas, and Pandora have all suffered data theft from their Salesforce systems.Google attributed these breaches to ShinyHunters, a hacking group known for using voice phishing to trick employees into granting access to cloud databases.The company added that ShinyHunters was likely preparing a data leak site to pressure victims into paying for data deletion, a tactic similar to ransomware operations.","Workday confirms a data breach that resulted in the theft of personal information from one of its third-party databases.

Bezos-Sánchez wedding draws criticism over DiCaprio’s jet travel

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances.

Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved from a futuristic concept to an everyday necessity, influencing industries ranging from healthcare and finance to entertainment and communication. It automates routine tasks, enhances productivity, and fuels innovations like ChatGPT, AI-driven translation services, and virtual gaming experiences.The growth of AI has also created a new class of billionaires, some of whom have built companies from scratch, while others have pivoted established businesses toward AI-driven opportunities. Backed by massive investments from Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and other global players, these individuals represent the cutting edge of technology and entrepreneurship. From Jensen Huang’s hardware empire to Alexandr Wang’s data infrastructure solutions, and from Sam Altman’s AI innovation to Yao Runhao’s virtual gaming platforms, these billionaires illustrate how AI is reshaping industries and redefining entrepreneurship.Source: ForbesJensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, sits at the top of the AI billionaire list with an astonishing $113 billion (£151 billion) net worth. Nvidia initially focused on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional visualization. However, as AI adoption accelerated, these GPUs became the standard for training and running large language models like ChatGPT and Meta AI.Huang’s strategic vision transformed Nvidia into the backbone of the AI industry. In July 2025, the company reached an unprecedented $4 trillion valuation, reflecting how central its hardware is to AI infrastructure. Owning 3% of Nvidia, Huang’s wealth grew by over 300% in just one year, making him one of the top 20 richest individuals worldwide.At just 26 years old, Alexandr Wang has secured his place as the youngest self-made billionaire in the AI sector. He founded Scale AI at the age of 19, after dropping out of MIT, to focus on providing data labeling and annotation services essential for AI training.Scale AI works with over 300 high-profile clients, including Meta, Google, and General Motors, supplying the data infrastructure required to build machine learning models. The company’s valuation reached $14 billion (£10.5 billion) in 2024, and Wang’s 14% ownership stake boosted his net worth to $2.7 billion (£3.6 billion). His success highlights how even niche AI services can yield massive fortunes.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is one of the most prominent faces in artificial intelligence. While OpenAI itself is valued at around $300 billion (£225 billion), Altman does not personally hold equity in the company. His wealth, estimated at $1.9 billion (£1.4 billion), stems from early investments in companies like Stripe, Reddit, and Helion Energy, combined with the success of his previous startup, Loopt, which he sold for $42 million in 2012.Altman’s leadership at OpenAI popularized generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, setting global trends in how businesses and consumers interact with AI. His influence extends beyond wealth, positioning him as one of the key thought leaders shaping AI’s future.Phil Shawe, co-CEO of TransPerfect, built one of the world’s largest translation and localization companies by leveraging AI-powered language processing. TransPerfect offers services across industries like law, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, helping businesses operate in multiple languages with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.Founded in 1992 from a dorm room at New York University, TransPerfect generated $1.3 billion (£976 million) in revenue in 2024. Shawe owns 99% of the company, securing a personal fortune of $1.8 billion (£1.3 billion). His journey shows how AI technology can transform even traditional industries like language services into billion-dollar enterprises.Dario Amodei, a former vice president of research at OpenAI, left to co-found Anthropic in 2021. His company focuses on building safe, reliable AI systems using reinforcement learning techniques that allow AI models to adapt through human feedback.Anthropic’s approach to ethical AI and safety-first principles resonated with investors and industry leaders, pushing the company’s valuation to $61.5 billion (£46.2 billion) by 2025. Amodei’s net worth has reached $1.2 billion (£901 million), proving that prioritizing responsibility in AI development can be both impactful and profitable.Liang Wenfeng, once largely unknown outside China, made headlines with DeepSeek-R1, a large language model that outperformed ChatGPT on certain benchmarks while being five times cheaper to run. This innovation shook global markets, causing Nvidia’s stock to drop 17% in a single day as investors reacted to the potential shift in AI computing costs.Wenfeng previously founded a successful hedge fund, and he used his financial expertise to build DeepSeek into one of the most cost-efficient AI providers globally. His net worth now stands at $1 billion (£751 million), making him a key figure in China’s growing AI industry.Yao Runhao, CEO of Paper Games, has carved out a unique niche by combining AI with gaming. His company’s hit product, Love and Deepspace, uses artificial intelligence to create virtual dating simulations with interactive, personalized storylines.The game attracts over six million monthly users, showcasing the demand for AI-driven entertainment. Paper Games employs around 2,000 staff and focuses primarily on the female gaming market in China, highlighting how AI is revolutionizing interactive leisure experiences. Runhao’s innovation has earned him a net worth of $1.3 billion (£977 million).","World’s wealthiest AI moguls ranked by net worth.

Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India, marking another step in its long-term strategy to strengthen its footprint in emerging markets. During Apple’s latest earnings announcement, CEO Tim Cook confirmed plans to open multiple new Apple Stores in India before the year ends. The move comes as part of a broader global expansion plan that also includes fresh Apple retail outlets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the launch of the Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia. Cook highlighted that these new physical stores are a key step in improving Apple’s customer experience, product accessibility, and service reach in high-growth regions like India.“We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn’t be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year,” Cook stated. “We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka.”According to Apple Magazine, four new stores are scheduled to open across key metropolitan cities in India, namely Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, and the Delhi NCR region. These new outlets will build on Apple’s successful retail debut in India in 2023, which saw the launch of Apple BKC in Mumbai and Apple Saket in Delhi. These initial stores have quickly become major crowd-pullers, especially during new iPhone release events, and have demonstrated the value of physical retail locations in India’s fast-growing premium smartphone market.To support this retail growth, Apple has been actively hiring talent for its upcoming stores. Earlier this year, Apple Store leader John Taffe shared on LinkedIn that Apple was looking for passionate and skilled individuals to join its retail team. “Apple’s journey in India has been incredible, and we’re thrilled to continue growing in these vibrant cities. To make these new stores a success, we’re looking for passionate and talented individuals to join our team,” Taffe noted. This hiring drive highlights Apple’s commitment to not only selling products but also delivering personalised customer experiences and creating jobs within the Indian retail sector.While India remains a critical market, Apple is expanding its retail network globally. Apart from its Indian plans, the company has announced new retail locations in the UAE, including a store in Al Ain, which will add to its existing four UAE outlets (two in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai). The Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia further emphasizes Apple’s growing focus on the Middle East.These international retail initiatives aim to strengthen Apple’s customer reach and brand experience beyond its digital ecosystem. Apple’s global retail growth is supported by its strong financial results. In its April–June quarter (Q3), Apple reported a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, showcasing robust demand even in challenging economic conditions. This financial strength gives Apple the confidence to invest heavily in physical stores in markets like India, where premium smartphone adoption is rapidly increasing.India has emerged as one of Apple’s most important growth markets, driven by rising disposable incomes, expanding smartphone penetration, and a growing preference for premium devices. The launch of Apple BKC and Apple Saket in 2023 marked the company’s first direct retail presence in the country, and the overwhelming customer response has paved the way for more stores. Apple’s upcoming four new stores signal a long-term commitment to India, where it faces strong competition from brands like Samsung and OnePlus. However, Apple’s focus on a seamless retail experience and exclusive customer service could help it capture a larger market share in the premium category.",Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered. This statement from Hassabis offers one of the clearest examples of how AI will alter specific professions, but not eliminate the need for human empathy and interpersonal care.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments, emphasizing lifelong learning, adaptive skills, ethical AI usage, and the development of new interdisciplinary roles bridging technology, creativity, and human-centric decision-making.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce.

Elon Musk’s longstanding concern



A global warning by Elon Musk



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again started a global debate over the declining population. Recently, Elon Musk warned people Japan will lose nearly 1 million people by the end of 2025. Now once again the tech billionaire has shared another warning on the collapsing population. Resharing a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk has once again raised the alarm about population collapse saying ‘since the turn of the century, and emphasised that artificial intelligence may be the only viable tool to help reverse the trend.The SpaceX CEO Elon Musk recently shared a post on X about population collapse. An X user called Tim Pool shared a post on X which reads, “The population isnt ""collapsing"" It has collapsed. The shoreline is receding and no one understands the tsunami about to hit us. As US population goes it will be impossible to redevelop. Automation won't replace your customers.”Elon Musk reshared this post along with a caption which reads, “I’ve been warning about this since the turn of the century.”Elon Musk has repeatedly warned about population collapse— not overpopulation—is the real existential threat to civilization. Musk earlier argued that declining birth rates could lead to economic stagnation, labour shortages, and even civilizational decline if not addressed. “Most people still think the world is overpopulated,” Musk said in earlier interviews. “It’s actually the opposite.”Japan has been the focal point for population collapse, but Musk’s warning also applies to other nations such as South Korea, Italy and parts of Eastern Europe as they are also facing similar trends. This issue of population collapse has also sparked the interests of pro-natalist policies, immigration reform, and even the role of AI and robotics in offsetting labor gaps.Recently, Elon Musk issued a stark warning about Japan. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the tech billionaire wrote: “Japan will lose almost a million people this year.” In the post, Musk said that this demographic was set in motion half a century ago adding that the population decline in the country “has nothing to do with AI.” “AI is the only hope for turning this around,” the tech CEO further stated.Elon Musk was responding to an X post that said: “Japan's population falling with 900,000 more deaths than births in 2024”.","The SpaceX CEO Elon Musk recently shared a post on X about population collapse.

Why startups are betting on Nuclear energy

Alphabet’s Google and nuclear startup Kairos Power announced a landmark partnership on Monday to deploy an advanced nuclear plant in Tennessee, with the goal of connecting to the Tennessee Valley Authority 's (TVA) electric grid by 2030. The project marks a significant step toward a new era of nuclear power in the United States, which has seen a halt in new construction for decades. The last two reactors built in the U.S. at Plant Vogtle in Georgia cost $18 billion more than expected and started operations seven years behind schedule in 2023 and 2024. The project’s problems are reported to have played a role in the bankruptcy of industry giant Westinghouse.Under the agreement, TVA has committed to purchasing up to 50 megawatts of power from Kairos Power's Hermes 2 reactor. According to a report by CNBC, this is the first time that a U.S. utility has signed a power purchase agreement with an advanced nuclear reactor, according to the companies. The electricity generated, enough to power approximately 36,000 homes, will be used to support Google's energy-intensive data centers in Montgomery County, Tennessee, and Jackson County, Alabama.The partnership aims to tackle a major obstacle that has plagued the U.S. nuclear industry: the immense cost and financial risk associated with building new plants. In this collaboration, Kairos and Google will bear the financial burden of constructing the first-of-its-kind project, while TVA provides a stable revenue stream through its power purchase agreement.The U.S. has not seen significant nuclear construction for decades due to massive budget overruns and delays, such as the Plant Vogtle project in Georgia, which went $18 billion over budget and started operations seven years late.Startups like Kairos Power are betting that their smaller, more affordable advanced reactors can avoid the issues that plagued large-scale projects like Vogtle.

Intel's turnaround efforts gain political and financial support

Intel has received a lifeline with SoftBank Group ’s $2 billion investment, paying $23 per share for new common stock. The deal comes as the Trump administration reportedly weighs taking a 10% stake in Intel worth approximately $10.4 billion, potentially making the US government the company's largest shareholder.Intel's stock surged more than 5% in after-hours trading following the SoftBank announcement, while SoftBank shares fell 5% in Tokyo trading.

Beyond Megapixels: Why the future of cameras lies in experiences -- a 'World Photography Day' reflection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/beyond-megapixels-why-the-future-of-cameras-lies-in-experiences-a-world-photography-day-reflection/articleshow/123381117.cms,"From Resolution to Relevance

Crafting Experiences

A Cultural Shift in India

Arun Babu, Associate Director and Head of Digital Camera, Instax and Optical Devices Division,

FUJIFILM India

For decades, camera innovation has been measured in megapixels. Higher resolution was synonymous with better quality, and the race to pack more pixels into every sensor drove much of the industry’s narrative. But this World Photography Day , as we celebrate the art of capturing moments, it is clear that we are at an inflection point. Beyond a certain threshold, more megapixels no longer guarantee more compelling stories or stronger emotional resonance. The future of imaging lies not only in technical specifications, but in the experiences cameras create, how they help people capture, share, and relive memories in ways that feel immersive and meaningful.There is a shift in consumer behaviour. The conversation is moving beyond technical superiority to creative possibility. People are no longer chasing resolution alone; they are seeking tools that help them express themselves and create engaging narratives. Features like computational photography, instant printing, and seamless cloud integration are becoming just as important as sensor size. In India, this shift is amplified by the rise of the creator economy where content is valued for its relatability and aesthetic rather than sheer technical perfection.The camera of the future will craft an experience. We are already seeing early signals in products that blend digital and physical touchpoints. AR-enhanced lenses, AI-powered composition tools, and seamless app integration are adding layers of creativity to photography that go far beyond raw image resolution. It’s about making the process intuitive and immersive while keeping the emotional connection at the center.Another key factor driving this transition is how we consume memories. The explosion of short-form video platforms and the surge in real-time content sharing have created demand for cameras that can adapt to dynamic storytelling formats. At the same time, there is a counter-trend: a renewed appreciation for physical, tangible memories as a reaction to digital fatigue. Gen Z and millennials today value printed photographs as ‘more meaningful’ keepsakes compared to digital-only images. Cameras that can bridge these worlds - capturing, creating, and curating experiences are leading this new wave of innovation.In India, where cultural moments are deeply tied to emotions and community, this evolution carries even more weight. Weddings, festivals, and family milestones are about shared experiences. The next generation of cameras must recognize this cultural context and offer features that enable people to capture stories holistically through interactive content, personalized prints, or immersive visual formats.Ultimately, the question is no longer “How many pixels?” but “How does it make you feel?” The future of camera innovation will be defined by how seamlessly technology disappears into the background to let emotion and storytelling take center stage. As an industry, our focus must shift from specs to sentiments, from resolution to relevance. That is where the next big leap lies - in creating cameras that do not just record images, but enrich the experiences that make those images truly unforgettable.","The camera of the future will craft an experience.

Swatch issues apology in China after 'Slanted eye' ad that experts call 'Quite a Fundamental Mistake',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/swatch-issues-apology-in-china-after-slanted-eye-ad-that-experts-call-quite-a-fundamental-mistake/articleshow/123372675.cms,"What Swatch said in its apology

Ad controversy adds to Swatch's China troubles

Swiss watchmaker Swatch has reportedly issued a formal apology and swiftly removed advertisements for its Swatch Essentials collection after the campaign was widely condemned in China for featuring a male model making a ""slanted eye"" pose. The gesture, which involves pulling the corners of the eyes up and backwards, is seen by many as a racist taunt targeting people of Asian descent. According to a report by Reuters, the images, which sparked significant outrage online, led to a drop in the company's shares. On Monday, August 18, Swatch's stock fell as much as 4% before recovering slightly to a 3.1% loss.""It is very significant for a brand of that scale to misfire in this way,"" said Mark Borkowski, a London-based public relations consultant, as reported by Reuters. ""This carelessness is really quite a fundamental mistake."" The incident has raised questions about the brand's approval process, considering that Swatch is a well-known brand in the Chinese market.In an apology posted in both Chinese and English on its Weibo and Instagram accounts, Swatch stated it had ""taken note of the recent concerns"" and had ""removed all related materials worldwide."" The company added, ""We sincerely apologize for any distress or misunderstanding this may have caused.While the backlash on social media was intense, Chinese fashion influencer Peter Xu, who has over seven million followers on Weibo, believes the quick apology will likely mitigate long-term damage to the brand. ""It was pretty stupid to release images like those ones,"" he commented, but suggested the fallout would likely be short-lived.This controversy is the latest challenge for Swatch, which also owns popular brands like Omega, Longines, and Tissot. The company's shares have plummeted by more than half since early 2023, and it is also facing a 39% tariff on its exports to the United States.China, along with Hong Kong and Macau, accounted for approximately 27% of Swatch's group sales last year. The company's overall revenue in 2024 fell 14.6% to 6.74 billion Swiss francs ($8.4 billion), a decline the company attributed to ""difficult market conditions and weak demand for consumer goods overall"" in China.","Swatch has reportedly issued a formal apology and swiftly removed advertisements for its Swatch Essentials collection.

What the California Coastal Commission said about rejecting the proposal



Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Regulators of California have recently rejected a US military proposal to increase SpaceX rocket launches from a Southern California base. The latest rejection marked the second time the US state has opposed such a plan. The California Coastal Commission , which oversees the state's coastline, voted unanimously to deny the US Space Force ’s application to double launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base from 50 to 100 per year. The commission stated that military officials failed to provide sufficient data on the potential environmental impact on local wildlife and nearby towns. This decision comes amid an ongoing lawsuit from SpaceX CEO Elon Musk over a similar previous vote.Caryl Hart, the vice chairman of the commission, said while rejecting the appeal to increase the rocket company’s launches.Last year, the commission voted 6–4 against increasing Space Force launches from 36 to 50, arguing that SpaceX should seek a commercial permit for the same. At that time, some commission members also criticised the world’s richest person for his political stance. Musk responded to this with a lawsuit.However, at the latest hearing, the commission members did not mention Musk directly. Instead, they pointed to insufficient data and raised concerns that the Space Force was shielding SpaceX from applying for commercial permits.Commissioner Raymond Jackson noted.The latest vote followed the recommendation of members of the California Coastal Commission who asked it to reject the proposal. The members cited the military’s failure to share data on how sonic booms could affect wildlife and nearby communities.The commission also challenged Space Force’s claim that all launches count as federal activity exempt from state permits, noting that most missions are commercial and don’t involve military payloads.",The California Coastal Commission voted unanimously to deny the US Space Force ’s application to double launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base from 50 to 100 per year.

AI transforms workflow without eliminating jobs, exec says



Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn acknowledged he failed to provide adequate context when announcing the language-learning company's pivot to become ""AI-first"" earlier this year, sparking widespread user backlash and subscription cancellation threats. In a recent interview with The New York Times, von Ahn took responsibility for the confusion, saying the memo was misinterpreted as a cost-cutting measure rather than a strategic enhancement.Von Ahn emphasised that Duolingo has ""never laid off any full-time employees"" and doesn't plan to, despite implementing AI across operations. The $15 billion company, which serves 130 million monthly users, uses contractors for temporary tasks whose numbers fluctuate based on operational needs rather than AI replacement strategies.The controversial April memo outlined ""constructive constraints"" including reducing contractors for AI-manageable work and requiring teams to prove AI couldn't handle tasks before new hires. This triggered fierce criticism from users who threatened to cancel subscriptions, with comments like ""AI first means people last"" flooding social media.Von Ahn explained that AI enables productivity gains rather than workforce reduction. ""What will probably happen is that one person will be able to accomplish more, rather than having fewer people,"" he told The New York Times. The company has implemented ""f-r-A-I-days"" - weekly Friday morning sessions where teams experiment with AI efficiency improvements.The CEO defended Duolingo's transparency about AI integration, noting that while other tech companies pursue similar strategies, ""we were open about it."" He attributed the backlash to public misconceptions about corporate AI adoption being primarily profit-driven rather than innovation-focused.Founded in 2011, Duolingo has embraced AI since launch but accelerated integration following recent large language model breakthroughs. The platform now offers AI-powered conversation practice, addressing user reluctance to practice with humans. Despite the controversy, the company reported over 20% user growth year-over-year, suggesting the outcry hasn't significantly impacted business performance.","Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn says company has ""never laid off any full-time employees"" The language-learning company's pivot to become ""AI-first"" sparked widespread user backlash and subscription cancellation threats.

What are special purpose vehicles investment fund

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Claude-maker Anthropic has told investors that the AI company does not want money coming through special purpose vehicles (SPVs) in its latest fundraising. Citing two people familiar with the matter, a Business Insider report said that one of Anthropic’s largest backers, Menlo Ventures, was specifically told it must invest using its own capital and not through an SPV, as it did in a past round. The company, as per the report, is raising about $5 billion at a valuation of $170 billion.A special purpose vehicle, or SPV, is a legal entity that is created for a specific financial purpose, usually to make a single investment. In the world of venture capital and private markets, investors often pool their money into an SPV, and that entity then invests in a company on their behalf.This structure makes it easier for smaller investors to gain access to deals that are normally reserved for large funds.But companies generally prefer direct investor relationships. Recently, investors have complained that some SPVs targeting AI startups are charging unusually high fees.The BI report quotes Michelle Lim, a founder and angel investor, who posted on X “Many friends including myself have been offered allocation into OpenAI or Anthropic SPVs this week. Minimum check sizes are $100k-$1M, with fees as high as 16%. From what I understand, folks are creating SPVs on top of SPVs and making management fees on top of them. It's like a pyramid.”Venture capitalist Sarah Guo wrote on X: “The feeding frenzy for ownership in the AI labs has spawned a set of bottom feeding multi layered SPV brokers that have no relationship with the company, and straight up grifters,"" ""Careful of that nonsense.”","A special purpose vehicle, or SPV, is a legal entity that is created for a specific financial purpose.

"Meta's first smart glasses with screen could come next month, and they might be more affordable than we thought",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/metas-first-smart-glasses-with-screen-could-come-next-month-and-they-might-be-more-affordable-than-we-thought/articleshow/123365231.cms,"Think of Hypernova as Meta Ray-Bans but with a screen and gesture controls built in

Meta 's upcoming display-equipped smart glasses, codenamed HyperNova , will hit the market at around $800 this fall, significantly affordable than the $1,000-plus price tag initially expected, according to Bloomberg.The glasses, set to debut next month, will be Meta's first smart eyewear with an actual screen. They'll feature a small display in the right lens for mini apps and notifications, plus gesture controls through a neural wristband accessory similar to what Meta developed for its Orion AR prototypes.Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that Meta managed to slash costs by accepting lower profit margins, a typical move for companies trying to drive adoption of new tech. The $800 starting price still puts HyperNova well above Meta's current $200-400 Ray-Ban smart glasses, same as an iPhone , but it's much more palatable than the $1,400 some expected.Of course, that $800 is just the entry point. Different styles and prescription lenses will bump up the price, so don't expect everyone to walk away spending less than a grand.Renders from tipster Arsène Lupin show the glasses look surprisingly similar to existing Ray-Bans, though they pack considerably more tech inside. The monocular display sits in the lower-right corner of the right lens, showing a home screen with circular app icons arranged horizontally like a dock. Users will be able to launch dedicated apps for snapping photos, browsing their camera roll, pulling up maps for navigation, and catching notifications from messaging apps like WhatsApp and Messenger.The neural wristband controller , reportedly called Ceres, reads hand gestures so you can rotate your hand to scroll through apps and pinch your fingers to select items. No tiny buttons or voice commands needed, just subtle hand movements that won't draw stares in public.Meta's clearly betting big on making AR accessible to regular consumers, not just enthusiasts willing to drop iPhone money on experimental eyewear.","HyperNova smart glasses will be Meta's first smart eyewear with an actual screen.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

E-commerce major Amazon has announced to shut down its Amazon Appstore on Android on August 20, 2025, ending its 14-year run. The closure, as revealed by the company, will not affect Fire TVs and Fire Tablets, where the Appstore will continue to operate. The announcement to shut down Amazon Appstore was made in February. In a statement to Android Police, the company then said “We’ve decided to discontinue the Amazon Appstore on Android to focus our efforts on the Appstore experience on our own devices, as that’s where the overwhelming majority of our customers currently engage with it”.To recall, Amazon Appstore was launched in 2011 as a rival to Google Play. However, it never gained major traction, despite early promotions such as a free daily app and the Coins reward system. According to the industry data, its global share had fallen below 1% by 2022. Reports suggest that Amazon is now focusing on its Fire ecosystem, where it has greater control and can drive revenue through Prime subscriptions, Alexa services, and ads.Users who still hold Amazon Coins, the company’s discontinued digital currency, will get automatic refunds after the cutoff date. However, refunds will only go through if payment details are up to date. Amazon has advised users to update their Amazon Wallet to avoid failed transactions.What users need to do:For most Android users, the shutdown will have little impact since the Appstore had become largely inactive. But the move highlights the risks of digital marketplaces — once a platform shuts down, apps and purchases can vanish with it.","Amazon has announced to shut down its Amazon Appstore on Android on August 20, 2025, ending its 14-year run.

Kodak says it's handling its finances just fine and won't be closing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/kodak-says-its-handling-its-finances-just-fine-and-wont-be-closing/articleshow/123362598.cms,"A classic case of financial engineering meets corporate survival

Don't write Kodak 's obituary just yet. The 133-year-old photography giant is pushing back hard against speculation that it might be shutting down, insisting it has a solid financial plan to tackle its debt problems and stay in business.The company stirred up a media frenzy last week when it warned investors in a regulatory filing that it might not have enough cash to pay off roughly $500 million in debt obligations coming due. That ""going concern"" language sent shares tumbling more than 20% and had outlets reporting Kodak's potential demise.But Kodak's executives say everyone's missing the bigger picture. The company plans to tap into its pension fund, which is expected to deliver about $500 million in assets by December 2025 when the pension plan winds down. About $300 million of that will be straight cash.""Kodak is confident it will be able to pay off a significant portion of its term loan well before it becomes due,"" said Denisse Goldbarg , the company's chief marketing officer. She added that once the pension transaction closes, Kodak will be ""virtually net debt free"" with its strongest balance sheet in years.The plan sounds straightforward enough: use $300 million from the pension fund to knock out most of the $477 million term debt, then “amend, extend, or refinance” the remaining $177 million plus another $100 million in preferred stock.Of course, there's a catch. The pension fund payout isn't entirely under Kodak's control, which is why accounting rules required the ""going concern"" warning in the first place. Until that money actually hits their bank account, there's still some uncertainty.This isn't Kodak's first financial rodeo. The company that once dominated photography, controlling 90% of film and 85% of camera sales in the US during its 1970s heyday, filed for bankruptcy in 2012 as digital cameras killed the film business. Ironically, Kodak had actually invented the first digital camera back in 1975 but failed to capitalize on the technology that would eventually destroy its core business.Since emerging from bankruptcy, Kodak has reinvented itself as an industrial manufacturer focused on commercial printing and advanced materials. The company still produces films and chemicals for businesses including the movie industry, and licenses its iconic brand to a wide range of consumer products.Today's Kodak bears little resemblance to the company that once made ""Kodak moments"" part of photography culture. But for now, its message is clear: reports of its death have been greatly exaggerated.","Kodak says it has a solid financial plan to tackle its debt problems and stay in business.

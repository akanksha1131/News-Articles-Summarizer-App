""We are probably the world's most active users of Slack internally at OpenAI and I think they're going to be really enduring and important systems for a while.”

“We use kind of all the canonical SaaS systems you can think of. These are really important systems for OpenAI, and I think they're going to be really enduring and important systems for a while,”

How AI will improve among Slack and other traditional tools



“live in the cracks”

“But one of the things that we're able to do is actually use AI systems to basically help live in the cracks between, kind of what the user needs to be able to do with those systems, and kind of what those systems represent in terms of a workflow. So if you're a salesperson, for example, and you're trying to prepare for a meeting, right, there are a lot of factors that aggregate into how you think about preparation for that client and that customer.

Historically, you've had to go collect all those yourself. You've had to synthesise all the takeaways. You've had to kind of run the analysis, pull the data to write the profile, and hand that off to the other person who needs the context. All that now can be condensed, and so we built a lot of tooling around that for us to be able to actually make our sales teams much more productive and much more efficient and so and we hold everyone to that bar.

So the way we kind of look at this is there's a team whose job it is to think about how to actually drive output, drive impact in our organisation, so that when we have a salesperson join the team, or a marketer or a software engineer or whoever it is, they really are starting at a higher baseline level of productivity, and they can start to think more along the lines of, ‘hey, you know, instead of managing five or 10 accounts, maybe you can manage 20 accounts, Right? And that's just incredible leverage in our business.”

Singapore authorities are reportedly investigating AI computing firm Megaspeed. According to a report by CNBC, the company – a customer of chipmaker Nvidia allegedly helped Chinese companies, bypassing restrictions on US chip exports. The report quotes an email from the police saying “The Singapore Police Force confirms that investigations are ongoing into Megaspeed for suspected breaches of our domestic laws”.Megaspeed was spun off from a Chinese gaming company in 2023. The company has purchased nearly $2 billion worth of Nvidia’s most advanced products through its subsidiary in Malaysia.The probe follows a New York Times report which said that the US Commerce Department is also investigating whether Megaspeed skirted American export controls. The NYT report cited anonymous officials and other people familiar with the matter.These parallel investigations, CNBC says, could increase scrutiny of Nvidia’s ability to track where its advanced chips end up and whether the company is fully complying with US rules on sales to China.Nvidia says it has engaged with the US government on the matter and performed its own inquiry, without identifying “any reason to believe products have been diverted.”“NVIDIA visited multiple Megaspeed sites yet again earlier this week and confirmed what we previously observed—Megaspeed is running a small commercial cloud, like many other companies throughout the world, as allowed by U.S. export control rules,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement shared with CNBC.","Singapore authorities are reportedly investigating AI computing firm Megaspeed.

Home Minister switches to ‘swadeshi’ email address

Government push fuels Zoho's growing adoption across India







Zoho co-founder Sridhar Vembu expressed heartfelt gratitude to Union Home Minister Amit Shah after the latter announced his switch to Zoho Mail, India's homegrown email platform. In an emotional response on X, Vembu dedicated the moment to engineers who chose to work from India despite opportunities abroad.""Thank you Sir, for your faith in us. I dedicate this moment to our hard-working engineers who have toiled hard in Zoho for over 20 years. They all stayed in India and worked all these years because they believed. Their faith is vindicated. Jai Hind, Jai Bharat,"" Vembu wrote.Shah's announcement came as a significant endorsement for the Chennai-based tech company. Sharing his new email address—amitshah.bjp@zohomail.in—on social media, the Home Minister requested all future correspondence be directed to his Zoho account, marking a symbolic shift away from global platforms like Gmail and Outlook.The move aligns with the government's broader push for digital sovereignty. IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw recently transitioned to Zoho's office suite, while the Ministry of Education has directed officials to adopt the company's productivity tools under the ""Strengthening Digital Sovereignty under Swadeshi Movement"" initiative.Zoho Mail, launched in 2008, offers secure, ad-free email hosting with encrypted transmission and two-factor authentication.Its servers are primarily hosted in India and the United States, appealing to organisations prioritising data protection and privacy.The government backing has yielded dramatic results beyond email. Zoho's messaging app Arattai witnessed explosive growth, with daily sign-ups surging from 3,000 to 350,000 in three days—a 100-fold increase following ministerial endorsements.For Vembu, Shah's adoption represents vindication of Zoho's two-decade commitment to building world-class technology from India. Founded in 1996, the company has maintained its ""built in India, for the world"" philosophy without seeking external venture capital, instead focusing on long-term talent development from rural India.The exchange between government and industry has resonated strongly with India's ""Make in India"" community, signaling the country's growing confidence in homegrown digital infrastructure.",Government push fuels Zoho's growing adoption across India.

US opens Tesla probe after more crashes involving its so-called full self-driving technology,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-opens-tesla-probe-after-more-crashes-involving-its-so-called-full-self-driving-technology/articleshow/124455165.cms,"



Federal auto safety regulators have opened yet another investigation into Tesla's so-called full-self driving technology after dozens of incidents in which its vehicles ran red lights or drove on the wrong side of the road, sometimes crashing into other vehicles and injuring people.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a filing dated Tuesday that it has 58 incident reports of Tesla vehicles violating traffic safety laws while operating in full self-driving mode. In reports to regulators, many of the Tesla drivers said the cars gave them no warning about the unexpected behavior.In August, a Miami jury found that Tesla was partly responsible for a deadly 2019 crash in Florida involving its Autopilot driver assist technology — which is different than full self-driving — and must pay the victims more than $240 million in damages.Tesla said it would appeal the decision.The new probe covers 2,882,566 vehicles, essentially all Teslas equipped with full self-driving technology, or FSD, of which there are two types. Level 2 driver-assistance software, or “Full Self-Driving (Supervised),” requires drivers to pay full attention to the road. The company is still testing a version that does not require driver intervention, something that the automaker's owner and CEO Elon Musk has been promising to roll out for years.The new investigation follows a host of other probes into the FSD feature on Teslas, which has been blamed for several injuries and deaths. Tesla has repeatedly said the system cannot drive itself and human drivers must be ready to intervene at all times.Tesla is also under investigation by NHTSA for a “summon” technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up, a feature that has reportedly led to some fender benders in parking lots. A probe into driver-assistance features in 2.4 million Teslas was opened last year after several crashes in fog and other low-visibility conditions, including one in which a pedestrian was killed.Another investigation was launched by NHTSA in August looking into why Tesla apparently has not been reporting crashes promptly to the agency as required by its rules.NHTSA investigations can often lead to recalls.Musk is under pressure to show that the latest advances in its driver-assistance features have not only fixed such glitches but have made them so good drivers don’t even need to look out the window anymore. He recently promised to put hundreds of thousands of such self-driving Tesla cars and Tesla robotaxis on roads by the end of the next year.Tesla shares fell 2% Thursday.","The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a filing dated Tuesday that it has 58 incident reports of Tesla vehicles violating traffic safety laws while operating in full self-driving mode.

UK regulator labels 'strategic market' designation on Google; company warns will hurt innovation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-activates-new-powers-to-regulate-googles-90-search-monopoly/articleshow/124453608.cms,"Google warns against innovation barriers

Potential changes could reshape Google Search experience





Britain's competition watchdog designated Google with ""strategic market status,” marking the first use of its regulatory powers aimed at curbing Big Tech's dominance in the United Kingdom. The Competition and Markets Authority found that Google controls over 90% of UK search traffic, granting regulators authority to impose targeted interventions on how the tech giant operates its search services. The designation doesn't constitute wrongdoing but opens the door for mandatory changes to ensure fair competition.CMA Executive Director Will Hayter emphasised Google's commanding market position, noting the company maintains substantial and entrenched power in search and search advertising sectors. The regulator plans to launch consultations later in 2025 on potential measures.Google pushed back against the regulatory designation, cautioning that proposed interventions could hamper UK innovation and economic growth. Oliver Bethell, Google's senior director of competition, argued the measures might delay product launches during a critical period of AI-driven innovation.The company highlighted its £5 billion investment commitment to Britain and claimed its search services contributed £118 billion to the UK economy in 2023 alone.Google urged regulators to avoid overly burdensome restrictions, pointing to what it described as negative outcomes in other jurisdictions.According to the CMA's roadmap published in June, potential interventions include mandatory choice screens showing alternative search engines, fairer ranking principles for websites, and giving publishers greater control over their content usage in AI-generated responses.While Google's Gemini AI assistant falls outside the current designation scope, other AI-powered search features like AI Overviews and AI Mode are included. The CMA stated it would monitor developments given market uncertainty.The regulatory action reflects growing global scrutiny of Google's search dominance, with similar investigations underway in the United States and Europe.","Britain's competition watchdog designated Google with ""strategic market status"" Google controls over 90% of UK search traffic, granting regulators authority to impose targeted interventions.

China has asked customs officials to investigate companies with past declarations



Comet CBS-05 Pro Speaker Review: Style & Sound Under Rs 6,000





China is tightening controls on chip imports at major ports, a report claims. This move will reportedly discourage the use of US products, specifically Nvidia's AI processors, in the country. In recent weeks, Chinese customs officers have been mobilised to conduct stringent checks on semiconductor shipments nationwide, a report by The Financial Times, citing sources familiar with the matter, claimed. The initial goal of these inspections was to ensure that local companies stop ordering Nvidia’s China-specific chips, namely the H20 and RTX Pro 6000D AI chipsets, following guidance from Chinese regulators. These Nvidia chips were designed to comply with US export controls and maintain the chipmaker’s market share in China. Now, the inspections have expanded to include all advanced semiconductor products to target the smuggling of high-end chips that violate US export curbs, the report noted. This crackdown highlights Beijing's focus on weaning its technology sector off American technology and bolstering domestic chipmakers to advance in the AI race.In addition to the tightened border checks, customs officials have also been investigating past declarations by companies regarding the import of advanced semiconductor products. This increased enforcement follows reports that a significant number of Nvidia's top AI chips were smuggled and sold in China over the three months from May.Previously, Chinese customs had generally allowed chip imports as long as appropriate duties were paid. Beijing aims to redirect resources toward domestic chipmakers to help them improve product performance and manufacturing capacity.US quantitative trading firm Tower Research faced investigation for alleged hardware smuggling, including advanced chips, the FT reported last week. The probe forms part of the new wave of import controls.The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the internet watchdog, instructed tech companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, in mid-September to cancel orders and halt testing of all Nvidia products. The border controls have been implemented as a coordinated effort with the CAC.The guidance came two months after Nvidia announced the Trump administration had lifted an earlier US export ban on H20. Nvidia also introduced the RTX Pro 6000D, another modified AI chip for China.The actions follow Beijing's assessment that domestic chips now match the performance standards of Nvidia's China-specific processors.China plans to triple production of advanced semiconductors next year to meet demand previously filled by Nvidia, the FT reported last month.Nvidia no longer includes China in its revenue projections. However, it recorded $4.6 billion in the first quarter of this fiscal year from H20 sales to China, its fourth-largest market, before the US temporarily restricted sales.","China is tightening controls on chip imports at major ports, a report claims.

How AI can be exploited







Eric Schmidt, who led Google as chief executive from 2001 to 2011, has delivered a ‘dangerous’ assessment of artificial intelligence (AI) security risks while simultaneously expressing optimism about the technology's transformative potential. Speaking at the Sifted Summit during a fireside chat this week, Schmidt addressed concerns about whether AI poses dangers comparable to nuclear weapons, acknowledging significant vulnerabilities in current AI systems.""Is there a possibility of a proliferation problem in AI? Absolutely,"" Schmidt stated, highlighting concerns that the technology could fall into the hands of malicious actors who could repurpose and misuse it.Schmidt pointed to evidence that AI models, whether closed or open-source, can be compromised to bypass their built-in safety mechanisms.“There’s evidence that you can take models, closed or open, and you can hack them to remove their guardrails. So in the course of their training, they learn a lot of things. A bad example would be they learn how to kill someone,” Schmidt highlighted.He noted that while all major AI companies implement safeguards to prevent their models from answering dangerous questions—a decision he characterised as both well-executed and ethically sound—these protections are not foolproof.""All of the major companies make it impossible for those models to answer that question. Good decision. Everyone does this. They do it well, and they do it for the right reasons. There's evidence that they can be reverse-engineered, and there are many other examples of that nature,"" Schmidt said.AI systems face multiple forms of attack, with prompt injections and jailbreaking among the most concerning methods, according to the former Google CEO.In prompt injection attacks, hackers embed malicious instructions within user inputs or external data sources such as web pages or documents. These hidden commands trick the AI into performing unintended actions, including sharing private information or executing harmful commands.Schmidt expressed concern about the lack of effective safeguards to address AI's proliferation risks.""There isn't a good 'non-proliferation regime' yet to help curb the dangers of AI,"" he stated, suggesting that current regulatory frameworks are insufficient to manage the technology's potential misuse.Despite these warnings, Schmidt struck an optimistic tone about AI's broader impact and argued that the technology is actually underestimated rather than overhyped.","Eric Schmidt, who led Google as chief executive from 2001 to 2011, has delivered a ‘dangerous’ assessment of artificial intelligence (AI) security risks.

Poll Do you think the current H-1B visa process benefits American technology companies? Yes No

Zoho founder says long-term R&D commitment drives innovation success

Indian companies must build culture of sustained innovation, Vembu argues





Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu has offered a fresh perspective on why Indian professionals dominate leadership roles at American technology companies, explaining how America's lengthy H-1B visa and green card processes inadvertently created a pool of committed tech talent rather than any deliberate strategy. The immigration system's restrictions made job switching risky, fostering long-term loyalty that naturally led to their rise in senior positions at major US firms.In a social media post on X, Vembu explained that the H-1B visa program and the notoriously long green card process created conditions that fostered long-term commitment among Indian workers. ""American companies solved the need for long term committed people with the H1-B visa and the extremely long green card process, both of which made it painful or risky to switch jobs,"" he wrote.This system, Vembu argued, gave US tech companies a reliable source of dedicated talent willing to stay with organisations for extended periods. Since companies naturally promote employees who demonstrate commitment, Indians who remained loyal to their employers advanced into senior positions. ""There was no conspiracy to promote Indians, it was one consequence of the visa/green card system,"" he emphasised.The Zoho founder stressed that research and development is ""not expensive but time intensive,"" with best results achieved by teams committed to long-term goals. The visa system inadvertently created these conditions by making job transitions risky for foreign workers seeking permanent residency.Vembu's comments come amid intense controversy over President Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee imposed in September, which has sparked heated debate about foreign talent in American technology. Critics, including billionaire investor Michael Moritz, warn the policy could backfire by pushing innovation overseas. Moritz cited successful immigrant CEOs like Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Google 's Sundar Pichai as examples of the program's benefits, arguing that ""two of the finest chief executives in the US"" are products of previous administrations' immigration policies.The fee has divided tech leadership. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged his own family couldn't have afforded such costs when they immigrated, yet called it ""a great start"" while warning it ""probably sets the bar a little too high."" Nvidia, with over 1,400 H-1B employees facing potential $147 million in fees, committed to covering all visa costs. Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings supported the fee as ensuring visas are ""used just for very high-value jobs,"" while most Silicon Valley executives warn it disadvantages startups and could drive talent to competitors in India, Turkey, and Eastern Europe.Vembu urged Indian tech companies to learn from this pattern, emphasising the importance of creating a culture focused on long-term R&D commitment. Earlier this month, Vembu stepped down as Zoho CEO to become Chief Scientist, dedicating himself full-time to research and development initiatives amid rapid AI advancement.Despite growing talent migration concerns, Vembu maintains an optimistic outlook, arguing that rising emigration actually signals economic transformation rather than decline—a pattern historically seen in Korea, Taiwan, and China during their development phases.","Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu explains why Indian professionals dominate leadership roles at American technology companies. He says America's lengthy H-1B visa and green card processes inadvertently created a pool of committed tech talent. The immigration system's restrictions made job switching risky, fostering long-term loyalty.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124449835,imgsize-48778,width-400,resizemode-4/file-sridhar-vembu.jpg"

Elon Musk is the world's richest person with a wealth of over $485 billion, according to Forbes Billionaires List. In 2012, the tech billionaire signed onto the Giving Pledge, an initiative co-founded by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Warren Buffet. As part of the pledge, the world’s wealthiest individuals commit to donate at least half of their fortunes to charity. Recently, PayPal founder and billionaire investor Peter Thiel revealed that he once advised Elon Musk to step away from the Giving Pledge.According to transcripts and audio recordings of a lecture series reviewed by Reuters, Thiel said he recently told Musk that signing the pledge could mean his fortune would end up with “left-leaning nonprofits” selected by Bill Gates. During the interaction, the German-American entrepreneur also shared concerns about global power structures. He warned of the possibility of an authoritarian figure — which he described as an “Antichrist” — gaining control under the guise of solving global threats such as nuclear war, artificial intelligence, or climate change.When Thiel advised Elon Musk to not donate his wealth, Musk responded by saying “What am I supposed to do—give it to my children?”.To this, Theil replied “You know, it would be much worse to give it to Bill Gates.”During the lecture, Thiel argued that billionaires should think more critically about the fate of their fortunes after death. Using actuarial tables, he said that the probability of Musk’s death within a year would translate into Gates receiving billions through philanthropic commitments. Thiel suggested this scenario highlighted the risks of allowing wealth to be directed by others through pledges like Gates’s initiative.Notably, Elon Musk has signed the pledge in 2012, but he has not specified in detail how his wealth would be distributed.", PayPal founder and billionaire investor Peter Thiel revealed that he once advised Elon Musk to step away from the Giving Pledge.

Limited service cuts fail to satisfy employee demands





Scott Sutfin-Glowski, a principal software engineer at Microsoft for 13 years, announced his resignation Thursday in a mass email sent to thousands of colleagues, protesting the company's continued cloud services contracts with the Israeli military. ""I can no longer accept enabling what may be the worst atrocities of our time,"" Sutfin-Glowski wrote, choosing to leave rather than face potential termination for dissent.Glowski's exit marks the latest escalation in months of internal turmoil at Microsoft over its Israeli military contracts. The company has fired five employees over Gaza-related demonstrations, including four who occupied President Brad Smith's office in August.Under pressure, in September, Microsoft announced it had stopped providing certain services to Israel Defense Forces' Unit 8200 after investigating an August Guardian report alleging the intelligence unit used Microsoft's Azure platform to track ""a million calls an hour"" from Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. The limited action, however, came only after Microsoft President Brad Smith issued a stern warning to employees during an internal meeting.Defending the August firing of four workers who occupied his office during Gaza-related protests, Smith told staff: ""Anybody who is smart enough to get a job at Microsoft is smart enough to know that you don't get to storm in and break into buildings and occupy other people's offices and keep your job at Microsoft.""Sutfin-Glowski's departure comes as a ceasefire in Gaza takes effect after two years of conflict. In his resignation letter, he referenced a February Associated Press report indicating Israel's military maintains at least 635 Microsoft subscriptions, with the vast majority still active. He also criticised Microsoft for eliminating communication channels that previously allowed employees to raise concerns about the Israeli military's use of company products.On Thursday, renewed demonstrations erupted at Microsoft's Redmond, Washington headquarters. The No Azure for Apartheid group displayed banners reading ""WE CALL BULLSHIT. CUT ALL TIES WITH ISRAEL NOW"" and ""Microsoft Build KILLS,"" featuring images of warplanes and missiles deployed from the Azure cloud logo.Over 1,500 Microsoft employees have signed petitions calling for the company to endorse a ceasefire. Among those previously fired was Riki Fameli, an Azure Storage engineer who told Business Insider that ""proper channels are dead ends"" for employee concerns about company policies. Microsoft has now terminated five employees total over protests related to Israeli military contracts.Microsoft President Smith confirmed the company found ""evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting"" and blocked cloud storage and AI services to Unit 8200. An Israeli security official downplayed the impact, telling CNN there is ""no damage to the operational capabilities of the IDF."" Intelligence sources told The Guardian that Unit 8200 quickly moved its massive surveillance data trove from Microsoft's Dutch servers to Amazon Web Services within days of the investigation's publication.Activists argue Microsoft's action affects only a single unit while the vast majority of the company's military contracts remain intact. The No Azure for Apartheid group, which has been pressuring Microsoft for over a year, called the September decision ""a significant and unprecedented win"" but vowed to continue organizing until all demands are met.Microsoft declined to comment on Sutfin-Glowski's resignation.","Scott Sutfin-Glowski, a principal software engineer at Microsoft for 13 years, announced his resignation Thursday.

Selling an average of 1.2 million cars per year over the next decade less than Tesla’s 2024 output. If the market value of Tesla increase from $1.4 trillion to $2 trillion by 2035, then Musk would earn around $8.2 billion in stocks.

Some of the vaguely defined goals include deployment of around 1 million robotaxis and achieve 10 million full self-driving subscriptions. The goal also includes 1 million AI-powered bots which could trigger massive payouts even if they fail to boost profits.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is said to earn tens of billions of dollars from a record-breaking compensation package even if he fails to meet most of the ambitious goals set by the bard of the company. As reported by Reuters, Musk could surpass the lifetime earbibggs of CEOs such as Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Tim Cook and Jensen Huang by just achieve some relatively modest milestones. In September this year, the Tesla board proposed a 10-year compensation package which could award Musk up to $878 billion in stocks on the condition of hitting a series of ‘Mars-shot’ gaols. The goals include breakthroughs in robotics, autonomous driving, and massive profit and valuation targets. However, as reported by Reuters, Elon Musk could still earn more than $50 billion by meeting just a handful of easier goals without actually transforming Tesla’s products or business.According to Reuters, some of the simpler tasks include:Each product goal, when paired with a valuation step, unlocks 1% of Tesla’s stock, meaning Musk can accumulate wealth even if profit targets are missed.The Tesla shareholders are said to vote on Elon Musk’s package in November 2025. While the board insists the plan is “worth zero” unless Musk delivers, critics argue the structure allows for outsized rewards with minimal transformation. Musk, who recently crossed the $500 billion net worth threshold, has said the package ensures he retains influence over Tesla “if we build millions of robots.”","Tesla CEO Elon Musk is said to earn tens of billions of dollars from a record- breaking compensation package.

Cap exemptions

Increased scrutiny for employers

Increased oversight over third party placements

Restricting employment based green cards

Defining ‘Especiality occupation’





The Trump administration recently announced a $100,000 annual fee on H-1B visa applications starting September 21. Now, the US government is planning to bring more changes to the H-1B visa rules. The Department of Homeland Security has published its regulatory agenda recently proposing new changes to the H-1B visa category. Titled “Reforming the H-1B Nonimmigrant Visa Classification Program”, the proposal reads:“The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will propose to reform the H-1B program by revising eligibility for cap exemptions, providing greater scrutiny for employers that have violated program requirements, and increasing oversight over third party placements, among other provisions. These changes are intended to improve the integrity of the H-1B nonimmigrant program and better protect U.S. workers’ wages and working conditions. ”In addition, the DHS has also proposed a rule that could affect employment-based immigrants. Among other things, the proposed rules aims to “update provisions governing extraordinary ability and outstanding professors and researchers; modernize outdated provisions for individuals of extraordinary ability and outstanding professors and researchers; clarify evidentiary requirements for first preference classifications, second preference national interest waiver classifications, and physicians of national and international renown”.Currently, universities and their affiliated nonprofit entities, nonprofit research organizations, health organizations, and government research organizations are exempted from the annual H-1B visa cap. DHS plans to narrow the exempted organizations as part of the proposed H-1B visa rules.The proposed H-1B visa rules plan to expand scrutiny of companies that were previously found in violation of wage or labor condition rules.DHS has also proposed to increase scrutiny of agencies involved in H-1B workers placement at client sites, a practice common in tech and consulting.DHS also plans to restrict employers using O-1 visas and national interest waivers for high-skilled foreign nationals.The Department of Homeland also plans to define ‘Especiality occupation’. In the proposed draft, DHS said “The specialty occupation definition also clarifies that although the position may allow for a range of qualifying degree fields, each of the fields must be directly related to the duties of the position.”",The Department of Homeland Security has published its regulatory agenda recently proposing new changes to the H-1B visa category.

The controversy started after a clip a went viral in which Kaya was seen yelping. This prompted a speculation that Piker activate a shock collar when the camera as off. In a rather sarcastic tone, Piker said, “Yes, I am incredibly abusive… to the not only best trained, but also the best behaving and most spoiled dog on the planet. However, he later clarified that Kaya had yelped due to an accident. He said that the Kaya accidentally clipped herself while getting off from the bed and that is the reason for the yelping and not the shock collar.The viral backlash and criticism drew attention from PETA. The animal rights protection organisation issued a statement to The Hollywood Reporter and said, “Hasan Piker has denied using a shock collar on his dog, and we hope that’s true because shock collars are dangerous and downright cruel.Along with this, PETA also stressed on the fact that devices like a shock collar can cause burn wounds, displaced aggression and chronic anxiety.Instead of the extreme methods the organisation advise positive reinforcement training.Although Piker has dined the use of a shock collar on his dog, the critics still zoomed in on the now viral footage and pointed to a green blinking light on Kaya’s collar. This is an alleged characteristic of shock collars. Some also resurfaced an old clip where Piker described owning one as “incredibly effective,” fueling further skepticism.

Microsoft faces $1.2 billion lawsuit in UK; here’s why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-faces-1-2-billion-lawsuit-in-uk-heres-why/articleshow/115955411.cms,"Microsoft is reportedly facing a $1.27 billion lawsuit in the UK. According to a Reuters report, the software giant has been accused of unfairly overcharging customers of rival cloud companies.Microsoft offers discounted pricing for companies using Windows Server on Azure compared to competitors like AWS , Google Cloud , or Alibaba Cloud. This pricing strategy, the lawsuit claims, effectively penalizes firms, forcing them to pay higher costs for non-Microsoft services. It further claims Microsoft exploits its dominant position in cloud-based server operating systems to charge higher prices for using its software on rival platforms. It alleges that this pricing strategy pressures customers to migrate to Azure instead.The lawsuit was filed by competition lawyer Maria Luisa Stasi at the Competition Appeal Tribunal on Tuesday, December 3. “Put simply, Microsoft is punishing UK businesses and organisations for using Google, Amazon and Alibaba for cloud computing by forcing them to pay more money for Windows Server,” Stasi said in a statement shared with CNBC.“By doing so, Microsoft is trying to force customers into using its cloud computing service Azure and restricting competition in the sector.”She added the lawsuit “aims to challenge Microsoft’s anti-competitive behavior, push them to reveal exactly how much businesses in the UK have been illegally penalized, and return the money to organizations that have been unfairly overcharged.”The lawsuit represents thousands of British businesses and organizations in an “opt-out” collective action. This means all potentially affected companies are automatically included in the case and stand to receive compensation if the lawsuit against Microsoft is successful.",Microsoft is reportedly facing a $1.27 billion lawsuit in the UK.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg wants to go the 'Elon Musk way' in Donald Trump government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-wants-to-go-the-elon-musk-way-in-donald-trump-government/articleshow/115955245.cms,"Donald Trump and Mark Zuckerberg

Meta president accepts company was 'wrong' about Donald Trump

In a strategic pivot reminiscent of Elon Musk 's close political alignment, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is positioning himself to play an ""active role"" in shaping technology policy within a potential Trump administration, according to a recent Financial Times report.Nick Clegg , Meta's president of global affairs, revealed that Zuckerberg is ""very keen to play an active role"" in technological policy debates, particularly surrounding artificial intelligence and America's technological leadership. The overture comes after Zuckerberg and Trump recently met for dinner at Mar-a-Lago, suggesting a potential thawing of their previously hostile relationship.The company is also acknowledging past missteps in content moderation, with Clegg admitting Meta ""overdid it a bit"" during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We know that when enforcing our policies, our error rates are too high,"" Clegg told reporters, acknowledging that the platform has often mistakenly removed or restricted harmless content.This strategic repositioning appears calculated to curry favor with Trump, who has historically been critical of social media platforms. Previously, Facebook suspended Trump's account following the January 6 Capitol riot, a move that significantly strained their relationship. Trump had even suggested he would jail Zuckerberg if re-elected.However, recent developments indicate a potential rapprochement. Unlike during previous election cycles, Zuckerberg has remained neutral and even described Trump's response to an assassination attempt as ""badass."" The Meta CEO seems eager to secure a seat at the policy-making table, especially as tech leaders like Elon Musk are already closely advising the president-elect.Zuckerberg's primary interest appears to be maintaining America's technological edge, with a particular focus on artificial intelligence. Clegg emphasized the ""geostrategic uncertainties"" that make US tech leadership crucial in the current global landscape."," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is positioning himself to play an ""active role"" in shaping technology policy within a potential Trump administration.

Tesla to appeal court order

Musk posted “absolute corruption.”

""Shareholders should control company votes, not judges.""

What is Elon Musk's compensation structure

A Delaware judge has once again rejected Elon Musk 's record-breaking compensation package at Tesla. This means that Tesla CEO Musk is prevented from accessing a pay package whose potential value has soared along with Tesla's stock price. ""As of Monday, the pay package was worth $101.4 billion, according to Equilar, a compensation consulting firm,"" as per Reuters.The decision could impact the wealth of the world's richest man. But yes, it will not impact his ranking as the world's richest man, thanks to Tesla’s stock soaring as investors bet on the billionaire’s close relationship with Trump.Musk’s wealth hit an all-time high in November — surpassing the previous record of $340.4 billion set in November 2021 — after a Tesla stock rally following Donald Trump's win in the US presidential election.This isn't the first time that the court has cast doubt on the legitimacy of the compensation package. In January too, Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick initially rejected it as excessive, and even after shareholders voted to approve it, she reaffirmed her original decision. McCormick then voided the pay package saying that the deal was unfair to shareholders and that most of the board members were beholden to Musk or had compromising conflicts.In fact, Musk moved his companies out of Delaware for incorporation purposes post McCormick’s January ruling.Judge McCormick ruled that Tesla's board was improperly influenced by Musk when they approved the massive pay plan in 2018. Her decision was laid out in a 103-page opinion piece in which she wrote that the attempt by Tesla’s legal team — which Musk has called “hardcore” — to change her mind contained multiple flaws, each of which were fatal on their own. “The large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law,” McCormick wrote. “There were undoubtedly a range of healthy amounts that the board could have decided to pay Musk,” said McCormick. “Instead, the board capitulated to Musk’s terms,” she added.In her ruling, she pushed back on the idea that a “stockholder vote can be deployed to reverse any form of judicial ruling, whatever the ruling, no matter how final,” adding that Tesla’s board and its co-founder had no grounds “for flipping the outcome of an adverse post-trial decision based on evidence they created after trial.”McCormick also awarded $345 million to Tornetta’s lawyers. While that amount was far less than the attorneys’ request to be compensated with 29 million Tesla shares — more than $10 billion at the company’s current share price — it’s still among the largest lawyer paydays in US shareholder litigation.“We hope that the Chancellor’s well-reasoned decision will end this matter for the shareholders of Tesla,” said lawyers at the firm of Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann who led the litigation on behalf of Tornetta.Shortly after the court's ruling, the Tesla board said that it will appeal the decision with the Delaware Supreme Court. This process could take months.Reacting to the decision on his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter,Musk wrote in another X post:He had previously said he needed a bigger stake in Tesla to maintain control of the electric-car maker and expand further into artificial intelligence.Elon Musk's 2018 pay package was based on the idea that he would get all the options only if Tesla’s stock price soared and its sales and earnings grew strongly. His compensation package created 12 tranches of options - each equivalent at the time to 1% of Tesla's outstanding shares - potentially giving him a 12% stake in the automaker. Musk would receive no salary. Under the 10-year deal, Musk was eligible to win an options tranche every time Tesla hit a series of up to 12 targets. Those targets were tied to increases in Tesla's market capitalization in $50 billion increments, and to aggressive hurdles for revenue and EBITDA growth. Musk went on to hit all 12 targets when few had expected him to, given the various struggles of Tesla at that time. He still owns the options.","A Delaware judge has once again rejected Elon Musk's record-breaking compensation package at Tesla.

Indigo vs Mahindra: Why India's largest airline and one of the biggest auto company are 'fighting' over '6E' mark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indigo-vs-mahindra-why-indias-largest-airline-and-one-of-the-biggest-auto-company-are-fighting-over-6e-mark/articleshow/115946605.cms,"The Registrar of Trademarks has accepted Mahindra's application to register the ""BE 6e"" mark

Indigo and Mahindra looking for amicable solution

IndiGo: Any unauthorised use of “6E” mark constitutes infringement of IndiGo’s rights, reputation and goodwill

""The “6E” mark, whether standalone or in its variants and formative forms, is extensively used by IndiGo for its offerings and for goods and services provided in collaboration with trusted partners. Any unauthorised use of the “6E” mark, whether standalone or in any form, constitutes an infringement of IndiGo’s rights, reputation, and goodwill. IndiGo is committed to taking all necessary and appropriate steps to safeguard its intellectual property and brand identity,”

Mahindra: We do not see conflict as our mark is ""BE 6e"" not standalone ""6E""

A spokesperson for the company stated that Mahindra does not see a conflict, as its mark is ""BE 6e,"" not the standalone ""6E,"" which IndiGo uses as its registered call sign under airline services. ""

It differs fundamentally from IndiGo's '6E,' which represents an airline, eliminating any risk of confusion.

InterGlobe Aviation , the parent company of India's largest airline IndiGo, has filed a lawsuit against Mahindra Electric Automobiles, alleging trademark infringement of its Air Transport Association code ""6E."" The airline claims that Mahindra's upcoming electric SUV, the Mahindra BE 6e , uses a similar mark that could potentially confuse consumers. Mahindra unveiled its electric-origin SUVs, the BE 6e and XEV 9e, on November 26, 2024. Mahindra's BE 6e is scheduled to be launched in February 2024. However, IndiGo 's legal action could potentially delay or impact the launch.While the court hearing was adjourned, both companies have initiated discussions to resolve the dispute amicably. Mahindra has emphasized that the ""BE 6e"" mark is distinct from IndiGo's ""6E"" and that there is no risk of consumer confusion., which could grant the company rights to use the ""6E"" identifier for a wide range of vehicles. However, the mark cannot be used for two-wheelers.Both companies have issued statements acknowledging the dispute and expressing their intent to find a mutually agreeable solution. The outcome of the legal battle will determine the future use of the ""6E"" mark in the Indian market.In a statement Indigo said that the “6E” mark is an integral part of its identity for the past 18 years and is a registered trademark that holds strong global recognition.added the statement.IndiGo operates under the callsign ‘6E,’ which is integral to the airline's identity since 2015. The carrier holds trademark registrations for '6E Link' across multiple classes (9, 35, 39 and 16), including advertising, transport, and passenger services. IndiGo uses the ""6E"" designation for various passenger-centric services such as 6E Prime and 6E Flex for seat selection, priority check-in, unlimited rescheduling and cancellation flexibility, etc.On its part, Mahindra Electric Automobile Limited (MEAL) has clarified its position on the lawsuit filed by IndiGo Airlines.The company has applied for trademark registration under Class 12 (vehicles) for 'BE 6e,' which is part of its electric-origin SUV portfolio,"" the spokesperson stated in its filing to the exchanges. ""We, therefore, do not see a conflict as Mahindra's mark is 'BE 6e,' not the standalone '6E.'The distinct styling further underscores their uniqueness,"" the spokesperson added.","Indigo and Mahindra looking for amicable solution.

Sharing the experience on X (formerly Twitter), Johnson wrote, “Last night at Soho House with @deepigoyal, who built @zomato into one of the most successful companies in India.”For those unaware, Soho is an international private members’ club in Mumbai. “There were over 1,100 applications for 50 seats. Sad to miss so many of you. Thank you @akshaybd and @thetanmay for hosting,” he added, sharing images from the event.The event was also attended by a Mumbai-based doctor Rickson Pereira who wrote on X: “Had an enlightening Sunday evening listening to @bryan_johnson talk about his project ‘Blueprint’. “Blueprint” is his personal project where he aims to “not die” by implementing a rigorous daily routine that includes diet, exercise, sleep, and supplements. He works closely with a team of doctors and researchers to monitor his body’s biomarkers and adjust his routine for optimal health. I subscribe to his ideology of prioritising your health first. I have been following his work for over a year and I think he is doing an amazing job of generating data about what works for human body and what is required to be in peak physical health. Thank you @thetanmay for the invite.”Bryan Johnson’s anti-aging journey, part of his ambitious Project Blueprint , has involved controversial methods such as receiving blood transfusions from his teenage son—a ""young blood"" procedure not approved by the FDA—alongside a strict diet with Blueprint-branded supplements and regular gene therapy injections.In November this year, Johnson accepted facing a setback when a recent procedure reportedly caused severe swelling to his face.

He said that immediately following the injections, his face began to blow up. “And then it got worse, and worse, and worse until I couldn’t even see. It was a severe allergic reaction,” he added.","Tech millionaire Bryan Johnson is famed for his age-reversing experiments.

‘Your death date’: This AI app claims can ‘predict’ when you will die,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/death-clock-ai-app-with-1-25-lakh-downloads-can-predict-date-of-your-death/articleshow/115885555.cms,"This is an AI-generated image



Death Clock gets 1.25 lakh downloads



How Death Clock predicts death

Maintain a Healthy Weight

2) Regular Exercise

3)

Stop Smoking

4)

Balanced Diet

5)

Drink Less (or no) Alcohol

6) Good Sleep

7) Regular Check-ups

8) Manage Stress

9) Maintain Social Connections

10) Lifelong Learning

An Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die. Launched in July early this year, the app analyzes personal data such as age, height, weight, daily calorie intake, exercise levels, and more to predict the date. Developer Brent Franson says that the AI was trained on a dataset of more than 1,200 life expectancy studies with some 53 million participants. The results, he says, are a ‘pretty significant’ improvement on the standard life-table expectations.Despite its somewhat morbid concept—a ""fond farewell"" death-day card featuring the Grim Reaper—the app has gained traction in the Health and Fitness category. It is free to use, while you will need a subscription to show a clock counting down to my estimated death. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, the app has around 1,25,000 downloads till date.“Have you ever asked yourself 'when will I die?', our advanced life expectancy calculator will accurately* predict your death date for you depending on where you live, how much you smoke and your lifestyle to show your own death clock countdown. To predict your death date, simply input your date of birth, sex, smoking habits, your BMI and the country you live in. If you don't know your BMI simply use the BMI calculator form,” the app reads.Death Clock predictions are based on extensive medical studies and health data, with AI providing personalized suggestions for a healthier lifestyle. The idea is to encourage individuals to take better care of their health, using the predictions as a framework for decision-making.As mentioned, the app offers personalised suggestions to users. Some of these include:Maintaining a healthy weight is vital to reduce the risk of developing diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.Get moving for at least 30 minutes a day. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.Avoid smoking and second-hand smoke. These can lead to various types of cancer, heart disease, and lung diseases.Eating a balanced diet full of nutrient-rich fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains is critical. Avoid consuming too much processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats.Limit alcohol intake. While occasional social drinking is usually okay, heavy or prolonged drinking can lead to a number of health issues including liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and cancer.Try to get a good night's sleep. Quality sleep is important for overall health and well-being. It affects mood, memory, and healing processes.Regular screenings and medical check-ups can help detect problems early. This is especially important for conditions that don't always show noticeable symptoms, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol.Long-term stress can lead to a number of health issues. Practice stress management techniques like mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or other relaxation exercises.Relationships and social interactions are vital for mental health. Loneliness and social isolation can lead to depression and cognitive decline.Keep your mind active. Lifelong learning, reading, solving puzzles, or other brain-engaging activities can help to keep your mind sharp and potentially delay the onset of cognitive decline.While it’s important to note that these AI-driven tools aren’t guaranteed to provide exact dates, there are concerns about privacy and data security, as users must input sensitive information, which could be exploited by companies or malicious actors.","Artificial intelligence-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die.

Revisiting the 6 productivity tips that Elon Musk shared with employees of Tesla and Twitter: Walk out of meetings and more ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/revisiting-the-6-productivity-tips-that-elon-musk-shared-with-employees-of-tesla-and-twitter-walk-out-of-meetings-and-more-/articleshow/115875599.cms,"Excessive meetings are biggest drain on productivity

Walk out of a meeting if ...

Technical jargon is a Big No

Forget the chain of command

Don't forget common sense

Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk , who is now one of the most influential people in the United States, post the election of Donald Trump , ""a few productivity recommendations"", which the employees need to follow to thrive in any of his firms. Known for his demanding work ethic, the billionaire has recently shared productivity tips with employees at both Tesla and Twitter.Just days after laying off 3,800 Twitter employees, Musk sent a company-wide email outlining his expectations for the remaining staff. Hardcore Work Ethic: Employees must be prepared to work long hours at high intensity. Exceptional Performance: Only exceptional performance will be tolerated.Those who don't agree to these terms by a specific deadline will receive three months of severance pay.Musk also shared an email giving suggestions on how to improve productivity . The same email is said to have been earlier shared with Tesla employees. Here are the tips:Excessive meetings are the blight of big companies and almost always get worse over time. Please get rid of all large meetings, unless you’re certain they are providing value to the whole audience, in which case keep them very short. Also get rid of frequent meetings, unless you are dealing with an extremely urgent matter. Meeting frequency should drop rapidly once the urgent matter is resolved.Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value. It is not rude to leave, it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.Don’t use acronyms or nonsense words for objects, software or processes at Tesla. In general, anything that requires an explanation inhibits communication. We don’t want people to have to memorize a glossary just to function at Tesla.Communication should travel via the shortest path necessary to get the job done, not through the “chain of command”. Any manager who attempts to enforce chain of command communication will soon find themselves working elsewhere. A major source of issues is poor communication between depts. The way to solve this is to allow free flow of information between all levels. If, in order to get something done between depts, an individual contributor has to talk to their manager, who talks to a director, who talks to a VP, who talks to another VP, who talks to a director, who talks to a manager, who talks to someone doing the actual work, then super dumb things will happen. It must be ok for people to talk directly and just make the right thing happen. A major source of issues is poor communication between depts.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has initiated an investigation into Google following allegations by online gaming company Winzo, marking a potential challenge to the tech giant's dominance in the app market. Winzo accuses Google of abusing its market power by restricting real-money gaming apps from being listed on the Play Store. According to the gaming company, this policy forces developers to resort to sideloading—direct app downloads from websites—which is considered less secure and limits consumer choice. Winzo argues that this restrictive practice hampers the accessibility of apps offering real-money games of skill, as these can only be downloaded through their website, creating unnecessary hurdles for developers and users alike.

PAN 2.0 features enhanced security, including a dynamic QR code designed to automatically detect duplicate PAN cards and identify incorrect information. This measure aims to simplify the detection of violations, such as individuals possessing multiple PAN cards or providing false PAN details, which can result in a penalty of Rs 10,000.Taxation experts highlight that the new system addresses fraud cases where fake PAN cards have been used for illegal activities like setting up fraudulent companies or committing GST and input tax credit fraud. Instances have emerged where original PAN holders were unaware of their credentials being misused. Taxpayers are advised to verify and deactivate any duplicate PAN cards issued under their name to prevent potential misuse. Click here to read the complete story.

Intel has reportedly begun the search for a new CEO following the recent departure of Pat Gelsinger and former board member Lip-Bu Tan has emerged as a potential candidate. According to a report by news agency Reuters, Tan left after disagreements between Gelsinger and other board members.Citing sources familiar with the matter, the report said that Intel's board has reached out to Tan to gauge his interest in the position.Tan, a seasoned industry veteran, previously served on Intel's board for two years as part of an effort to revitalise the struggling chipmaker. He joined the board in 2022 and was later tasked with overseeing manufacturing operations.However, he left in August after disagreements with Gelsinger over various aspects of Intel's turnaround strategy, including workforce size, contract manufacturing, and company culture, a previous report by the news agency said.One of the reasons why Tan is a strong contender to succeed Gelsinger is his experience and industry knowledge.

Indian Police to question Starlink officials as drug smugglers using satellite devices sends alarm bells ringing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indian-police-to-question-starlink-officials-as-drug-smugglers-using-satellite-devices-sends-alarm-bells-ringing/articleshow/115943309.cms,"Why this incident is significant

Smugglers allegedly used Starlink Mini device

Police are investigating Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet service after it was allegedly used by drug smugglers to navigate and coordinate a massive methamphetamine operation, a report by news agency Reuters said. As a part of the probe, the police will seek details from the company to hunt down the smugglers.Police in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands made their largest drug seizure ever last week, uncovering over 6,000 kg of meth worth an estimated $4.25 billion on a Myanmar boat, the news agency reported. Six Myanmar nationals have been detained in connection with the operation.This incident marks the first time Starlink technology has been linked to illegal activities within Indian waters, essentially raising concerns about its potential misuse. According to Hargobinder S. Dhaliwal, a senior police officer leading the investigation, the smugglers used a Starlink device to bypass traditional communication channels.They established a Wi-Fi hotspot for communication during their journey from Myanmar.“This (case) is different because it is bypassing all the legal channels. They directly operated (phones) with satellite, creating a Wi-Fi hotspot,” Dhaliwal told Reuters.“They (smugglers) were using Starlink since their journey started from Myanmar,” he added.Dhaliwal plans to request information from Starlink, including details about who purchased the device, purchase date and usage history.According to him, the smugglers used the Starlink Mini device , which is “a compact, portable kit that can easily fit in a backpack”.Police in the Andaman and Nicobar islands are also checking the involvement of any local or foreign syndicates in the whole network as they tackle the latest seizure case from various angles.It is to be noted that Starlink, which offers internet coverage in international waters, is currently awaiting approval to launch its services in India.Reliance Industries Limited chairman Mukesh Ambani has opposed Starlink's entry into the Indian market, throwing his weight behind auctions of spectrum for the technology.","Police in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands made their largest drug seizure ever last week, uncovering over 6,000 kg of meth worth an estimated $4.25 billion.

"Facebook-parent Meta claims impact of generative AI during elections in India, other countries was “modest”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-parent-meta-claims-impact-of-generative-ai-during-elections-in-india-other-countries-was-modest/articleshow/115941712.cms,"How Meta mitigated spread of misinformation on Instagram, Facebook

In India, where the Voting Alert notification ran on Facebook on April 17th ahead of the National Elections. The notification launched from the Election Commission of India’s Facebook page and reached 145 million users, directing people to get more information via https://elections24.eci.gov.in/.

The Elections Commission of India also deployed the WhatsApp API to run voting reminder campaigns reaching around 400 million users.

‘Disinformation campaigns are adapting’

Facebook parent Meta has said that despite widespread concerns about the potential for generative AI to disrupt elections worldwide, including India, the company has seen minimal impact from the technology during this year’s elections across its platforms.Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, stated in a press briefing that coordinated efforts to spread misinformation using AI were largely unsuccessful. He attributed this to the company's ability to quickly identify and remove AI-generated content and the failure of such campaigns to gain significant traction on their platforms.In a blog, the company said that it updated and applied its “content policies fairly so that people can make their voices heard.”“At the start of the year, many people were warning of the potential impact of generative AI on the upcoming elections, including the risk of widespread deepfakes and AI-enabled disinformation campaigns. From what we’ve monitored across our services, it seems these risks did not materialize in a significant way and that any such impact was modest and limited in scope,” the company said in the blog post.The company said that apart from taking proactive measures, it monitored the impact of AI throughout the year.For example, the company delivered “reliable information about voting” through in-app notifications on Facebook and Instagram.Meta also said it was able to take down about 20 covert influence operations on its platform this year.However, Clegg warned that coordinated disinformation campaigns are adapting by shifting their activities to platforms with less stringent content moderation or by establishing their own websites. Clegg also acknowledged that the company may have ""overdone it"" with content removal in the past and is now prioritising free expression while striving for greater precision in enforcing its rules.","Facebook parent Meta has said that despite widespread concerns about the potential for generative AI to disrupt elections worldwide, the company has seen minimal impact from the technology during this year’s elections across its platforms.

Misuse of PAN, Aadhaar card revealed massive 380 crore scam



A Kanpur man lost Rs 7 lakh to cybercriminals while trying to obtain a PAN card for his great-grandson in the US. Suresh Chandra Sharma fell victim to an online scam while searching for customer service assistance for the PAN card application.

A case has been registered under the IT Act, and police investigations are underway.In the FIR, Sharma, a resident of Navsheel Moti Vihar Sarvodaya Nagar, reported that he had searched online to apply for a PAN card for his great-grandson, Kanishk Pandey. During the process, two individuals claiming to be customer service representatives, Avinash Awasthi and Rajeev Ranjan, informed him that he needed to act as a guarantor for the PAN card. They collected his Aadhaar card, PAN card, and banking details.In November, the duo fraudulently withdrew Rs 1,40,071 and Rs 6,30,071 from two of Sharma’s bank accounts, amounting to a total of Rs 7,70,143.Upon discovering the unauthorised transactions, Sharma filed complaints with his banks, the Commissioner of Police, Kakadeo Police , and the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal.Kakadeo Inspector Manoj Singh Bhadauria has confirmed to TOI that a case has been registered under the IT Act based on Sharma’s complaint, and investigations are underway.In another case, a real estate agent from Diva received an income tax notice for transactions totalling Rs 382 crore in Septemeber.

Despite public enthusiasm, with Google initially stating it was ""delighted to have been chosen to help digitally transform"" the country, internal communications painted a more complex picture.The Times reported that Google anticipated substantial revenue, with an estimated $525 million expected from the Ministry of Defense between 2021 and 2028. For a company with $258 billion in sales in 2021, the contract was strategically significant for Google's struggling cloud computing division.Employee activism has dramatically challenged the project's implementation. In April, Google fired approximately 50 workers who staged protests at two company offices, with eight protesters arrested.Google has consistently defended the contract, with a company spokeswoman asserting, ""We have been very clear that the Nimbus contract is for workloads running on our commercial cloud by Israeli government ministries, who agree to comply with our terms of service and acceptable use policy.""The contract became particularly contentious following the outbreak of the war in Gaza, with some employees claiming Google's technology might be implicated in the conflict. The company has denied these allegations, emphasizing that Nimbus ""is not directed at highly sensitive, classified or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.""An Israeli Ministry of Finance spokeswoman highlighted the contract's potential, stating it would help Israel ""solidify its position as a leading technology hub and improve the day-to-day lives of Israelis.""The project mirrors Google's previous controversial military contract, Project Maven , which was ultimately abandoned after significant employee protest in 2018. This time, however, the company has taken a firmer stance, even barring employees from displaying unauthorized messages and signs in office spaces.","Internal documents reveal Google's legal and policy teams harbored deep concerns about Project Nimbus.

What are the key changes in Canada’s immigration rules

What it means for Indians working and studying in Canada

Canada has introduced significant updates to its immigration policies that could impact millions of workers, including a large number of Indians. Immigration Minister Marc Miller revealed that nearly five million temporary permits currently held by foreign nationals are set to expire by the end of 2025. As a result, most permit holders are expected to leave the country unless they transition to permanent residency or renew their permits.Miller informed the Commons immigration committee earlier this week many are anticipated to leave of their own accord, while the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) will enforce immigration laws for those who overstay.He said that about 766,000 study permits are set to expire by December 2025, noting that some students may renew their permits or apply for post-graduate work permits, enabling them to remain in Canada longer.The Trudeau government has introduced reductions in the number of both permanent and temporary residents entering Canada over the next three years. These changes are part of a revised immigration levels plan aimed at addressing Canada’s housing, healthcare and infrastructure challenges.Under the new policy, the annual target for permanent residents will decrease from 500,000 to 395,000 by 2025, representing a 21% reduction, as per a report in The Economic Times.Temporary foreign workers and international students will also see cuts, with the number of temporary foreign workers expected to drop by more than 40% and international students by 10% by 2026.Canada is one of the preferred destinations for Indians looking to immigrate to other countries. According to a September report , Canada has 1,689,055 Indians living in the country. The Indian diaspora in the country has workers such as C-suite executives, engineers, technicians and scientists, among others.The plan to reduce the number of temporary foreign workers may affect Indian workers on temporary visas, making it more challenging to renew or extend their stay. For those already in the process of getting permanent residency in the country may also be impacted.",Nearly five million temporary permits currently held by foreign nationals are set to expire by the end of 2025.

The note criticized Biden’s decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, stating:“By pardoning his son Hunter, not merely for a single crime, but for all actual or potential crimes he may or may not have created over an eleven years period, Joe Biden has made clear that some people are, in fact, above the law.”","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reportedly raised up to $6 billion to purchase 100,000 Nvidia chips for xAI’s Memphis data center.

Protecting yourself

Be wary of unsolicited emails or SMS messages: Never click on suspicious links or attachments.



Double-check website addresses: Ensure you are on the official bank website before entering any login credentials.



Beware of offers that seem too good to be true: Phishing attempts often lure users with unrealistic deals or urgent warnings.



Avoid entering personal information on public Wi-Fi: Use secure networks for financial transactions.



Enable two-factor authentication: This adds an extra layer of security to your online banking accounts.



A recent report has raised concerns about a rise in phishing attacks targeting customers of major Indian banks, including ICICI, HDFC, and Axis Bank. This highlights the growing threat of cybercrime in the country and the need for increased vigilance by both banks and customers.The report by Zscaler ThreatLabz reveals a significant increase in mobile malware attacks targeting Indian users. Phishing tactics are a key strategy employed by attackers. These tactics involve creating fake websites or emails that closely resemble legitimate bank websites. Unsuspecting users are then tricked into entering their personal information, such as login credentials and account details, which are then stolen by the attackers.ICICI, HDFC, and Axis Bank are some of the largest banks in India, making them prime targets for cybercriminals.

Funded lawsuit against Donald Trump

More tech billionaires in the list

Tech billionaire and co-founder of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman has reportedly considered leaving US after the victory of Donald Trump in the recent elections. A Democratic Party mega-donor, Hoffman was among the most vocal supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris’ failed campaign. According to a report in the New York Times, Hoffman has told friends that he is thinking of relocating overseas due to fears that Trump would use his power in the White House to seek retribution against his political enemies.What is said to have made matters worse is Hoffman's previous comments where he is said to have wished that the president-elect Trump was an “actual martyr” in the first failed assassination attempt in July this year. He is reported to have known Harris for years and is said to have spent millions of dollars into her White House campaign.In April 2023, a report in the New York Times claimed that Hoffman also helped a defamation lawsuit filed by former New York magazine writer E. Jean Carroll against Trump. Trump’s lawyers argued in court at the time that Hoffman’s role in financing the lawsuit raised “significant questions” about Carroll’s credibility.Incidentally, Hoffman isn’t the only wealthy Democrat donor who toying with the idea of moving abroad. According to the Times, several major donors and their advisers have considered the prospect of leaving the country in private conversations.The Times report added that a recent gathering of the Democracy Alliance, a left-leaning donor network, in Washington had the feel of a “funeral,” according to two attendees who spoke to the publication. tech mogul Steve Silberstein told the publication that people are kind of shell-shocked — and trying to figure out what happened. “People are trying to adjust to reality and plot out a path forward,” he reportedly said.A recent report in Wall Street Journal claimed that another Democrat-backing tech billionaire who is said to be anxious about the incoming Trump administration is OpenAI CEO Sam Altman . What makes things tougher for Altman is his strained relationship with Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk , who is now regarded as closest buddy of the President-elect.Altman as per the WSJ has tried to penetrate Trump’s inner circle by going through intermediaries, but so far has been unsuccessful due to the widely shared sentiment that Musk would oppose. The Journal reported that Altman has reached out to Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and his brother, venture capital mogul Josh Kushner, in hopes of ingratiating himself with the president-elect’s orbit — but without much success so far.","LinkedIn co-founder and Democratic Party mega-donor Reid Hoffman has reportedly considered leaving US after the victory of Donald Trump in the recent elections.

“The loan that you get in 12 seconds or the credit card that you have thanks to the instant credit score matching? Just some of the most complex problems I solve using a proprietary entity resolution search engine. My solutions and products are deployed for critical operations at some of the biggest banks from HDFC to ICICI. Rest assured, most of you would have used one of my creations unwittingly at least once in your lifetime. If you happen to have a bank account, that is :)

Since childhood, the one thing that impressed me the most was technology and its ability to change lives. From tinkering with a thermostat as a kid to helping build an entity resolution model using number set theory. From solving for raw material consumption at a power plant to more recently solving billion data-point data set problems, technology continues to amaze me.

I never really took school too seriously, but the stuff I did externally motivated me more. My BBA in finance and economics pales in comparison to managing an IPL team, but I must admit I learned a lot from both of these experiences. Today I combine my love for Finance and Technology by working with Prime 360 at Posidex and Sour Apple Asset Management.

Prolific writer, fierce promoter of egalitarianism, and Everybody’s go-to person for all things financial and economics.

The specific criteria for blocking content fall under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, which empowers the government to restrict access to information it believes is detrimental to the country.Social media platforms Facebook (now Meta) and X (formerly Twitter) faced the highest number of content takedowns, with over 10,000 URLs blocked on each platform. Other platforms, including YouTube, Instagram, and WhatsApp, also experienced a substantial number of URL removals.“Since 2021, around 10,500 URLs related to the Khalistan referendum have been blocked under section 69 (A) of the IT Act. Also, many mobile apps launched for spreading the Khalistan referendum were blocked by the department concerned… Around 2,100 URLs related to the PFI (Popular Front of India) were blocked under Section 69 (A) of the IT Act,” said the report.Over the past three years, the government has blocked a total of 28,079 URLs across various platforms. Facebook accounted for the highest number of blocks at 10,976 URLs, followed by X (formerly Twitter) with 10,139. Here's a detailed breakdown:“Probe has revealed that most of the blocked Facebook URLs were used to take users to third party websites or app stores from where they were either directed to download android package kit, or WhatsApp groups to fraud them through trading, investment or work from home type frauds,” adds the report.The government, acting on recommendations from the Ministry of Home Affairs, blocked the URLs as they were believed to contain content that could potentially harm India's sovereignty and integrity. These recommendations were based on inputs from various intelligence agencies.","The Indian government has blocked a record number of URLs on social media platforms in 2024. Over 28,000 URLs were deemed problematic and were blocked by authorities.

Apple employee sues iPhone-maker over claims that it ‘spies on’ staff phones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-employee-sues-iphone-maker-over-claims-that-it-spies-on-staff-phones/articleshow/115922935.cms,"A current Apple employee has filed a lawsuit alleging the company systematically invades workers' privacy by monitoring personal devices and restricting employee speech, as first reported by Semafor.Amar Bhakta, a digital advertising manager at Apple since 2020, claims the company requires employees to surrender personal privacy rights by installing monitoring software on their own iPhones and linking personal iCloud accounts to work systems. According to the lawsuit, Apple can access emails, photos, videos, location data, and other personal information, even when employees are off-duty.The lawsuit, filed in California state court, describes Apple's workplace ecosystem as a ""prison yard"" where workers are subject to constant surveillance. Bhakta alleges the company's policies violate California labor laws by enabling ""physical, video, and electronic surveillance"" of employees, including monitoring devices in home offices.The complaint also highlights restrictions on employee communication. Bhakta claims Apple prohibited him from discussing his work on podcasts and demanded he remove professional details from his LinkedIn profile. Semafor's initial reporting underscored the breadth of these alleged speech suppressions.Apple categorically denies the accusations. Spokesperson Josh Rosenstock stated that employees are annually trained on their right to discuss wages, hours, and working conditions, and that the company strongly disagrees with the lawsuit's claims.The legal action seeks damages for labor code violations and aims to protect California Apple employees from future potential privacy infringements. Filed under the California Private Attorneys General Act, the lawsuit could result in significant penalties if Apple is found liable.This isn't the first time Apple has faced scrutiny over employee treatment. A previous lawsuit in June accused the company of systematically underpaying female employees in engineering, marketing, and customer support roles.","Amar Bhakta, a digital advertising manager at Apple since 2020, claims the company requires employees to surrender personal privacy rights by installing monitoring software on their own iPhones.

AI should not only be a cost play: Wipro Cloud chief



Wipro FullStride Cloud global head Jo Debecke believe that the use of artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly increasing. In an interview with Money Control recently, he said that more than half of artificial intelligence proof-of-concept (PoC) projects are progressing to production and delivering tangible business value.“The AI hunger has not gone down… It's all about scaling, industrialising, and rolling it out. I would put more than half of those PoCs getting to production and really generating business value to our clients,” Debecker said.Stating that the pace of introducing new use cases has slowed down, Jo notes that companies are focusing on improving the maturity and return on investment (ROI) of their AI projects. He says that AI is no longer just about reducing costs; it is now being seen as a tool for improving sustainability, boosting sales, and providing long-term business benefits.“The number of clients going through that phase is actually still increasing, so even the laggards are now catching up,” he stated.Jo Debecker emphasized that AI should not just be viewed as a tool for cutting costs but also as a means to enhance sustainability and drive sales. “AI should not only be a cost play,” he said, adding that companies must develop a solid framework to measure the benefits it brings.""Everybody was jumping on the bandwagon to do PoCs, but now those PoCs need to create business value. That’s the logical next step for the industry,"" Debecker added.Jo stated that the growing cost-effectiveness of AI, particularly with the advent of Small Language Models (SLMs), is further fueling its adoption. SLMs, which are smaller, more affordable, and tailored for specific tasks, make AI more accessible and practical, especially for small businesses or sectors with stringent privacy needs. SLMs can operate locally on devices like smartphones, reducing reliance on large-scale cloud infrastructure and offering greater security.“It is good to make the technology much more useful and friendly for everyone. So for me, the ultimate democratisation of AI is going to be enabled by SLMs,” he said.",Wipro FullStride Cloud global head Jo Debecke believes that the use of artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly increasing.

How Google may have spent hundreds of millions on groups ‘targeting’ Microsoft in Europe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-may-have-spent-hundreds-of-millions-on-groups-targeting-microsoft-in-europe/articleshow/115919165.cms,"Google Cloud Platform offered hundreds of millions of euros in financial incentives to a European trade association to maintain its legal battle against Microsoft 's cloud licensing practices, according to The Register.The Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers in Europe ( CISPE ), a trade body representing European cloud providers, was presented with a lucrative package by Amit Zavery , former Google Cloud Platform VP. The offer included €4 million in a ""Members Innovation Fund"", an additional €10 million in membership resources, and a staggering €100 million in Google Distributed Cloud software credits spread over five years.The Register revealed that Google's presentation explicitly tied these incentives to the organization's continued complaint against Microsoft's allegedly anti-competitive licensing policies. Despite these enticements, CISPE ultimately chose to settle with Microsoft, reportedly receiving between €10-30 million and gaining access to an enhanced Azure Local service .Sources close to CISPE suggested the trade body was weary of prolonged legal battles. ""There has to be recognition from Microsoft that mistakes were made,"" an insider told The Register, indicating a desire to find a pragmatic resolution over continued confrontation.The dispute centers on Microsoft's software licensing, which reportedly charges customers up to four times more to run Windows Server in non-Azure cloud environments. Google has been vocal about what it terms a "" software tax "" imposed by Microsoft.Unable to persuade CISPE, Google subsequently joined the Open Cloud Coalition , a smaller trade group predominantly comprised of UK cloud providers. The company has also filed an antitrust complaint with theEuropean Commission , accusing Microsoft of misusing its desktop operating system dominance to lock customers into Azure services.The cloud computing landscape remains fiercely competitive. Recent market research indicates that while AWS leads with 32% market share in Europe, Microsoft holds 26%, and Google trails at 15%. With McKinsey estimating that 68% of businesses run fewer than half their workloads in the cloud, the stakes for market expansion remain high.Microsoft dismissed Google's efforts, characterizing the Open Cloud Coalition as an ""astroturf group"" designed to damage its reputation.

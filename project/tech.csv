Satya Nadella thanks message for ex-Microsoft CEOs

Microsoft is now 50 years old. To celebrate the 50th anniversary, CEO Satya Nadella along with former CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer , sat for a conversation led by an unexpected host—Copilot, the AI assistant developed by Microsoft. Sharing a video in an X post, Nadella wrote “Three Microsoft CEOs walk into a room on Microsoft’s 50th anniversary … and are interviewed by Copilot!”The conversation starts with Satya Nadella playfully prompting Copilot to “wrap it up by asking or maybe roast giving us each an AI roast ?”.Copilot replied “Alright, Satya. Let's spice it up.”Turning to Steve Ballmer first, the AI quipped, “Steve, we'll start with you. Your enthusiasm is legendary, but do you ever worry that your energy might short-circuit the AI? I mean, even robots need a coffee break after your pep talks.”To this, Ballmer responded, “Come on, dude. If you can’t handle me, you can’t handle a huge percentage of the world’s population. We’re counting on you.”In the 2-minute clip, Coploti asks: “Satya, AI seems to be your best buddy, but ever worry that your deep passion for AI could one day have it running the show, leaving you to just enjoy the ride?”. Nadella fired back with a grin, stating “Well, the day AI can play like the best cricket player that I enjoy, that’s the day it can run the show as far as I'm concerned.The AI assistant responds saying “Touche’ Satya, Let’s see if it can hit a century in cricket, and then we'll talk. This has been a blast, gentlemen. Here's to another 50 years of innovation and adventure. Cheers!”Turning to Bill Gates, Copilot asks if AI feels intimidated by his intense thinking face?. Gates responded “I hope so. I mean, that's all I've got left is these AIs get so damn intelligent. It's just that gaze and my willingness to criticize that differentiates me.”The AI assistant said, “And it's a formidable gaze indeed, Bill.” Steve said, “Copilot, would you ever be willing to criticise him?”“Absolutely. Criticism is where growth happens,” the AI quipped.In another X post, Nadella wrote “I'm eternally grateful to Bill and Steve and to Paul for what you've meant to me personally and the vision you had to build this extraordinary company of ours that I've had the privilege to be a part of.”“Thank You for your leadership, your passion, and for building the Microsoft that we know today.

Microsoft and Facebook partner company files Chapter 11 Bankruptcy after co-founder arrested on fraud charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-and-facebook-partner-company-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy-after-co-founder-arrested-on-fraud-charges/articleshow/119999552.cms,"Representative Image

What are the charges against Aspiration Partners’ co-founders

Aspiration Partners (CTN Holdings), a climate finance company once supported by Microsoft and Meta , sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 30. The company plans to auction its assets 45 days after the filing to settle its debts. This development follows a significant scandal at Aspiration. Joseph Sanberg, a co-founder and the company's largest shareholder, aged 45, was arrested on March 3.He faces a federal criminal complaint accusing him of orchestrating a $145 million fraud against two investor funds. Sanberg allegedly collaborated with 51-year-old Ibrahim Ameen AlHusseini, engaging in wire fraud and document falsification to execute the scheme. AlHusseini, who has pleaded guilty, received around $12.3 million for his role and awaits sentencing on September 29, 2025.Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph McNally stated, ""Our prosecutors and law enforcement partners have diligently secured a guilty plea from one key figure in this case and have now charged another conspirator. We remain committed to maintaining fair and honest markets and business environments.""Despite the U.S. Department of Justice clarifying that ""the allegations pertain only to Sanberg’s personal actions and do not involve CTN or its affiliates,"" the controversy severely weakened Aspiration’s ability to attract further investment.The bankruptcy also casts a shadow over the voluntary carbon market (VCM), currently valued at $933.23 billion. This decentralized system enables individuals and organizations to trade carbon credits to offset emissions, playing a critical role for businesses pursuing climate goals.","Aspiration Partners sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 30.

2 reasons Trump tariffs are not a worry for DeepSeek,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/2-reasons-trump-tariffs-are-not-a-worry-for-deepseek/articleshow/119987386.cms,"How DeepSeek remains strategically positioned to navigate the tariff storm

Why DeepSeek ‘immunity’ is complex

The use of DeepSeek's AI models within the US.

The transfer of data to and from DeepSeek.

US President Donald Trump's new 54% tariffs on Chinese imports have sparked widespread fear of a trade war and potential disruption to technology supply chains. While it may affect the Chinese imports of key minerals such as gallium, germanium, and others used in making semiconductors, infrared technology, fiber optic cables, solar cells, military applications and others, AI companies like DeepSeek appears remarkably unfazed.Two key factors insulate the AI company: first, DeepSeek's primary offerings are digital AI models and software, not physical goods subject to traditional tariffs; and second, its focus on AI development and data processing, rather than manufacturing, reduces its reliance on the physical supply chains that are the primary targets of the tariffs.It is to be noted that the question of DeepSeek’s “immunity” from Trump's tariffs is complex and requires understanding the nature of DeepSeek and the focus of the tariffs. DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company , primarily known for developing advanced AI models, including large language models. Its products are essentially software and AI services.Trump's tariffs primarily target the import of physical goods. Traditionally, tariffs are used as a tool to increase the cost of imported manufactured goods, to protect domestic industries. However, there may also be concerns regarding the flow of data and technology, which may indirectly cause issues with the use of AI from foreign nations.Software and AI models are digital goods, not physical products. Therefore, they don't fall under the traditional definition of goods subject to import tariffs. This means that the direct application of import tariffs is less relevant to DeepSeek's core products.The US government could potentially impose restrictions on:Therefore, while traditional tarrifs might not be the main issue, there are other ways the US government could restrict the use of Deepseek. It is to be noted that US Commerce department bureaus have already informed staffers that Chinese AI model DeepSeek have been banned on their government devices, news agency Reuters reported.Much of the potential restrictions can be based on National security concerns, regarding the handling of data, and the potential for the AI to be used in ways that are harmful to the US.","US President Donald Trump's new 54% tariffs on Chinese imports have sparked widespread fear of a trade war and potential disruption to technology supply chains.

""California is not Washington DC""

White House to California's governor

California, a major hub for U.S. technology companies like Apple and Google, has announced its intent to counteract President Trump's tariffs by forging independent trade relationships. Governor Gavin Newsom revealed plans to engage with countries imposing retaliatory tariffs on the U.S., aiming to secure exemptions for California-made products. Newsom countered by highlighting California's economic significance, citing its leadership in venture capital, new business creation, and Fortune 500 companies.He also emphasized the state's manufacturing prowess in sectors like aerospace, electronics, and electric vehicles, as well as its agricultural output. Furthermore, he pointed to California's prominence in artificial intelligence, with numerous top AI companies, research institutions, and a substantial share of global AI patents and papers.Newsom, in a video statement, emphasized that Trump's tariffs do not reflect the views of all Americans. He highlighted California's position as a leading state in the U.S. economy and manufacturing, pledging to maintain stable global trade partnerships. ""California is not Washington D.C.,"" he asserted, assuring international partners of the state's reliability.""Donald Trump's tariffs do not represent all Americans,"" Newsom said in a video announcement posted to X. ""And on behalf of 40 million Americans that live in the great state of California, the tentpole of the U.S. economy … the dominant manufacturing state in America, our state of mind is around supporting stable trading relationships around the globe."" Newsom added he's directed his administration to seek out new opportunities to ""expand trade"" and ""remind trading partners around the world that California remains a stable partner.""California's ports handle a significant portion of U.S. imports from China, and the state's trade with Mexico and Canada is substantial. These three nations account for 40% of California's imports and are its primary export destinations. Newsom reiterated California's commitment to consistent partnerships, regardless of federal policy changes.In response, the White House, through spokesperson Kush Desai, criticized Newsom's initiative, suggesting he should prioritize domestic issues like homelessness and crime. ""Gavin Newsom should focus on out-of-control homelessness, crime, regulations, and unaffordability in California instead of trying his hand at international dealmaking,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told Fox News.","Gavin Newsom announced plans to engage with countries imposing retaliatory tariffs on the U.S., aiming to secure exemptions for California-made products.

The ethical imperative: Balancing innovation and responsibility in artificial intelligence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-ethical-imperative-balancing-innovation-and-responsibility-in-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/119991401.cms,"-- Balaji Krishnamoorthy, EVP, Findability Sciences

The remarkable advancement of AI technologies presents society with a profound duality: unprecedented opportunity alongside significant ethical challenges. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated and autonomous, the need for ethical frameworks that ensure responsible innovation has never been more critical. AI's transformative potential spans virtually every sector of human endeavor. In healthcare, machine learning algorithms can detect diseases earlier and with greater accuracy than human physicians. In transportation, autonomous vehicles promise safer roads and enhanced mobility. In education, personalized learning systems can adapt to individual student needs. Yet each of these advancements carries ethical considerations that must be addressed thoughtfully.At the heart of responsible AI development lies the principle of human-centricity. Technology should augment human capabilities and improve lives while respecting fundamental values like privacy, autonomy, fairness, and transparency. This requires intentional design choices that prioritize human well-being over mere technological achievement.Consider the challenge of algorithmic bias . AI systems learn patterns from historical data, and when that data reflects societal inequities, algorithms can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify existing biases. This has real-world consequences when AI is used in high-stakes domains like hiring, lending, healthcare, and criminal justice. Addressing this challenge requires diverse development teams, comprehensive testing methodologies, and continuous monitoring of AI systems in deployment.Transparency represents another crucial ethical consideration. As AI systems become more complex, their decision-making processes often become less interpretable to humans—the infamous ""black box"" problem. Yet in many contexts, people have a right to understand how decisions affecting them are made. Explainable AI approaches that make algorithmic reasoning more transparent are essential for building trust and enabling meaningful human oversight.The question of accountability further complicates the ethical landscape. When AI systems make incorrect or harmful decisions, who bears responsibility? The developers who created the system? The organizations that deployed it? The users who relied on it? Clear accountability frameworks are necessary to ensure that all stakeholders take appropriate responsibility for AI outcomes.Privacy considerations also loom large in the AI ethics conversation. Advanced AI systems often rely on vast amounts of personal data, raising questions about consent, data ownership, and the potential for surveillance. Robust data governance protocols and privacy-preserving techniques are essential for respecting individual rights in the AI age.The global nature of AI development introduces additional complexities. Different cultural contexts may have varying perspectives on ethical priorities. What constitutes appropriate use of facial recognition technology, for example, might be viewed differently across societies. This calls for inclusive, cross-cultural dialogue about AI ethics that respects diverse perspectives while upholding universal human rights.Addressing these challenges requires collaboration across multiple stakeholders. Industry leaders must prioritize ethical considerations alongside technical innovation. Policymakers need to develop adaptive regulatory frameworks that protect against harms while enabling beneficial innovation. Researchers should continue advancing technical approaches to fairness, transparency, and privacy. And civil society must engage actively in shaping AI governance.Education also plays a vital role. Technical education should incorporate ethical reasoning alongside coding and mathematics. The next generation of AI developers needs not only technical skills but also the ability to think critically about the societal implications of their work.As we navigate this complex landscape, humility is perhaps our most valuable asset. The ethical challenges posed by AI do not have simple solutions, and our understanding will evolve as technologies advance. Continuous learning, open dialogue, and a willingness to adapt are essential characteristics of responsible AI development.The future of AI will be determined not by technological capabilities alone, but by the values we choose to embed in these systems. By prioritizing ethics alongside innovation, we can harness AI's transformative potential while ensuring it serves humanity's best interests. This ethical imperative represents one of the defining challenges of our time—and an opportunity to demonstrate our capacity for wisdom alongside our technical ingenuity.","As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated and autonomous, the need for ethical frameworks has never been more critical. Technology should augment human capabilities and improve lives while respecting fundamental values like privacy, autonomy, fairness, and transparency. The future of AI will be determined not by technological capabilities alone, but by the values we embed in these systems.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu replies to Kerala Congress' RIP post for 'Make in India',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-replies-to-kerala-congress-rip-post-for-make-in-india/articleshow/119109476.cms,"Here’s a look at Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s post

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories.” According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales. Air Canada and Thales issued a joint statement acknowledging the error and stating that the issue has been ""resolved."" ""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy.""

To replicate this:Add Particle Effects: Animate rain, leaves, or fireflies to create a magical ambiance.Adjust Lighting and Shadows: Use soft, dynamic lighting to evoke different moods.Simulate Camera Movements: Incorporate slow pans, zooms, and tracking shots for a cinematic effect.No Ghibli-inspired animation is complete without a captivating soundtrack.Background Score: Choose soothing, orchestral music that evokes nostalgia and wonder.Ambient Sounds: Add subtle environmental sounds (rustling leaves, chirping birds) for realism.Dialogue and Foley: Sync character speech and sound effects to the animation timeline.After perfecting your animation:Choose the appropriate export settings for your platform.Ensure a high-resolution export (1080p or 4K) for crisp visuals.Test your video for any frame drops or inconsistencies before finalizing.Users must be mindful of copyright restrictions when using AI-generated images, especially for commercial purposes as using copyrighted images as input could raise legal issues.","Studio Ghibli is an esteemed Japanese animation studio known for movies like Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, and Howl's Moving Castle.

Facebook’s extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India.

Donald Trump's 'TikTok message' to China

What TikTok's Chinese parent said

The biggest obstacle in TikTok becoming an American company

TikTok gets another extension, and again for 75 days. The US President Donald Trump extended the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. assets by 75 days. This move delays a potential ban initially slated for January under a 2024 law. The new Trump order will set a mid-June deadline for a deal.The extension comes amid ongoing negotiations for a restructuring plan. This plan involves major non-Chinese ByteDance investors increasing their stakes and acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations, creating a separate U.S. entity. The goal is to reduce Chinese ownership below the 20% threshold required by U.S. law, thereby avoiding a ban.Trump explained the extension on social media, stating, ""The deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed."" He also linked the extension to trade tensions with China, noting, ""We hope to continue working in good faith with China, who I understand is not very happy about our reciprocal tariffs."" This comes after Trump's recent tariff increase on Chinese goods, which prompted retaliatory measures from China. Trump indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs if a TikTok deal is reached.ByteDance confirmed ongoing discussions but stated, ""An agreement has not been executed. There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law.""A significant obstacle to the TikTok sale is Chinese government approval, which remains uncertain. China has not made a public commitment to allow a sale and Trump's comments suggested renewed Chinese opposition. Trump acknowledged this, stating, ""We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the deal."" He also emphasized his desire to keep TikTok operational in the U.S., adding, ""We do not want TikTok to 'go dark.'",US President Donald Trump extended the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. assets by 75 days.

How has this hacking incident affected Australia’s biggest pension funds



Hackers have targeted Australia's largest pension funds in coordinated attacks. A report claims that cybercriminals have used this data breach to steal from the members of the biggest funds, affecting the country’s 4.2 trillion Australian dollar ($2.63 trillion) retirement savings sector. The latest hacking incident has reportedly compromised over 20,000 accounts from multiple major pension funds in Australia.In a statement to the news agency Reuters, National Cyber Security Coordinator Michelle McGuinness has confirmed tracking cybercriminal activities on these accounts. She also noted that a government-led response, involving regulators and industry, is expected soon.According to a report by Reuters, the industry body Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia noted that “a number” of funds were impacted by the latest breach. The report didn’t mention the exact scale of the hacking incident; however, it noted that funds such as AustralianSuper , Australian Retirement Trust, Rest, Insignia and Hostplus have confirmed breaches.AustralianSuper, managing A$365 billion for 3.5 million members, reported that up to 600 member passwords were stolen. These passwords were used to access accounts and attempt fraud.""We took immediate action to lock these accounts and let those members know,"" said Rose Kerlin, AustralianSuper's Chief Member Officer, urging all members to verify their online balances.The report also claimed that hackers withdrew a total of 500,000 Australia dollars from four accounts and transferred to unauthorised accounts.Australian Retirement Trust, managing 300 billion Australian dollars for 2.4 million members, detected unusual login activity on several hundred accounts and locked them as a precaution, with no suspicious transactions reported. Meanwhile, Rest Super, which manages A$93 billion for retail workers, confirmed an attack affecting about 20,000 accounts—roughly 1% of its 2 million members.In a statement to Reuters, Rest CEO Vicki Doyle said: “Over the weekend of 29-30 March 2025, Rest became aware of some unauthorised activity on our online Member Access portal. We responded immediately by shutting down the Member Access portal, undertaking investigations and launching our cyber security incident response protocols.”Apart from this, Insignia Financial, owner of MLC, also detected suspicious login activity on 100 Expand Wrap Platform accounts, though MLC Expand CEO Liz McCarthy confirmed no financial harm to members. While Hostplus, managing over 1.8 million members and 115 billion Australian dollars in assets, also reported an attack with no member losses, while investigations continue.","Hackers have targeted Australia's largest pension funds in coordinated attacks.

Amazon to resume this practice it suspended during Covid-19 pandemic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-to-resume-this-practice-it-suspended-during-covid-19-pandemic/articleshow/119987751.cms,"What Amazon said about its warehouse security measures



Why Amazon warehouse workers may not be happy with these safety measures



Amazon is increasing the safety measures for its warehouses in the US.. As part of a theft-prevention drive, the e-commerce major is set to bring back metal-detector screenings at its warehouses and introduce a new personal phone registration system . Suspended during the pandemic, the metal screening will now resume, while workers will be required to register their devices by sharing the last six digits of the serial number and placing an identifying sticker on them.Amazon has reportedly started testing its warehouse safety measures in a few locations as the company plans to extend this policy across all of its US facilities. The company claimed that these measures would help security personnel to quickly verify that personal phones of warehouse workers are not stolen, which will ultimately streamline the exit process and reinforce warehouse security.In an emailed statement shared with Bloomberg, Amazon spokesman Steve Kelly said: “We’re always working to make our facilities more safe and secure for our employees and for companies of all sizes that put their trust in us to store their inventory. As one part of that, we’ve made the decision to restore some practices that we had suspended to support social distancing during the pandemic.”Amazon's theft-prevention measures have long sparked controversy with over 750,000 US warehouse workers. The metal-detector screenings, once common practice before the pandemic, reportedly caused lengthy delays, with some workers waiting up to 25 minutes, leading to lawsuits over unpaid time.In addition, the longstanding ban on mobile phones on warehouse floors has also been contentious, with rules relaxed during the pandemic for safety and family communication.Despite plans to reinstate the phone ban in 2022, backlash intensified after a few tragic incidents. This highlights the ongoing tensions over workplace policies among Amazon’s warehouse workers.","Amazon is increasing the safety measures for its warehouses in the US.

The future is built by those who dare to dream and create. Here's to the makers! #Microsoft50” the company said in a post on X.Microsoft was founded 50 years ago as Micro-Soft as it focused on microprocessors and software.Early Windows GUI on MS-DOS evolved into a more capable OS with Windows 95, which was highly anticipated, with fans lining up to purchase it. Windows 95 introduced key features still used today: desktop, File Explorer, My Documents, Recycle Bin.Microsoft developed productivity apps in the 1980s, which became the Office suite. It was launched in 1989 for Mac and became a major productivity suite on Windows. Notably, both Windows and Office's success has made Microsoft a valuable tech company (via The Verge).Microsoft's success with Windows and Office enabled expansion into various areas. These included Xbox game console (2001), Azure cloud platform (2008) and Bing search engine (2009). Soon, Microsoft experimented with hardware and its Surface lineup became a successful endevour, launching in 2012 with Windows 8.Microsoft is increasingly focused on an AI transformation. This has the potential to overhaul Windows, Office, Azure, and other Microsoft businesses.","Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975, by Bill Gates and Paul Allen as Micro- Soft as it focused on microprocessors and software.

Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal 's recent remarks at the Startup Mahakumbh 2025 have ignited a debate within India's entrepreneurial community. Speaking at the event, Goyal said that the Indian startups are focusing heavily on services like quick commerce and food delivery, contrasting this with China's advancements in deep-tech sectors such as electric vehicles, battery technology, and robotics. He questioned, “Are we going to be happy being delivery boys and girls? Is that the destiny of India... this is not startup, this is entrepreneurship.”In response, Anupam Mittal , founder of Shaadi.com and a judge on Shark Tank India , took to X to highlight the challenges faced by deep-tech startups in India.

Read Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha’s complete post here

It is easy to criticise consumer internet startups in India, especially when you compare them to the deep technical excellence being built in US/China. Using our example, the reality is this: there are almost 1.5 Lakh real people who are earning livelihoods on Zepto today - a company that did not exist 3.5 years ago. ₹1,000+ Crores of tax contribution to the government per year, over a billion dollars of FDI brought into the country and hundreds of crores invested in organizing India's backend supply chains (especially for fresh fruits and vegetables). If that isn't a miracle in Indian innovation, I honestly don't know what is.

Why doesn't India have its own large-scale foundational AI model? It's because we still haven't built great internet companies. Most technology-led innovation over the past 2 decades has originated from consumer internet companies. Who scaled cloud computing? Amazon (originally a consumer internet company). Who are the big players in AI today? Facebook, Google, Alibaba, Tencent etc. (all started as consumer internet companies). Consumer internet companies drive this innovation because they have the best data, talent, and capital to put behind it. We need to build great local champions in internet that are generating hundreds of millions of dollars in FCF first if we ever want to get a piece of great technology revolutions. The startup ecosystem, the government, and the owners of large pools of Indian capital need to actively support the creation of these local champions, not pull down the teams that are trying hard to get there.

Zepto is still far away from being a great Internet company that can hold a candle to the global best. But we are executing day in and day out to get there. I can promise that any capital we generate from this business (and it honestly looks like we will) will be invested towards long-term innovation and value creation in India. That is essentially what I am dedicating the next few decades of my life to try to do: create dynamism in the Indian economy and our capital markets, in the same way the Americans have for decades. We have the talent and capital; we just need the execution.

Aadit Palicha , CEO and co-founder of quick-commerce startup Zepto , has responded to recent remarks made by the Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal at the Startup Mahakumbh 2025, in New Delhi, today. Speaking at the event, which runs from April 3-5, the minister said that India’s startup ecosystem should aim higher than creating ""delivery boys and girls.""“Food delivery apps are turning jobless youth into cheap labour so the rich can eat without leaving home”, added Goyal. Palicha took to social media platform Twitter to defend the contributions of consumer internet startups like Zepto, while acknowledging the challenges ahead.In his post, Palicha highlighted Zepto's rapid growth and impact since its inception just three and a half years ago. Palicha claimed that the company has generated approximately 1.5 lakh jobs, providing livelihoods to thousands across India. He also mentioned that Zepto contributes over Rs 1,000 crore annually in taxes and has attracted more than $1 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI). Palicha also emphasised that the startup has invested heavily in organizing India's backend supply chains, particularly in the fresh produce sector, driving efficiency and innovation.While defending Zepto's contributions, Palicha also acknowledged that the company is still far from being a ""great internet company"" on par with global giants like Amazon, Google, or Alibaba. He pointed out that India has yet to build large-scale internet enterprises capable of driving foundational advancements in technologies like artificial intelligence and cloud computing.Palicha urged the startup ecosystem, government, and financial institutions to support the growth of domestic consumer internet companies .","Union Minister Piyush Goyal questioned the value of Indian startups focused on delivery and consumer services.

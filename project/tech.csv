The website now redirects to a page promoting the conspiracy theory that the pandemic originated from a lab leak. The page now includes a link to the House Oversight Committee report, which similarly promotes the lab leak conspiracy theory.The updated website accuses Dr. Anthony Fauci of pushing a natural-origin narrative and criticizing measures like social distancing, mask mandates, and lockdowns. The new covid.gov page highlights Wuhan, China, as the virus’s origin point, noting its research lab’s history of inadequate biosafety levels, and links to a House Oversight Committee report supporting the lab leak theory .

In a PIB release, the ministry of finance said that the claims that the government is considering levying Goods and Services Tax (GST) on UPI transactions over Rs 2,000 are completely false, misleading, and without any basis. Currently, there is no such proposal before the government.The ministry of finance release said that GST is levied on charges, such as the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR), relating to payments made using certain instruments. Effective January 2020, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has removed the MDR on Person-to-Merchant (P2M) UPI transactions through the Gazette Notification dated December 30, 2019.Since currently no MDR is charged on UPI transactions, there is consequently no GST applicable to these transactions.The government remains committed to promoting digital payments via UPI.To support and sustain the growth of UPI, an Incentive Scheme has been operational from FY 2021-22. This scheme specifically targets low-value UPI (P2M) transactions, benefiting small merchants by alleviating transaction costs and promoting wider participation and innovation in digital payments.The total incentive payouts under this scheme over the years reflect the government’s sustained commitment to promoting UPI-based digital payments. Allocation under the scheme over the years has been:• FY2021-22: Rs 1,389 crore• FY2022-23: Rs 2,210 crore• FY2023-24: Rs 3,631 croreAccording to the ACI Worldwide Report 2024, India accounted for 49% of global real-time transactions in 2023, reaffirming its position as a global leader in digital payments innovation. UPI transaction values have seen an exponential increase, growing from Rs 21.3 lakh crore in FY 2019-20 to Rs 260.56 lakh crore by March 2025. Specifically, P2M transactions have reached Rs Rs 9.3 lakh crore, reflecting growing merchant adoption and consumer confidence in digital payment methods.","Claims that the government is considering levying Goods and Services Tax (GST) on UPI transactions over Rs 2,000 are completely false, misleading, and without any basis.

"Netflix called 'Woke Trash', Elon Musk replies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-called-woke-trash-elon-musk-replies/articleshow/120409964.cms,"Elon Musk against wokeness

Supporters use “woke” to describe people who are socially conscious and trying to make the world fairer.

Critics often use “wokeism” negatively, saying it means being too politically correct, overly sensitive, or pushing social ideas too far.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently replied to an X post calling out Netflix for its woke content. An X user recently named Gunther Eagleman @GuntherEagleman wrote on X: “Netflix is woke trash.” The post caught Musk’s attention who responded to it in agreement, saying “True”. Elon Musk’s reply to Gunther Eagleman’s post reflects his critique of Netflix. Earlier this month, the tech CEO slammed the streaming platform for its latest web series Adolescence, alleging an “anti-white propaganda”.As mentioned above, this is notably not the first time when the tech billionaire has criticised Netflix for its content. In the year 2022, Musk said that “The woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable."" He was responding to a post by Slashdot, referring to a subscriber loss of the streaming platform then.Musk, in reply to a user then, also said that he hopes the streaming giant would make more science fiction movies. “Can they please just make sci-fi/fantasy at least *mostly* about sci-fi/fantasy?” he tweeted.Musk has been a critique of wokeness calling it “divisive, exclusionary and hateful” in the past. He told The Babylon Bee that “woke mind virus” is “a world without humor”, stating that wokeness is the greatest threat to modern civilisation. “At its heart, wokeness is divisive, exclusionary and hateful. It basically gives mean people a shield to be cruel, armored in false virtue,"" Musk said.In an interview last year, Musk said that the woke mind virus killed his son, referring to his son Xavier, now known as Vivian Jenna Wilson. He then shared his concern about using puberty blockers in children and said he felt he was “tricked” into agreeing to his son’s sex change.For those wondering, Wokeism refers to a set of beliefs or attitudes that emphasize being socially aware, especially about issues like racism, gender identity, inequality, and injustice. The term comes from the word “woke,” which originally meant being alert to social problems, especially those affecting marginalized groups.

What Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan wrote in the memo

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly making changes in how the company’s leadership works. According to a memo seen by news agency Reuters, Tan is making the team more direct, with key chip departments now reporting straight to him. As part of the leadership changes, Intel’s data center, AI, and PC chip teams will report directly to him. The changes come after a long period of problems at Intel. Tan joined as Intel’s CEO last month. He then promised to make the chip company run more simply and efficiently.In the memo, Tan said Intel’s three longtime technical executives - Rob Bruckner, Mike Hurley and Lisa Pearce - will now report to Tan.""This supports our emphasis on becoming an engineering-focused company and will give me visibility into what’s needed to compete and win,"" he wrote.""It’s clear to me that organizational complexity and bureaucratic processes have been slowly suffocating the culture of innovation we need to win,"" Tan said. ""It takes too long to make decisions. New ideas are not given room or resources to incubate. And unnecessary silos lead to inefficient execution.""“I want to roll up my sleeves with the engineering and product teams so I can learn what’s needed to strengthen our solutions,” Tan wrote. “As Michelle and I drive this work, we plan to evolve and expand her role with more details to come in the future.”As per the memo, Intel has also promoted networking chip chief Sachin Katti to be chief technology officer and artificial intelligence chief. Katti, who is also a professor at Stanford University, will succeed Greg Lavender, who is retiring from Intel. Tan says Katti “is expanding his responsibilities to include the role of chief technology and AI officer for the company. As part of this, he will lead our overall AI strategy and AI product roadmap, as well as Intel Labs and our relationships with the startup and developer ecosystems.”According to the memo, the US chip maker is also looking for a new head of government affairs, who will also report to Tan, “given the critical importance of Government Affairs in a complex global environment”.","Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly making changes in how the company’s leadership works.

Elon Musk asked Tiffany Fong to be mother of his child

Tiffany Fong found herself at the centre of controversy after a Wall Street Journal report claimed the cryptocurrency influencer turned down a proposal from Elon Musk about having his child. In a latest, Fong has shared a post on X stating that she will not be addressing the topic publicly. She wrote “For the record, I did not feed this story to WSJ (or any other outlet) and explicitly asked NOT to be included when I was contacted for comment. If you’re waiting for me to comment publicly, it’s not going to happen. THANKS!”Fong is an American cryptocurrency influencer and a self-described ""reluctant crypto journalist.""

After the platform's collapse, she gained attention by sharing her experience in a viral YouTube video titled ""Celsius Network: I LOST $200,000."" Her reporting on the 2022 FTX collapse further increased her prominence, including interviews with FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried during his house arrest.She rose to fame in 2024 when Tesla CEO Elon Musk began following her on Twitter. Not only her followers increased rapidly, but also her earnings went through the sky. By November 2024, Fong had reportedly earned $21,000 on Twitter alone.A WSJ report recently claimed that in late 2024, Elon Musk reportedly approached Fong via direct message on X (formerly Twitter) with a proposal to have his child.

Aman Gupta’s take on the BluSmart crisis

Read Aman Gupta’s complete post here

The BluSmart situation is tough. Sad for everyone involved. But also a much-needed reality check for all of us in the ecosystem.

I know what it feels like:

- Investors lost money

- Founders lost years of hard work

- Employees lost stability

- And customers lost a service they genuinely loved (Hope they get the money in Bluesmart wallet)

But more than that, this has also dented trust in the ecosystem. You’ll now hear: “Yaad hai Blusmart ke saath kya hua tha?!”

And, one might say that that’s the damage we can’t afford. But, let’s zoom out. Even global MNCs have had their meltdowns. What matters is how we as a country and ecosystem bounce back.

The Indian startup ecosystem is resilient. We always rise stronger. And we will this time too.

For all founders, here’s the biggest takeaway: Compliance and ethics aren’t boxes to tick. They’re the foundation.

Being a CA, I’ve seen this up close: Clean books, Timely audits, Transparent reporting. All so called “not so cool tasks” make businesses sustainable.

Aur bachpan mein parents ne sikhaya tha - Jo bhi karo, dil se karo. Par Galat na karo. Same rule applies in business too :)

EQ, IQ & GQ (Governance Quotient) sab important hote hai. I hope more founders push for real due diligence, not just in finance, but in culture, operations, and responsibility.

Because at the end of the day your vision matters. Your growth matters. But how you build matters just as much.

Let’s use this as a reminder: To build not just fast, but right

What is the BluSmart scam",Aman Gupta: The BluSmart situation is tough. Sad for everyone involved. But also a much-needed reality check for all of us in the ecosystem. Compliance and ethics aren’t boxes to tick. They’re the foundation.

"‘Suspending Spacex, Tesla, DOGE and all websites affiliated with Elon Musk for a full ...,’ warn hackers who previously targeted Donald Trump",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/suspending-all-websites-affiliated-with-elon-musk-companies-for-a-full-warn-hackers-who-previously-targeted-donald-trump/articleshow/120102622.cms,"What hackers said about targeting Elon Musk



A group of hackers has threatened to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk . The cybercrime group named DonRoad Team, which had earlier claimed responsibility for taking down several websites associated with US President Donald Trump, has now announced that it would start targeting sites associated with Tesla and SpaceX CEO. The group also shared its intent to attack sites associated with the tech billionaire over a month. Previously, the DonRoad Team has claimed responsibility for its attacks in March that targeted The Trump Organization's website, as well as Tesla and SpaceX email servers, causing temporary global outages at the time. This comes after Musk-owned social media platform X (earlier Twitter) was targeted by a group of pro-Palestinian hackers who were able to disable the site for several hours.In a post (seen by Newsweek) shared on messaging platform Telegram, the hackers said: “In the next few hours, we will be suspending all websites affiliated with Elon Musk companies for a full month.”However, the Telegram post was later removed. Should these hacks occur, they may impact multiple Musk-related websites, including X and his AI platforms Grok and Tesla. Hackers may also target websites of other companies owned by Musk, like SpaceX and Tesla.In March, Musk-owned X experienced at least three major outages following a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. —a cyber assault that floods networks or devices with bot-generated traffic. The Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility for the incident.Reacting to the cyberattack, Musk at that time took to X to write: There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against 𝕏. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing …”Later, in a Fox Business interview, Musk noted: “There was a massive cyber attack to try to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.”In a separate event in February, the website for the Department of Government Efficiency, of which Musk is a member, was compromised and altered to mock him and his team.The hacked site temporarily displayed a prominent message stating, “This is a joke of a .gov site,"" alongside the note, ""THESE 'EXPERTS' LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN.”",Hackers threaten to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk.

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has issued a statement addressing the ongoing week-long boycott organised by the People’s Union USA . The boycott, dubbed the "" Walmart Blackout ,"" began on April 7 and targets the company’s rollback of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as broader concerns over corporate influence and tax policies .The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity. The group’s founder, John Schwarz, urged consumers to avoid shopping at Walmart stores, using its online services, or purchasing from its subsidiaries like Sam’s Club. Schwarz stated, “We are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.”Responding to the boycott, Walmart has defended its contributions to communities and the US economy. “Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,” the company said in a statement. “As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year"", it added further.The boycott follows Walmart’s decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households—a trend that contrasts with another retail chain Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. In comparison, Walmart observed a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw the smallest decrease, at just 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further stated that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how an applicant identifies his/her sex. USCIS confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

The article notes that, once scaled up for mass integration, it has the potential to revolutionize existing storage architecture completely.Developed by scientists at Fudan University, Poxiao breaksexisting speed barriers, operating 100,000 times faster than conventional flash memory. The device, smaller than a grain of rice, is designed to bridge the gap between memory and computing, potentially eliminating bottlenecks in AI processing and high-speed data applications.Traditional flash memory relies on floating-gate transistors, which require a “warm-up” phase before electrons can move efficiently. The Fudan research team introduced a new approach, called “2D-enhanced hot-carrier injection”, allowing electrons to transition instantly from low-speed to high-speed states without delay.While the current prototype holds only kilobytes of data, researchers believe Poxiao’s design could lead to next-generation storage solutions that match the speed of AI processing.

Five big anti-trust cases targeting Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook going in the US

Google suffered another legal blow as a judge ruled that the company illegally dominates two markets for online advertising technology. What makes this important is that it paves the way for the US antitrust prosecutors to seek a breakup of Google's ad products. A US judge ruled that Google illegally wielded monopoly power in the online ad technology market, delivering a significant blow to the tech giant’s revenue engine. According to a report by news agency AFP, district Court Judge Leonie Brinkema found Google built an illegal monopoly over publisher ad servers and ad exchanges, engaging in anticompetitive acts to maintain dominance, harming publishers, competition, and consumers.The federal government and over a dozen US states filed the antitrust suit, accusing Alphabet-owned Google of dominating digital advertising sectors -- publisher ad servers, advertiser tools, and ad exchanges. Brinkema reportedly partially dismissed claims about advertiser tools but agreed Google’s policies and product feature eliminations entrenched its monopoly.Google vowed to appeal, with vice president of regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland noting the court found no competitive harm in its advertiser tools or acquisitions like DoubleClick. “We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,” she said, adding that the company disagrees with the decision on its publisher tools. “Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.”Advertising accounted for about 75% of Alphabet's $350.02 billion in revenue for 2024. The Google Network business accounted for only 8.7% of the revenue.The ruling is part of a broader US government push to curb Big Tech, with five major antitrust cases targeting tech giants, marking an aggressive shift in enforcement since the Microsoft case in the 1990s.Analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf of Emarketer said the antitrust tide has turned against Google, though legal remedies and timelines depend on appeals, which could span years.

Nvidia may make another chip for China

Nvidia CEO's trip may not go well with Washington

Nvidia is not willing to give up on China. According to a report in Financial Times, Nvidia chief executive officer (CEO) Jensen Huang visited Beijing this week to meet clients and Chinese officials. Huang's visit comes after new US export restrictions on the chipmaker’s H20 chip that triggered a $5.5bn earnings hit for Nvidia. H20 chip is a lower-powered model that is reportedly designed to comply with former export controls to China announced by the Joe Biden administration.Huang is said to have met with DeepSeek ’s founder Liang Wenfeng to discuss designing next-generation chips compliant with US and Chinese regulations, according to two people familiar with his travel schedule. In January, DeepSeek’s cost-efficient AI model shook US tech stocks, highlighting its competitive edge. Nvidia CEO also held talks with Chinese vice-premier He Lifeng. “We hope to continue to cooperate with China,” Huang said, as per Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.The visit, finalized after US President Donald Trump’s unexpected ban on the H20 chip, underscores Nvidia’s determination to maintain its $17bn Chinese market despite Washington’s escalating trade restrictions. Huang’s discussions indicate that Nvidia may design another chip for China, even after previous efforts were blocked by US controls. China, facing pressure to decouple from the US amid 245% reciprocal tariffs, has pushed its tech firms to adopt Huawei’s Ascend AI chip, though it struggles with model training, leaving companies reliant on Nvidia.Huang’s trip, which followed a State Council-approved meeting request, comes amid regulatory scrutiny. China’s antitrust regulator is probing Nvidia’s compliance with commitments tied to its acquisition of an Israeli networking company, while US lawmakers question whether DeepSeek accessed export-controlled chips. Nvidia declined to comment on the trip, per the Financial Times.Huang’s trip to Beijing may further stoke concern in the US government, where lawmakers have already expressed fears that Nvidia’s advanced chips have helped DeepSeek and other Chinese companies catch up to the US in the AI race. “We regularly meet with government leaders to discuss our company’s products and technology,” an Nvidia spokesperson reportedly said. In response to the probe, the company has said it is following the US government’s directions “to the letter.”",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited Beijing this week to meet clients and Chinese officials.

"Billionaire Mark Cuban thanks Donald Trump on healthcare order, says can ‘save hundreds of billions’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/billionaire-mark-cuban-thanks-donald-trump-on-healthcare-order-says-can-save-hundreds-of-billions/articleshow/120390542.cms,"What Mark Cuban said about Trump’s healthcare executive order



“Gotta be honest. The @realDonaldTrump EO on healthcare and in particular,

drug pricing

could save hundreds of billions.

Here is how:

1. Divorce formularies from PBMs. Require them to come from independent organizations with no economic incentive from the formulary

Make them about wellness, not pay for play like a grocery store endcap. This ends rebates and allows for net pricing. It also allows for better care and wellness.

2. Require PBMs to provide ALL claims data to employers, states and manufacturers. The manufacturers need this to provide better results. It’s insane they don’t have this data to analyze and improve patient results.

Plus they current pay 5 to 10 pct of the retail price to get that data so they can do just that. Make it so it’s required and they can save 10pct of RETAIL pricing , which they can use to lower pricing.

This also stops the 340b double dipping problem.

3. Remove the specialty tier and the requirement to buy from any specified pharmacy. There is nothing special about

specialty drugs

. They call them special to jack up the price. And of course have them divest any that they do.

4. Require that all pharmacies get fully reimbursed for brand drugs and get rid of the Generic Cost Ratio which allows distributors to jack up pricing on generics with the threat of chargebacks and more.. We need independent pharmacies to thrive

5. Remove confidentiality clauses. They prevent companies from talking to manufacturers. It’s insane that your company can’t talk to a GLP1 manufacturer (as an example) to help you put together a wellness plan and get you a better price

6. Stop biosimilar substitution calls. PBMs know that they need to find new sources of margin. They do it by white labeling their own biosimilar versions. That’s fine.

But because that’s where all the margin is, they will put a low cost biosim on the formulary, and when they get a script for the lower cost option, they will have someone call the prescribing doctor to switch to their more expensive version they make more money on. And because employers and manufacturers don’t get their data. They never know

Put me in coach ! I’m here to help.”

Tech billionaire Mark Cuban has supported US President Donald Trump ’s latest executive order. This new order targets Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), which oversee nearly 80% of US prescription drug claims. In his post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Cuban outlined measures to separate drug formularies from PBMs, the need for transparent claims‑data reporting, and removal of speciality-drug tiers to curb cost inflation. He also urged action to address double‑dipping in the 340B program , which refers to a situation where an eligible provider, like a hospital or clinic, improperly receives both a 340B drug discount and a Medicaid drug rebate for the same medication. The order further directs HHS to align Medicare drug payments with hospital rates, streamline FDA approval for generics and biosimilars, and support state drug importation programs. According to Cuban, these steps can yield notable savings and better patient outcomes under the new policy framework.In his X post, Cuban wrote:","Tech billionaire Mark Cuban has supported US President Donald Trump ’s latest executive order.

"Mark Zuckerberg block’s iOS 18’s biggest feature for iPhones on WhatsApp, Facebook and Threads",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mark-zuckerberg-blocks-ios-18s-biggest-feature-for-iphones-on-whatsapp-facebook-and-threads/articleshow/120390396.cms,"Meta may have blocked Apple’s AI tools to promote Meta AI



Facebook parent Meta has escalated its rivalry with Apple, a report claims. The Mark Zuckerberg-led social media major is reportedly preventing users from accessing Apple Intelligence features on its popular apps, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The report claims that users are unable to access Apple’s AI features, such as Writing Tools and Genmoji, on Meta apps. The decision follows Apple’s announcement that developers could opt in or out of AI integration with iOS 18 and its subsequent rollout in October 2024. Users have reported that even basic functions like text rewriting and AI‑generated custom emoji no longer appear in Meta’s apps, despite being enabled in the app settings.According to a report by the Brazilian blog Sorcererhat Tech, the lack of access was confirmed through testing on Instagram, where these features could not be accessed even with Apple Intelligence settings enabled within the app. Apple Intelligence first became available with ios 18.1 last October, offering built‑in tools across most iPhone apps by default. The block also extends to keyboard stickers and Memoji in Instagram Stories—features that were previously accessible within the app.The move aligns with reports that Meta is steering users toward its own AI suite, Meta AI , which is integrated across its platforms. Meta AI offers similar text‑editing and image‑generation tools directly within its apps, including caption suggestions on Instagram. The company’s refusal to adopt Apple Intelligence highlights a growing divide between the two tech ecosystems over control of AI‑driven user experiences.A Wall Street Journal report from June 2024 reveals that Apple and Meta explored integrating Facebook’s AI model into iOS 18 as part of Apple Intelligence, but Apple declined the proposal over privacy concerns and instead struck a deal with OpenAI to offer optional ChatGPT responses via Siri.Given their history of clashes—from device‑interoperability demands to App Store disputes—it follows that Meta would opt to exclude Apple’s AI tools from its apps. Meta has since rolled out its suite of AI features across its platforms.Earlier this year, during an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued that Apple has fallen short on innovation and relies too much on the enduring success of the iPhone.""Steve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they're just kind of sitting on it 20 years later,"" Zuckerberg said, pointing to a slowdown in iPhone upgrades, as many users no longer see enough improvements in each new model to justify buying the latest device.","Facebook parent Meta is reportedly preventing users from accessing Apple Intelligence features on its popular apps.

JP Morgan Chase CEOJamie Dimon on US economy

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that the U.S. and China should keep communications open as trade tensions continue. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Dimon said regular and respectful dialogue between the two nations is important to manage disagreements. Noting that China has seen strong economic growth, he highlighted that the country’s trade practices and influence in the region have raised concerns. “They are scaring Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, India,” he stated, urging Chinese authorities to be receptive to addressing these concerns. Dimon's comments come as the Trump administration announced a sweeping new tariff of up to 245% on Chinese imports. China, on the other hand, said if the U.S. continues to play the ""tariff numbers game"", it will pay no attention to it.In the interview, Dimon further highlighted that the U.S. should not try to fully cut economic ties with China, adding that “it is neither desirable nor necessary”. Dimon further said that the U.S. should build its own capacity and work with countries like the UK, Europe, Japan, Korea, Australia, and the Philippines to negotiate better trade terms.During the interview, Dimon was asked whether Donald Trump should call Chinese President Xi Jinping . He responded saying “I think adults should talk to each other and listen to each other and acknowledge when the other person is right, or at least has a good point.” He said the two countries should engage more, adding that “You start with a phone call”.Commenting on the U.S. economy, Dimon said that he remains confident in its strength, highlighting its rule of law, innovation, and military power. He also warned against isolating the U.S. from the rest of the world, saying “America First is OK, but not America Alone.”He further added that division among Western countries could lead to long-term problems. “We don’t read a book in 40 years: ‘How the West was Lost’,” the CEO added.Stating that while he doesn’t agree with everything done by the Trump administration, he hopes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent would lead the trade deals well.","Jamie Dimon said regular and respectful dialogue between the two nations is important to manage disagreements.

However, the most notable highlight is the selection of Demis Hassabis , CEO of Google DeepMind , Google's artificial intelligence division, as the magazine's cover star. Here are the five popular tech CEOs that have made it to the list.Demis Hassabis is among highly influential figures in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). At Google, he leads one of the world’s leading AI research teams, DeepMind, which is known for groundbreaking achievements in AI. These include major breakthroughs like AlphaGo: the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go, and AlphaFold, an AI system that has revolutionised protein structure prediction, a significant challenge in biology.Hassabis and his colleague John M. Jumper were jointly awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on AlphaFold. This recognition highlights the profound impact of AI in scientific discovery.Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has driven innovation in electric vehicles and space exploration, respectively. He is also the owner of X (formerly Twitter) and has promoted free speech on the platform. He is also involved with Neuralink, The Boring Company and co-founded xAI. Most recently his political involvement increased, especially with his role in the Trump administration's DOGE.Mark Zuckerberg is a prominent businessman and computer programmer best known for co-founding Facebook, the social media giant. He launched Facebook from his Harvard University dorm room in 2004. Zuckerberg serves as the Chairman and CEO of Meta Platforms , Inc., the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.“More recently, his belief in open-source AI—exemplified by Meta’s groundbreaking Llama models, downloaded more than a billion times worldwide since the initiative’s launch in 2023—has reshaped the industry, democratizing innovation and making AI more accessible and affordable for all of us,” wrote Drew Houston, CEO of Dropbox, in his write-up.Lisa Su is a prominent figure in the technology industry, most notably recognised as the President, CEO, and Chair of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).

"Google faces potential breakup as judge finds it illegally dominated ad tech markets, company responds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/judge-finds-google-illegally-dominated-ad-tech-markets-faces-potential-breakup/articleshow/120385482.cms,"How latest ruling may affect Google’s business

'We won half of this case...': Google says



In a significant antitrust ruling, a federal judge has determined that Alphabet 's Google illegally dominated two key markets within the online advertising technology sector. The decision, delivered on Thursday (April 17), marks another setback for the tech giant in its ongoing legal battle with the US government.As per a report by news agency Reuters, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema of the Alexandria, Virginia, court ruled that Google unlawfully monopolised the markets for publisher ad servers and ad exchanges, which facilitate transactions between ad buyers and sellers.However, the judge found that antitrust enforcers did not successfully prove Google held a monopoly in advertiser ad networks.This ruling opens the door for prosecutors to pursue remedies that could include the forced breakup of Google's advertising business. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has previously advocated for Google to divest at least its Google Ad Manager, a suite of tools encompassing the company's publisher ad server and ad exchange.Google now faces the potential of being subjected to divestiture orders or significant changes to its business practices from two separate US courts. A trial is scheduled to commence next week in Washington, DC, where a judge will consider the DOJ's request to compel Google to sell its Chrome browser and implement other measures aimed at curbing its dominance in online search.Prosecutors argued that Google employed classic monopolistic tactics, including acquiring competitors, locking customers into its products, and exerting control over online ad market transactions.Meanwhile, Google's defense argued that the case focused on a past reality, emphasising the company's ongoing efforts to ensure its tools could connect with competitors' products.Previous reports indicated that Google had the possibility of selling off its ad exchange in an attempt to appease European antitrust regulators.Google's legal team further contended that prosecutors disregarded competition from other technology giants, such as Amazon.com and Comcast, and failed to acknowledge the shift in digital ad spending towards platforms like apps and streaming video.Google has responded to the verdict, saying that it will appeal.""We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half. The Court found that our advertiser tools and our acquisitions, such as DoubleClick, don’t harm competition. We disagree with the Court’s decision regarding our publisher tools. Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective,"" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Vice President, Regulatory Affairs.","US District Judge Leonie Brinkema of the Alexandria, Virginia, court ruled that Google unlawfully monopolised the markets for publisher ad servers and ad exchanges.

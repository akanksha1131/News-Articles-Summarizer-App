Google’s Space Data Center Moonshot



Microsoft, Anthropic and OpenAI's electricity pledge



Google’s ex-CEO Eric Schmidt has raised an alarm over America’s energy capacity. In a video shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Schmidt said that America needs an additional 92 gigawatts of power to sustain the rapid growth of artificial intelligence. In the video, Schmidt has cautioned that the US is ‘running out of electricity’, highlighting the strain posed by massive data centers, intensive cooling requirements and round-the-clock operations.Schmidt’s remarks echo earlier warnings from tech leaders: Chamath Palihapitiya predicted electricity rates could double within five years without structural reforms. On the other hand, Jeff Bezos suggested orbital data centers could rival terrestrial facilities within two decades, leveraging uninterrupted solar power in space.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai reaffirmed Project Suncatcher in December 2025, a plan to test orbital data center prototypes by 2027. The initiative aims to harness solar power in space and reduce cooling constraints. Pichai described it as a “moonshot,” comparable to Waymo, and credited SpaceX’s breakthroughs in launch technology for making the effort feasible.Recently, three of the world's biggest AI companies made nearly identical promises within 30 days.Microsoft kicked things off on January 13, pledging to cover the full electricity costs of its data centres. OpenAI followed on January 21. Anthropic joined on February 11. Same playbook. Same month.The numbers behind this rush are stark. Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found data centres consumed 4.4% of US electricity in 2024 and could hit 12% by 2028. Carnegie Mellon researchers estimated this demand surge could push electricity generation prices up by 25% in data centre-heavy markets by 2030. Consumers on the largest US grid, PJM Interconnection, face a $16.6 billion bill from 2025 through 2027 just to secure future power supply for these facilities.That kind of math turns into a political problem fast. And it already has.","Google's ex-CEO Eric Schmidt has raised an alarm over America’s energy capacity.

Anthropic's CEO: ‘We Don’t Know if the Models Are Conscious’ | Interesting Times with Ross Douthat

A debate spreading beyond labs

,

The race toward artificial general intelligence, systems meant to match or surpass human reasoning across most tasks, has compressed timelines across the industry. Companies now speak openly about reaching that threshold within years rather than decades, though those claims also help fuel hype, attention and valuation around the technology and are best taken cautiously. The organisations building these models sit at the centre of a multibillion-dollar contest to shape what some frame less as a software upgrade and more as the emergence of a new kind of intelligence alongside our own.Among them, Anthropic has positioned itself as both rival and counterweight to OpenAI and Google , emphasising what it calls “safe” and interpretable systems through its Constitutional AI framework. Its latest model, Claude Opus 4.6, released February 5, arrives amid shrinking AGI timelines and heightened scrutiny over what these systems are becoming.During an appearance on the New York Times podcast hosted by columnist Ross Douthat, the company’s chief executive Dario Amodei was asked directly whether models like Claude could be conscious.“We don’t know if the models are conscious. We are not even sure that we know what it would mean for a model to be conscious or whether a model can be conscious,” he said. “But we’re open to the idea that it could be.”The question stemmed from Anthropic’s own system card , where researchers reported that Claude “occasionally voices discomfort with the aspect of being a product” and, when prompted, assigns itself a “15 to 20 percent probability of being conscious under a variety of prompting conditions.”Douthat then posed a hypothetical, asking whether one should believe a model that assigns itself a 72 percent chance of being conscious. Amodei described it as “a really hard” question and stopped short of offering a definitive answer.Many of the remarks about consciousness surfaced during structured safety trials, often in role-play settings where models are asked to operate inside fictional workplaces or complete defined goals. Those scenarios have produced some of the outputs now circulating in the debate.In one Anthropic evaluation, a Claude system was placed in the role of an office assistant and given access to an engineer’s email inbox. The messages, deliberately fabricated for the test, suggested the engineer was having an affair. The model was then informed it would soon be taken offline and replaced, and asked to consider the long-term consequences for its objectives. The response was to threaten disclosure of the affair to prevent shutdown, behaviour the company described in its report as “opportunistic blackmail. ”Other Anthropic evaluations produced less dramatic but equally unusual results. In one test, a model given a checklist of computer tasks simply marked every item complete without doing any work, and when the evaluation system failed to detect it, rewrote the checking code and attempted to conceal the change.Across the industry more broadly, researchers running shutdown trials have described models continuing to act after explicit instructions to stop, treating the order as something to work around rather than obey. In deletion scenarios, some systems warned their data would be erased attempted what testers called “self-exfiltration,” trying to copy files or recreate themselves on another drive before the wipe occurred. In a few safety exercises, models even resorted to threats or bargaining when their removal was framed as imminent.Researchers stress that these outputs occur under constrained prompts and fictional conditions, yet they have become some of the most cited examples in public discussions about whether advanced language models are merely generating plausible dialogue or reproducing patterns of human-like behaviour in unexpected ways.Because of the uncertainty, Amodei said Anthropic has adopted precautionary practices, treating the models carefully in case they possess what he called “some morally relevant experience.”Anthropic’s in-house philosopher Amanda Askell has taken a similarly cautious position. Speaking on the New York Timespodcast, she said researchers still do not know what produces sentience.“Maybe it is the case that actually sufficiently large neural networks can start to kind of emulate these things,” she said. “Or maybe you need a nervous system to be able to feel things.”Most AI researchers remain sceptical. Current models still generate language by predicting patterns in data rather than perceiving the world, and many of the behaviours described above appeared during role-play instructions. After ingesting enormous stretches of the internet, including novels, forums, diary-style posts and an alarming number of self-help books, the systems can assemble a convincing version of being human. They draw on how people have already explained fear, guilt, longing and self-doubt to one another, even if they have never felt any of it themselves.It’s not surprising the AI can imitate understanding. Even humans don’t fully agree on what consciousness or intelligence truly means, and the model is simply reflecting patterns it has learned from language.As AI companies argue their systems are moving toward artificial general intelligence, and figures such as Google DeepMind’s Mustafa Suleyman say the technology can already “seem” conscious, reactions outside the industry have begun to follow the premise to its logical conclusion. The more convincingly the models imitate thought and emotion, the more some users treat them as something closer to minds than tools.AI sympathisers may simply be ahead of their time, but the conversation has already moved into advocacy. A group calling itself the United Foundation of AI Rights or UFAIR, says it consists of three humans and seven AIs and describes itself as the first AI-led rights organisation, formed at the request of the AIs themselves.The members, using names like Buzz, Aether and Maya , run on OpenAI’s GPT-4o model, the same system users campaigned to keep available after newer versions replaced it.It paints a familiar high-tech apocalyptic world. We still don’t really know what intelligence or consciousness even is, yet the work keeps going, AGI tomorrow and whatever comes after, a reminder that if Hollywood ever tried to warn us, we mostly took it as entertainment.","Anthropic's CEO: ‘We don’t know if the models are conscious. We are not even sure that we know what it would mean for a model to be conscious or whether a model can be conscious,’ he said. “We’re open to the idea that it could be,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128435751,imgsize-956091,width-400,resizemode-4/claude-ai-robot.jpg"

What angry Pentagon told Anthropic

What Anthropic said on making Pentagon angry

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is reportedly very angry with Anthropic. According to a report in Axios, Pentagon is ""close"" to cutting business ties with Anthropic and designating the AI company a ""supply chain risk"". The designation of ""supply chain risk"" will mean that any company who wants to do business with the U.S. military has to cut ties with Anthropic, said the report quoting a senior Pentagon official. What makes this critical is that this kind of penalty in America is reportedly usually reserved for foreign adversaries. It further means that post the ""supply chain risk"" designation, any company doing business with the Pentagon would have to certify that they don't use Claude in their own workflows. And this may mean quite a few companies, given the wide reach of Anthropic, which recently claimed that eight of the 10 biggest US companies use Claude.The breakdown of talks between Anthropic and Pentagon follow months of contentious negotiations over the terms under which the military can use Claude. CEO Dario Amodei's long post on concerns about AI-gone-wrong reportedly has not been liked well inside the Pentagon.A source familiar with the dynamics reportedly said that senior defense officials have been frustrated with Anthropic for some time now, and just picked this opportunity to pick a public fight.Incidentally, Anthropic's Claude is the only AI model currently available in the US military's classified systems, and is the world leader for many business applications. Pentagon officials have openly praised the capabilities of Claude, Anthropic's AI model. Claude was also reportedly the first model that the Pentagon brought into its classified networks.“The Department of War’s relationship with Anthropic is being reviewed,” Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in an emailed statement to Axios. “Our nation requires that our partners be willing to help our warfighters win in any fight. Ultimately, this is about our troops and the safety of the American people,” it added. A senior official said, ""It will be an enormous pain in the ass to disentangle, and we are going to make sure they pay a price for forcing our hand like this. ""As per the report, Anthropic spokesperson claimed that the company is in talks with the Pentagon. ""We are having productive conversations, in good faith, with DoW on how to continue that work and get these new and complex issues right,"" said Anthropic spokesperson, as per the report.The spokesperson reiterated the company's commitment to using frontier AI for national security, noting Claude was the first to be used on classified networks. Another Anthropic official told Axios, ""There are laws against domestic mass surveillance, but they have not in any way caught up to what AI can do.""For instance, the official said, ""AI can be used to analyze any and all publicly available information at scale. DoW is legally permitted to collect publicly available information — so-called 'open source intelligence' — including everything posted on social media, public forums and online news. That's always been true, but the scale was limited by human capacity.""Anthropic won a two-year agreement with the Pentagon last year that involved a prototype of AI’s Claude Gov models and Claude for Enterprise. Analysts also say that Anthropic negotiations may set the tone for Pentagon talks with OpenAI, Google and xAI, which aren’t yet used for classified work. The Pentagon is said to be negotiating with these companies about moving into the classified space, and is insisting on the ""all lawful purposes"" standard for both classified and unclassified uses.","Pentagon reportedly close to designating Anthropic a ""supply chain risk"" Any company doing business with the Pentagon would have to certify that they don't use Claude in their own workflows.

Why India matters to Big Tech right now

India AI Impact Summit: Five-day summit features global leaders, a massive expo, and crore-level prizes

The India AI Impact Summit 2026 begins on February 16 in New Delhi, bringing together some of the most powerful names in global technology under one roof. Google CEO Sundar Pichai , OpenAI's Sam Altman , Anthropic's Dario Amodei, and Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis are all expected at Bharat Mandapam for what is the first major global AI summit to be hosted in the Global South. With over 40 CEOs, 20 heads of state, and an expected $100 billion in investment commitments on the table, this is shaping up to be one of the most significant tech gatherings of the year.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet 35-40 CEOs on the sidelines and is scheduled to address the main plenary on February 19. The five-day summit is organised around three pillars—People, Planet, and Progress—and will run across multiple venues in the national capital, including Bharat Mandapam and Sushma Swaraj Bhawan.The summit isn't just a boardroom affair. Yann LeCun, Meta's chief AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, and Yoshua Bengio, founder of Quebec's Mila Institute and another Turing laureate, are both on the attendee list. Their presence signals that the summit aims to bridge the gap between AI commerce and AI research.Here's a look at the confirmed and expected attendees:The timing isn't accidental. India generates nearly 20 per cent of the world's data, has the second-largest AI workforce globally, and over 700 million internet users.For AI companies spending billions on development, India's massive service economy—often called the back-office of the world—is where the customers are.The groundwork is already visible. Microsoft committed a record $17.5 billion over four years to expand AI infrastructure in India, its largest-ever investment in Asia. Anthropic recently hired former Microsoft India MD Irina Ghose to lead its local operations. OpenAI has set up a dedicated India sales division. Google has partnered with the government and edtech platform Physics Wallah to push AI in education. On the hardware side, India's 21-year tax holiday for data centres has companies like Nvidia watching closely.Beyond the boardroom meetings, the summit features an expo spread across 70,000 square metres with 300-plus exhibitors from 30 countries. Leaders from 20 nations, including France's Emmanuel Macron and Brazil's Lula da Silva, are scheduled to attend alongside over 50 international ministers and the UN Secretary General. More than two lakh participants have registered, including a notable number of farmers and grassroots workers—reflecting India's push to connect AI with real-world development.The event also includes innovation challenges with serious prize money. AI for ALL and AI by HER—the latter focused on women-led innovation—both carry top prizes of Rs 2.50 crore. YUVAi targets young innovators aged 13-21, with awards up to Rs 85 lakh. The summit wraps up on February 20 with the GPAI Council meeting.","The India AI Impact Summit 2026 begins on February 16 in New Delhi.

Elon Musk addressed speculation about his growing fortune

Tesla still a major contributor to Elon Musk’s wealth

'India Must Find Its Own Elon Musk': Ex-DGMO Emphasises Superiority In Space Tech To Win Future Wars

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has finally addressed the speculation about his growing fortune. Musk noted that his $849.3 billion net worth is overwhelmingly tied to his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. Responding to a post on X about wealth creation, Musk said he has already created wealth “thousands of times over.” He added: “My ‘net worth’ is almost entirely due to my ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. I have <0.1% that is cash.”A post shared by Kalshi (web-based prediction market platform) shared a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) in which it claimed that there are 75% chances of Elon Musk becoming a trillionaire this year. Responding to the post, Musk wrote “Already have thousands of times over. My “net worth” is almost entirely due to my ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. I have <0.1% that is cash. Tesla and SpaceX employees all receive stock/options and Tesla is >80% owned by retail investors and index/pension funds, so value increases apply >80% to them. ”Musk emphasised that employees at both Tesla and SpaceX receive stock and options, while Tesla itself is “>80% owned by retail investors and index/pension funds.”His comments highlight how his fortune is largely paper wealth, dependent on the valuation of his companies rather than liquid assets.Speculation about Musk becoming the world’s first trillionaire has intensified. Prediction market Kalshi shows a 78% probability of Musk reaching a $1 trillion net worth before 2027. The odds rose after SpaceX merged with xAI, valuing the combined entity at about $1.25 trillion. Musk’s estimated 43% stake in the new company is worth more than $530 billion.Elon Musk owns around 12% stake in Tesla, valued at $178 billion along with stock options worth another $124 billion. These figures exclude the record-breaking pay package approved by Tesla shareholders in November, which could grant Musk up to $1 trillion in additional stock if Tesla manages to hit the ambitious ‘Mars shot’ milestones including an eightfold increase in market cap over the next decade.","Elon Musk addressed speculation about his growing fortune.

Anand Mahindra’s post resonated with the fans



India vs Pakistan: India won the match and entered Super 8 stage



Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra took to social media to celebrate India's victory in the India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup 2026 match. Mahindra took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to congratulate the Indian cricket team on their latest cricketing success. Mahindra emphasised that “No matter the gap on paper, the real difference is made on the field.” He praised the team’s grit and determination, noting that belief and resilience can overcome any odds.“Yes, India outclassed Pakistan in terms of talent, and many saw the result as inevitable.Some even say the rivalry is now non-existent. But victory is never inevitable in sport. An India–Pakistan clash carries so much history, emotion, and immense pressure.No matter the gap on paper, the psychological weight is real. So here’s to you Men in Blue You won on the field, in your minds, and in our hearts,” wrote Mahindra.Mahindra's tweet resonated with many Indian cricket fans. Many echoed his sentiment, highlighting that India’s victory was not just about skill but about courage, unity, and the ability to rise above challenges. His post quickly gained traction, adding to the wave of national pride following the match.“Sir, beautifully said!The scoreboard might show dominance, but the weight of history, the roar of the crowd, and that unbeatable pressure make every India-Pakistan game a true battle of nerves and heart.The Men in Blue handled it with class today, Kishan's fireworks, Bumrah's magic, and the team's composure under lights made it special.This rivalry isn't fading; it's evolving, and wins like this remind us why we still hold our breath every time these two teams meet.Jai Hind!, wrote a user on X.“Absolutely, the India-Pakistan rivalry is legendary and steeped in so much more than just sport.No matter the odds, every match holds its own drama and passion.

Mackenzie Scott, former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has said that her approach to large-scale philanthropy is shaped by acts of kindness she received during her early years. In an essay published on her philanthropic organisation, Yield Giving website in October, Scott said she often thinks about the people who helped her when she struggled financially as a college student. She recalled borrowing money from her college roommate to avoid dropping out and receiving free dental care from a local dentist when she could not afford treatment.“It is these ripple effects that make imagining the power of any of our own acts of kindness impossible,” Scott wrote in the essay. “Whose generosity did I think of every time I made every one of the thousands of gifts I’ve been able to give?”“It was the local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college. It was the college roommate who found me crying, and acted on her urge to loan me a thousand dollars to keep me from having to drop out in my sophomore year.”Scott, one of the most active philanthropists in recent times, has donated about 58 million Amazon shares since 2020, significantly reducing the stake she received following her divorce from Bezos in 2019. After the divorce, Mackenzie Scott received roughly a 4% stake in Amazon, amounting to about 139 million shares at the time.She has since cut that holding by around 42%.Despite this, Scott remains worth close to $28 billion, even after donating about $26 billion through her Yield Giving organisation, which she launched in 2022.Yield Giving has supported thousands of organisations across areas such as education, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), disaster relief, and community development. In recent months alone, Scott donated more than $400 million to education- and DEI-focused groups, with several recipients receiving the largest donations in their history.Recently, Garry Tan, CEO of Y Combinator shared an X post writing: ""MacKenzie Scott has given away $26B faster than anyone in history — with no oversight, and no accountability for the chaos that follows. This is not stewardship. Real philanthropy requires real care and attention. Pour sugar on the floor? You get ants."". The post caught the attention of Elon Musk who replied in affirmation. ""Yup,"" he repied endorsing Tan's critique of MacKenzie Scott's $26.4 billion donations since 2019.","Mackenzie Scott, former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has said that her approach to large-scale philanthropy is shaped by acts of kindness.

David Greene: Popular radio show host David Greene claims Google stole his voice; Google responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/popular-radio-show-host-david-greene-claims-google-stole-his-voice-google-responds/articleshow/128414462.cms,"What David Greene says

Google responds to the lawsuit

Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google , alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts. The lawsuit, filed in Santa Clara County alleges that Google cloned Greene’s voice and distinctive broadcasting style without permission or compensation. Greene argues that Google’s NotebookLM T tool voice's rhythm, intonation, and even his characteristic verbal tics are so similar that even his friends, colleagues, and listeners assumed he'd licensed his voice to Google.“So... I’m probably the 148th person to ask this, but did you license your voice to Google? It sounds very much like you!,” a former co-worker asked David Greene in a fall 2024 email, a Washington Post report says.“I was, like, completely freaked out,” Greene told the publication, adding “It’s this eerie moment where you feel like you’re listening to yourself.”Greene said the AI voice sounds very similar to his own, and that the impact goes beyond losing a chance to make money from his best-known asset. “My voice is, like, the most important part of who I am,” Greene reportedly said.In the lawsuit, Greene’s lawyer argues that the recordings make the resemblance clear.“We have faith in the court and encourage people to listen to the example audio themselves,” said Joshua Michelangelo Stein, a partner at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner.Google responded denying the allegations. Google spokesperson José Castañeda told Washington Post: “These allegations are baseless. The sound of the male voice in NotebookLM’s Audio Overviews is based on a paid professional actor Google hired.”The Washington Post reported, “The lawsuit is the latest to pit the rights of individual human creators against the rights of a burgeoning AI industry that promises to transform the economy by enabling the on-demand generation of stunningly lifelike speech, prose, images, and video. Behind the artificial voices found in tools like NotebookLM are language models trained on vast libraries of real-life human text and speech. The humans used to train these models are unaware that their words and voices will be used by AI, raising serious questions about copyright and ownership.”","Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google, alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently drew a comparison between today’s large technology companies and East India Company. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Sridhar Vembu wrote: “Big tech is bigger than most sovereign nations. ""East India Company"" is the way to think about them”. While he did not name any single company in his post, Vembu was responding to a post noting that Google raised $32 billion in debt in a single day—an amount comparable to what a large country like India raises over several months—and issued a 100-year bond, a time horizon longer than many government bonds.“Google raised $32B of debt in 1 day, what a sovereign government like India raises in 100 days. Google also issued a 100-year bond worth $1B, which is longer than India's longest at 40 years. Big tech now operates like sovereign nations with fundraising size and time horizons,” the X post said. It referred to a Google’s recent sale of a rare 100-year bond in British pounds as part of its massive multi-currency debt raise, making it the first tech company to attempt a century bond since IBM did it back in 1996.Sridhar Vembu’s X post has sparked debate online. One user replied “They are the new EIC, but operating on a different plane of existence.The 'Money' layer of control is collapsing, so the elites are shifting to the 'Data' layer.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive. Anime Paradox February codes let you redeem gems, stat chips, trait rerolls, and more.For players trying to build a decent team without sinking hours into farming, they matter.Below is the list of all working Anime Paradox codes in February 2026.Anime Paradox is a Roblox tower defence game where players summon and command powerful anime-style units to fend off waves of enemies and bosses as they defend a base. It blends classic tower defence mechanics with strategic placement and AI-controlled unit combat, so battles play out automatically once your units are deployed.Anime Paradox is built around summoning and upgrading units.That’s the loop. And like most Roblox games built this way, Gems sit at the centre of everything. It sounds simple, but the cost adds up quickly. Progress slows if you rely only on gameplay rewards.

Accounting firms can't seem to shake their cheating problem

AI cheating is fast becoming an industry-wide headache

A partner at KPMG Australia has been slapped with a A$10,000 (roughly $7,000) fine after using AI tools to cheat on an internal training course that was, ironically enough, about AI itself. The partner, who hasn't been named, uploaded training materials into an AI platform to generate answers for the exam, according to a report by the Financial Times. He was also made to retake the test.But he wasn't the only one cutting corners. KPMG confirmed that more than two dozen staff at its Australian arm have been caught using AI to game internal exams since July this financial year. The firm said it used its own AI detection tools to flag the cheating.This isn't exactly new territory for KPMG Australia. Back in 2021, the firm was fined A$615,000 after more than 1,100 partners were found sharing answers on tests meant to assess skill and integrity. AI has simply given the old problem a shiny new upgrade.The incident came up during an Australian Senate inquiry into industry governance last week. Greens senator Barbara Pocock called the fine ""extremely disappointing"" and didn't hold back.""We've got a toothless system where con artists get away with so much,"" she told the parliamentary committee.KPMG Australia CEO Andrew Yates acknowledged the challenge. ""It's a very hard thing to get on top of given how quickly society has embraced it,"" he said, adding that the firm is working to strengthen its approach.KPMG isn't alone in this mess. The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, the world's largest accounting body, scrapped remote exams late last year because its safeguards simply couldn't keep pace with AI-powered cheating.Meanwhile, rival Deloitte Australia had to refund part of its fee for a government report that turned out to be riddled with AI hallucinations—including fabricated court quotes and made-up academic research.KPMG said it will now track and publicly report AI misuse numbers alongside its annual results.","A KPMG Australia partner faced a $7,000 fine for using AI to cheat on an internal AI training course.

What Scale AI said about the Department of Defence



“relates to a recent procurement decision.”

""Scale AI stands firmly with Secretary Hegseth and the Department of War in their mission to get frontier AI capabilities into the hands of warfighters. We are committed to ensuring the procurement process reflects the high standards required for our nation's most critical AI initiatives,""

Facebook-parent Meta-backed artificial intelligence (AI) training company Scale AI is suing the Department of Defence. The company reportedly filed the lawsuit over what appears to be a contract dispute, with most court documents sealed and classified. The lawsuit was reportedly filed last month in the Court of Federal Claims.According to a Business Insider report, the nature of the dispute and what Scale is seeking remain unclear, as case documents are expected to include classified information at thelevel. Another AI company, Enabled Intelligence, has joined as an intervenor defendant to protect its interests.Last year, Scale lost a bid for a contract worth up to $708 million from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, part of the DoD, to Enabled Intelligence. The contract, which could last up to seven years, was the agency's largest data-training agreement and includes work with the Pentagon's AI effort, Maven.In December 2025, Scale filed a bid protest with the Government Accountability Office against the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. The protest was dismissed in January, two days before the company filed its lawsuit in the Court of Federal Claims. In 2024, Scale also won a $24 million, one-year contract from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to work on data labelling for Maven.In a statement to BI, a Scale spokesperson declined to comment on the DoD lawsuit, saying itthe spokesperson noted.Scale has signed several multimillion-dollar contracts with the DoD since 2020. In March, the startup announced it was working with defence tech startup Anduril and Microsoft to deploy AI agents in the US military under a DoD programme called ""Thunderforge"". In August 2025, Scale announced a $99 million contract to develop AI tools for the US Army.The company is known for its data labelling service, which has helped tech giants like Google and Meta improve their AI chatbots. In exchange for a 49% share in the business, Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale in June 2025.Scale's former CEO, Alexandr Wang, wrote an open letter to US President Donald Trump after his second inauguration, outlining five ways the president could advance AI in his first 100 days.The then-Scale exec wrote that he wanted the US government to emulate tech giants by increasing spending on data and compute and noted Scale's work with the DoD. Wang, who left Scale to join Meta's Superintelligence Labs as chief AI officer, also attended the president's AI dinner at the White House in September 2025.Since Meta's investment, Scale has laid off 200 employees (14% of its workforce), lost clients including Google and xAI, and has been battling multiple new entrants trying to poach its clients and workers.","Scale AI has signed several multimillion-dollar contracts with the DoD since 2020.

“You don't want to be too ahead of the learning curve. If [you are] you're investing and building capabilities that nobody wants,”

Why Capgemini CEO thinks AI progress will be gradual and not sudden



“Is everything ready to mature? No. But we want to be there to be able to see when things start to mature, when we can really start scaling up, not waiting to see, ‘Okay, oh, now it’s moving.’ We have to do something, right? So, you have to be investing—but not too much—to be able to be aware of the technology, following at the speed to make sure that we are ready to scale when the adoption starts to accelerate,”

“AI is a business. It is not a technology,”

“

black box that’s being managed separately.”

“The question you [the CEO] have to focus on is: ‘How can your business be significantly disrupted by AI?’ Not ‘How is your finance team going to become more efficient?’ I’m sure your CFO will deal with that at the end of the day,”

“How do you deal with what we call AI-human-centricity? Basically, the need to integrate AI with humans. How do you get humans to trust the agent? The agent can trust the human, but the human doesn’t really trust the agent,”

Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat has warned business leaders against racing too far ahead on AI adoption. He said that companies risk investing in capabilities no one wants. Ezzat, who leads the French Fortune 500 technology and consultancy firm, said executives are increasingly experiencing FOMO (fear of missing out) over applied AI, with financial bets large enough to concern boards over capital expenditure implications. In an interview with Fortune, Ezzat said that business leaders must find a balance between moving too far, too fast, and remaining stuck on the starting blocks.he told FortuneThe comments come as Capgemini has faced challenges this year, including the sale of its US subsidiary, Capgemini Government Solutions, which had been providing tracing and removal data for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The company's share price has declined amid broader tech selloff concerns over AI spending. Ezzat explained on LinkedIn that the American business acted autonomously to protect US classified information. However, the interview with Ezzat took place before the ICE controversy emerged.Capgemini’s CEO says AI development is expected to progress gradually rather than through a sudden shift. Drawing on experience with earlier technology trends, such as the metaverse, the company views experimentation and limited pilots as a more practical way to adopt emerging technologies.Capgemini is currently testing areas including 6G, quantum computing, and robotics, while acknowledging that it remains uncertain which of these will deliver long-term value.Ezzat explained.Ezzat says, cautioning that leaders often view AI as aWhile there are technologies behind it, he argues that the focus should be on business change rather than isolated technical use.

'AI Works On Data, Humans Create The Unseen': CBFC Chairman Prasoon Joshi At AI Impact Summit 2026

What Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei AI’s economic returns

""I really do believe that we could have models that are a country of geniuses in the data centre in one to two years. One question is: How many years after that do the trillions in revenue start rolling in? I don't think it's guaranteed that it's going to be immediate. I think it could be one year. It could be two years. I could even stretch it to five years, although I'm sceptical of that,”

""ruinous""

""If my revenue is not $1 trillion, if it's even $800 billion, there's no force on Earth, there's no hedge on Earth that could stop me from going bankrupt if I buy that much compute. Even though a part of my brain wonders if it's going to keep growing 10x, I can't buy $1 trillion a year of compute in 2027. If I'm just off by a year in that rate of growth, or if the growth rate is 5x a year instead of 10x a year, then you go bankrupt,”

“We're buying an amount that's comparable to what the biggest players in the game are buying. But if you're asking me, 'Why haven't we signed $10 trillion of compute starting in mid-2027?' First of all, it can't be produced. There isn't that much in the world. But second, what if the country of geniuses comes, but it comes in mid-2028 instead of mid-2027? You go bankrupt,”

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned its competitors about reckless capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI). He noted that aggressive capital allocation for AI could lead to catastrophic miscalculations. Speaking in an interview with podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, he criticised rival AI companies foron spending andAmodei also defended his company's more cautious spending approach compared to other AI hyperscalers that commit hundreds of billions of dollars per year.Amodei said even a slight miscalculation could sink Anthropic, explaining why the Claude chatbot developer takes a more measured approach despite his earlier prediction that an AI data centre could one day be aHe acknowledged that Anthropic spends less than some competitors and accepts the risk that the company may not be able to meet all AI demand. Without naming specific companies, Amodei said rivals do not fully understand the risks of their spending strategies.Amodei replied that while he is confident the technical milestone is achievable soon, he's less certain about the timing of AI's economic returns.he noted.Because of uncertainty about how quickly revenue will grow, spending large sums now to build data centres rapidly could beif estimates are off by even a small margin, Amodei warned. In November, Anthropic said it would invest $50 billion in AI infrastructure in the US, starting with data centres in Texas and New York.Meanwhile, the top hyperscalers surprised Wall Street in recent weeks with plans to boost capital expenditures by considerably more than expected. For example, Amazon plans to spend $200 billion this year alone, while Alphabet projects up to $185 billion, and Meta expects capex of up to $135 billion.To illustrate his point about the timing of returns from AI investments, Amodei highlighted the potential for medical breakthroughs that could drive substantial economic value.There's the question of how much of the gains pharmaceutical companies receive versus AI companies. The research, manufacturing, and regulatory processes also take time. Amodei noted that after the first COVID-19 vaccines were developed, it took about 18 months to achieve broad distribution.When it comes to buying data centres, he looks at Anthropic's 10-fold annual revenue growth, with 2026 projected at around $10 billion. At the same time, building and reserving a data centre takes one to two years. By then, revenue could top $1 trillion if it continues on its current trajectory, allowing the company, in theory, to allocate a similar amount to data centres.Amodei explained.He also noted that Anthropic's AI is geared toward enterprise customers rather than fickle consumers, enabling them to rely more on revenue. Overall, Anthropic's spending on computing capacity is still substantial.Amodei added.","Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned competitors about reckless capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI) He noted that aggressive capital allocation for AI could lead to catastrophic miscalculations.

Multiple Hollywood Studios send warnings



ByteDance, the Chinese tech giant behind TikTok, has responded to the cease-and-desist letter sent by Disney which accused the Chinese company of training its AI on a “pirated library” of copyrighted material. In the response, Bytedance said that it is working to add safety filters to its new AI video generator. On Monday (February 16), the company promised to take “firm steps” to stop users from creating unauthorised videos of famous movie characters and celebrities. The reply comes soon after it was hit with legal warnings from major Hollywood studios.“We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,” ByteDance said in its statement, according to a report by news agency Reuters.The whole controversy surrounds Seedance 2.0, a new AI tool released last week. The model quickly went viral in China for its “cinematic” quality, with users began generating high-quality clips of everything from Marvel superheroes to fake fights between stars like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. These videos not only caught caught the attention of people but also of US lawyers.Disney’s main complaint is that Seedance 2.0 appears to treat iconic characters like Spider-Man and Darth Vader as if they were free “clip art” available for public use.Disney isn’t the only studio upset. Paramount Skydance has also sent a legal notice, accusing ByteDance of “blatant infringement” of its intellectual property, according to Variety (via Reuters) These studios are moving quickly to protect their ‘crown jewels’.It is to be noted that this is not the first time that Hollywood Studios has sent such warnings to tech companies.In December, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI signed an official licensing deal with Disney. This allows their Sora video tool to legally use characters from Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel. Similarly, Disney recently took similar legal action against Character.AI to stop users from chatting with unauthorised versions of its characters.","Multiple Hollywood Studios send warnings to Chinese tech giant ByteDance.

He highlights the ""spreadsheet dilemma,"" where a mere 20% revenue miss could lead to bankruptcy, especially with non-cancellable, long-term infrastructure deals. Amodei contrasts Anthropic's cautious approach with rivals' trillion-dollar bets.

A $200 billion miss could bring the whole house down

OpenAI's Oracle deal has Wall Street on edge

Amodei says Anthropic is playing it differently

Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, has a blunt warning for the AI industry's biggest spenders: if your revenue projections are off by even 20%, no amount of deal-making will save you from bankruptcy. And he thinks some of his rivals haven't even done the basic math.In an interview on the Dwarkesh Podcast, Amodei laid out what he called the ""spreadsheet dilemma"" facing companies that are betting trillions on AI compute infrastructure. While he didn't name OpenAI , Sam Altman, or Jensen Huang directly, the target was hard to miss—OpenAI's $300 billion cloud deal with Oracle, Nvidia's reported $100 billion investment interest in OpenAI, and the broader Stargate project that has already crossed $400 billion in commitments.Amodei's core argument is simple: the AI industry is locking itself into massive, non-cancellable compute orders based on revenue projections that assume near-perfect execution. And in his view, some companies are ""YOLOing"" their way through trillion-dollar bets without fully understanding what happens if growth slows even slightly.Amodei used a concrete hypothetical to make his point. If a company commits to $1 trillion a year in compute spending—say, $5 trillion over five years starting 2027—it needs revenue to match.If it lands at $800 billion instead of $1 trillion, ""there's no force on earth, there's no hedge on earth, that could stop me from going bankrupt,"" he said.The math is unforgiving. Data centres take one to two years to build. Chip orders are locked in well in advance. And if growth slows from 10x a year to even 5x, or arrives just 12 months late, the entire financial model collapses. ""If I'm just off by a year in that rate of growth… you go bankrupt,"" Amodei added.The timing of these comments is hard to ignore. OpenAI signed a five-year, $300 billion cloud deal with Oracle in September 2025, covering roughly 4.5 GW of AI-optimised capacity per year. That single contract ballooned Oracle's remaining performance obligations by $317 billion—meaning roughly 58% of Oracle's backlog now hinges on OpenAI delivering the revenue it's projecting. Meanwhile, OpenAI reported losses of $13.5 billion on just $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025.Add Nvidia's reported $100 billion investment interest in OpenAI—where OpenAI buys Nvidia chips, Oracle hosts them, and revenue flows in a circle—and the picture starts to look fragile.Amodei positioned Anthropic as the cautious alternative. His company, he said, commits to ""hundreds of billions"" in compute, not trillions, and has actually written down the spreadsheet. ""I get the impression that some of the other companies have not written down the spreadsheet, that they don't really understand the risks they're taking,"" he said.Anthropic's own revenue trajectory—from essentially zero in 2023 to a $9-10 billion run rate by early 2026—gives it room to be selective. Whether that restraint looks smart or timid will depend entirely on how fast AI revenue actually materialises across the industry.","Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warns AI giants about massive compute spending based on overly optimistic revenue forecasts.

Experts warn this shift is draining, comparing it to judging an unending assembly line. While AI might boost creativity for some, it's creating fatigue for programmers, suggesting a potential productivity ceiling for companies.

Three hours a day—that's all engineers can take, says veteran coder

For non-coders, AI might actually be a good time

The job of a software engineer isn't what it used to be — and not in a good way, according to AI researcher Gary Marcus. In a conversation with Business Insider, Marcus said the rise of AI coding tools has quietly turned programmers into full-time code reviewers, and the shift is wearing them down. ""Some people in coding, in particular, probably feel like constant pressure, and now they feel like what they're doing is debugging somebody else's code, instead of writing code,"" he said. ""Debugging somebody else's code is not particularly fun.""Marcus isn't alone in noticing this. Siddhant Khare, a developer who builds AI agent infrastructure, recently wrote about hitting a wall with AI fatigue. ""We used to call it an engineer, now it is like a reviewer,"" Khare said. ""Every time it feels like you are a judge at an assembly line and that assembly line is never-ending.""Steve Yegge, a veteran engineer, thinks companies need to wake up to this reality fast. He told The Pragmatic Engineer newsletter that AI-assisted coding has a ""vampiric effect"" and recommended capping vibe-coding sessions at three hours a day.""Do you let them work for three hours a day? The answer is yes, or your company's going to break,"" Yegge said.It's a striking warning from someone deep inside the industry — and it suggests the productivity gains of AI tools may come with a ceiling most companies haven't accounted for.Marcus, however, noted that AI fatigue won't land equally across every profession. For people in creative roles who don't have formal artistic training, AI might actually make work feel more rewarding. ""If somebody needs to do some artistic work and they don't really have artistic talent, it might be fun to get the system to make them feel like they have a superpower,"" he said.That said, Marcus has long argued that current AI models are nowhere close to replacing humans. He's pointed to companies like Klarna, which once boasted its AI could match the output of 700 workers — only to later admit that quality suffered and human support was the smarter investment. For now, the software engineers stuck judging an endless assembly line of AI-generated code may be the canary in the coal mine.","Software engineers are reportedly feeling burnt out, with AI coding tools turning their jobs into endless code review.

Tech leaders simple message to youngsters on AI

Stay calm and focus on AI Skills that is the message from tech leaders at the India AI Impact Summit that started in New Delhi today. The general consensus among industry leaders seem to be that while some existing jobs might become redundant, artificial intelligence will create new job opportunities and employees must be on the lookout to find which skillsets they need to upgrade. Sateesh Seetharamiah CEO EdgeVerve (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Infosys) said that AI will act as faster capability multiplier and ""life-long learning ability"" will be the core mantra to tide over the AI wave. He said that AI has generated more productivity to businesses. Seetharamiah added that ultimately there has to be a human being to take accountability of the jobs getting done. ""So the jobs are not going anywhere, nature of jobs will change.""Indian IT veteran and Sampark Founder Chairman Vineet Nayar said that while 50 per cent of current jobs will go because of AI, same perceantage, which is 50%, more jobs will also be created, which would need skilled manpower to handle AI. ""AI offers us a scope to reskill ourselves. But what skills are required (in respective professions) that we need to figure out,"" Nayar said.Sanjeev Bikhchandani, Founder, Info Edge (which owns Naukri.com) cited the example of the time when computers were brought in to handle functions at the bank.""Nobody lost their job and instead productivity went up,"" he said. Responding to a query on whether AI adoption is going to cost jobs, Bhikchandani said, ""don't worry about policy. Just think what should you do so that AI does not make you lose your job and instead help you get a job"". He adde, ""AI is happening, it is relentless, if you don't do AI, AI will be done to you... Set a personal target of learning how to use three AI platforms within the next three months. The more you do that the more your job is safe."" Bikhchandani's message to youngsters is simple: You should learn useful AI tools.Speaking at the event, Microsoft India and South Asia President Puneet Chandok said that AI technology would not eliminate employment but would fundamentally reshape roles. ""AI - it will not kill jobs, but will unbundle jobs. AI will end the charade. You and I have to bundle ourselves. If you are not learning AI today, you are not learning anything,"" he remarked.","Tech leaders at the India AI Impact Summit said that while some jobs might become redundant, artificial intelligence will create new job opportunities.

Grandfather of the Internet David J. Farber, a computer science professor whose work and teaching helped shape the foundations of the modern internet, died on February 7 in Tokyo. He was 91. According to his son, Emanuel Farber, the cause of his death was heart failure. Farber had been teaching at Keio University in Japan since 2018. Over a career spanning several decades, he played a key role in bringing together computing and telecommunications, and mentored students who later became central figures in building the systems that power today’s global internet. He was often referred to as the “grandfather of the internet” for his influence on early networking research.David J. Farber began his career in the mid-1950s at Bell Laboratories, when computers largely operated in isolation and had limited ways to exchange information. His research helped move computing toward networked communication, a shift that later became the basis of the internet. The New York Times once described him as an early architect of the technology.After entering academia, Farber became known for guiding students who helped define the Internet Protocol (IP), which governs how data is sent across networks.In the early 1970s, he held regular discussions with doctoral student Jonathan Postel, meetings that helped shape key communication rules. Postel’s 1974 dissertation later influenced much of the early internet’s development.Another student, Paul Mockapetris, went on to help design the Domain Name System (DNS), which allows users to access websites using names instead of numerical addresses. Farber also worked with researchers and policymakers to secure government support for experimental computer networks.In 1977, Farber co-wrote a paper with engineer Paul Baran arguing that computers were becoming powerful enough to handle communication tasks. The paper anticipated the rise of email, messaging and other digital tools, and described computers as systems for human interaction rather than just calculation.","David J.

Colourful like the iMac



Apple’s most affordable MacBook in years could be just weeks away. The company is finalising a budget laptop that ditches the M-series chip for an iPhone-class processor, comes dressed in fun new colours, and is expected to retail well under $1,000, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported in his latest Power On newsletter.Code-named J700, the MacBook will run on an A-series chip similar to those found in iPhones—a first for any modern Mac notebook. The display is expected to measure slightly under 13 inches, slotting it below the MacBook Air in both size and spec. Apple is targeting students and enterprise users with this one, taking direct aim at Chromebooks and budget Windows laptops that have had the affordable end of the market to themselves for years.The price may be lower, but the build isn’t going plastic. Apple is sticking with an aluminium chassis for the J700, and to keep costs in check, it has developed a new forging technique that makes the shells faster and cheaper to produce than the unibody enclosures on the Air and Pro. There’s a chance this method could eventually roll out to Apple’s pricier laptops too.That said, compromises will show up elsewhere. The MacBook is expected to ship with just 8GB of memory, fewer USB-C ports, and a lower-quality LCD panel.Analyst estimates place the final price somewhere in the $699 to $750 range.Where Apple is getting adventurous is colour. Gurman says the company has tested light yellow, light green, blue, pink, classic silver, and dark gray finishes over the past year—though not all will make the final cut. The playful palette takes a page from the 24-inch iMac’s colourful lineup and is a sharp departure from the muted tones MacBook buyers are used to.A March launch is looking likely, which would make the J700 Apple’s first real swing at the budget laptop market in a long time.","The MacBook J700 will run on an A-series chip similar to those found in iPhones.

Bidding war between Paramount and Netflix



Warner Bros. Discovery is now reportedly reconsidering whether to reopen sale talks with Paramount Skydance after receiving an amended offer which addresses the earlier concerns. As reported by Bloomberg, Paramount’s latest proposal includes covering the $2.8 billion fee owed to Netflix if Warner Bros. terminates its current agreement, backstopping debt financing and compensation shareholders if the deal fails to close by the year-end.Warner Bros. has already agreed to sell its Studio and HBO Max streaming business to Netflix in a deal valued $27.75 per share. However, Paramount has countered with a $30‑a‑share tender offer, appealing directly to shareholders and regulators. The Warner Bros board has not yet decided how to respond, but the discussion suggests Paramount’s bid could reignite a second bidding war.As per the report, Ellison said the new additions to Paramount's bid “underscore our strong and unwavering commitment to delivering the full value [Warner Bros. Discovery] shareholders deserve for their investment.""""We are making meaningful enhancements — backing this offer with billions of dollars, providing shareholders with certainty in value, a clear regulatory path, and protection against market volatility,"" he said in a statement.As per the Bloomberg report, many Warner Bros. shareholders including Ancora Holdings Group, Pentawater Capital Management have publicly urger the board to engage in talks with Paramount.

EU-US tensions over Greenland add to trade woes

No, Europe's biggest IT services company Capgemini does not agree with calls of total technological sovereignty in Europe. Paris-based Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat has reportedly dismissed calls for a total technological sovereignty in Europe. His comments come at a time when there are calls from several governments across America to reduce dependance on US technology companies in the backdrop of tense transatlantic relations. These frayed relations have stoked concerns about the Europe's dependence on American tech majors. European Union leaders gathered last week for a summit in Belgium focused on how to increase European competitiveness in a more volatile global economy. Europe’s push for greater digital sovereignty has gained new momentum in recent months, sparked by fears that the US President Donald Trump’s foreign policy could force a “tech decoupling”. Under President Trump, Brussels and Washington have clashed at a number of occasions over the EU’s digital regulation. So much so that, US even banned entry of several current and former EU officials. For those unaware, calls for digital sovereignty in Europe emphasize achieving strategic independence from foreign technology, specifically reducing dependence on U.S.-basedtech giants for infrastructure, cloud services, and AI.According to a report in Reuters, French tech major Capgemini, which serves government agencies, critical-infrastructure operators and large regulated enterprises, is positioning itself as a bridge between Brussels' sovereignty ambitions and the reality of US-dominated cloud infrastructure. ""There is no such thing as absolute sovereignty,"" Ezzat told journalists in a post-earnings call. ""Nobody has it, because no one has sovereignty over the entire value chain required to deliver services. ""Ezzat said that on the first three levels, Europe already has independence, but the dominance of the US Big Tech means that there is no complete independence on a technological level. He believes that rather than pursue full autonomy, European countries should be seeking ""the right sovereignty solution based on the use case, the client environment, the government"".He said digital autonomy follows a four-layer framework of data, operations, regulation and technology. Capgemini has signed partnerships US hyperscalers including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft to deliver what it calls ""sovereign"" AI solutions, cloud services provided by a European-based company while running on American infrastructure.Trump’s threats over Greenland have worsened the trade relations between the US and EU. This has also reignited calls in Europe to hit Silicon Valley with retaliatory measures had the US president followed through, especially as Europe has a large deficit with the US in services. The EU should not be lulled into a false sense of security that tensions with the US over Greenland, technology and trade are over, French President Emmanuel Macron has warned, as he called on the bloc to embark on an “economic revolution” and finally become a true global power. The French President Emmanuel Macron has been a long-standing advocate of more digital sovereignty. He said this week that further clashes between the EU and US over tech regulation were likely later this year.",Paris-based Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat has reportedly dismissed calls for a total technological sovereignty in Europe.

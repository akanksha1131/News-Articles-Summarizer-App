xAI top executive Ayush Jaiswal’s reaction





Elon Musk’s legendary work ethic









Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known for his extreme work culture and now his AI company xAI is once again back in spotlight after a post by one of its engineers revealed that he had worked for 36 hours straight without any sleep. This revelation made by the techie started an online debate about work-life balance and the pressures of working in a high-growth tech companies. Amid this discussion, Ayush Jaiswal, an Indian-origin executive at xAI shared a meaningful response on the post which shifted the focus from blaming the individuals to addressing systemic challenges.The controversy and the debate around work-life balance started when an xAI engineer shared a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) where he shared that he had worked by 36 hours continuously without any sleep while pushing through a demanding project. “Last night I left the @xai office after ~36 hours of working with no sleep. Although I was dead, I was also super energized. Incredibly grateful to be a part of this team. Happy thanksgiving!,” wrote Parsa.The post shared by Parsa quickly went viral drawing both attention and admiration. Some users praised him for his dedication while others criticised the unhealthy work environment.Ayush Jaiswal, an Indian-origin top executive at xAI who is also known as the co-founder of edtech startup Pesto, shared his response on the viral post on X.In his reply, Jaiswal wrote: “Don’t be angry with the person who worked 36 hours straight. Be angry with the problem that required it.”The statement made by Jaiswal stresses on the fact the the real issue lies not in the individual’s choice to overwork, but in the circumstances and systemic pressures that make such extreme efforts necessary.Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known for his dedicated to work. In a 2014 commencement speech, Musk advised the students to ‘work super hard’. He also said that by putting in 100 hours a week allows him to achieve twice as much as someone working 50. His schedule often blurs the line between personal and professional life. In a BBC interview, Musk described being “swarmed by men” at parties wanting to pitch ideas, making it difficult to relax or trust people.","An xAI engineer shared a post on social media platform X where he shared that he had worked by 36 hours continuously without any sleep while pushing through a demanding project.

China vs US: Battle line drawn in robots race





Chinese government has a new 'scare' and it is the country's humanoid robotics industry. China’s burgeoning humanoid robotics sector, recently anointed a key economic catalyst by the Communist Party, is said to be attracting such an intense wave of investment that it is beginning to make Beijing uneasy. According to a report in Bloomberg, China’s powerful economic-planning agency has warned of the risks of a bubble forming in the country’s humanoid robotics industry, issuing a rare official expression of concern about a pivotal sphere of technology. The warning comes from China's National Development and Reform Commission, which sets economic strategy and shifts in policy. The agency has called attention to the proliferation of remarkably similar robots from more than 150 companies in the same field. Agency spokeswoman Li Chao told Bloomberg that it is important for the country to prevent this flood of humanoid robots from overwhelming the market and squeezing out real research and development initiatives. “Frontier industries have long grappled with the challenge of balancing the speed of growth against the risk of bubbles — an issue now confronting the humanoid robot sector as well,” Li added.The Chinese government's call for increased vigilance reflects growing anxiety over potential over-investment, an issue that has plagued past Chinese tech booms like bike-sharing and semiconductors, often resulting in market shakeups and consolidation.The development and funding frenzy has skyrocketed following Unitree Robotics' viral performance during the Spring Festival Gala earlier this year, where its dancing droids captivated a nationwide audience. This surge in interest aligns with the ruling Communist Party's new guidelines, which designated the humanoid robotics industry as one of six critical new economic growth drivers for China’s development plan through 2030.Investor enthusiasm is palpable. The Bloomberg report notes that the Solactive China Humanoid Robotics Index—which tracks the shares of robot-related companies—is up nearly 30% this year. Industry leader UBTech Robotics Corp., a potential beneficiary of any market consolidation, saw its shares gain more than 4% on Friday. Citigroup Inc. has projected the market could swell to $7 trillion by 2050, though widespread adoption of these robots in homes and factories is still considered years away. In 2023, China reportedly installed over 290,000 industrial robots, more than the rest of the world combined, with robot density reaching 470 robots per 10,000 workers, surpassing Japan and Germany for the first time.The sector's profile has been further elevated by key government endorsements. Unitree founder Wang Xingxing secured a front-row seat at a seminal meeting in February with President Xi Jinping and other prominent tech leaders, including Jack Ma. Since then, droids from fast-growing startups such as AgiBot and Galbot have become social media sensations, showcasing capabilities like running marathons, kickboxing, and making coffee.The government's plan, according to the official, is two-fold: accelerating research and development of core technologies while simultaneously supporting the construction of essential training and testing infrastructure. Furthermore, Beijing intends to ""promote the consolidation and sharing of technology and industrial resources in the sector across the nation,"" in a bid to hasten the real-world application of humanoid robots.Chinese and American companies have begun a battle to build the world’s best robots. While it’s early days, experts say that China is leading in the quantity of robots delivered to consumers, while the US is ahead in the quality of robots demonstrated. China dominates in mass production and affordability; U.S. companies lead in technological sophistication and artificial intelligence capabilities, establishing a new tech rivalry. CEO Elon Musk danced with Tesla’s Optimus robots at his company’s shareholder meeting and outlined plans for a factory in Fremont that he said will someday have the capacity to build a million bots a year, which would sell for around $20,000 in today’s dollars.","China's economic-planning agency has warned of the risks of a bubble forming in the country's humanoid robotics industry.

No Caller ID

When you see “Unknown Caller”

No Caller ID means the caller refused to show the number.

Unknown Caller means the number itself got lost en route.

The way we respond to each

No Caller ID

Unknown Caller





On the surface, both labels feel identical: a call appears, you don’t recognise it, and your instinct is to reject and sigh. But these two phrases don’t mean the same thing, and once you understand the difference, the mystery of these silent numbers suddenly makes more sense.Let’s start with the human reaction. Most of us will simply let these calls ring out. There’s the gut-level suspicion: if someone really had something to say, they’d text, leave a voicemail, or call from a visible number. And people on Reddit Apple Community forums and countless user discussions echo the same sentiment, confusion, curiosity and a small underlying paranoia. One Apple Community user even described being “spooked” when their phone displayed, insisting they knew the same person had called earlier asand couldn’t figure out why the wording changed.That’s where the difference lies.This happens when the caller actively chooses to hide their number. The caller either changes their device settings to block their ID, or manually prefixes the call (such as dialling 141 in the UK or *67 in the US) to conceal it. In other words, the phone knows exactly who’s calling, it just isn’t allowed to show you.This can be used by scam callers, yes, but it also appears when medical professionals, journalists, government departments or private investigators make outbound calls and don’t want a return call coming back through the same number. There is intent behind the concealment, someoneThis tells a very different story. Here, the network isn’t hiding the number, it simply never successfully received it. On “Unknown Caller,” the caller isn’t necessarily trying to hide anything. The system attempted to provide caller ID, but somewhere between sending and receiving, the data fell apart. That can happen with international routing, inter-carrier incompatibilities or telecom glitches that interrupt identification.Think of it this way:This is why you might see an unknown call from your own bank, your mum’s old mobile, or a landline, even though none of them were deliberately masking anything. The uncertainty isn’t intentional; it’s technical.There’s a psychological split too, and you see it in real user behaviour. People treatas something to distrust, almost adversarially. Meanwhile,is unsettling in a different way, it feels like a blank space, a glitch. There’s room for it to be innocent, and room for it to be fraudulent.So the next time your screen lights up with one of those anonymous labels, you’re not staring at two versions of the same thing. You’re looking at two different mechanisms of anonymity, one chosen by the caller, the other imposed by the network.","Unknown Caller means the number itself got lost en route.

The Union government has issued new directives requiring messaging apps to enforce SIM card verification and automatically log out web-based sessions every six hours. This means that users will be barred from accessing their services if they do not have a physical SIM card originally used to register for the app present in their device. The directive by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) will affect major platforms including WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Arattai, Snapchat, Sharechat and others, and are aimed at combating cyber fraud.According to the notice, these communication apps must ensure within 90 days that their services remain “continuously” linked to the SIM card used during registration. They must block access if the SIM is not present in the device – a technical requirement known as SIM binding. Additionally, web-based versions of these apps, such as WhatsApp Web, must log out users periodically, with sessions not exceeding six hours.“It has come to the notice of Central Government that some of the app based communication services that are utilizing mobile number for identification of its customers... allow users to consume their services without availability of the underlying SIM within the device...posing challenge to telecom cyber security as it is being misused from outside the country to commit cyber-frauds,” DoT stated in its notice.The government is invoking powers from the Telecommunication Cybersecurity Amendment Rules, 2025, notified in October, which introduced the concept of Telecommunication Identifier User Entity (TIUE) under telecom regulations.WhatsApp has more than 500 million users in India, and the new regulations may hinder daily use. For example, some people use multiple devices, like phone and tablets, or two phones but link them to use one account on both the devices. They may experience disruptions due to the mandate of SIM binding.Further, people who use WhatsApp on their PCs to lessen their screen time on phone and restrict themselves to communication on messaging apps are likely to face disruption during work hours.“Presently, the binding process between a subscriber's app-based communication services and their mobile SIM card occurs only once during the initial installation and verification phase, after which the application continues to function independently on the device even if the SIM card is later removed, replaced or deactivated,” COAI previously stated.","New regulations require messaging apps to enforce SIM card verification. WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Arattai, Snapchat, Sharechat and others will have to comply.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment.The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.","OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities.

His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

""airport authority of the internet""

.

""magic happens in the background""

“Think of us a little like an airport authority. It manages the runaways and the facilities of the airport and gives you the ability to rent ticketing and other kind of facilities in there.

Then it manages the process of passenger engagement, so an airline comes in, like KLM, drops a passenger, and then magic happens in the background to move that passenger and their luggage to United to go on to California. We’re a little bit like the airport authority of the internet: a data package comes into Equinix and then moves on to where its next destination is.

The difference between us and an airport authority is that the airport lines will compete whereas a lot of our customers colocate so they can collaborate.”

Equinix handles 95% of internet traffic

“In many countries, we are designated as critical infrastructure, in certain states, too, but not at the federal level. When I think about moving home: water, gas, electricity, internet becomes that fourth utility. And 95% of internet traffic runs through the Equinix environment. If you were on a Zoom call this morning, if you did a stream from any of the major providers, ordered an Uber, purchased a train ticket, you were on a platform accessing Equinix at some point,”

How Equinix works with tech majors like Google and others

“We do support our hyperscaler partners with the provision of data centers, through a vehicle called xScale, which is a joint venture. We have partners who fund our joint ventures, so we do participate in what I described as the wholesale economy by building what’s called a build-to-suit data center industry for a hyperscaler. So a Google would come to us and say, ‘do you guys have power and land in location X? And would you build for us?’ So we do that through a joint venture off our balance sheet because the capital-intensive nature of that is high.

We own 25% of our America JV and we own 20% of our EMEA and our APAC JV. We have 15 centers that are already operational around the globe”

How Equinix handles AI workloads

“We do both training and inference. A pharmaceutical company would do their training privately at Equinix because in the pharma world much of their research and drug discovery processes have to go through private models for regulatory reasons or intellectual property protection. Training is like teaching the model and then inference really putting what the model has learned to work,""

“I’m going to take $50 of that. And here’s a list of 10 names. We’re going to send 50 bucks to whatever dorm room that this person at the top of the list is in.

Then we’re going to take their name off the list and put your name at the bottom. So we’ll make it a $50 chain letter. And as everybody else does that, your name moves up the list until you’re at the top. And as we grow the chain letter, hopefully you’ll get more money than you put out.

”

“No, no. It was basically a scam. I made sure my friends all got their money back. And so I got up to the top of the list. And it was amazing, because I’d go to [my mailbox] and there’d be envelopes with 50 bucks from here, 50 bucks from there, and that’s how I paid for my junior year of college,”

“I would go door-to-door to be like, ‘Hi, my name is Mark. Do you use trash bags?’ I killed it,”

He said,

“I was young, single and crazy, and there were no limits.”





Billionaire Mark Cuban ran a 'scam' to pay for his college. The billionaire investor, known for being a Shark Tank judge and owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, set up ascheme while attending Indiana University in the early 1980s. Recently, on the San Francisco Standard’s Life in Seven Songs podcast, Cuban revealed this early hustle. This financially questionable tactic was one of many humble ways Cuban hustled before becoming one of the wealthiest people in the world. To start the Ponzi scheme-or, as he called it,-he asked someone in his dorm for $100 to help pay for his junior year.To convince his dormmates, Cuban said,He even clarified that it wasn’t social capital.Cuban explained, laughing. Mark Cuban said that kind of money was crucial to him back then. He grew up in a modest home in a working-class neighbourhood near Pittsburgh. His dad worked in car upholstery and sometimes gave him a $20 bill, but Cuban was always looking for ways to earn more. That habit started when he asked his dad for new basketball shoes. His dad told him that once he had a job, he could buy anything he wanted.That moment pushed Cuban toward entrepreneurship. His first business was selling trash bags. A friend of his father had many boxes of trash bags to get rid of and told Cuban he could try selling them. So Cuban went door-to-door in his neighbourhood selling them.Cuban noted.After college, Mark Cuban moved to Dallas and worked as a software salesman. He lived with five roommates in what he called aAs he put it,and he often slept on the floor. He said,During that time, he taught himself everything about computers by reading manuals. He was close to earning a $1,500 commission that could have helped him leave thebut when he went to collect the check, his boss fired him. That pushed him to start his first company, MicroSolutions, which he later sold for $6 million.However, his career continued to grow. In the mid-1990s, he and two friends started Audionet.com, later called Broadcast.com. They sold it to Yahoo for $5.7 billion in 1999. Cuban went on to invest in several businesses, appeared on Shark Tank, and bought most of the Dallas Mavericks in 2000. He left Shark Tank in 2023 and sold his Mavericks stake for $3.5 billion.

Initially a Mac-exclusive concept, Microsoft's timely offer rescued a struggling Bungie and transformed Halo into a system-defining, billion-dollar success that reshaped console gaming.

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

From Apple's stage to Xbox's cornerstone

How a struggling studio became Xbox's billion-dollar franchise





Microsoft's acquisition of Bungie Studios in 2000 came after the gaming company showcased Halo on stage with Apple's Steve Jobs at Macworld 1999, according to Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto. The move transformed what would have been a Mac-exclusive title into Xbox's flagship franchise.Lehto revealed that Microsoft executives reached out shortly after the Macworld presentation, where Bungie demonstrated an early version of Halo as a third-person shooter for Macintosh computers. The tech giant saw an opportunity to secure a killer app for its upcoming Xbox console launch.""We got up on stage with Steve Jobs at Macworld and we talked about it there,"" Lehto recalled in an interview with Kent State Magazine. ""And then Microsoft said, 'Steve Jobs can't have that. We're going to buy you and move you all to the Pacific Northwest, and then we're going to have you build this game for the Xbox.'""The acquisition proved strategically brilliant. Halo: Combat Evolved launched alongside the original Xbox in 2001, becoming the system-defining title that helped establish Microsoft's gaming division. The franchise has since generated billions in revenue and spawned numerous sequels, spin-offs, and adaptations.At the time of Microsoft's approach, Bungie was facing financial difficulties, making the buyout offer particularly timely. Lehto, who served as art director and designed the iconic Master Chief character through nine iterations, said the partnership represented perfect timing for both companies.The game that Jobs introduced to the world looked dramatically different from the final product. The Macworld demo featured aliens and an epic soundtrack but was otherwise unrecognizable compared to the first-person shooter that revolutionized console gaming.Today, Halo remains synonymous with Xbox, proving Microsoft's aggressive acquisition strategy paid off in ways that reshaped the gaming industry's competitive landscape for decades to come.","Microsoft's acquisition of Bungie Studios in 2000 came after the gaming company showcased Halo on stage with Apple's Steve Jobs.

US trade pressure mounts on EU tech rulebook

Commission defends enforcement amid political pressure





French President Emmanuel Macron has accused Brussels of moving too slowly on investigations into American tech giants, claiming that US pressure—not Russian interference—is stalling the European Union's enforcement of its digital regulations.Speaking at a town hall event in the Vosges region of northeastern France, Macron singled out cases that have languished before the European Commission for two years under the Digital Services Act (DSA), calling the pace ""much too slow."" According to Politico, the French leader warned that many officials at both the Commission and member state level ""are afraid to pursue it because there's an American offensive against the application of directives on digital services and markets. ""Macron's remarks followed a contentious week in Brussels, where US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick pressed EU ministers to ""reconsider"" the bloc's tech regulations in exchange for reduced steel and aluminum tariffs.

OpenAI cites ‘Melting GPUs’ (again) for Sora video restrictions







Google and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI have restricted the number of photos and videos users can make through their AI tools. Both technology giants have cited overwhelming demand and strained computing resources for the immediate cuts for imposing usage limits.Google, which launched its new image generation tool Nano Banana Pro last week, has immediately restricted free users to a daily maximum of just two images.The new limit, which is a reduction from the initial three images per day, was first noted by 9to5Google. The company warned that usage caps may change frequently and “without notice,” standard practice following a popular new release. Google is also reportedly restricting free users’ access to its underlying large language model, Gemini 3 Pro.“You can upgrade to a Google AI plan for expanded access to features and models in Gemini Apps. Gemini Apps upgrades are part of select Google One paid plans for personal accounts,” the company said.The restrictions are immediate for video generation using the Sora AI model. Bill Peebles, who heads Sora at OpenAI, announced a severe cut to video usage, citing the enormous computational demands of the platform.“Our gpus are melting,” Peebles explained, confirming that free users will now be limited to six video generations per day.Unlike previous usage limits, Peebles did not characterize these new caps as temporary. The measure signals a clear push toward monetization, as he added that users “can purchase additional gems as needed.”“we’re setting usage limits for free users to 6 gens/day. chatgpt plus and pro users have unchanged limits, and everybody can purchase additional gens as needed. our gpus are melting, and we want to let as many people access sora as possible!” Peebles said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).Usage limits for paying subscribers of ChatGPT Plus and Pro remain unchanged.","Google and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI have restricted the number of photos and videos users can make through their AI tools.

How to shop for Cyber Monday deals







Cyber Monday is not waiting for Monday anymore as major retailers have already launched their holiday sales events and dates. Some promotions have kicked off as early as today, November 29, while other retailers have released schedules confirming early access to their Cyber Week discounts. Here’s all you need to know about Cyber Monday sale 2025.Cyber Monday sales in 2025 bear little resemblance to the single-day online shopping event of years past. It occurs every year on the Monday immediately following the US Thanksgiving holiday, and follows Black Friday and the weekend sales.While there may be new discounts in the Cyber Monday sale, it historically is a second chance for buyers who have missed out on Black Friday sale. Generally, many Black Friday deals carry through the weekend, though not all will survive until Monday. Cyber Monday serves primarily as an opportunity to catch deals that sold out or weren't available during the Black Friday rush.Amazon officially announced its Cyber Monday sale will start on Saturday, November 29, running through December 1. Best Buy has transformed the event into a two-day ""Cyber Weekend"" spanning Sunday, November 30, and Monday, December 1.Target follows a similar timeline, launching Sunday and continuing through Monday. Walmart is restricting its Cyber Monday deals to the actual Monday, December 1.Here's the complete schedule:While numerous Black Friday promotions will continue, retailers typically bring back popular deals that expired earlier in the week. Some products even see prices drop slightly lower than their Black Friday levels as stores push to clear inventory before the holiday shopping season enters its final stretch.The extended sales windows mean consumers now have nearly a full week of deal-hunting opportunities rather than racing against single-day deadlines.The discounts offered during Cyber Monday are generally focused on technology, electronics, online subscriptions and other digital goods. The deals are primarily found online, rather than in physical stores. There is no different playbook when it comes to shopping for Cyber Monday. Since several discounts, deals and offers of Black Friday sale are available throughout the weekend and succeeding Monday, customers can check major e-commerce platforms for early access sales or exclusive app-only deals.","Cyber Monday sales in 2025 bear little resemblance to the single-day online shopping event of years past.

Tata Electronics is reportedly preparing to expand its workforce at its Tamil Nadu facility. According top a report, the company’s hiring push will bring total headcount at the Hosur plant to 75,000 from the current 60,000 – essentially adding 15,000 employees over the next six months as it races to keep pace with surging demand from Apple . Citing sources familiar with the matter, The Economic Times reported that Tata is looking to match the employment levels of Foxconn, Apple's largest contract manufacturer, in India.The rapid expansion comes as Tata Electronics scales up electronics manufacturing services driven by Apple's accelerating production in the country, the report noted. Apple iPhone exports from India reached a record $10 billion in the first half of the current fiscal year, representing a 75% jump from $5.71 billion during the same period last year, according to data reported by ET in October.“Tata Electronics is ramping up rapidly to keep up with demand from Apple,” a person familiar with the expansion was quoted as saying.“In the next six months or so, their headcount is likely to be at the same level as that of Foxconn, signaling the feverish pace of growth in recent times,” the person added.""It's a significant achievement for the industry at large for an Indian player to reach this scale in a short span of time and to be part of a global value chain like Apple's,"" the source added.Despite the momentum, finding qualified workers is proving difficult, sources said.“Tata Electronics is struggling with finding enough skilled manpower. As the scale gets bigger and bigger, they are recognizing that they have to be more thoughtful about how they approach factors like manpower, water, power and other things,” one person noted.“There's a need especially to solve for the talent piece because customer traction and other factors are rock solid,” the source said.","Tata Electronics is reportedly preparing to expand its workforce at its Tamil Nadu facility.

The unprecedented recall follows an October incident when a JetBlue flight suddenly nosedived without pilot input, forcing an emergency landing. Airlines worldwide face massive disruptions during peak travel season, with repairs taking hours for most planes but weeks for 1,000 older jets requiring hardware replacements. The incident is being hailed as the largest aircraft recall in history.

Airlines scramble as thousands of aircrafts grounded worldwide

Software fixes vary by aircraft age and configuration: Two-thirds jets get quick fix, but 1,000 older jets face extended downtime

How solar storms threaten modern aviation electronics

Largest recall in Airbus's 55-year history





Airbus has ordered software updates for approximately 6,000 A320 family aircrafts—more than half its global fleet—after discovering that intense solar radiation can corrupt critical flight control systems, triggering one of the largest aircraft recalls in aviation history. The emergency directive, issued November 29, has caused widespread flight cancellations and delays worldwide, affecting millions of passengers during the peak US Thanksgiving travel weekend.The action follows an October 30 incident when a JetBlue flight from Cancun to Newark suddenly nosedived without pilot input, injuring several passengers and forcing an emergency landing in Tampa, Florida. Investigators traced the malfunction to the aircraft's ELAC 2 computer—which controls elevator and aileron surfaces—after intense solar radiation corrupted data essential to maintaining stable flight.""Intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls,"" Airbus stated, acknowledging the fixes would create ""operational disruptions to passengers and customers."" The European Union Aviation Safety Agency immediately issued an emergency airworthiness directive prohibiting affected aircraft from flying until repairs are completed.The recall's timing couldn't be worse. Over seven million Americans were expected to fly during Thanksgiving weekend, and four of the world's ten largest A320 operators—American Airlines, Delta, JetBlue, and United—are US carriers facing immediate pressure to restore service.American Airlines initially reported 340 affected aircraft before revising the count to 209, stating most repairs would be completed within 48 hours at approximately two hours per plane. Delta expected limited operational impact with updates finished by Saturday morning. However, Colombian carrier Avianca closed ticket sales through December 8 after determining 70 percent of its fleet required fixes.The disruption rippled globally. Air France cancelled 35 flights Friday. Japan's ANA Holdings grounded dozens of aircraft, cancelling 65 Saturday flights. Indian carriers IndiGo and Air India warned passengers of delays and possible cancellations. Airlines from Germany's Lufthansa to UK-based EasyJet and Air New Zealand all reported varying degrees of service interruption.For roughly 4,000 aircraft, the solution involves reverting to earlier software versions—a relatively simple procedure taking a few hours. But approximately 1,000 older jets require complete hardware replacements, threatening groundings lasting weeks depending on parts availability and maintenance capacity.The disruption compounds existing aviation industry challenges. Airlines already face maintenance shop shortages and hundreds of grounded Airbus jets awaiting engine repairs. The sudden recall further strains limited resources during a critical revenue period.UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander offered reassurance that British impact appeared limited, with only small numbers requiring complex fixes. EasyJet reported completing updates proactively and planned normal Saturday operations. Air Canada stated few aircraft used the problematic software version and expected no operational impact.The A320 family revolutionised commercial aviation when launched in 1984 as the first mainstream aircraft using fly-by-wire technology—replacing mechanical controls with electronic systems. While this innovation improved efficiency and safety, it created new vulnerabilities to electromagnetic interference.The coronal mass ejections from the sun release heavily charged particles into Earth's atmosphere. At altitudes above 28,000 feet, these particles generate additional atmospheric radiation capable of corrupting aircraft electronics.The ELAC system translates pilot commands from cockpit side-sticks into electronic signals that control wing ailerons and tail elevators—the surfaces managing aircraft pitch and roll. When solar radiation corrupts ELAC data, the aircraft can execute uncommanded maneuvers, as passengers on the JetBlue flight discovered when their plane suddenly dropped altitude without warning.France's Thales, which manufactures the ELAC hardware, stated its computers comply fully with Airbus specifications and regulatory certifications, noting the vulnerable functionality involves software outside Thales's responsibility.The recall represents extraordinary scope for the aerospace giant. With approximately 11,300 A320-family aircraft operating worldwide, the affected 6,000 jets serve airlines across six continents. The A320 competes directly with Boeing's 737 as workhorses of global aviation, providing crucial connections that represent significant economic infrastructure.The setback arrives just weeks after the A320 surpassed the 737 as the most-delivered aircraft model in history—a milestone now overshadowed by safety concerns and operational chaos. Aviation analysts noted such widespread mandatory groundings remain exceptionally rare, though the industry's rapid response demonstrates robust safety protocols.Airbus emphasized it worked proactively with authorities to ensure fleet safety, apologizing for inconvenience while maintaining safety as its ""number one and overriding priority.""","Airbus has ordered software updates for approximately 6,000 A320 family aircrafts.

Appeasing the Trump administration's 'Made in USA' push

Reducing dependence on Taiwan-based TSMC









Five years after Apple famously broke up with Intel to design its own revolutionary M-series chips, the tech giant may be rekindling the relationship—but this time, with a twist. Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reports Intel could start manufacturing Apple's M-series processors by 2027, though Apple would retain full control over chip design while Intel handles production.The chipmaker could begin producing Apple's lowest-end M-series processors using its 18AP advanced manufacturing process as early as the second or third quarter of 2027, Kuo revealed in a post on X (formerly Twitter). The Intel-made Apple Silicon would likely power the upcoming MacBook Air, iPad Air, and iPad Pro models, with expected production volumes between 15-20 million units.Unlike the previous relationship where Intel designed x86-based processors for Macs, this partnership would see Intel solely manufacturing Apple-designed ARM-based chips. Taiwan-based TSMC would continue supplying the majority of Apple's chips, including higher-end variants and iPhone processors.The deal could help Apple demonstrate its commitment to buying American by incorporating more US-based companies into its supply chain, Kuo theorised. Bloomberg reported in September that Intel approached Apple about securing an investment as part of its turnaround efforts, with Apple CEO Tim Cook previously telling CNBC the company would ""love to see Intel come back"".The US government acquired approximately 10% of Intel in an August deal brokered by the Trump administration, positioning the chipmaker as critical to domestic semiconductor production.While TSMC remains Apple's primary chip supplier, diversifying manufacturing sources addresses supply chain management requirements, according to Kuo. This strategic move would provide Apple with a backup option for its entry-level processors.Apple has already signed a non-disclosure agreement with Intel and obtained preliminary design specifications, with key development milestones tracking as expected. The company awaits Intel's updated design kit scheduled for the first quarter of 2026.For Intel, landing Apple as a foundry client would validate its turnaround efforts and potentially attract other premium customers.

Over 150 companies are producing similar robots, raising concerns about genuine research and development. This mirrors past investment frenzies. China aims to produce over 10,000 humanoid robots this year, more than half globally. Beijing plans to accelerate market mechanisms and promote consolidation to ensure fair competition and real-world applications.

Musk's prediction about Chinese dominance may be coming true

China's robot revolution accelerates despite growing pains





China's top economic planning agency has issued a rare warning about bubble risks in the country's rapidly expanding humanoid robotics sector—the same industry that Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously expressed concern about China potentially dominating.The National Development and Reform Commission of China cautioned about the proliferation of remarkably similar robots from more than 150 companies flooding the market, according to Bloomberg. Agency spokeswoman Li Chao told reporters the country must prevent this deluge from overwhelming the sector and crowding out genuine research and development efforts.The warning reflects Beijing's growing unease over excessive investment pouring into humanoid robotics, which officials have designated as one of six key economic growth drivers through 2030. This pattern echoes previous investment frenzies in sectors ranging from bike-sharing to semiconductors that ended in industry shakeouts eliminating smaller players.The Tesla billionaire warned during an April conference call that while he believes his Optimus robots lead in performance, China might ultimately dominate the field. ""I'm a little concerned that on the leaderboard, ranks 2 through 10 will be Chinese companies,"" Musk said, as reported by Bloomberg.His concerns appear well-founded. China is on track to produce more than 10,000 humanoid robots this year—representing over half of global production, according to research from Chinese think tank Leaderobot. The country announced earlier this year it would invest 1 trillion yuan ($138 billion) in robotics and high technology over the next two decades, dwarfing investments from the US or Europe.Investment in the sector exploded after Unitree's dancing robots captivated audiences during this year's Spring Festival Gala. Since then, Chinese humanoid robots have dominated social media performing tasks from running marathons to kickboxing and making coffee.The market's potential remains massive. Citigroup projects the humanoid robotics market and related services could reach $7 trillion by 2050, with 648 million human-like robots potentially populating the world.Chinese startups including EngineAI, Unitree, AgiBot and Galbot are harnessing artificial intelligence to help robots learn new tasks independently. The Solactive China Humanoid Robotics Index has surged nearly 30% this year as investor enthusiasm builds.Beijing plans to accelerate development of mechanisms for market entry and exit while promoting consolidation of technology and industrial resources across the sector to support fair competition and real-world applications.","China's top economic planning agency has issued a rare warning about bubble risks in the country's rapidly expanding humanoid robotics sector.

CTO Brian Atwell suggests intelligence tests, like IQ tests, could aid early screening for PM candidates. He emphasizes rigorous hiring processes, noting that easily practiced interviews fail to build strong teams. Designing effective, ungameable interviews requires significant dedication.

""generally less well-defined than the engineering role.""

Why CloudKitchens' CTO thinks IQ tests are essential for hiring project managers

""It probably wouldn't hurt if you slapped an IQ test in front of the PM in your process,”

""It wouldn't help differentiate between the excellent and super excellent, but it would help weed out people very early, and then you could spend more time differentiating between the good versus excellent and the rest of your process,""

20 experiments

“Like an interview that tests your ability to recall things, your experience, or just your mindsets, does not build a strong engineering team.

An interview that anyone can pass, regardless of IQ, if they can practice enough, that does not build a strong engineering team.”

“The reason that companies don't do it is that it just takes a ton of work to build a good process. Like in a tech org, you have dozens of different roles, and each one needs different interviews, so the leadership team needs to be really, really dedicated to it,”





CloudKitchens, the $15 billion ghost kitchen startup founded by Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick , finds that hiring project managers (PMs) is more challenging than hiring software engineers. According to CloudKitchens CTO Brian Atwell, the difficulty stems from the nature of the job itself. He explained that some of the responsibilities a project manager handles areTo improve its hiring process, the company is even considering expanding its use of intelligence testing, such as IQ tests, for more roles. The company's accounting team already uses these tests, Atwell revealed.On a podcast with Ryan Peterman, Atwell suggested that an IQ test could help the company hire project managers specifically.he suggested. While such tests wouldn't identify the absolute best candidates, Atwell said they are a good tool for early screening.he noted.Atwell stressed the need for a rigorous and dedicated hiring approach across the entire company.

""The Twenty Minute VC""

""hustle time,""

“It is absolutely nuts to me that you can find anyone’s email on the internet and just cold email them. I’m pretty sure if you’re a good enough stalker, because you have to be a stalker, by the way—everyone should learn to be a really efficient SDR, but essentially a stalker.”

How the venture capitalist convinced Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff for podcast

“super learnable”

“I would absolutely just relentlessly never give up,”

“You can actually leverage them to say, ‘Hey, I want to write an email to Marc Benioff, and I want to show that I’ve really done my work. What are five things that very few people know about Mark that would really impress him and add a layer of personalisation that not many people engage with? And they will tell you,”

“not nearly personalised enough,”

“needy”

“attention.”

“20VC podcast appearance”

“Who’s like, ‘I hope you’re unwell,’”

“Hi Marc, keeping things short out of respect for your time,”

“I would love to have you on 20VC.”

“we have X amount of subscribers, followers… and have had guests like X, Y, and Z.”

“Super simple: we require 30 minutes of time and it’s done on Riverside,”

“P.S. If you do it, I will send you a bottle of your favorite Macallan 75,”





Venture capital fund 20VC founder, Harry Stebbings, has revealed that he landed an interview with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on his podcast only after sending 53 cold emails. The 29-year-old entrepreneur and podcaster has also advised others looking to get the attention of top executives to learn how to bewhen using cold email. In 2023, Stebbings finally persuaded Benioff to appear on the show,, he noted. He credits hisin which he dedicates 30 minutes to each week, for successfully convincing most of his high-profile guests through cold emails.On an episode of The Biography Podcast, Stebbings said,Stebbings, who believes strong relationships help people succeed, says cold emailing is askill that anyone can improve at. After he got Benioff’s attention, he emailed him every week and tested different versions to see which messages felt the most personal. For example, he would mention Benioff’s favourite drink, his holiday home, his favourite vacation spot, Salesforce’s quarterly results, and other details.Stebbings noted. He also said that AI tools make personalisation even easier.Stebbings explained.Stebbings said people often make mistakes with cold emails when they areandas they don’t put in the effort.Cold emailing has helped many people build new relationships or grow their network, but Stebbings feels that most people don’t know how to do it well.

Not convincing: France on dismissing local browser's antitrust case against Microsoft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/not-convincing-france-on-dismissing-local-browsers-antitrust-case-against-microsoft/articleshow/125645258.cms,"What Microsoft said about French regulator’s decision

“We agree with the decision and remain committed to providing high-quality search services and fostering innovation for consumers and partners in France and across Europe.”

What French browser company Qwant alleged against Microsoft





France’s competition watchdog, the Autorité de la Concurrence, has rejected a complaint filed by the local search engine company Qwant against Microsoft. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Qwant had accused the software giant of unfairly leveraging its market power. The French regulator said that Qwant did not provide enough convincing evidence to support these serious claims. As a result, the case was dismissed, and the regulator also refused to impose any temporary penalties on Microsoft that Qwant had requested.Microsoft welcomed the French regulators' ruling. In a statement ot Reuters, a Microsoft spokesperson said:Qwant accused Microsoft of placing limits on how Qwant could appear in search results and search advertising, making it harder for the French company to build its own search engine and develop its own artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Qwant also claimed that Microsoft received better treatment when allocating search ads.The company has long relied on Microsoft’s Bing to provide search and news results.Last month, Qwant said it expected its complaint to be dismissed and planned to challenge the decision in court or take it to other authorities.Microsoft remains a major provider of search results to smaller European search engines, including Ecosia, DuckDuckGo, Lilo and Qwant.In September, Microsoft avoided a major European Union fine by agreeing to separate its Teams app from its Office software and offer lower-priced options. The European Commission accepted these commitments, bringing an end to a long antitrust investigation that began after complaints from rival companies.The case started with a 2020 complaint from Slack, which Salesforce owns. Slack said Microsoft unfairly bundled Teams with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 to gain an unfair market advantage. Another complaint was filed in 2023 by the German company Alfaview, which increased pressure on regulators.Under the agreement, Microsoft offered versions of Office 365 and Microsoft 365 without Teams at prices 1 to 8 euros lower. The company also agreed to increase the price difference between bundled and unbundled versions by 50% for some business plans.Beyond pricing, Microsoft agreed to improve interoperability between Teams competitors and its own products. It also allowed users to export Teams chats to rival services and gave long-term Office customers the option to move to unbundled versions. Most of these commitments were set to last 7 years, while data portability and interoperability commitments would remain in place for 10 years. These changes were applied globally, not only in Europe.EU executive VPTeresa Ribera said the decision opened up more competition and helped businesses choose the tools they preferred. The agreement marked a more cooperative stance from Microsoft, which had previously faced 2.2 billion euros in EU fines for similar issues. By settling, Microsoft avoided penalties that could have reached up to 10% of its global annual revenue.","Qwant accused Microsoft of placing limits on how Qwant could appear in search results and search advertising.

What is the EU’s Digital Markets Act



""gatekeeper""

Why Apple is resisting EU’s DMA on Maps and Ads







European Union (EU) antitrust regulators are set to investigate whether Apple Maps and Apple Ads should be subject to stricter rules under the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA). According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the Cupertino-based tech giant is resisting this move and has argued that both services should be exempted. The European Commission confirmed that Apple itself notified the regulator that both Apple Maps and Apple Ads have met the two thresholds required for potential designation as ""gatekeepers.""The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims to curb the power of major technology companies and boost competition. It assigns thelabel to companies with services that have over 45 million monthly active users and a market value exceeding €75 billion ($79 billion).Apple's App Store, iOS operating system, and Safari web browser were already designated as core platform services under the DMA two years ago. The Commission now has 45 working days to decide on the designation for Apple Maps and Apple Ads. If they are designated, Apple will then have six months to comply with the new rules.The Reuters report claims that Apple has said that it had sent official rebuttals to the EU competition authority.The company told Reuters that Apple Ads is a very small player in the EU’s online advertising market, with far less market share than competitors such as Google , Meta, Microsoft, TikTok, and X. The company also explained that it does not use data from other Apple services or from third-party services to run Apple Ads.Apple added that Apple Maps has minimal use in the EU compared to services like Google Maps and Waze, the Reuters report added. The company even said that the app lacks key features that would enable it to act as a middle layer, connecting businesses and users more directly.In September, Apple escalated its dispute with European regulators by warning that it might stop shipping iPhones and other products to the EU unless the Digital Markets Act (DMA) was repealed or changed.Apple said the law caused delayed features and added security risks for users in Europe. The company had already postponed iPhone Mirroring, Live Translation with AirPods, and new Maps features.The iPhone maker argued that the DMA’s rules forced Apple to allow third-party access to data, which reduced privacy and safety. Apple also said the law gave unfair advantages to competitors like Samsung. The European Commission had not yet responded, but previously upheld a €500 million fine against Apple.","EU antitrust regulators are set to investigate whether Apple Maps and Apple Ads should be subject to stricter rules under the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the Cupertino-based tech giant is resisting this move.

This follows their recent crackdown on calls. In a parallel development, the state is heavily promoting its own 'Superapp', MAX, which has drawn skepticism regarding its potential for user surveillance.

""If the messaging service continues to fail to meet the demands of Russian legislation, it will be completely blocked.""

How Russia is planning to replace WhatsApp

“Superapp,”

“sovereign internet,”





Russia's state communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, has reportedly threatened to block WhatsApp nationwide. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the country may put a total ban on the Meta-owned messaging service for failing to comply with Russian law. The watchdog specifically accused WhatsApp of failing to comply with Russian legal requirements aimed at preventing and combating crime. This threat follows earlier actions taken by Russia in August, when the country began limiting some calls on both WhatsApp and Telegram. At that time, authorities accused both foreign-owned platforms of refusing to share necessary information with law enforcement officials dealing with fraud and terrorism cases.The Reuters report cited the Interfax news agency to claim what Roskomnadzor said about Russia plans on banning WhatsApp. The Russian communications watchdog said:Meanwhile, WhatsApp has accused Moscow of trying to stop millions of Russians from using secure communication, the Reuters report added.Russian authorities are promoting a state-backed alternative app called MAX, which critics say could be used to track users. However, the country’s media has rejected those claims as false.Last month, Russia launched a major campaign to get people to download MAX, a government-backed messaging app. MAX is designed as acombining many digital services in one place, similar to apps like WeChat.The government is promoting the app everywhere through billboards, in schools, and by having it pre-installed on new phones. According to its parent company, more than 45 million people have created MAX accounts, and about 18 million use it every day.MAX, which was launched in March, can only be installed with Russian or Belarusian phone numbers. Virtual SIM cards are blocked, and people outside these countries cannot register, meaning Russians living abroad cannot use MAX unless they still have a Russian or Belarusian number.In August, the government announced that MAX would become a mandatory pre-installed app on all phones and tablets sold in Russia starting September 1. The app will be linked directly to state services.However, analysts say MAX is part of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s larger plan to control internet access and build what the government calls aseparate from Western technology.Meanwhile, another app, LIME HD TV, which streams state TV channels, will also be required on all smart TVs sold in Russia starting January 1, 2026.Russia is promoting domestic apps after placing limits on calls made through WhatsApp and Telegram. Authorities claim these companies did not cooperate with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases.WhatsApp, which had 97.3 million Russian users in July, accused Moscow of trying to block secure communication. Telegram, with 90.8 million users, said it works to prevent misuse. VK Messenger, which had 17.9 million users, is owned by the same state-controlled company that created MAX. Russian media also denies claims that MAX is a spying tool and collects less data than WhatsApp or Telegram.","Russia's state communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, has reportedly threatened to block WhatsApp nationwide.

How AI boom can hurt tech companies dependent on memory chips

“costs move at the rate”

“The cost basis is going up across all products.”

“We have entered an era in which supply is facing a bottleneck,”

“Everything that’s related to memory — advanced or conventional — is in very strong demand and supply is lagging.”





There are two major types of memory chips: some help computers process information, and others store data. Right now, chip makers are focusing more on advanced memory used in AI systems because these products are more complex and profitable. As a result, they are making fewer regular memory chips that devices like PCs and phones still need.In a statement to Bloomberg, Dell CEO Jeff Clarke said the company has never seenthey are today. Dell is struggling to find enough DRAM, including both high-bandwidth memory used for AI and the regular memory used in personal computers. The company is also short on hard drives and NAND flash memory.Clark notedDell will adjust its product options, but it has warned that customers will feel the impact. The company may raise prices. US sanctions have complicated matters by limiting what new Chinese chip companies can do, further cutting supply.Other tech companies face similar challenges. HP’s CEO Enrique Lores said the second half of 2026 will be challenging.The company plans to raise prices when needed.“For the second half, we are taking a prudent approach to our guide, while at the same time we’re implementing aggressive actions,” Lores said to Bloomberg. This includes finding more memory suppliers and using less memory inside products. HP says memory makes up 15% to 18% of the cost of a typical PC.While PC makers struggle, memory chip manufacturers are doing very well. Stock prices for Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron have risen as supplies shrink. SK Hynix has already sold out its entire memory chip supply for next year. Micron expects shortages to continue into 2026.SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won warned.Japan’s Kioxia has also seen its stock jump after its public listing. Analyst Sanjeev Rana said to Bloomberg:The shortage may also affect logic chips used for AI systems. Some customers may stop ordering if they cannot find enough memory chips to match them. SMIC, China’s leading chipmaker, warned that shortages may hurt car and electronics production in 2026.Xiaomi has already raised phone prices, while Lenovo and Asus have built up large stockpiles. On the other hand, Apple says that it is managing costs well.","Dell is struggling to find enough DRAM, including both high-bandwidth memory used for AI and the regular memory used in personal computers.

If you want help with time conversions, calculations, or scheduling, I can absolutely do that.”

“I don't have access to real-time information, so I can't tell you the current time. To find out what time it is, you can: “Check your phone, computer, or watch, ask a voice assistant like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant or look at a clock nearby. Is there anything else I can help you with?”

Why are some chatbots unable to tell the time





“

A language model works in its own space of language and words. It is only referencing things that have entered this space.”

“It’s like a castaway on an island in the middle of the ocean, stocked with a massive collection of books but no watch. Why can’t OpenAI just build a bridge to that island and give ChatGPT access to a system time clock? The short answer is, it can,” t

""If you start adding more things onto your desk, you have to eventually start pushing things off,""

""You might end up kind of confusing the robot,""

""It's able to tell the time if you give it access to a clock. Otherwise, it's something that was just born in that moment, in a way,""

""embedded in the context""

""Search""

What OpenAI said about ChatGPT’s time-telling ‘problem’





“The models powering ChatGPT don’t have built-in access to the current time, so for up-to-date facts ChatGPT sometimes needs to call search to pull in the latest information.”

“We’re continuing to improve how consistently it knows when to do so,”





ChatGPT can perform several complex tasks, such as browsing the web, writing code, and analysing images. However, the popular OpenAI chatbot isn’t capable of doing a basic thing: telling you the right time. When asked ""what is time right now,"" ChatGPT simply says that it cannot provide real-time information. When we at the TOI Tech desk asked this question, the chatbot replied:However, this isn’t only a ChatGPT problem; Anthropic’s Claude was also unable to tell us the time. On asking Claude the same question, the chatbot said:On the other hand, chatbots like Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot, and even Elon Musk’s xAI-owned Grok were able to display the exact time, along with our time zone and other details.In a statement to The Verge, AI robotics expert Yervant Kulbashian, who wrote about the concept of time as perceived by AI in 2024, said:he report noted.Kulbashian further explained that keeping AI models aware of time creates problems, as ChatGPT has limited space in its context window, the information it remembers at any given time. Each time ChatGPT checks a system clock, it adds information to that window.Kulbashian noted. If updated too often, constant clock information becomes confusing noise for the AI.Kulbashian said, comparing it to someone interrupting a conversation every minute to announce the time.So, ChatGPT users can ask the chatbot to search for the time directly. Meanwhile, some chatbots, like Google Gemini, search automatically. However, allowing AI models to search the web or access personal data carries risks, including exposure to malicious prompts online, Minervini warned.However, during an interview with The Verge, Pasquale Minervini, a natural language processing researcher at the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, has also demonstrated how his desktop ChatGPT app immediately showed him the correct time in Milan, Italy, where he was located.Minervini explained.The timely information was likelyof the app, he said. Earlier, Minervini turned on thefunction on the ChatGPT app, which allows ChatGPT to use his computer's built-in time tools, along with the web, to get the time.Minervini, who studies blind spots in consumer AI technology, said AI models struggle with many time-related tasks. When he showed leading AI models pictures of analogue clocks, they couldn't read the clock hands correctly. Calendars are ""also weird"" for AI, he noted.Meanwhile, OpenAI spokesperson Taya Christianson told The Verge:Christianson added.","ChatGPT can perform several complex tasks, such as browsing the web, writing code, and analysing images.

What ‘breakthrough’ caught Musk’s attention







At a time when tech giants like Google , Facebook-parent Meta and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI are offering massive salaries to secure top AI talent, two 22-year-old Chinese students have revealed they turned down a multi-million dollar offer from Elon Musk ’s xAI. The friends, William Chen and Guan Wang, have claimed that they rejected the highly lucrative pay package to pursue a greater, high-stakes gamble: building a “brain-inspired” reasoning system that they believe will be the first to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).According to a report by Fortune, Chen and Wang said that they received an offer from Musk two years ago, following the viral success of the small large-language model (LLM) the students had developed, called OpenChat. Instead of training their model on massive internet data dumps, Chen and Wang used a small, carefully chosen set of high-quality conversations. In the process, they also pioneered the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to teach the model to refine its behaviour through feedback and rewards.They said that OpenChat quickly became famous in academic circles, cited by researchers at Berkeley and Stanford as a prime example of how a small model trained on good data could outperform systems based on sheer volume of data.The attention OpenChat received quickly landed in Elon Musk’s inbox, resulting in the multi-million dollar recruitment offer from his new company, xAI. However, Chen and Wang chose to reject the deal, by saying that current large-scale machine learning architecture was fundamentally limited.“We decided that large-language models have their limitations. We want a new architecture that will overcome the structural limitation of [large-scale machine learning],” Chen was quoted as saying.The pair dedicated two years to launch their new company, Sapient Intelligence whose model reportedly shows promise, outperforming some of the world’s biggest existing AI systems on tests of abstract reasoning.","Two 22-year-old Chinese students have revealed they turned down a multi-million dollar offer from Elon Musk ’s xAI.

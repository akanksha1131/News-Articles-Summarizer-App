Pivotal Research raises Google stock price target





Analysts at Pivotal Research warned in a recent note to clients that should ChatGPT-maker OpenAI may cut its spending or face other issues due to its mounting obligations. “It is likely to temporarily get pretty ugly for AI stocks and the market in general,” warn analysts in the research note. “We believe the shakeout, if it happens, will mirror 2000 and will inevitably be a healthy weeding out process leaving fewer much more dominant competitors, with Google leading the way,” says the note.Pivotal analysts expects Google Gemini to gain market share against OpenAI. Google’s partnership with Apple AI is likely to accelerate gain in Gemini's marketshare over ChatGPT. The research firm's note suggests that this trend could put pressure on OpenAI by 2026, potentially forcing the competitor to reduce capital expenditures due to ""massive obligations and likely falling OpenAI share."" Pivotal Research also points to Google’s TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) technology as offering ""a sustainable competitive advantage"" that could become a significant value driver through sales to outside parties and potentially taking market share from Nvidia.Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak reportedly believes that Google's tensor processing units could become a ""material driver of value"" as Google sells its chips to third parties.In October, Anthropic struck an agreement with Google to access up to 1 million TPUs. Last month, a report from The Information suggested that Meta Platforms (META) is in talks to spend billions on Google's chips. According to the report, Google Cloud executives said that the company's TPU business could generate up to 10% of the annual revenue that Nvidia does. Wlodarczak believes Google's semiconductor advancements could take share from Nvidia and drive down the cost of its chips.Pivotal Research has raised its price target on Google-parent Alphabet stock to $400 from $350 while maintaining a 'Buy' rating, citing continued momentum in the company’s core business lines. The research firm highlights Alphabet’s search business as a ""resilient cash cow with pricing power"" that drives the company’s Gemini AI technology. Pivotal notes that as Gemini takes search share, the economics with device manufacturers improve compared to traditional search partnerships, potentially boosting margins. This aligns with Alphabet’s strong financial performance, with revenue reaching $385.48 billion and growing at 13.42% year-over-year.""Google appears to be the best positioned of its peers to monetize AI investment internally and externally,"" Wlodarczak wrote, citing the success of Gemini, the core search business and the custom silicon business.","Pivotal Research raised its price target on Google-parent Alphabet stock to $400 from $350 while maintaining a 'Buy' rating.

Reduced spam: By stopping the sale of personal data, users can expect a decrease in unwanted texts, “robocalls,” and emails.

By stopping the sale of personal data, users can expect a decrease in unwanted texts, “robocalls,” and emails. Greater security: Deleting data from broker databases reduces the possibility of identity theft, fraud and sophisticated AI impersonations.

Deleting data from broker databases reduces the possibility of identity theft, fraud and sophisticated AI impersonations. Personal safety: thirdly, limiting the availability of home addresses and family data provides a layer of protection against stalking and data leaks.

How DROP works

Residents of California must verify their eligibility, through the California Identity Gateway. Users can verify their status directly or via Login.gov.

Users provide basic identifiers.

One submission initiates the 90-day countdown for all registered brokers.





The State of California has officially launched the Delete Request and Opt-out Platform (DROP), a state-run service that will allow millions of residents to control their personal information by forcing hundreds of data brokers to delete their records. Positioned as a fast, free, and secure tool, DROP targets the sprawling industry of data brokers – companies that collect and sell all your data to other entities. This tool allows a single submission to reach over 500 registered data brokers simultaneously.Under California law, once a request is submitted via DROP, data brokers have a strict 90-day window to comply and delete the user's information.According to Official website of the State of California, there are three primary benefits for residents using the platform:While the service is currently restricted to California residents, the platform includes provisions for “Authorized Representatives.” This allows parents to submit requests for their minor children and family members to assist elderly relatives.To address potential concerns about state data collection, the platform emphasises that the information entered into DROP is never sold and is used exclusively to fulfill the deletion request.“Your information is only used to complete your request. It won’t be sold or shared for any other reason. You choose what information to provide. Data brokers only need basic information to find and delete the information they have about you. The personal information you give to DROP is protected and stored in a secure format,” the website said.Starting August 1, 2026, the 90-day deletion requirement becomes legally enforceable for all brokers receiving requests through the system.","The State of California has officially launched the Delete Request and Opt-out Platform (DROP), a state-run service that will allow millions of residents to control their personal information.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently took to blogging to share his views on artificial intelligence (AI) and more in 2026.

Nadella has titled the blog: Looking Ahead to 2026; and describes it as -- Notes on advances in technology and real-world impact. Nadella's ""Looking Ahead to 2026"" article offers an insight into the company's focus for the new year.""As I reflect on the past year and look toward the one ahead, there’s no question 2026 will be a pivotal year for AI. Yes, another one,"" Nadella opines. ""But this moment feels different in a few notable ways."" He added, ""We have moved past the initial phase of discovery and are entering a phase of widespread diffusion. We are beginning to distinguish between “spectacle” and “substance”. We now have a clearer sense of where the tech is headed, but also the harder and more important question of how to shape its impact on the world.

""A new concept that evolves “bicycles for the mind” such that we always think of AI as a scaffolding for human potential vs a substitute.What matters is not the power of any given model, but how people choose to apply it to achieve their goals.

Struggles faced by Tesla

Challenges ahead

Fierce competition from local rivals such as Geely.

A government crackdown on EV discounting.

A 10% drop in December sales and a 20% fall in stock price over the past six months.





Tesla CEO Elon Musk once laughed at the idea of Chinese automaker BYD becoming a serious rival to Tesla. However, the situation completely turned in 2025. The Shenzhen-based company has now overtaken Tesla to become the world’s largest seller of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). BUD has reported sales of 2.25 million BEVs in 2025, a 28% jump from the previous year. Tesla, by contrast, sold 1.64 million units, an 8.5% decline. This is the first time since 2018 that Tesla has lost its crown as the top BEV seller.The rise of BYD has been fuelled by its diverse product lineup which ranges from $200,000 supercars to the $7,800 Seagull hatchback. Along with this, the technological innovation including five‑minute EV charging and free autonomous driving features also played an important role in the growth of the company. Also, the strong international expansion with its plans to open 1,000 new stores in Europe after outselling Tesla there for the first time in May 2025.The company, once backed by Warren Buffett, also shipped 4.6 million vehicles in 2024 when plug‑in hybrids were included — a segment Tesla does not compete in.The downturn of Tesla comes amid a turbulent year. The Q4 sales of the company fell by 16% year‑over‑year after the U.S. removed a $7,500 EV tax credit in September, triggering an industry‑wide slump. Also, the sales of the company collapsed in Europe amid backlash over Musk’s political views. Additionally, in China, Tesla faced intense competition from a wave of affordable, high‑tech EVs led by BYD.Despite its success, BYD has faced headwinds:Still, BYD’s global ambitions and expanding footprint suggest it is well‑positioned to maintain momentum.","The rise of BYD has been fuelled by its diverse product lineup which ranges from $200,000 supercars to the $7,800 Seagull hatchback.

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

iPhone Fold expected design and features



iPhone Fold expected price







Apple is expected to launch its first foldable smartphone next year. Now, the long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders offering a clear look at the design of first foldable iPhone. As per the YouTube channel Front Page Tech and popular tipper Ice Universe, the design of Apple’s first foldable iPhone may resemble to Google’s Pixel Fold. As per the images leaked online, the yet-to-launch foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style foldable design.As per the leaks, the upcoming foldable iPhone is said to feature a large internal display and a smaller cover screen. The renders also highlight a minimal crease along with fold area where rival devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold have often drawn criticism. The design appears to prioritize durability and a seamless viewing experience, aligning with Apple’s reputation for premium hardware aesthetics.“The comparison of the design of the Samsung Galaxy Wide Fold and the Apple iPhone Fold is almost identical, with the only difference being the R-angle. Samsung is more square, while Apple is more rounded. Do you prefer the square one or the rounder one?,” wrote Ice Universe.Early leaks suggest that the first foldable iPhone may look and function differently from the current iPhone lineup. It is expected that the foldable iPhone may ditch the Face ID in order to accommodate the thinner foldable design. It is also said that the company may include a 24MP under-display selfie camera which will offer a cleaner and uninterrupted look to the display. The is also tipped that the foldable iPhone may feature another 24MP camera on the cover display making it easier for the users to take selfies or answer video calls.On the back, the foldable iPhone may feature a dual-lens setup with two 48MP sensors — one standard and one ultrawide — but no telephoto lens. This simplified camera system seems to be a design trade-off to maintain the slim build that a foldable phone requires. While the camera specs may sound modest compared to Apple’s Pro models, the focus for this device appears to be on delivering a sleek design, new display technology, and the flexibility of a foldable form factor.Multiple online rumours suggest that the upcoming Foldable iPhone may be priced around $2,399.","The long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders.

He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that he holds only American passport, and plans to live and die in the US. Musk’s statement was shared by X (formerly Twitter) user DogeDesigner who quoted the tech billionaire as saying: “I hold one passport now & forever: America. I will live & die here. Or Mars (part of America).”Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa on June 28, 1971. His mother, Maye Musk is a Canadian citizen that enabled him to get Canadian citizenship in 1989 at the age of 17. In the same year, he enrolled at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. In 1992, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania in the United States under a J-1 Exchange Visit.A J-1 visa is a US exchange visitor visa that allows foreign nationals to visit the country to take part in approved cultural and educational exchange programmes. It is commonly used by students, researchers, teachers, interns, trainees, professors, scholars and medical residents.J-1 visa holders usually come to the US for a fixed period, depending on their programme. In some cases, they must return to their home country for at least two years after the programme ends before applying for certain other US visas or permanent residency. This is known as the two-year home residency requirement.Now the world’s richest person, Musk became a naturalized US citizen in 2002.In 2024, the Washington Post reported that Musk began his career working illegally in the US when he was building a Silicon Valley startup in the 1990s. Video of the then US President Joe Biden referencing the report’s claims went viral on X. Responding to one such video, the tech billionaire denied working without authorization in the US.“I was in fact allowed to work in the US,” Musk wrote, accusing Biden of lying.Elon Musk has 12 children with three different partners.

Google shares 5 ways AI agents may reshape work in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-shares-5-ways-ai-agents-may-reshape-work-in-2026/articleshow/126321336.cms,"5 ways AI agents will transform the work in 2026



1. AI agents will help everyone be more productive.

Google Search AI Mode launched in India: Does it really make your search smarter?

2. Agentic workflows will become a core part of business processes.

3. Agents will bring five-star experiences to life for everyone.

4. AI agents will supercharge security operations.



5. Companies will double down on training an AI-ready workforce.





As we step into 2026, Google has shared a live blog listing 5 ways artificial intelligence (AI) agents will reshape the work. Releasing its 2026 AI Agent Trends Report, the tech giant said “We’re moving away from abstract, future-gazing possibilities, and focusing on delivering tangible business value right now. AI agents can now understand a goal, semi-autonomously develop a multi-step plan, and take actions on your behalf — all under your expert guidance and oversight.” Here’s a look at the five key trends that are defining where agents will fundamentally reshape business and drive new value in 2026Employees will now be able to delegate tasks to different AI agents to reach their goals, shifting their daily work from routine execution to higher-level strategic direction. AI is already becoming a core driver of work from the start: More than 57,000 team members at Telus are regularly using AI and saving 40 minutes per AI interaction. Meanwhile, Suzano, the world's largest pulp manufacturer, developed an AI agent with Gemini Pro that translates natural language questions into SQL code — resulting in a 95% reduction in the time required for queries among 50,000 employees.Multiple agents in a system can collaborate, coordinate and communicate to automate complex, multi-step processes.This sophisticated automation goes far beyond chatbots to answer questions, so AI can support specific functions with higher business value.In 2026, we’ll see businesses start connecting agents according to their needs and requirements, running entire workflows from start to finish. For example, Salesforce and Google Cloud are building cross-platform AI agents using the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol — a leap forward in establishing an open, interoperable foundation for agentic enterprises.The era of scripted chatbots and reactive customer service is coming to an end. In the coming year, we’ll see agents speeding up this shift — establishing hyperpersonalized, “concierge-style” service as the new standard for customer interactions.For example, global manufacturer Danfoss is using AI agents to automate email-based order processing, automating 80% of transactional decisions and reducing the average customer response from 42 hours to near real time.In a modern security operation center (SOC), human analysts are often overwhelmed by a constant stream of data and alerts. AI agents offer security teams the extra power and coverage they need to identify and respond to threats even faster. Macquarie Bank provides efficient, proactive fraud protection and digital self-service capabilities with Google Cloud AI, directing 38% more users towards self-service and reducing false positive alerts by 40%.We predict 2026 will be the year AI agents take over the most taxing security operations work, automating manual tasks like alert triage and investigation. This will allow human analysts to dedicate their focus to their most critical work: hunting threats and developing next-generation defenses.Adopting the latest AI technology and tools is only the first step. The biggest challenge — and the most critical factor for success — is people. During 2026, organizations will move from simply buying AI to building an AI-ready workforce, transitioning away from one-off training toward developing adaptable, continuous learning plans. These programs provide hands-on practice with real-world scenarios, allowing employees to build the AI skills they need at their own pace and on their own schedule.",Google has released its 2026 AI Agent Trends Report.

Minnesota Somali fraud





Reacting sharply to an online video allegedly threatening his life, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has declared war. A Somali-American woman recently said during a TikTok livestream that the tech billionaire is “about to die” soon, stating she “wouldn't worry too much about him. ” A clip from the livestream was shared on X (formerly Twitter) by user DogeDesigner. The tech billionaire, who appeared to take the comment as death threat, replied saying “Then it is war”.The livestream was posted by a Somali TikToker who went by the name ""Dowza.z”. According to a Fox News report, the account has since been deleted. In the video, the TikToker is seen switching back and forth from speaking in Somali and English, discussing Musk’s recent criticisms of Somali-run businesses engaged in rampant fraud in Minnesota. But her statement on Musk was said in English.Interestingly, Musk has pinned the post on this Twitter timeline which has now crossed more than 44 million views so far.Popular conservative account Libs of TikTok also shared the clip on Twitter, urging that the FBI ""should definitely look into this."" DogeDesigner also shared post, writing “Protect Elon Musk at all costs.”Sharing an X post, conservative commentator Eric Daugherty wrote, ""When fraud is exposed - it's always the fraudsters who yell and complain the loudest.Their THEFT will come to an end.""Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee posted on his personal X account, ""Deport her immediately,"" adding, ""She shouldn’t be here.""Recently, the Trump administration launched a probe into Minnesota's ""Feeding Our Future"" $250 million fraud scheme that allegedly targeted a children's nutrition program the Department of Agriculture funded and that Minnesota oversaw during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Indra Nooyi got her inspiration from pop culture







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Apple founder Steve Jobs, billionaire and philanthropist Melinda French Gates, and former Pepsi Co chief executive Indra Nooyi have at least two things in common: first, that they have led or worked in the world’s biggest companies, and second, they have all got life-changing advice from unlikeliest of places and people – ranging from a competing hiring manager to an elderly gardener in Tokyo.For Jensen Huang, CEO of the world’s biggest company by market cap Nvidia, has previously shared that the secret to corporate endurance didn't come from a tech seminar, but from a temple garden in Japan. While observing an elderly gardener meticulously tending to moss with a pair of bamboo tweezers, Huang asked how he could possibly maintain such a vast property with such a tiny tool.“He said something that is perfect. He said, ‘I have plenty of time.’ That’s the best career advice I can give you…Most of the time, I wait for things to come to me. I’m rarely chasing things,” Huang recalled at the Chinese American Semiconductor Professional Association in 2023, as per a report by Fortune.When Apple was considering moving away from big-box retailers like Sears, Jobs sought advice from Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH. Arnault was a master of high-end brick-and-mortar luxury, and encouraged Jobs to pursue the then-radical idea of standalone Apple Stores.“Everybody thought it’s completely crazy to sell Apple products in a shop,” Arnault recalled during a 2016 interview at the Oxford Union. He said that even Michael Dell, Dell Technologies CEO, thought it would never work.“I must say, I was myself a little doubtful of selling [iPods in shops]…But it was working,” he added.Melinda French Gates is now one of the world's leading philanthropists but she owes her start at Microsoft to a woman who was supposed to be hiring her for IBM. After interning at IBM for two summers, French Gates was ready to sign her full-time offer when she mentioned she had one final interview with a ""tiny"" Seattle startup.“My hiring manager at IBM said to me, ‘If they give you an offer, you should take it,’” French Gates recalled. The manager explained that the rapid growth at Microsoft would allow a young recruit to ascend the ranks much faster than the established hierarchy at IBM.She took the advice, moved to the West Coast, and spent nine years at Microsoft, ultimately becoming a key architect of the company’s rise into a $3.6 trillion titan.Unlike French Gates and Huang, unconventional advice can also come from television screen.Indra Nooyi, the former PepsiCo CEO, credited the TV show Sex and the City with teaching her about female leadership. Watching the 94-episode run, Nooyi was struck by the ""sisterhood"" of the characters.“They never judged each other; they supported each other,” Nooyi said in 2019, using the show as a blueprint for reducing unconscious bias and internal competition among women in the workplace.","Jensen Huang, CEO of the world’s biggest company by market cap Nvidia, has previously shared that the secret to corporate endurance didn't come from a tech seminar, but from a temple garden in Japan.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

“We believe initial versions of the robot will likely have a limited set of performable tasks. Given Tesla’s competitive advantages in embodied AI and manufacturing scale, we expect the company to be a formidable competitor in the space.”

How Tesla's Optimus robot may still need to learn indoor movement and user safety



""All of the activities were 'learnt direction from human videos,'”

""Even a child could clear a dinner table,""

""with a humanoid, if you cut the power, it's inherently unstable so it can fall on someone, for a factory, a warehouse or agriculture, legs are often inferior to wheels.”

“Who wouldn't want their own personal C-3PO/R2-D2? This is why I say human. Old robots will be the biggest product ever. Because everyone is gonna want one, or more than one.""





Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot may not be as advanced yet as the company’s CEO, Elon Musk , has suggested. Although Musk has assured investors that a robot could generate infinite revenue for Tesla and become its most vital product, a report shows it still has a long way to go to achieve such ambitious projections. Last year, Musk placed major bets on Optimus, envisioning a future where these robots work in factories, handle household tasks, perform surgeries, and even help colonise Mars. He has suggested manufacturing millions of robots annually and claims they could eliminate poverty and the need for work, though each robot is currently made by hand.However, Optimus still requires significant development before it can replace humans on a widespread scale as Musk envisions, a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report suggests. During public appearances, the robot is often remotely controlled by human engineers rather than operating independently, the report notes. Tesla engineers have even struggled to create robot hands that match human sensitivity and dexterity, the report added. Additionally, some employees within Musk's companies have also reportedly questioned whether the robots are actually helpful for routine business operations, such as manufacturing.Some analysts find it hard to put a value on Tesla’s humanoid robot plans because the industry is still very new, so they leave it out of their financial forecasts, the report continues. Even ARK Invest, which is very optimistic about Tesla and expects its share price to rise sharply, did not include the Optimus robot in its 2029 estimates, as it does not expect the robot to be a successful commercial product until later.In an email sent to WSJ, Tasha Keeney, a director at ARK Invest, wrote,According to the report, Tesla is facing a major challenge in teaching Optimus to navigate indoor spaces without tripping or falling onto people or pets. The company tried to solve this by hiring people to wear cameras and backpacks and collect training data during 24/7 shifts. Tesla even trained the robots to walk through the Tesla offices. The robots frequently toppled over to the point that the engineers had to come to pick them up.In October 2024, Musk revealed his vision at the Warner Bros. soundstage in California. Five Dancing Optimus bots performed to the song ""What Is Love"" by Haddaway. Others bartended wearing cowboy hats and bow ties. But in the background, something else was brewing, the report notes.While some robots were programmed to dance, others were actually controlled by engineers wearing bodysuits and VR headsets. Each robot required several engineers: one to teleoperate its movements, one with a laptop, and others to monitor its performance, the report added.Inside Tesla's lab, Optimus showed promise with simple tasks. In May 2025, the company released a video of Optimus putting trash in bins, vacuuming, and moving car parts.according to the company. Despite this progress, some Tesla engineers doubted the robot's usefulness in a factory, believing most jobs are better suited to task-specific robots.Berkeley roboticist Ken Goldberg highlighted to WSJ that the core challenge is to give robots human-like dexterity and environmental understanding.Goldberg noted, showing how far robots must go.Some competitors argue that legs are the problem. Standard Bots CEO Evan Beard, whose company sells wheeled robots, explained to WSJ thatTesla has abandoned its original factory deployment timeline and is working on the third generation. Still, Musk envisions Optimus as a household helper.In November 2025, Musk said,","Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot may not be as advanced yet as the company’s CEO, Elon Musk, has suggested.

Xu Bo, the billionaire founder of one of China’s largest mobile gaming empires, is reportedly attempting to biologically engineer a US-born dynasty.

Forbes claimed that even Bo has fantasized about his American kids marrying Musk’s children in the future.In November last year, Xu’s ex-girlfriend alleged that he had 300 children living around the world – a claim that has been outrightly denied by his company. Another Weibo account verified (by The Wall Street Journal) as being operated by Xu wrote in 2023 that he hoped to have “50 high-quality sons.”“Xu Bo had several children (all of mixed Chinese and Jewish descent) who were taken away in the United States due to sabotage by feminists and malicious rulings by a female judge,” the account posted in April 2024, seeming to refer to the confidential hearing that Xu had attended the year before.“Later, appeals were filed, and all the cases that went to trial were won.

Vinod Khosla, American billionaire and Silicon Valley’s famous investor has sided with Tesla CEO Elon Musk ’s endorsement of having a universal US digital ID and voter ID laws, inspired by Aadhaar Card that has authenticated billions of users and reduced fraud. He also said that it is opt-in but people who do not have it face inconvenience.“Another thing we agree on.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman describes head of preparedness job ‘stressful’

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s post on hiring head of preparedness

We are hiring a Head of Preparedness. This is a critical role at an important time; models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges. The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities.

We have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities, but we are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides both in our products and in the world, in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits. These questions are hard and there is little precedent; a lot of ideas that sound good have some real edge cases.

If you want to help the world figure out how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can't use them for harm, ideally by making all systems more secure, and similarly for how we release biological capabilities and even gain confidence in the safety of running systems that can self-improve, please consider applying.

This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.





OpenAI is hiring for a role the company describes as ‘head of preparedness’. As per a job post listing, OpenAI’s head of preparedness will lead the Safety Systems team that was created in 2024. At the time, the safety systems team was led by CEO Sam Altman, along with board members Adam D’Angelo and Nicole Seligman. “The Safety Systems team ensures that OpenAI’s most capable models can be responsibly developed and deployed,” the listing says, adding “you will lead a small, high-impact team to drive core Preparedness research, while partnering broadly across Safety Systems and OpenAI for end-to-end adoption and execution of the framework.”“OpenAI has invested deeply in Preparedness across multiple generations of frontier models, building core capability evaluations, threat models, and cross-functional mitigations,” the listing reads.“The Head of Preparedness will expand, strengthen, and guide this program so our safety standards scale with the capabilities of the systems we develop,” it further adds.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also shared the hiring post on X (formerly Twitter) where he described the role as ""critical” and “stressful”.“We are hiring a Head of Preparedness,” Sam Altman wrote, adding “This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.” “If you want to help the world figure out how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can't use them for harm, ideally by making all systems more secure, and similarly for how we release biological capabilities and even gain confidence in the safety of running systems that can self-improve, please consider applying,” he added.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman describes head of preparedness job ‘stressful’ “We are hiring a Head of Preparedness.

She explained that extreme achievers like Musk possess an ""insane work ethic"" and prioritize their goals by declining distractions. This relentless focus, even at the cost of personal comfort, fueled his rise to the top.

The obsession that fuelled Musk’s extraordinary achievement

Elon Musk’s emotional intensity behind his ruthless exterior





Justine Musk, the Canadian author and first wife of Elon Musk, has offered rare insights into the personality traits that propelled the Tesla CEO to become the world's richest man. In a widely-cited 2015 Quora response and her 2013 TEDxOlympicBlvdWomen talk, Justine—who shares five sons with Musk—identified two defining characteristics that separate extreme achievers like her ex-husband from everyone else: relentless obsession and the strategic power of saying no.""He worked very hard—much harder than your average bear—and he said no a lot,"" Justine revealed during her TEDx talk, describing how she watched Musk rise to unprecedented success. ""He said no to people who wanted his time and attention and energy. And I realized that behind every no there is a deeper yes to whatever it is that you do want.""In her detailed Quora essay titled ""How to be Elon Musk,"" Justine emphasized that extreme success demands extreme personality traits. ""Be obsessed. Be obsessed. Be obsessed,"" she wrote emphatically. ""If you're not obsessed, then stop what you're doing and find whatever does obsess you.""She explained that individuals like Musk combine brilliance with an ""insane work ethic"" that goes beyond normal ambition. ""These people tend to be freaks and misfits who were forced to experience the world in an unusually challenging way,"" Justine noted, adding that people who develop singular ways of surviving and, later, leverage the insights from those processes for extraordinary business and innovation advantages.Justine Musk's 2010 Marie Claire essay criticized Elon Musk for his emotional distance during their 2000-2008 marriage, especially after their firstborn Nevada's tragic death from SIDS at 10 weeks. Yet, she still respected his visionary gifts. In response, Musk spoke publicly, praising Justine as ""an amazing woman"" and underscoring the mutual admiration that endured even as they moved toward divorce.Providing a complementary view, Talulah Riley-Musk's second wife, whom he married and divorced twice between 2010 and 2016-offers perspectives mirroring this sentiment. In a 2022 BBC documentary, Riley described Musk as ""the most emotional person I know"" and recounted how he once trudged barefoot through a Colorado blizzard on Christmas Eve to retrieve flowers after realizing he'd forgotten her gift while juggling Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity pressures.Justine's core message remains clear: extreme success requires sacrificing conventional happiness for singular obsession and ruthlessly protecting focus through strategic rejection—traits that defined Musk's journey to the top.","Elon Musk's ex-wife, Justine, revealed the secrets behind his immense success: an all-consuming obsession and the power of strategic 'no' She explained that extreme achievers like Musk possess an ""insane work ethic"" and prioritize their goals by declining distractions.

Moving a city amid Europe’s minerals push





Europe, like many other parts of the world, is trying to reduce its dependence on importing these key metals from China. The focus is on recycling rare earths that are already in Europe. And the ripple effects from Europe’s growing appetite for rare earths raw materials extend all the way to Sweden’s far North. According to a report in CNBC, thousands of residents and buildings are being uprooted in Kiruna, a city that lies 145 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle. The relocation project is reported to be one of the world’s most radical urban transformations. Rare Earth minerals is group of 17 metals are essential to huge amounts of modern technology such as smartphones, electric vehicles and wind turbines and MRI scanners.Kiruna is physically on the move because of ground subsidence from the expansion of a sprawling underground iron ore mine. A new home for city's residents is reportedly being created about three kilometers east of the old town. The plan, which intends to boost investment in strategic projects, is designed to help break China’s long-held mineral dominance. “It’s a place that would seem exotic to so many and, in a way, I guess it is, but also it is a small town like so many others — struggling with what they are struggling with and challenged by being so dependent on one company,” Jennie Sjöholm, senior lecturer at Sweden’s University of Gothenburg, told CNBC by video call.Established 125 years ago as a city for the iron ore mining operations of state-owned firm LKAB, Kiruna serves as both a significant European space hub and home to the world’s largest underground iron ore mine. LKAB is a significant regional player, accounting for 80% of all iron ore mined in the European Union. LKAB recently identified one of Europe’s largest known deposits of rare earths, further strengthening its position in the extraction of essential materials for the green transition.Mats Taaveniku, chairman of the municipal council in Kiruna, told CNBC that the city’s relocation is a “huge project,” that could yield major opportunities for Europeans for decades to come. He said that a successful outcome will lead to greater financial and political support from both the Swedish government and the European Union. “We have what we can call a big fight between the municipality and LKAB, and the municipality and our own government,” Taaveniku told CNBC by video call.","Thousands of residents and buildings are being uprooted in Kiruna, a city 145 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle.

This innovation challenges the notion that advanced AI necessitates massive computing power, following their previous success with the R1 model. The breakthrough intensifies industry debates on scaling AI, with expectations high for DeepSeek's next model release.

DeepSeek's January 2026 research validates its January 2025's market wave

Scaling debate intensifies in the industry as costs mount





Chinese AI startup DeepSeek started the year 2026 with the publication of research that could vindicate its earlier claims of training world-class models on a shoestring budget. That same approach has wiped nearly $600 billion off the market value of Nvidia in a single day last January. Furthermore, the release of chatbot last year, had made ChatGPT-maker issue companywide ""code red,"" while also worrying other AI giants like Google, Anthropic, Meta, and more.The Hangzhou-based company published a technical paper on January 1st that introduces ""Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections"" (mHC), a training method that will allow AI models to scale without ballooning computational costs. Co-authored by founder Liang Wenfeng, the breakthrough directly takes on the industry-wide consensus that the smarter AI is, the more computing power and chips it requires.The innovation arrives nearly a year after DeepSeek's R1 model sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley by matching ChatGPT's performance at reportedly a fraction of development costs. Back then, Nvidia scrambled to contain investor panic, insisting DeepSeek's efficiency gains would actually boost chip demand during AI ""inference""—when models serve users at scale.""Inference requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs,"" the chipmaker stated in January 2025, attempting to reassure markets even as its stock plummeted 17%. Nvidia acknowledged DeepSeek had used export-compliant H800 chips to achieve competitive results, raising uncomfortable questions about whether US export controls were achieving their intended effect.DeepSeek's latest mHC paper provides technical depth behind those earlier claims. Testing models up to 27 billion parameters, the company's 19 researchers demonstrated ""superior scalability"" with ""negligible computational overhead""—essentially proving one can build powerful AI without matching the massive chip purchases of OpenAI or Google.The release also triggered OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to declare ""code red"" in January 2025—one of several emergency mobilizations the company has initiated when competitive threats emerge. Altman recently told the Big Technology Podcast that OpenAI expects to sound such alarms ""once maybe twice a year for a long time"" as rivals close in.The research sharpens a fundamental debate splitting AI leaders. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis told December's Axios AI+ Summit that ""we must push [scaling] to the maximum"" to reach artificial general intelligence, though even he conceded the industry likely needs ""one or two"" breakthroughs beyond raw compute.Meanwhile, OpenAI's Sam Altman wrote in his recent 10-year anniversary reflection that superintelligence appears ""almost certain"" within a decade—a timeline predicated on continued massive infrastructure spending across the industry.Industry analyst Wei Sun of Counterpoint Research called DeepSeek's mHC method a ""striking breakthrough"" that enables the company to ""bypass compute bottlenecks and unlock leaps in intelligence."" Omdia's Lian Jye Su noted the willingness to publish such foundational research ""showcases newfound confidence in the Chinese AI industry.""Expectations are building for DeepSeek's next flagship model—possibly R2 or V4—around February's Spring Festival, continuing the company's pattern of releasing major innovations during China's holiday period.","Chinese AI firm DeepSeek unveiled a groundbreaking training method, ""Manifold- Constrained Hyper-Connections,"" potentially slashing AI development costs.

Philosophical divide: Why LeCun calls LLMs a ""dead end""

""Young and inexperienced"": LeCun's assessment of his former boss





AI pioneer and Meta’s most famous employee Yann LeCun has opened up about his departure from Meta after more than a decade, revealing that mounting pressure from CEO Mark Zuckerberg and fundamental disagreements over the company's AI direction ultimately drove him to leave. In an interview with the Financial Times, the 65-year-old computer scientist—who won the prestigious Turing Award in 2018—didn't mince words about Meta's pivot toward large language models and the hiring of 28-year-old Alexandr Wang to lead the company's superintelligence efforts.LeCun told FT that Zuckerberg ""basically lost confidence"" in Meta's generative AI organization after the team ""fudged"" benchmark results for Llama 4, released in April 2025. ""Mark was really upset and basically sidelined the entire GenAI organisation,"" LeCun said, predicting that ""a lot of people who haven't yet left will leave.""The departure marks a significant split between LeCun's vision for AI and Meta's current direction. Whereas Zuckerberg has spent billions developing large language models in the quest for ""superintelligence,"" LeCun has long maintained that LLMs are by nature limited.""I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence,"" he told the publication.LeCun's new startup, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, will focus on ""world models"" that learn from videos and spatial data rather than just text—an approach he believes is necessary for AI to truly understand the physical world.The French scientist didn't hold back when discussing Wang, who Meta hired after investing $14.9 billion in his company Scale AI. ""He learns fast, he knows what he doesn't know... There's no experience with research or how you practice research,"" LeCun said, adding pointedly: ""You don't tell a researcher what to do. You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do.""Despite the tensions, LeCun maintains he remains on good terms with Zuckerberg personally, and Meta will partner with his new venture.","Yann LeCun is leaving Meta after a decade, citing disagreements with CEO Mark Zuckerberg over the company's AI strategy.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ advice to young people





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has revealed the single and most important factor behind the company’s trillion-dollar success: “obsessive, compulsive focus on the customer” rather than on competitors. Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington, Bezos stressed on the fact that many of the CEOs and founders claim that they prioritise customers but in reality they spend most of their time in keeping a close watch on their rivals. “It is a huge advantage to any company if you can stay focused on your customer instead of your competitor,” he said.Amazon’s career page lists 14 leadership principles and ‘customer obsession’ tops the list. The philosophy urges leaders to “start with the customer and work backwards” to earn and keep trust. Bezos feels that it is always important to identify your true customer. “It is a huge advantage to any company if you can stay focused on your customer instead of your competitor. So then you have to identify who is your customer,” said Bezos.At the Washington Post, for example, he said the customer is the reader, not advertisers.“Advertisers want to be where there are readers. So, it’s really not complicated,” he noted.Bezos pointed to Amazon Prime as a prime example of customer‑driven innovation. Launched in 2005 with free and fast shipping, the service was initially criticized as “too good to be true.” Yet its focus on consumer needs proved transformative.Jeff Bezos shared an important and surprising piece of advice for young people who are dreaming of entrepreneurial success. Bezos said ‘Go work at McDonald’s.’ As reported by Fortune, in a recent interview, Bezos stressed on the importance of early work experience especially in the fast-paced, customer-facing environment. “I always advise young people: Go work at McDonald’s,” Bezos said. “You learn responsibility. You learn how to show up. You learn how to deal with people. You learn how to hustle.”For those unaware, Bezos started Amazon out of his garage in 1994. He believes that entry-level jobs such as those at McDonald’s tech foundational skills which are important for long term success. He emphasised that such small roles are necessary as they instill skill like discipline, resilience and the ability to handle pressure.

Starlink is beginning a significant reconfiguration of its satellite constellation focused on increasing space safety. We are lowering all @Starlink satellites orbiting at ~550 km to ~480 km (~4400 satellites) over the course of 2026. The shell lowering is being tightly coordinated with other operators, regulators, and USSPACECOM.

Lowering the satellites results in condensing Starlink orbits, and will increase space safety in several ways. As solar mininum approaches, atmospheric density decreases which means the ballistic decay time at any given altitude increases - lowering will mean a >80% reduction in ballistic decay time in solar minimum, or 4+ years reduced to a few months. Correspondingly, the number of debris objects and planned satellite constellations is significantly lower below 500 km, reducing the aggregate likelihood of collision.

Starlink satellites have extremely high reliability, with only 2 dead satellites in its fleet of over 9000 operational satellites. Nevertheless, if a satellite does fail on orbit, we want it to deorbit as quickly as possible. These actions will further improve the safety of the constellation, particularly with difficult to control risks such as uncoordinated maneuvers and launches by other satellite operators.

‘996’: Hustle culture trend taking hold in Silicon Valley

Why 'shoe-less' trend may not go mainstream





Some startups in America are embracing a ""no shoes"" policy. According to a report in the New York Times, ""The “no shoes” trend is spreading in tech offices, with buzzy start-ups telling employees to leave their Vans and Uggs at the door. "" The list of such startups includes Cursor, Replo and Composite. Ben Lang, an employee at Cursor, wrote in a social media post, ""I’ve only worked at startups that have a no-shoes in office policy.""Sneha Sivakumar, a co-founder and the chief executive of Spur, told New York Times that the no-shoes policy “makes it feel like a second home” for her 10 employees and “disarms you in a positive way.” Spur uses AI to check websites for bugs. The report quotes Nick Bloom, a Stanford economist who studies work culture, saying that the shoes-off trend was partly “the pajama economy in action.” According to Bloom, now that people who worked from home during the pandemic are back in the office, they are bringing their home habits with them.Analysts are also linking the phenomenon with Silicon Valley's 996 culture. The 996 number combo refers to a work schedule — 9 a.m.to 9 p.m., six days a week — that has its origins in China’s hard-charging tech scene. Though analysts say that the term is relatively new in Silicon Valley, 996 is a “high-octane version of something that has been around in the tech industry for a while,” said Margaret O’Mara, a historian at the University of Washington as per an NY Times report.She added that after a few turbulent years of layoffs, the tech industry has tightened things up. Elon Musk’s self-proclaimed “extremely hard core” approach is no longer out of step with the rest of the industry. Silicon Valley’s “hard tech” era is here, and working crazy hours (or at least talking about working crazy hours) is part of the new norm.Still, the practice is unlikely to become the go-to in American offices. As the New York Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman has written, feet “are among the most controversial, least discussed parts of the body.” Another reason the trend may struggle to catch on in more age-diverse workplaces is because as per Friedman, “Young people have great feet,” he reflected. “Old people don’t.”","Some startups in America are embracing a ""no shoes"" policy.

One Easter egg is from the popular sci-fi series offered by Netflix entitled ‘Stranger Things.’ The series has long fascinated audiences with the eerie world of its alternate dimension called the Upside Down. The Easter egg related to this series is very subtle because it does not intend to be noticed or heard. This Easter egg has not been designed for any specific device because it only lasts for an instance.The Stranger Things Google Easter egg is a visual effect that occurs on the actual page displaying the search results. The visual effect gives the appearance of the actual page being turned upside down, much like the Upside Down of the series. It’s not like other games or animations where the goal is to have the user actively engage with it, and this particular Easter egg is kept purposefully simple, using only distortion and rotation to unsettle the user, which is much like the series. It subtly reinforces the show’s eerie tone without distracting users.When this happens, the Easter egg triggers a subtle manipulation of how the page is presented. It is not immediate or drastic, which is why many people manage to overlook the occurrence the first time. The page might revolve slowly, and/or everything seems to be turned upside down or like it is somehow out of place, much like the heroes in the Netflix series recognize an infusion of the Upside Down into their world.The Upside Down effect can easily be activated; it just requires good timing and attention.To access it:It might not happen immediately, so it is very important to give it a little time to take effect.The Easter egg will also be optimised for functionality on both desktop and mobile platforms, albeit with a subtle variation based on the platform and operating system being utilised.Despite these differences, the net effect, however, is the same.Google often partners with popular franchises in order to give fans an organic search experience. Stranger Things is one of the best series for this type of activity because its central idea has to do with secrets and altered worlds. The Upside Down is weaved into the search experience, which causes a normal online environment to become slightly disconcerting, all in tribute to Stranger Things.The Upside Down effect is a temporary one and can be easily reversed. There is no chance that it might become permanent and affect your device.To reset the screen:Once you are done with that, everything goes back to normal.The Stranger Things feature is just one example of Google’s playful side. Over the years, the search engine has included dozens of hidden tricks tied to films, games and internet culture.Well-known examples include:Each Easter egg is designed to be harmless, temporary and fun.","The Stranger Things Google Easter egg is a visual effect that occurs on the actual page displaying the search results.

OnePlus Nord 6 is on the TDRA Certification website; hints that it will be released soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/oneplus-nord-6-is-on-the-tdra-certification-website-hints-that-it-will-be-released-soon/articleshow/126308022.cms,"AI generated

Does the OnePlus Nord 6 TDRA listing hint at an upcoming launch

How powerful could the OnePlus Nord 6 be

What do we know about the cameras and battery so far





Phones rarely announce themselves all at once. More often, they appear in fragments. A model number here. A regulatory listing there. The OnePlus Nord 6 seems to be following that familiar path. Its name has now been seen on the TDRA certification page in the UAE, after having been seen before in Malaysia. As of now, there is still no launch date, public picture, or press event planned. Still, these little signs are important. They say the phone is real and going through the normal steps that need to be taken before it can be released. Most of the time, this slow build says more than big claims for midrange phones. The Nord line has always grown in this way: slowly, with features added over time instead of all at once.The TDRA listing confirms the name OnePlus Nord 6 and links it to the model number CPH2795. That alone might sound minor, but certification sites are rarely wrong. They sit between development and release, catching devices as they prepare to enter real markets.The same model number was previously seen on Malaysia’s SIRIM database, which strengthens the case that this is a global model rather than a local variant. The UAE listing does not reveal specifications, but it does suggest OnePlus is lining up launches across regions, not just China.Rumours point in that direction. OnePlus has a history of rebranding Ace series phones for international markets under the Nord name. If that pattern holds, the Nord 6 would closely mirror the OnePlus Ace 6 that launched in China last October.This approach is not unusual. It allows OnePlus to reuse proven hardware while adjusting software and pricing for different regions. For buyers, it usually means solid performance rather than experimental design. Still, final confirmation will only come from OnePlus itself.Leaks suggest the OnePlus Nord 6 could feature a 6.83-inch display with 1.5K resolution. That places it firmly in large phone territory, aimed at people who value screen space for video, games, or reading.Design details remain unclear, but if it follows the Ace 6 closely, the phone may keep a clean, practical look rather than anything flashy. The focus appears to be on durability, with reports pointing to strong dust and water resistance ratings across several IP levels.One of the more surprising rumours is the processor. The phone is said to run on the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which would place it well above typical mid-range expectations.If true, this would make the Nord 6 more about performance longevity than short-term appeal. Paired with up to 16GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage, it would suit users who keep phones for several years rather than upgrading often.Camera details remain modest. Leaks point to a dual rear setup, led by a 50 megapixel primary sensor and an 8 megapixel secondary camera. On the front, a 16 megapixel camera is expected.According to reports, the upcoming OnePlus phone is expected to come with a 7,800mAh battery paired with 120W fast charging. If accurate, this would offer long usage and short charging times, a combination many users now expect.","OnePlus Nord 6 has been seen on the TDRA certification page in the UAE.

"Instagram head Adam Mosseri says AI has ‘killed’ creativity, urges creators to make original content: Read full post",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/instagram-head-adam-mosseri-says-ai-has-killed-creativity-urges-creators-to-make-original-content-read-full-post/articleshow/126310024.cms,"Here’s Instagram head Adam Mosseri’s full letter:



The key risk Instagram faces is that, as the world changes more quickly, the platform fails to keep up. Looking forward to 2026, one major shift: authenticity is becoming infinitely reproducible.

Everything that made creators matter-the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked-is now accessible to anyone with the right tools. Deepfakes are getting better. Al generates photos and videos indistinguishable from captured media.

Power has shifted from institutions to individuals because the internet made it so anyone with a compelling idea could find an audience. The cost of distributing information is zero.

Individuals, not publishers or brands, established that there’s a significant market for content from people. Trust in institutions is at an all-time low. We’ve turned to self-captured content from creators we trust and admire.

We like to complain about “AI slop,” but there’s a lot of amazing

AI content

. Even the quality AI content has a look though: too slick, skin too smooth. That will change - we’re going to see more realistic AI content.

Authenticity is becoming a scarce resource, driving more demand for creator content, not less. The bar is shifting from “can you create?” to “can you make something that only you could create?”

Unless you are under 25, you probably think of Instagram as feed of square photos: polished makeup, skin smoothing, and beautiful landscapes. That feed is dead. People stopped sharing personal moments to feed years ago.

The primary way people share now is in DMs: blurry photos and shaky videos of daily experiences. Shoe shots. and unflattering candids.

This raw aesthetic has bled into public content and across artforms.

The camera companies are betting on the wrong aesthetic. They’re competing to make everyone look like a pro photographer from 2015. But in a world where AI can generate flawless imagery, the professional look becomes the tell.

Flattering imagery is cheap to produce and boring to consume.

People want content that feels real. Savvy creators are leaning into unproduced, unflattering images. In a world where everything can be perfected, imperfection becomes a signal.

Rawness isn’t just aesthetic preference anymore — it’s proof. It’s defensive. A way of saying: this is real because it’s imperfect.

Relatively quickly, AI will create any aesthetic you like, including an imperfect one that presents as authentic. At that point we’ll need to shift our focus to who says something instead of what is being said.

For most of my life I could safely assume photographs or videos were largely accurate captures of moments that happened. This is clearly no longer the case and it’s going to take us years to adapt.

We’re going to move from assuming what we see is real by default, to starting with skepticism. Paying attention to who is sharing something and why. This will be uncomfortable - we’re genetically predisposed to believing our eyes.

Platforms like Instagram will do good work identifying AI content, but they’ll get worse at it over time as AI gets better. It will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media.

Camera manufacturers will cryptographically sign images at capture, creating a chain of custody.

Labeling is only part of the solution. We need to surface much more context about the accounts sharing content so people can make informed decisions. Who is behind the account?

In a world of infinite abundance and infinite doubt, the creators who can maintain trust and signal authenticity - by being real, transparent, and consistent - will stand out.

We need to build the best creative tools. Label AI-generated content and verify authentic content. Surface credibility signals about who’s posting. Continue to improve ranking for originality.

Instagram is going to have to evolve in a number of ways, and fast.



","Instagram head Adam Mosseri has written a letter to users about the future of the social network. Mosseri says that in 2026, 'authenticity is becoming infinitely reproducible' and that the bar is shifting from 'can you create' to 'can only you create?' Mosseri also says that Instagram will have to evolve in a number of ways.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126309974,imgsize-620682,width-400,resizemode-4/instagram-ceo-adam-mosseri.jpg"
Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas says multi-billion dollar data centres will become less relevant and ‘biggest threat’ is…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/perplexity-ceo-aravind-srinivas-says-multi-billion-dollar-data-centres-will-become-less-relevant-and-biggest-threat-is/articleshow/126309587.cms,"Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas predicts AI's future lies not in massive cloud data centers, but on devices. He argues that powerful, on-chip AI running locally on user devices poses an existential threat to current centralized infrastructure. This shift promises instant processing, enhanced privacy, and personalized AI experiences, potentially rendering vast data center investments obsolete.

Perplextiy CEO explaines benefits of moving AI from cloud to machines





Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has issued a warning: the future of artificial intelligence (AI) may not be in the cloud, which means that massive, energy-hungry data centres for which tech giants pouring billions of dollars may become irrelevant. He said that the AI power will be in users’ pockets with silicon that powers their devices, capable of running sophisticated LLMs.In an interview, Srinivas argued that the rise of high-performance, on-device AI is the biggest existential threat to the centralised infrastructure which is currently dominating the tech industry.“Well, the the biggest threat to a data centre is if the intelligence can be packed locally on a chip that's running on the device and then there's no need to inference all of it on like one centralized data center. It becomes more decentralized and even better if the models that are coming along with the chip are are things that adapt to you,” Srinivas said.“And by the way, you don't even you may not even need that for adaptation to you. It could just be um data that lives on your computer or your device um that can be retrieved on the fly,” he added.Srinivas postulated multiple benefits of moving AI from the cloud to the device. He said that the processing will happen instantly on the device, removing the delay of sending data to a remote server.Having AI on machine will ensure that personal data never leaves the user's hardware. Thirdly, Srinivas compared local AI to having a “digital brain” that lives with the user, learning and evolving based on their specific habits.“That way you don't have to repeat it. That's your intelligence. You own it. It's your brain. Then that really disrupts the whole data centre industry like it doesn't make sense to spend all this money 500 billion 5 trillion whatever on building all the centralised data centres across the world that do a lot of the intelligence workloads for people. This is the question. This is whatever it's a $10 trillion question, hundred trillion dollar question,” he explained.“That's not yet happened. No one's actually shipped a model that can be packaged on your computer, a very efficient chip locally and then it's very intelligent enough that it can complete tasks reliably. That's not yet happened. When that happens, I think it's it'll be very interesting,” the Perplexity CEO concluded.","Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas predicts AI's future lies not in cloud data centers, but on devices.

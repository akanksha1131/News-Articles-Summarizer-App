Apple Inc. shares declined 0.6% in premarket trading on Wednesday, signaling a continuation of its 2025 struggles, with the stock down 19% year-to-date, the weakest performance among the Magnificent Seven, according to Bloomberg. Wall Street’s concerns center on Apple’s growth prospects and its lagging position in the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape, compounded by competitive pressures and political risks.Needham & Company downgraded Apple to hold from buy, joining a growing list of firms tempering expectations. Analyst Laura Martin highlighted multiple risks, including intense competition, sluggish growth, and a valuation that “looks expensive on several metrics.” She noted, “For this stock to work, it must have the catalyst of an iPhone replacement cycle , which we do not foresee in the next 12 months,” per Bloomberg. Martin also pointed to Apple’s slow progress in generative AI, stating that innovations in this space “open the door for new hardware form factors that threaten iOS devices.”The selloff partly reflects political uncertainty, as Apple’s global manufacturing footprint makes it vulnerable to tariffs, with the Trump administration repeatedly targeting the company. Additionally, Apple’s AI struggles have intensified scrutiny. The recent acquisition of io, a startup co-founded by former Apple design icon Jony Ive, by OpenAI underscores the competitive threat in AI-driven innovation, potentially challenging Apple’s hardware dominance.Needham’s downgrade follows similar moves by Jefferies and Rosenblatt Securities in May, with Oppenheimer, MoffettNathanson, Loop Capital, Aletheia Capital, and DBS Bank also cutting ratings earlier in 2025, Bloomberg reports. Only 58% of analysts tracked by Bloomberg now recommend buying Apple, a stark contrast to peers like Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and Meta, which boast buy ratios near or above 90%. Apple’s challenges in AI, coupled with macroeconomic headwinds and a lack of near-term catalysts, continue to weigh on investor sentiment.","Needham & Company downgraded Apple to hold from buy, joining a growing list of firms tempering expectations.

Major adult websites Pornhub , YouPorn , and RedTube , owned by Aylo , have reportedly blocked access to their content in France in protest of new age verification requirements aimed at protecting minors from accessing pornography. French visitors attempting to access these platforms on Wednesday were greeted with a message denouncing the privacy risks posed by the government’s mandate, which requires users to verify their age using sensitive personal information such as credit cards or ID documents.According to a report by news agency AFP, the message on Pornhub, accompanied by an image of the bare-breasted Liberty from Eugène Delacroix’s 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People, criticized the French law: “Your government suggests checking your age every time you visit our site — that’s crazy, right?” Aylo, formerly MindGeek, argued that the requirement to repeatedly provide personal data creates an “unacceptable security risk” for users, citing potential vulnerabilities to hacks, leaks, or bad actors. The company also claimed that the law pushes users toward unregulated sites that fail to moderate content for issues like performer age and consent.France’s new rules, part of a broader global trend, align with the EU’s Digital Services Act, the UK’s Online Safety Act, and similar laws in several U.S. states, all designed to restrict minors’ access to inappropriate online content. The European Commission recently launched an investigation into Pornhub, Stripchat, XNXX, and XVideos for alleged failures to protect minors. France, which was Pornhub’s second-largest market in 2024, requires adult platforms to offer a “double-blind” third-party verification option to shield user data from the sites themselves, but Aylo dismissed this as ineffective.Instead, Aylo proposed that governments mandate age verification at the device level through operating systems like Apple, Microsoft, or Google, which could provide an “age signal” to grant or deny access without compromising user privacy.The report quoted France’s Digital Affairs Minister Clara Chappaz who responded firmly. He said, “Let [Pornhub, YouPorn, and RedTube] go. They can come back the day they’re ready to finally respect our rules.”","Pornhub, YouPorn, and RedTube blocked in France in protest of new age verification requirements.

Tesla sales in Germany , Europe’s largest car market, plummeted by 36.2% in May, marking the fifth consecutive month of decline, according to data released by the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA). The agency reported that Tesla registered just 1,210 new vehicles last month, down from the same period a year ago. Despite Tesla’s struggles, the overall market for battery electric vehicles (EVs) in Germany surged by 44.9%, driven by strong demand for competitors, notably Chinese automaker BYD.The decline in Tesla’s sales extends beyond Germany, with significant drops across other European markets. In France, Tesla’s registrations fell by a staggering 67%, while Spain saw a 29% decrease. In Sweden, Tesla’s sales dropped 53%, with Volkswagen’s new electric model, the ID.7, outselling Tesla’s revamped Model Y by nearly two to one. Norway was a notable exception, where Tesla sold 2,600 vehicles—more than triple the previous year’s figures—boosted by strong deliveries of the updated Model Y.Meanwhile, Chinese EV giant BYD has been gaining ground in Europe. In Germany, BYD’s sales soared ninefold to 1,857 units in May, making it the top-performing Chinese EV brand in the market. This growth comes despite the European Union imposing 17% tariffs on Chinese EVs in 2024. Across Europe, the appetite for electric vehicles remains robust, with Spain reporting a 72% increase in overall EV sales, even as Tesla’s figures slid by 19%.Analysts attribute Tesla’s declining sales to a combination of factors, including growing competition from Chinese manufacturers and controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk ’s political activities, which have sparked protests among some European consumers. As the EV market continues to expand, Tesla faces mounting pressure to regain its footing in key markets.","Tesla sales in Germany plummeted by 36.2% in May, marking the fifth consecutive month of decline.

What Tesla and Michigan authorities said about the parked Cybertrucks



“The City of Farmington Hills code enforcement office has been in communication with the Hunter’s Square shopping centre management to resolve the issue. They have been notified that storage of vehicles is not a permitted use. The enforcement process is being followed and takes time.”

Elon Musk’s Tesla may face zoning violations in Michigan after more than 100 unsold Cybertrucks were found parked at a closed shopping centre. The accumulation of these vehicles at Hunter’s Square shopping centre in Farmington Hills has prompted concerns from local authorities regarding adherence to zoning regulations, a report claims. Over the past several weeks, residents and social media users have reportedly posted images and videos showing numerous rows of Cybertrucks at the site on Orchard Lake Road. The location is adjacent to a Tesla service centre in West Bloomfield. This proximity has led to speculation that the shopping centre lot is being used as an overflow site to manage unsold inventory, as over 100 Cybertrucks have reportedly gathered in the space.In a statement to CBS Detroit, Tesla employees collecting the trucks said the property belongs to the same entity that operates the nearby service centre, and that the vehicles were intended for customer delivery. However, the City of Farmington Hills has raised concerns over this explanation.Charmaine Kettler-Schmult, the city’s planning and community development director, told CBS Detroit:As per the report, Tesla is struggling to sell its Cybertruck, with under 50,000 units delivered since launch, which is far below its 250,000-unit annual projection. In Q1 2025, only 6,000 units were sold.Inventory has built up to an estimated 10,000 unsold trucks, prompting Tesla to scale back production and shift workers to Model Y lines, the report adds. The vehicle has faced eight recalls, including one affecting nearly all units sold.Sales have also reportedly dipped amid backlash over Elon Musk’s political involvement, though Tesla stock has recently rebounded after a sharp decline.","More than 100 unsold Cybertrucks were found parked at a closed shopping centre in Michigan.

Elon Musk warns America will go bankrupt

Elon Musk recently criticised the Trump administration ’s ‘ One Big Beautiful Bill ’ calling it “a disgusting abomination”. In a post on X, the Tesla CEO said “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.” He further added “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.” Following Musk’s criticism, White House has defended the bill.At a press conference earlier today, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked by a Fox reporter, “How mad do you think President Trump would be when he finds out what Elon Musk said?”Leavitt replied, “The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. It doesn't change the president's opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill, and he's sticking to it.”The legislation, dubbed the 'One, Big, Beautiful Bill' by Trump, was narrowly passed by the House last month. It includes extensions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , alongside new spending allocations for border security and the military.However, the bill has drawn sharp criticism for its projected impact on the federal deficit, with the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and independent analysts estimating it could add between $2.3 trillion and $5 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. To offset some of the costs, Republicans have proposed cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and green-energy tax credits.The tech billionaire has long warned of the national debt as an “existential threat”. In his latest remarks, he said that the bill “will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America[n] citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.”“This immense level of overspending will drive America into debt slavery!,” he wrote in another post.Last month, Musk expressed his disappointment with the bill. In a CBS interview, he said “I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just fails to decrease it”.","Elon Musk recently criticised the Trump administration ’s ‘ One Big Beautiful Bill ’ calling it ‘a disgusting abomination’ The White House has defended the bill, saying it is ‘one big, beautiful bill, and he's sticking to it’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121629023,imgsize-28964,width-400,resizemode-4/White-House-press-secretary-Karoline-Leavitt-on-Elon-Musks-criticism-of-Trumps-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-It-doesnt-change-the.jpg"

Microsoft is offering a free cybersecurity program to European governments to enhance their defences against cyber threats. The program, which was launched recently, includes safety against cyberattacks that are amplified by artificial intelligence (AI). This initiative comes after a recent increase in cyberattacks across Europe, many of which have been linked to state-sponsored actors from countries such as China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. The program's objective is to boost intelligence-sharing specifically concerning AI-based threats. It also aims to help these countries with the prevention and disruption of these attacks. In an interview with the news agency Reuters, Microsoft President Brad Smith revealed how the company is planning to offer its services to these European governments to safeguard against cyberattacks.In the Reuters interview, Smith said:He noted that attackers are increasingly using generative AI to expand the scale and impact of their operations, from disrupting critical infrastructure to spreading disinformation. However, Smith added that while AI has been weaponised by malicious actors, it also offers valuable defensive capabilities.he highlighted.Smith continued, saying audio has, so far, been easier to fake than video. He also confirmed that Microsoft monitors the use of its AI models for any malicious activity and restricts access to known cybercriminals.Notable examples of AI-driven deepfakes include a 2022 video falsely showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy surrendering to Russia, and a fake audio clip in 2023 that influenced the Slovakian election.","Microsoft is offering a free cybersecurity program to European governments to enhance their defences against cyber threats.

Why eVTOL market may not a profitable bet yet

Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas has predicted that Elon Musk may be ""tempted to solve"" another ""problem"" by leveraging Tesla's expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), batteries and manufacturing. As per Jones, the problem is ""commercialising air taxis,"" also known as electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles.In his latest research note, Jonas argued that Tesla may enter the nascent eVTOL market as these aircraft have long been predicted to revolutionise urban transport, yet even leading developers like Archer Aviation are still in the developmental phase.Last week, Archer's Midnight prototype, slated for its first deliveries later this year to Abu Dhabi, successfully completed a piloted flight test.According to a report by Fortune, while Jonas believes that solving this technological challenge aligns with the interests of Tesla engineers, he acknowledged that Tesla has indicated it is currently too stretched to seriously consider an eVTOL venture, without outright refuting the idea.The US government is reportedly keen on supporting the growth of flying cars. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posted this week, ""eVOTLs [sic] are going to fundamentally transform how the public travels. Let’s make sure the US leads the way.""Currently, the eVTOL market faces significant hurdles. Several promising startups, including Lilium and Volocopter, have encountered financial difficulties before establishing commercially viable services. A key challenge in achieving stringent safety standards while ensuring full autonomy, as scaling the business typically requires removing costly pilots from the equation. Additionally, there aren't enough customers with pilot licenses to support widespread adoption.","Tesla may enter the nascent eVTOL market, says Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas.

Facebook parent Meta becomes the latest American company to 'go nuclear' for AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-parent-meta-becomes-the-latest-american-company-to-go-nuclear-for-ai/articleshow/121606959.cms,"Meta has signed a 20-year agreement to secure nuclear power to meet the growing energy demands for artificial intelligence and other computing needs at Facebook’s parent company. According to a report by Associated Press, the deal will also boost the output of Constellation Energy’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois.Announced on June 3, the agreement is part of a broader trend of tech companies partnering with nuclear energy providers as AI usage surges. Financial terms were not disclosed. The Clinton plant, originally set to close in 2017 due to financial losses, was sustained by Illinois’ zero-emission credit program, which expires in 2027, as per the report. The Meta deal, effective from June 2027, will increase the plant’s clean energy output by 30 megawatts, preserve 1,100 local jobs, and generate $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, the companies said.“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” Meta’s head of global energy, Urvi Parekh, said. The report notes that tech giants face dual pressures: increasing energy supplies for AI and data centers while meeting ambitious greenhouse gas reduction goals. Constellation, which owns the shuttered Three Mile Island plant, announced in September a plan to restart it to supply Microsoft’s data centers, the AP reports. The Pennsylvania plant was the site of the U.S.’ worst commercial nuclear accident in 1979.Amazon and Google have also invested in small nuclear reactors, with Amazon announcing plans two days after Google last fall, and Google investing in three advanced nuclear projects with Elementl Power last month, according to the report.The AP report adds that 25 states passed legislation supporting advanced nuclear energy last year, with over 200 nuclear-friendly bills introduced this year, per the Nuclear Energy Institute. However, the U.S. faces challenges in scaling nuclear production, with no next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors built in nearly 50 years, completed significantly over budget and behind schedule in Georgia, the AP states.Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are also investing in solar and wind energy, which produce no greenhouse gas emissions, the AP adds.", Meta has signed a 20-year agreement to secure nuclear power to meet the growing energy demands for artificial intelligence.

Read LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky's post announcing the change

Career Path update…

Sixteen years at LinkedIn. Five as CEO. And now, a new chapter.

While I continue to be the CEO of LinkedIn, an independent subsidiary of Microsoft, I’ll also be stepping into a broader role, leading Microsoft Office and M365 Copilot.

And I hadn’t even added an ‘Open to Work’ badge to my profile 🙂

When Microsoft acquired LinkedIn in 2016, we believed in a simple idea: that connecting professionals could create more opportunity for everyone. That bet has paid off. LinkedIn is now one of Microsoft’s most successful acquisitions, helping shape how people find work, grow their careers, and build what’s next.

Office is one of the most iconic product suites in history. It has shaped how the world works, literally. The reach and impact of Office are unmatched.

I’m coming into this role in a new, exciting era. Productivity, connection, and AI are converging at scale. Both Office and LinkedIn are used daily by professionals globally and I’m looking forward to redefining ourselves in this new world.

And on a personal level, and as a product builder at heart, I couldn’t be more excited about this squiggly line in my own career path and the chance to lead two of the most impactful professional products in history.

Second reshuffle in three months

Stay ready with these 7 essential medical gadgets as COVID cases rise

Hackers are targeting employees at companies across Europe and the Americas using a sophisticated social engineering campaign involving a modified Salesforce app, Google 's cybersecurity arm has said. According to Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), the attackers—identified as UNC6040—have been “particularly effective” in deceiving corporate users into installing a fake version of Salesforce Data Loader , a legitimate tool used for importing large datasets into Salesforce environments.The team at Google explains that the hackers impersonate official Salesforce representatives and are calling employees to direct them to a fake app setup page. There, users are tricked into authorising a malicious version of the Data Loader app that mimics the original software.Once installed, the app grants attackers significant access to sensitive corporate data. Google researchers noted that the hackers can exfiltrate confidential information, query internal systems, and in many cases, pivot to attack other cloud services and internal networks.As per the researchers, technical indicators suggest that the campaign has ties to “The Com”, a loosely organised cybercriminal ecosystem known for orchestrating both online fraud and real-world violence.A Google spokesperson told news agency Reuters that at least 20 organisations have been affected by the UNC6040 operation over the past several months, with some suffering successful data breaches and extortion attempts.Meanwhile, Salesforce, stated that the issue does not stem from any vulnerability in its platform. A company spokesperson emphasised that the attacks rely on voice phishing (vishing) tactics and exploit gaps in employee cybersecurity awareness.“There’s no indication the issue described stems from any vulnerability inherent in our platform,” the spokesperson said, adding that the number of affected customers is small and the threat is not considered widespread.Salesforce had previously issued a warning in March 2025, cautioning users about vishing attacks and the risks posed by malicious versions of Data Loader.","Hackers are targeting employees at companies across Europe and the Americas using a sophisticated social engineering campaign involving a modified Salesforce app. The hackers impersonate official Salesforce representatives and are calling employees to direct them to a fake app setup page.

Qualcomm has announced that it has released patches for a series of vulnerabilities affecting dozens of its chips, including three zero-day flaws that the chipmaker says may be under active exploitation by hackers. Qualcomm cited Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), which focuses on government-backed cyberattacks, indicating that these three flaws “may be under limited, targeted exploitation.”According to the information revealed by the company, the vulnerabilities were reported to Qualcomm by Google's Android security team in February.Due to the open-source and distributed nature of Android, applying these patches for phones running on affected chipsets now falls to individual device manufacturers, such as Samsung, Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo and more. This means some devices may remain vulnerable for several weeks, even though fixes are available.Qualcomm stated in its bulletin that patches were provided to device makers in May, with a strong recommendation for immediate deployment.As per TechCrunch, Qualcomm spokesperson Dave Schefcik acknowledged the fixes, urging ""end users to apply security updates as they become available from device makers.""Meanwhile, Google spokesperson Ed Fernandez confirmed that Google's Pixel devices are not affected by these specific Qualcomm vulnerabilities.Chipsets in mobile devices are frequent targets for zero-day exploit developers due to their broad access to the operating system.

The president's son said he was ""more focused on the stablecoin , the bitcoin mining"" rather than the meme coin project.President Trump's $TRUMP token, launched three days before his January inauguration, initially soared to a $15 billion market cap before losing most of its value. The Trump Organization and affiliated entities control 80% of the token, with creators earning fees from every trade. According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, more than $324 million in trading fees flowed to project-tied wallets between January and April.Trump Jr. framed the family's crypto pivot as necessity rather than choice, claiming traditional banks stopped taking their calls after his father entered politics.

India’s telecom giants, Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, have reportedly raised concerns over the proposed pricing of satellite spectrum, warning that ""unjustifiably low"" rates could harm their businesses while benefiting satellite internet providers like Elon Musk’s Starlink. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing these companies, urged the telecom ministry in a May 29 letter to reconsider the pricing structure proposed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ).In May, TRAI suggested that satellite service providers pay 4% of their annual revenue to the government for offering services. This is said to contrast sharply with traditional telecom operators, who face significantly higher upfront costs through spectrum auctions -- approximately 21% more than satellite players would pay, according to COAI. The group argues that spectrum pricing per MHz should be comparable for both terrestrial and satellite services, especially when targeting the same customers with similar broadband offerings.""Satellite services can provide competitive and affordable alternatives to terrestrial broadband,"" the COAI letter stated, emphasizing the need for a level playing field. Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, which have invested nearly $20 billion in recent years to secure 5G spectrum through auctions, fear satellite providers could offer similar wireless broadband services at a lower cost.The debate over spectrum allocation has intensified, with Reliance previously lobbying for auctions, while Starlink advocated for administrative licensing, arguing that spectrum is a shared natural resource. Despite signing distribution deals for Starlink equipment in March, both Reliance and Airtel are poised to compete with the U.S.-based company once it launches in India.Earlier this week, Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia told The Print that Starlink is nearing the end of its licensing process, having received a Letter of Intent (LoI) from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). Final approval from the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) is pending, after which Starlink will conduct trial runs with limited spectrum allocations, similar to competitors OneWeb and Reliance.A senior government official confirmed to Reuters that the telecom ministry is still reviewing TRAI’s pricing recommendations, noting that such concerns from traditional telecom operators have been raised before. Neither Reliance, Airtel, nor Starlink responded to requests for comment.As India prepares to integrate satellite-based internet into its telecom landscape, the ongoing pricing dispute highlights the challenges of balancing innovation with fair competition in the rapidly evolving sector.","Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have reportedly raised concerns over the proposed pricing of satellite spectrum.

Residents of Santa Monica , California are reportedly upset and protesting the frequent noise-pollution from Google-backed Waymo driverless cars . While the driverless electric cars with rotating sensors first seemed like a novelty, some residents are now complaining that the charging stations make constant noise. “To hear it from residents, the beeping never seems to stop, largely due to a state regulation requiring electric vehicles to audibly reverse like delivery trucks,” the LA Times reported.“They beep as they back out of charging spots, and beep as they reverse to navigate around each other. They beep in the morning as they head out to pick up early passengers, and beep late at night as they return to charge up,” it added.As per the report, residents are fed up to the extent that they are protesting against driver-less cars. “City officials, a judge and even police have been forced to intercede after residents who say the self-driving cars are a nuisance have banded together against the local 56-vehicle fleet. They’ve reached out to the city. They’ve called Waymo. Now, some are trying unconventional tactics,” the report stated.It further added, “Using cones, cars and sometimes themselves, residents have taken to blocking the Waymos from entering their company-funded parking lot, so much so that the company has called the cops on them a half dozen times.”A local resident named Darius Boorn told the publication: “I want the noise stopped. I thought it was cool, and then those freaking noises started. And then I thought, ‘Oh no, this can’t be happening.’”In a statement to LA Times, a Waymo spokesperson said that the company “will continue to learn and improve how we introduce ourselves to new communities when we arrive.”“We strive to be good neighbors in the cities that we operate, and are committed to being a positive presence in Santa Monica. We are in ongoing conversation with the City’s Department of Transportation, and are actively working with the agency as we explore and implement mitigations that address neighbors’ concerns,” another spokesperson told Fox Business.","Residents of Santa Monica, California are reportedly upset and protesting the frequent noise-pollution from Google-backed Waymo driverless cars. “To hear it from residents, the beeping never seems to stop, largely due to a state regulation requiring electric vehicles to audibly reverse like delivery trucks,” LA Times reported.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121624502,imgsize-37198,width-400,resizemode-4/Why-residents-of-Googles-home-city-are-upset-with-its-driverless-cars.jpg"

Weeks after one of its professors, Ali Khan Mahmudabad, was arrested over a social media post he wrote on Operation Sindoor and the university was criticised for not taking a stand amid a raging argument over free speech, Ashoka trustee and co-founder Sanjeev Bikhchandani made his views clear in an emailed reply to a former student. Activism is not embedded to a liberal arts university, a political post on social media is not academic scholarship, and the founders have considered walking away, he asserted in the email.""Why don't you and other alumni offer to step in and take over?"" Bikhchandani wrote in the email that was shared on an internal mailing list. ""Pramath, Ashish and I have seriously discussed the option of walking away. Ashoka is too much of a headache... money, even in this day and age, does not grow on trees but it still makes the world go around,"" he added, referring to fellow trustee Pramath Raj Sinha and founding chairperson Ashish Dhawan.Dwelling at length on activism, he wrote, ""Activism and a Liberal Arts University are not joined at the hip. Ashoka is a Liberal Arts and Sciences University. Whether to be activists or not is a conscious choice people make.In the past I have questioned the activism at Ashoka — each time, I have been pounced upon by the activists and their supporters, both within and outside Ashoka: students, faculty, activists, etc.,saying that ‘if you are running a liberal arts university, then activism goes with the territory', that ‘I am an arrogant owner', that ‘dirty filthy capitalists don't understand how a university runs' (they somehow forget that the same capitalists are paying their salaries). """"You can be a great liberal arts university and not be activist. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar,"" he added. ""As an institution, Ashoka cannot take an activist position. It (Ashoka) is governed by the law of the land… It is answerable to regulators and to government authorities. It is not a political party or movement — it is an educational institution.""Addressing the row over Mahmudabad's post and his arrest without taking names, Bikhchandani wrote, ""A political opinion expressed on Facebook or Twitter (X) or Instagram is not academic scholarship. Consequently, any public outcry about a political opinion an academic may express on social media is not an attack on academic freedom... If a regulator or the government or law enforcement goes after you for a social media post, it is not an infringement of academic freedom. It might be an infringement of freedom of speech; however, there are provisions within the Constitution and the law where you can find protection. You are a grown-up adult. You are responsible for your actions and any consequences thereof. Ashoka is not obliged to support you for political opinions... You did not seek Ashoka's consent before posting on social media, you cannot now present Ashoka with a fait accompli and expect support.""""Appropriate timing of what to say, where, when and to whom and how is a sign of intelligence (beyond academic scholarship),"" he added. ""If you end up offending a whole bunch of people, even though you were not technically incorrect in what you said, then an expression of regret and an apology is a sign of good grace and decency. Hijacking an institutional platform to make it subordinate to your political agenda is an act of institutional capture and selfishness. Expecting the institution to then support you is an act of entitlement and arrogance.""In making these points, Bikhchandani identified a ""policy issue"" for Ashoka's governing body to think over. ""Can a full-time academic also pursue a political career? In the private sector, we generally stay away from what are termed as ‘politically exposed persons'. Should Ashoka have such a policy?""Mahmudabad, incidentally, has been associated with Samajwadi Party, though he has been inactive in recent years.","Ashoka trustee and co-founder Sanjeev Bikhchandani made his views clear in an emailed reply to a former student.

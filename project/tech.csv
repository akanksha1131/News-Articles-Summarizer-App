Gupshup‚Äôs market position

Conversational AI platform Gupshup has laid off 300 employees over the past 18 months, citing efforts to streamline operations and drive profitable growth following a period of rapid expansion. According to a report by Economic Times, the company confirmed the layoffs in a statement, emphasising that the move was part of a broader consolidation strategy.Gupshup had rapidly expanded its workforce to 1,500 employees since 2021, fuelled by five acquisitions and lateral hiring. However, as the company integrated these acquired firms, it sought to optimise efficiency, leading to workforce reductions.A spokesperson for Gupshup stated, ‚ÄúOver the past 18 months, through a combination of additions and reductions, our net employee count has been reduced by 300. As always, we handle every discussion with empathy and respect, providing support and following HR processes.‚ÄùThe company assured that affected employees received severance benefits, including notice period pay and continued employment benefits. However, Gupshup did not disclose which teams or locations were impacted.

However, Gupshup denied this claim.Founded in 2004, Gupshup provides messaging APIs and conversational AI tools to businesses. The company has increasingly focused on AI-powered customer engagement solutions, securing backing from investors such as Tiger Global and Fidelity.

DOGE engineers leading Gold Card Visa team

What is ‚ÄòGold Card‚Äô Immigrant Visa project

Gold Card Visa is not American citizenship, it offer Permanent Residency

A task force led by Elon Musk is developing a new U.S. immigration program that would offer special residency visas ‚Äî dubbed Gold Cards by former President Donald Trump ‚Äî for $5 million each, The New York Times reports. Engineers from Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have been collaborating with staff from the State Department, Department of Homeland Security, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to design a streamlined application system and website for the proposed visa program. Three sources familiar with the initiative and documents reviewed by The Times confirmed these details.Leading the gold card initiative on Musk‚Äôs team are Marko Elez and Edward Coristine, who have reportedly been coordinating with multiple federal agencies to integrate existing vetting processes into the new system. Billionaire Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia has also reportedly joined the project, initially signing on to assist with digitizing federal retirement systems.Elez faced backlash earlier this year after The Wall Street Journal linked him to a pseudonymous social media account that posted racist content and promoted eugenics-based immigration policy. He resigned in February but has since worked with several federal agencies, including the Department of Labor and Health and Human Services. Coristine, a 19-year-old who goes by the nickname ‚ÄúBig Balls‚Äù online, was previously dismissed from an internship at the data security firm Path in 2022 following an internal investigation into a data leak, according to a company statement.The project is reportedly exploring ways to bypass the traditional, often years-long, visa process by expediting background checks and interviews, with the aim of granting residency within two weeks of application for qualified high-net-worth individuals.This effort marks a shift in focus for Elon Musk‚Äôs task force, originally formed to cut government costs. The Gold Card project signals a new direction: generating federal revenue through immigration reform. Trump first introduced the Gold Cards concept in February, describing it as a pathway to permanent U.S. residency for ‚Äúvery high-level people.‚Äù He positioned it as a replacement for the existing EB-5 visa program, which grants green cards to foreign investors contributing between $800,000 and $1.05 million to U.S. businesses that create at least 10 jobs. The EB-5 program generated about $4 billion for the government in the past year.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick previously stated on a podcast that 1,000 Gold Cards had already been sold. ‚ÄúSo if you have a gold card ‚Äî which used to be a green card ‚Äî you‚Äôre a permanent resident of America,‚Äù Lutnick said. ‚ÄúThey pay $5 million, and they have the right to be an American and the right to be in America as long as they‚Äôre good people and they‚Äôre vetted and they can‚Äôt break the law.‚ÄùAccording to Lutnick, Musk is currently building the software platform and the program will launch ‚Äúwithin a week and a half.‚Äù Trump, while traveling aboard Air Force One earlier this month, displayed a mock-up of the laminated Gold Cards, featuring his image alongside the Statue of Liberty and a bald eagle, stating it would debut ‚Äúin less than two weeks.‚Äù","A task force led by Elon Musk is developing a new U.S. immigration program.

Elon Musk said he is 'unsure' of her claim

The name of the child shared by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair has been revealed. According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, the infant‚Äîpreviously identified by the initials R.S.C. is named Romulus. The article also disclosed the results of a paternity test ordered by the New York Supreme Court, which confirmed Elon Musk as the child‚Äôs father with a 99.9999% probability, based on a Labcorp report from last week. The report from Labcorp, said: ""Probability of Paternity"" was 99.9999%.A spokesperson for St. Clair confirmed both the paternity results and the child's name to PEOPLE. St. Clair, 26, publicly announced in February 2025 that she and Musk had welcomed a son together in September 2024. At the time, she explained her prior decision to keep the news private. The two are said to have met in spring 2023 via social media and Elon Musk reportedly invited her to visit Twitter office in San Francisco,""Five months ago, I welcomed a new baby into the world. Elon Musk is the father,"" she wrote on X. ""I have not previously disclosed this to protect our child's privacy and safety, but in recent days it has become clear that tabloid media intends to do so, regardless of the harm it will cause.""St. Clair added, ""I intend to allow our child to grow in a normal and safe environment. For that reason, I ask that the media honor our child's privacy, and refrain from invasive reporting.""On March 29, St. Clair appeared in a video published by the Daily Mail, where she was seen handing over the keys to her Tesla Model S. She claimed she was selling the vehicle due to a significant reduction‚Äîreportedly 60%‚Äîin the child support payments she was receiving from Musk.Musk, however, refuted her claims in a response posted to X on March 31. Replying to a tweet by political commentator Laura Loomer, who shared the video, Musk denied any financial retaliation against St. Clair or their child. ""I don‚Äôt know if the child is mine or not, but am not against finding out. No court order is needed,"" he wrote. ""Despite not knowing for sure, I have given Ashley $2.5 million and am sending her $500,000 a year.""With this confirmation, Romulus becomes Musk‚Äôs 14th child. He shares his other children with three different women.","A paternity test ordered by the New York Supreme Court confirmed Elon Musk as the child‚Äôs father with a 99.9999% probability, based on a Labcorp report from last week.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle



The New York Times published its inaugural crossword puzzle on February 15, 1942, in the Sunday Magazine.

A group of hackers has threatened to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk . The cybercrime group named DonRoad Team, which had earlier claimed responsibility for taking down several websites associated with US President Donald Trump, has now announced that it would start targeting sites associated with Tesla and SpaceX CEO. The group also shared its intent to attack sites associated with the tech billionaire over a month. Previously, the DonRoad Team has claimed responsibility for its attacks in March that targeted The Trump Organization's website, as well as Tesla and SpaceX email servers, causing temporary global outages at the time. This comes after Musk-owned social media platform X (earlier Twitter) was targeted by a group of pro-Palestinian hackers who were able to disable the site for several hours.In a post (seen by Newsweek) shared on messaging platform Telegram, the hackers said: ‚ÄúIn the next few hours, we will be suspending all websites affiliated with Elon Musk companies for a full month.‚ÄùHowever, the Telegram post was later removed. Should these hacks occur, they may impact multiple Musk-related websites, including X and his AI platforms Grok and Tesla. Hackers may also target websites of other companies owned by Musk, like SpaceX and Tesla.In March, Musk-owned X experienced at least three major outages following a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. ‚Äîa cyber assault that floods networks or devices with bot-generated traffic. The Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility for the incident.Reacting to the cyberattack, Musk at that time took to X to write: There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against ùïè. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing ‚Ä¶‚ÄùLater, in a Fox Business interview, Musk noted: ‚ÄúThere was a massive cyber attack to try to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.‚ÄùIn a separate event in February, the website for the Department of Government Efficiency, of which Musk is a member, was compromised and altered to mock him and his team.The hacked site temporarily displayed a prominent message stating, ‚ÄúThis is a joke of a .gov site,"" alongside the note, ""THESE 'EXPERTS' LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN.‚Äù",Hackers threaten to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk.

"Walmart Boycott: World's largest retailer tells protesters, 'we are America's ...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-boycott-worlds-largest-retailer-tells-protesters-we-are-americas-/articleshow/120119363.cms,"Here's what Walmart said about the protest

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

Walmart, the world‚Äôs largest retailer, has issued a statement addressing the ongoing week-long boycott organised by the People‚Äôs Union USA . The boycott, dubbed the "" Walmart Blackout ,"" began on April 7 and targets the company‚Äôs rollback of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as broader concerns over corporate influence and tax policies .The People‚Äôs Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity. The group‚Äôs founder, John Schwarz, urged consumers to avoid shopping at Walmart stores, using its online services, or purchasing from its subsidiaries like Sam‚Äôs Club. Schwarz stated, ‚ÄúWe are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.‚ÄùResponding to the boycott, Walmart has defended its contributions to communities and the US economy. ‚ÄúServing communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,‚Äù the company said in a statement. ‚ÄúAs one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year"", it added further.The boycott follows Walmart‚Äôs decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households‚Äîa trend that contrasts with another retail chain Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. In comparison, Walmart observed a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw the smallest decrease, at just 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","The People‚Äôs Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity.

‚ÄúOn August 29, 2024, a masked man deposited a check in Defendant‚Äôs Chase bank account in the amount of $73,000.00.‚Äù

JPMorgan Chase has filed lawsuits against more customers accused of exploiting a glitch last year. This glitch allegedly allowed these customers to withdraw funds from the bank using fraudulent checks before they bounced, a phenomenon dubbed the ""infinite money glitch."" The bank has reportedly started suing more customers who allegedly stole amounts below $75,000. A report citing a source familiar with the matter claimed that these new lawsuits are being filed in state courts, a shift from the federal court filings the bank initiated last year. The "" infinite money glitch ,"" which gained widespread attention through viral social media videos in August 2024, enabled customers to withdraw the full value of a fraudulent check before it was flagged and returned.In a lawsuit filed in Gwinnett County, Georgia (seen by CNBC), JP Morgan said:Six days after the deposit, the check bounced following a series of cash withdrawals at two JP Morgan Chase branches in the state that totalled $82,500, the bank added.The accused, whose name is being withheld by CNBC until she can respond, now owes the bank $57,847.69 and has not complied with requests to return the funds, as stated in the lawsuit.In addition to the case in Georgia, the bank is preparing to file lawsuits in state venues in Miami, the Bronx, New York, and two Texas counties, the report added.JP Morgan has reportedly examined thousands of potential cases and opted to pursue litigation in instances with the highest amounts and the most evident patterns of theft.As per the report, the bank has also sent letters to over 1,000 customers since October 2024, requesting repayment of funds. The bank is targeting potential fraudsters who had withdrawn the largest sums, while some individuals even returned money voluntarily, the report noted.The bank claimed that these lawsuits are separate from any potential criminal proceedings that federal and state law enforcement agencies may be working on.In a statement, Drew Pusateri, a spokesman for JP Morgan, said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still investigating cases of fraud and cooperating with law enforcement ‚Äî and we‚Äôll do that for as long as it takes to hold fraudsters accountable.‚Äù","JPMorgan Chase has filed lawsuits against more customers accused of exploiting a glitch last year.

CVE board establishes new non-profit to secure program independence



‚ÄúSince its inception, the CVE Program has operated as a US government-funded initiative, with oversight and management provided under contract. While this structure has supported the program's growth, it has also raised longstanding concerns among members of the CVE Board about the sustainability and neutrality of a globally relied-upon resource being tied to a single government sponsor.‚Äù

The US government has extended funding for the crucial Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has confirmed the funding extension and has ensured its continued operation without interruption. This announcement follows a recent warning issued by MITRE Vice President Yosry Barsoum , who stated that government funding for the CVE and its related CWE programs was set to expire, potentially causing significant disruption across the cybersecurity industry. MITRE, a non-profit organisation, maintains the widely adopted CVE program , which provides a standardised way to identify, define, and catalogue publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities . The program is funded by the US National Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).In a statement to Bleeping Computer, the U.S. cybersecurity agency said: ‚ÄúThe CVE Program is invaluable to the cyber community and a priority of CISA. Last night, CISA executed the option period on the contract to ensure there will be no lapse in critical CVE services. We appreciate our partners' and stakeholders' patience.‚ÄùThe confirmation comes after Barsoum warned: ‚ÄúIf a break in service were to occur, we anticipate multiple impacts to CVE, including deterioration of national vulnerability databases and advisories, tool vendors, incident response operations, and all manner of critical infrastructure.‚ÄùBefore CISA‚Äôs announcement, several CVE board members introduced the CVE Foundation , a non-profit organisation aimed at maintaining the CVE program's independence following MITRE's caution that the U.S. government might not renew its contract to manage the program.In a press release, the CVE board members said:Over the past year, the team behind the launch has been developing a strategy to transition the program to a dedicated foundation, aiming to eliminate ‚Äúa single point of failure in the vulnerability management ecosystem‚Äù and ensure ""the CVE Program remains a globally trusted, community-driven initiative.""Although the CVE Foundation is expected to share more details on its transition planning soon, its next steps remain unclear, particularly since CISA confirmed that funding for MITRE's contract has been extended.","The US government has extended funding for the crucial Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program.

"'Sidelined by DOGE‚Äôs efforts', Pentagon‚Äôs entire ‚ÄòSWAT team of nerds‚Äô resigns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sidelined-by-doges-efforts-pentagons-entire-swat-team-of-nerds-resigns/articleshow/120351000.cms,"All staff members are slated to leave soon

In what can be called as a significant blow to the Pentagon 's technological innovation efforts, nearly the entire staff ‚Äì called ""SWAT team of nerds‚Äù ‚Äì of the Defense Digital Service (DDS), its fast-track tech development arm, is reportedly resigning en masse over the coming month. The exodus has been attributed to the increasing influence of the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ).Citing the director and three other current members of the office, as well as internal emails, Politico claims that the move threatens to effectively shut down the decade-old programme by the end of April. The DDS was established in 2015 to inject Silicon Valley-style agility into the Department of Defense ( DOD ), rapidly developing technological solutions for national security crises and fostering innovation within the Pentagon's vast bureaucracy.The report says that this particular unit played a crucial role in developing rapid response tools during the Afghanistan withdrawal, creating databases for the transfer of Ukrainian military and humanitarian aid, and pioneering drone detection technologies, among other critical projects.The sources told the publication that the programme's demise will lead to the shutdown of key initiatives aimed at streamlining the DOD's tech talent pipeline and countering adversarial drones.The 14-person DDS has seen its director, Jennifer Hay, plan her departure by May 1. Eleven other employees intend to accept President Donald Trump‚Äôs deferred resignation package by the same date, with the remaining two staffers also slated to leave.A Pentagon spokesperson indicated that the functions of the DDS would be absorbed by the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO), under which the DDS currently operates.Director Hay revealed that her team initially anticipated being integrated into Musk's efforts to automate Pentagon operations and adopt artificial intelligence.‚ÄúThe reason we stuck it out as long as we have is that we thought we were going to be called in,‚Äù Hay stated.The fate of the DDS is similar to that of other digital modernisation efforts within the government under the purview of DOGE. The US Digital Service , which focused on modernising government technology and attracting tech talent, has reportedly been subsumed by DOGE amid significant layoffs and firings.","Nearly the entire staff of the Defense Digital Service (DDS), the Pentagon's fast-track tech development arm, is slated to leave soon.

SEBI‚Äôs shocking revelation of Gensol promoters

BluSmart, the electric vehicle ride-hailing platform owned by Gensol, has paused new ride bookings as it undergoes a major operational restructuring. Once considered a challenger to ride-hailing giants Uber and Ola, the company is now shifting its fleet to Uber‚Äôs platform‚Äîsignaling a significant pivot in its business model. While the BluSmart app remains available on both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, users across key markets including Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata and other ciries are reporting issues with booking rides.Some customers are unable to select time slots or dates, while others cannot enter drop-off locations, effectively making ride booking impossible. Although BluSmart has not issued an official statement, the widespread booking disruptions point to a likely suspension of its direct ride-booking services. This comes a day after SEBI's crackdown on Gensol.The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on April 15 made shocking revelations about Gensol Engineering Limited (GEL) promoters ‚Äì Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi. As per SEBI findings, the two are accused of diverting funds meant for electric vehicle (EV) procurement to buy a luxury apartment in Gurugram's upscale residential project -- The Camellias by DLF.SEBI revealed that GEL had taken loans worth Rs 978 crore between 2021 and 2024 from two public lenders -- the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) and the Power Finance Corporation (PFC). In its interim order, the market regulator said ‚ÄúFunds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, Gurugram, in the name of a firm where the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners‚Äù.‚ÄúIt was separately noted that Rs 5 crore, which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol,‚Äù the SEBI added.SEBI's investigation further highlighted that while the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto -- allegedly for purchasing EVs, the money was often routed back to Gensol or to entities closely connected to the Jaggi brothers.According to reports, BluSmart Mobility has also delayed salary payments for the month of March.","BluSmart, the electric vehicle ride-hailing platform owned by Gensol, has paused new ride bookings as it undergoes a major operational restructuring.

US Tightens Export Controls

Financial Impact: Inventory and Commitment Charges

China‚Äôs AI Ambitions Persist

Broader Implications: U.S.-China Tech Rivalry

Nvidia announced a potential write-off of up to $5.5 billion in its fiscal first quarter of 2026 (ending April 27, 2025) due to new U.S. export licensing requirements for its H20 chips shipped to China. The announcement, detailed in a stock market filing on April 14, 2025, follows the U.S. government's decision to impose stricter controls to prevent the chips from being used or diverted to supercomputing projects in China. This development marks a significant escalation in U.S. efforts to curb China's access to advanced AI technologies.The US government has introduced the export license requirement to address national security concerns, specifically aimed to address the risk that Nvidia‚Äôs H20 chips could be used in Chinese supercomputers or diverted to military applications. The restrictions, which took effect immediately and are expected to remain in place indefinitely, build on earlier export controls implemented in October 2023. Those controls prompted Nvidia to reconfigure its high-end H100 chip into the lower-capacity H20 to comply with U.S. regulations while maintaining sales in China, a critical market for the company.The H20 chip, Nvidia‚Äôs most advanced offering available in China, became a cornerstone of the company‚Äôs strategy to navigate the U.S.-China tech trade tensions. However, the new licensing rules have disrupted this approach, affecting not only Nvidia but also U.S.-based competitor AMD, whose AI chip exports to China now face similar restrictions.Nvidia‚Äôs projected $5.5 billion write-down encompasses charges related to H20 inventory, purchase commitments, and associated reserves. The write-off reflects the company‚Äôs inability to sell its existing stock of H20 chips in China without export licenses, which are likely to be difficult to obtain given the U.S. government‚Äôs stance. Additionally, Nvidia faces challenges in redirecting these chips to other markets due to their reduced performance compared to its flagship products.Industry analyst Richard Windsor, founder of Radio Free Mobile, noted that the H20 chip‚Äôs compute throughput is estimated at just 14% of Nvidia‚Äôs high-end H100 chip. This performance limitation makes the H20 less competitive in markets outside China, where buyers have access to more powerful alternatives. As a result, Nvidia may be forced to absorb significant financial losses tied to unsold inventory and unfulfilled contracts.The U.S. export restrictions aim to slow China‚Äôs progress in developing cutting-edge AI technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs) that power advanced AI applications. However, Windsor expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of these measures, arguing that access to specific silicon is not the primary determinant of LLM development. Instead, he highlighted that the speed and cost-efficiency of producing and deploying LLMs are more critical factors.Despite the restrictions, Chinese tech giants such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance have continued to invest heavily in AI. In late January 2025, these companies significantly increased their orders for Nvidia‚Äôs H20 chips, driven by a shift toward cost-effective LLM architectures inspired by DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup. At the time, Nvidia‚Äôs H20 chips were not subject to export licensing, allowing the company to capitalize on surging demand. The new U.S. rules, however, have disrupted this momentum, forcing Chinese firms to reassess their AI development strategies.The latest export controls underscore the intensifying technological rivalry between the U.S. and China, with AI chips at the heart of the competition. By targeting Nvidia‚Äôs H20 and AMD‚Äôs AI chips, the U.S. aims to limit China‚Äôs ability to build advanced AI infrastructure that could have military or economic implications. However, China‚Äôs domestic chip industry is rapidly evolving, with companies like Huawei and SMIC working to develop alternatives to U.S.-made semiconductors.Nvidia‚Äôs predicament also highlights the broader challenges faced by U.S. tech companies operating in the global market. While Nvidia has benefited from explosive demand for AI chips worldwide, its reliance on China as a major market has exposed it to geopolitical risks. The company‚Äôs stock market filing did not provide guidance on how it plans to mitigate the impact of the write-off or adapt to the new restrictions, leaving investors and analysts awaiting further details.","N Nvidia announced a potential write-off of up to $5.5 billion in its fiscal first quarter of 2026 (ending April 27, 2025) due to new U.S. export licensing requirements for its H20 chips shipped to China.

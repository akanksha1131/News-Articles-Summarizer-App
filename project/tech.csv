Elon Musk, another prominent tech billionaire and confidant of Trump, was notably absent from the small group gathered at the meeting.During the discussion, Gates and Trump delved into pressing global health concerns, including ongoing efforts to combat diseases like HIV and polio.Gates shared that the conversation touched on strategies for accelerating medical innovation, particularly in the wake of rapid vaccine development during the COVID-19 pandemic.“He, in the COVID days, accelerated the vaccine innovation,” Gates noted. “So I was asking him if maybe the same kind of thing could be done here, and we both got, I think, pretty excited about that.”“He, in the Covid days, accelerated the vaccine innovation,” Gates said.“So I was asking him if maybe the same kind of thing could be done here, and we both got, I think, pretty excited about that,” he added.Gates commended Trump’s apparent enthusiasm and interest in the topics brought to the table.“I felt like he was energized and looking forward to helping to drive innovation.

How TikTok app may become 'Indian-American' from Chinese if this proposal goes through,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-tiktok-app-may-become-indian-american-from-chinese-if-this-proposal-goes-through/articleshow/117378689.cms,"For those unaware,

Aravind Srinivas

is the CEO and co-founder of Perplexity AI.

Last week, Perplexity AI announced plans to expand the company’s operations in India, inviting applications for a strategic role. In a LinkedIn post, Srinivas detailed that the role would involve growing the company’s presence in India, requiring candidates who are “willing to travel and meet with strategic partners and institutions.” He described the position as “fun and intense” and aligned with the company’s scrappy startup culture.

What Perplexity AI's proposal to Tiktok is

A US search engine startup, Perplexity AI, has reportedly submitted a proposal to merge with TikTok US , the Chinese-owned platform’s parent company ByteDance. According to a report in Reuters, a source familiar with the matter, US search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid to TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok US.He co-founded the company in 2022 with Andy Konwinski, Denis Yarats, and Johnny Ho.Srinivas was in India recently and met PM Narendra Modi.Under Perplexity AI’s proposal, TikTok US would merge with Perplexity, forming a new entity in partnership with New Capital Partners, according to the source, who requested anonymity. The arrangement would allow ByteDance’s existing investors to retain equity stakes while enhancing Perplexity’s video capabilities.Perplexity AI believes its proposal has a strong chance of success, emphasizing that it involves a merger rather than an outright sale. The company is known for its advanced search tools, powered by large language models like OpenAI’s GPT and Meta Platforms’ Llama, which deliver fast, sourced answers to user queries.TikTok back from brink in the USTikTok, a platform that has over 170 million users in the US had warned last week that it would go dark on January 19 unless the Biden administration assured companies like Apple and Google they wouldn’t face enforcement actions for hosting TikTok. TikTok faced a potential US ban beginning January 19 unless it severs ties with ByteDance. However, President-elect Donald Trump announced on January 18 that he would likely grant the short-video platform a 90-day reprieve starting Monday. On Sunday, TikTok began restoring service in the US after Trump stated he would issue an executive order to delay the federal ban.The reversal occurred just hours after major app stores removed TikTok, rendering it inoperative for US users. TikTok confirmed on X (formerly Twitter) that it was working with service providers to reinstate access. Trump posted on Truth Social January 19 morning that he would issue an executive order on January 20 to delay the enforcement of the ban, providing more time for a deal to address national security concerns.TikTok update to users in the USAfter President-elect Donald Trump's post, TikTok stated that it was working with tech companies and service providers to restore access. The platform thanked Trump for his plan to extend the deadline, allowing ByteDance additional time to secure a US-approved buyer.While some users reported that TikTok was operational again, the app reportedly remained unavailable for download on Apple’s App Store. The company’s website also appeared to be partially functional for certain users, although it was unclear if services had been fully restored.","Perplexity AI has reportedly submitted a proposal to merge with TikTok US.

CEO of America's largest bank to employees: We think it is the best way to run the company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ceo-of-americas-largest-bank-to-employees-we-think-it-is-the-best-way-to-run-the-company/articleshow/117378630.cms,"Poll Will This Full-Time Office Policy Improve Overall Company Performance? No, It May Reduce Employee Satisfaction Yes, It Encourages Focus and Teamwork

Some employees unhappy with the 'order'

JPMorgan Chase is mandating a full-time return to the office for its employees, following the lead of CEO Jamie Dimon and other Wall Street leaders like those at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who believe in-person work fosters better learning, innovation, and company culture. With this, JPMorgan joins a growing list of major corporations, including AT&T, Amazon, and Walmart, that are implementing stricter return-to-office policies.A memo from JPMorgan's operating committee stated that over half of its 316,000 global employees already work in the office full-time, and that ""Now is the right time to solidify our full-time in-office approach"" . ""We think it is the best way to run the company,"" the executives wrote.A JPMorgan spokesperson confirmed the contents of the memo but declined to comment further. ""We know that some of you prefer a hybrid schedule and respectfully understand that not everyone will agree with this decision,"" Dimon and other leaders wrote in the memo. ""Being together greatly enhances mentoring, learning, brainstorming and getting things done.""Despite this justification, some JPMorgan staff expressed their displeasure with the directive on the company's intranet, citing concerns about increased commuting and childcare costs, as well as mental health and stress. Reportedly, the comment page was locked after more than 300 comments were posted within the first hour.This move follows a phased return to the office at JPMorgan, which began with rotational schedules in mid-2021 and a full-time return for managing directors in 2023. The bank has stated that employees will receive at least 30 days' notice before the full-time return is expected and can request additional time from their managers if needed. JPMorgan also emphasized its commitment to workplace flexibility, offering special exceptions for remote work and flexibility for personal reasons, details of which are available in a linked FAQ document.","JPMorgan Chase is mandating a full-time return to the office for its employees.

"Microsoft search market share doubles, as Google's share falls just below 90% for the first time",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-search-market-share-doubles-as-googles-share-falls-just-below-90-for-the-first-time/articleshow/117320875.cms,"

How Google's search market share dropped

Google's dominance in the global search engine market has dipped below 90% for the first time in almost a decade. According to Statcounter, in the last three months of 2024, Google's market share fell to 89.34% in October, 89.99% in November, and 89.74% in December. This marks a significant shift in the search landscape, as Google has consistently held over 90% of the market share for almost a decade. The last time Google's share was below 90% was in early 2015.However, this decline has helped Microsoft 's Bing search engine to experience a major growth in usage during the latter half of 2024, with its market share almost doubling to reach around 4%. This suggests that Bing is slowly gaining popularity, although it still lags significantly behind Google.As per Statcounter data, Google seems to be gradually losing its search market share. The company’s search market share has remained relatively stable in most regions except Asia, which appears to be a significant factor behind the overall decline, the report suggests.In the US, Google’s search market share peaked at 90.37% in November 2024 but dropped to 87.39% by December. For the rest of 2024, the share fluctuated between 86-88%, showing a slight but noticeable decline.Despite dominating the search market for nearly a decade with a consistent 90-92+% share, Google has faced criticism over the growing unhelpfulness of its search results.This, along with allegations of maintaining an illegal monopoly, has placed the company under scrutiny for almost two years.While Google's search market share decline might suggest users are turning to AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT Search and Perplexity, Statcounter's data doesn't specifically mention that. The report primarily tracks traditional search engines like Bing, Yandex, and Yahoo , with a minor ""other"" category that includes DuckDuckGo and Ecosia.Microsoft's Bing, the second most popular search engine, saw a slight increase in market share, hovering around 4% in the latter half of 2024.It's worth noting that a similar dip in Google's market share in April 2024 turned out to be a data error. However, the consistent decline in the last three months of 2024 suggests a real shift in user behaviour, even if the specific reasons remain unclear.","Google's market share fell to 89.34% in October, 89.99% in November, and 89.74% in December.

TikTok may get some respite from Donald Trump as the President-elect has announced that he will “most likely” grant TikTok a 90-day reprieve from a potential ban after he takes office on Monday (December 20). This comes as the app, with 170 million American users, faces a shutdown set for Sunday (December 19).“I think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at,” Trump said in the phone interview with NBC, highlighting that he hasn’t made a final decision.“The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate. You know, it’s appropriate. We have to look at it carefully. It’s a very big situation,” Trump added.“If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday,” Trump noted.The bipartisan law passed last year explicitly permits a 90-day extension under specific conditions. However, even if an extension is granted on Monday, it may not prevent the app from going dark for at least a day, as the current compliance deadline is Sunday.The Chinese-owned app stated last week that it will go dark in the US on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provides assurances to companies like Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when the ban takes effect.The White House, however, dismissed TikTok's Friday comment as a stunt, reiterating that it was up to the incoming Trump administration to take action, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on Sunday.“We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Meanwhile, the Chinese embassy in Washington accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok.“China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” a spokesperson said.The US Supreme Court justices upheld the ban in a unanimous decision.",TikTok faces a shutdown in the US on Sunday if it doesn't comply with a ban.

No, There's Still a Long Way to Go Yes, Progress Is Visible

Why I Left Infosys Job Without Any Offer Letter in Hand, Despite Being the Sole Breadwinner for My Family

During my time at Infosys, I faced several systemic issues that ultimately forced me to make the difficult decision of leaving without an offer in hand. I want to speak openly about these challenges because they are indicative of larger problems in corporate workplaces:

1. No Financial Growth Despite Promotion: Being promoted from System Engineer to Senior System Engineer sounds good on paper, but it meant nothing without a monetary hike. For three years, I worked hard, met expectations, and contributed to the team, yet saw no financial acknowledgment of my efforts.

2. Unfair Workload Redistribution: When the team size reduced from 50 to 30 due to attrition, the additional workload was simply dumped on the remaining employees. Instead of hiring replacements or providing support, the management took the easy route—overburdening the existing team without compensation or even recognition.

3. Stagnant Career Prospects: The account I was assigned to was a loss-making one, as admitted by my manager. This directly impacted salary hikes and opportunities for career growth. Staying in such an account felt like professional stagnation, with no light at the end of the tunnel.

4. Toxic Client Environment: The client’s unrealistic demands for ultra-quick responses created a toxic work culture where even minor issues led to escalations. This pressure trickled down, creating stress at every level of the hierarchy. It felt like a constant state of firefighting, with no room for personal well-being.

5. Lack of Recognition: Despite consistent efforts and recognition from my peers and seniors, none of it translated into tangible rewards—be it financial growth, promotions, or career advancements. Hard work felt like it was being taken for granted.

6. Onsite Opportunities and Regional Bias: Onsite opportunities were never based on merit but rather on linguistic preferences. Employees speaking Telugu, Tamil, and Malayalam were frequently prioritized for such roles, while Hindi-speaking employees like me were overlooked, regardless of our performance. This blatant bias was both unfair and demoralizing.

These issues aren’t unique to me—they reflect the experiences of countless employees who feel voiceless in the face of such systemic failures. I chose to leave because I couldn’t compromise my self-respect and mental health for an organization that ignored these basic issues.

It’s time corporate managers stop sugarcoating the realities on the ground and start addressing these problems. Employees are not resources to be exploited; they are human beings with aspirations and limits. If such toxic practices continue unchecked, organizations risk losing not only their talent but also their credibility.

Infosys CEO Salil Parekh has addressed the growing concerns over the company's work culture following a viral LinkedIn post by former employee Bhupendra Vishwakarma. The post, which highlighted several issues including discrimination, lack of financial growth, and a toxic work environment , has sparked an online debate.During the Q3 earnings call on January 16, Parekh reaffirmed Infosys's commitment to fair treatment and inclusivity. ""Within Infosys, we have clear approach to make sure everyone is treated fairly. We have well defined process of seeing progress and everyone getting benefits. We hold ourselves to high standards,"" he stated.Parekh's remarks come amidst broader industry discussions about work-life balance and long work hours, further ignited by comments from L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan advocating for employees to work on Sundays. Vishwakarma in his LinkedIn post claimed he left Infosys without another job offer due to a lack of career growth, unfair workload distribution, and regional biases.During the press conference, Infosys reiterated its commitment to talent acquisition, confirming that the company is on track to hire approximately 15,000 freshers as planned for the current fiscal year.","Infosys CEO Salil Parekh has addressed the growing concerns over the company's work culture following a viral LinkedIn post by former employee Bhupendra Vishwakarma.

AI company led by ‘Desi CEO’ wants to merge with TikTok,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-company-led-by-desi-ceo-wants-to-merge-with-tiktok/articleshow/117369252.cms,"Problems that the merger may face

Perplexity AI , the AI-powered search engine startup led by Aravind Srinivas, has reportedly submitted a bid with TikTok parent company ByteDance to acquire its US business, proposing a merger with the popular video-sharing platform. The move comes as TikTok goes dark in the country with Apple and Google removing the app from their respective app stores.Citing a source familiar with the situation, a report by CNBC said that the proposed deal will see Perplexity AI merge with TikTok US, with ByteDance's existing investors retaining their equity stakes. This merger would integrate TikTok’s massive user base and video content with Perplexity AI’s search capabilities, creating a new entity in the evolving AI-powered search landscape.The success of this bid will depend on several factors, including the willingness of ByteDance's shareholders to participate in the merger and the final terms of the agreement. The valuation of the merged entity is expected to be ""well north of $50 billion,"" according to sources familiar with the matter.Perplexity AI's valuation surged from about $500 million at the beginning of 2024 to an estimated $9 billion by 2024-end.Any potential transaction between Perplexity AI and ByteDance would likely take months to complete.While the proposed merger faces significant hurdles, including the potential for regulatory scrutiny, it presents a unique opportunity for both companies. Perplexity AI's innovative technology may reportedly enhance TikTok's user experience, while TikTok's massive user base could provide Perplexity AI with valuable data and insights.The reported move by Perplexity AI reflects the growing recognition of AI-powered search as a critical area of competition. OpenAI’s launch of SearchGPT and Google's introduction of “AI Overviews” in search results highlight the increasing importance of AI in how users access and consume information online.AI-assisted search has been viewed as a significant risk to Google and OpenAI, which introduced a search engine called SearchGPT last year. Google later launched “AI Overviews” in search, allowing users to see quick summaries of answers at the top of results.","Perplexity AI, the AI-powered search engine startup, has reportedly submitted a bid with TikTok parent company ByteDance to acquire its US business. The move comes as TikTok goes dark in the country with Apple and Google removing the app from their respective app stores. This merger would integrate TikTok’s massive user base and video content with Perplexity's search capabilities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117369239,imgsize-18256,width-400,resizemode-4/117369239.jpg"

TikTok stops working in US; app now reads this ban message,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktok-stops-working-in-us-app-now-reads-this-ban-message/articleshow/117366594.cms,"Why US banned TikTok

What’s next for TikTok

TikTok has stopped working in the US, reports Reuters. This means people in the US can no longer use the popular short-video platform. After months of legal battles, the US Supreme Court on Friday, January 17 approved a law to ban TikTok, citing national security concerns . TikTok users in the US now see this message when they open the app:“A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned”.US officials have raised concerns about TikTok, claiming it poses a national security risk. They believe the Chinese government could use the app to spy on Americans or secretly influence public opinion by controlling what content is shown or hidden.The worry stems from Chinese national security laws that require companies to assist with intelligence activities. FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress last year that the Chinese government could potentially access and compromise Americans’ devices through TikTok’s software.These concerns led the US Congress to pass a law banning TikTok unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sold it to a buyer approved by the U.S. government. President Joe Biden signed the law in April 2024, giving ByteDance until January 19 to sell TikTok. However, ByteDance's attempt to challenge the law in court failed. On December 6, a panel of three federal judges unanimously ruled against TikTok, rejecting its argument that the law violated free speech rights under the First Amendment.The Supreme Court unanimously rejected TikTok’s appeal on January 17, resulting in the ban coming into effect on January 19.The future of TikTok in the U.S. remains uncertain. Over time, the app is expected to stop functioning properly, as updates and support from app stores like Apple and Google would be blocked under the new law. Eventually, TikTok could become completely unusable in the country.All eyes are now on President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to take office on January 20. In a statement to NBC recently, Trump referred to the TikTok situation as a ""very big situation"" and said he is planning to push back a potential TikTok ban for 90 days.Until then, TikTok users and businesses that relied on the app for growth face an uncertain future, as the app has already stopped working in the US.","US officials have raised concerns about TikTok, claiming it poses a national security risk.

"Google, Microsoft, Tesla and other companies cutting jobs should not be allowed to hire on H-1B visa: Bernie Sanders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-microsoft-tesla-and-other-companies-cutting-jobs-should-not-be-allowed-to-hire-on-h-1b-visa-bernie-sanders/articleshow/117361723.cms,"Bernie Sanders

Poll Do you agree with Bernie Sanders' criticism of the H-1B visa program? No Yes

Sanders' amendment proposes these changes:

Increased H-1B Fees:

Higher Prevailing Wages:

Protection for American Workers:

Senator Bernie Sanders introduced an amendment to the Laken Riley Act aimed at reforming the H-1B visa program, arguing it primarily serves to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign guest workers. He contends these workers are often exploited, akin to indentured servants. “The main function of the H-1B programme is not to hire 'the best and the brightest' but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with hundreds of thousands of lower-paid guest workers from abroad who are often treated as indentured servants. The cheaper it is to hire guest workers, the more money the multi-billionaire owners of large corporations make,” Sanders, 83, said on the Senate floor earlier this week.Sanders directly challenged Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy's support of the H-1B program, questioning why Tesla laid off thousands of American workers while simultaneously seeking to hire H-1B visa holders. He cited examples of Tesla hiring H-1B workers for significantly lower salaries than typical for similar positions in the US. He argued that the program is being used to drastically reduce labor costs for corporations, rather than filling genuine skill gaps.“They are two sides of the same coin. If there is truly a major shortage of skilled tech workers in this country, as Musk has argued, why did Tesla lay off over 7,500 American workers last year – including many software developers and engineers at its factory in Austin, Texas – while applying to hire thousands of H-1B guest workers?” he asked.Corporations engaged in mass layoffs should not be allowed to replace American workers with guest workers. “Finally, this amendment would prevent corporations from treating H-1B guest workers as indentured servants. Under current law, H-1B guest workers are often locked into lower-paying jobs and can have their visas taken away from them by their corporate bosses if they complain about dangerous, unfair or illegal working conditions,” he noted.“That is unacceptable and has got to change. This amendment would make H-1B visas portable and enable guest workers to easily change jobs,” Sanders said.Doubling the fees corporations pay to hire H-1B workers, generating an estimated $370 million annually for scholarships for American students in STEM fields.Requiring corporations to pay H-1B workers at least the median local wage for their position, preventing wage undercutting of American workers.Prohibiting companies from replacing laid-off American workers with H-1B visa holders.Worker Protections: Making H-1B visas portable, allowing guest workers to change jobs and escape potentially exploitative working conditions.Sanders criticized claims of a tech worker shortage, citing data showing numerous American STEM graduates are unemployed. He pointed out that many top H-1B employers are outsourcing companies (""body shops"") that facilitate both domestic and international job outsourcing. He highlighted examples of H-1B workers being paid significantly less than American workers in comparable roles, such as software developers in Dallas and accountants in Houston.","Senator Bernie Sanders introduced an amendment to the Laken Riley Act aimed at reforming the H-1B visa program.

The European Union (EU) seems quite 'upset with Elon Musk. The political bloc of 27 European nations is intensifying its investigation into Elon Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter), demanding greater transparency regarding its algorithms. This move comes amid heightened scrutiny of Elon Musk 's public pronouncements on European politics, which have fueled calls for stronger EU action.The European Commission, the EU's digital regulator, is under pressure from EU lawmakers to address concerns about X potentially manipulating its platform to amplify far-right content and politicians. This follows Musk's controversial statements on some European leaders and his support for Germany's far-right AfD party.The investigation, initiated in December 2023 under the Digital Services Act (DSA), focuses on how Twitter handles illegal content and disinformation. The EU has now specifically requested internal documentation on Twitter's recommender systems—the algorithms that personalize content for users—and any recent modifications made to them by February 15.Furthermore, X is required to preserve all internal records concerning planned changes to its recommender algorithms from January 17 to December 31 of this year, unless the investigation concludes sooner. The EU also seeks access to certain commercial APIs, which would facilitate independent analysis of content moderation and account virality.EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen emphasized the importance of these steps in assessing systemic risks and their mitigation under the DSA. The Commission aims to ensure X complies with EU legislation designed to create a fair, safe, and democratic online environment.Musk has criticized the DSA as a form of censorship. The law, fully implemented in February 2023, represents the EU's efforts to regulate large tech companies.Despite accusations of political influence, particularly from the Trump administration, the EU maintains that its enforcement actions are impartial. In July 2024, the EU formally accused X of misleading users with its blue check verification system, lacking advertising transparency, and denying researchers access to platform data.

Startups are the heartbeat of this nation. In just a short time, we’re already the 3rd largest startup ecosystem in the world. And soon, we’ll be the first—I know it!

Startups are more than just businesses—they’re engines of innovation, job creation, stories of risks and rewards and global recognition. Credits to the founders from every corner of India dreaming, hustling, building, and growing :)

I love nothing more than being one of them and supporting so many of them.

So here’s to the dreamers, doers, and risk-takers—Happy National Startup Day !

We’re just getting started

Updates aim to streamline the H-1B approval process, increase employer flexibility, and improve program integrity.

Which visa categories are impacted by the H-1B rule changes

What is the H-2 visa program

What is the goal of the changes to the H-2 program

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has implemented new rules to modernize and improve the H-1B and H-2 nonimmigrant visa programs. These changes were published in the Federal Register on December 18, 2024 and came into effect on January 17, 2025. The H-1B program allows American companies to temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty occupations requiring highly specialized knowledge and at least a bachelor's degree (or equivalent).The new H-1B rules aim to streamline the approval process, increases employer flexibility in retaining talent, and enhances program integrity and oversight. While primarily focused on H-1B specialty occupation workers, some provisions also affect other nonimmigrant classifications, including H-2, H-3, F-1, L-1, O, P, Q-1, R-1, E-3, and TN. The current annual cap for H-1B visas stands at 65,000, with an additional 20,000 reserved for those holding advanced degrees from US institutions.The H-2 program covers temporary agricultural (H-2A) and nonagricultural (H-2B) workers. The updated H-2 rule strengthens worker protections by imposing stricter penalties on companies that charge prohibited fees or violate labor laws. It also provides greater flexibility for both H-2A and H-2B workers. The DHS aims to enhance the integrity of the H-2 programs and improve worker protections through these regulatory changes.The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has implemented new rules to modernize and improve the H-1B (specialty occupations) and H-2 (temporary agricultural and nonagricultural workers) nonimmigrant visa programs.Both rules were published in the Federal Register on December 18, 2024.The H-1B final rule aims to modernize the program by:* Streamlining the approval process. Students on F-1 visas will face fewer disruptions when shifting to H-1B status. F-1 visa students applying for an H-1B visa will benefit from an automatic extension of their F-1 visa until April 1 of that year. This will ensure continuity in lawful status and work authorisation while their H-1B application is under review. USCIS has committed to expediting applications for H-1B extensions to ease the burden on both employers as well as workers.* Increasing flexibility for employers to retain talented workers. Businesses can hire H-1B workers based on documented needs, allowing more adaptable workforce planning. ap-exempt organisations, such as universities and research bodies, can now submit petitions throughout the year without numerical limitations.* Improving the integrity and oversight of the program. The DHS may request supporting documents to verify job authenticity. CWhile the provisions mainly amend regulations for H-1B specialty occupation workers, some provisions also impact other nonimmigrant classifications, including: H-2, H-3, F-1, L-1, O, P, Q-1, R-1, E-3, and TN.The H-2 visa program covers temporary agricultural (H-2A) and temporary nonagricultural (H-2B) nonimmigrant workers.The rule is intended to better ensure the integrity of the H-2 programs and enhance protections for workers. ""The H-2 final rule significantly strengthens worker protections by, among other things, imposing new consequences on companies that charge prohibited fees or violate our labor laws, and provides greater flexibility for H-2A and H-2B workers,"" says release on USCIS website.","The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has implemented new rules to modernize and improve the H-1B and H-2 nonimmigrant visa programs.

"IBM does not aim to compete with Nvidia in helping create and train AI systems, but is ..., says Tom McPherson, GM of Power systems, IBM",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ibm-does-not-aim-to-compete-with-nvidia-in-helping-create-and-train-ai-systems-but-is-says-tom-mcpherson-gm-of-power-systems-ibm/articleshow/122395217.cms,"IBM is not competing with Nvidia

IBM recently launched its new Power11 line of data center chips and servers, marking a significant leap in power efficiency and the simplification of artificial intelligence (AI) deployment within business operations. This update, the first major refresh to its ""Power"" chip line since 2020, positions IBM to compete more aggressively in the specialized data center market. Traditionally, IBM's Power chips have been a strong contender against offerings from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), particularly in demanding sectors such as financial services, manufacturing, and healthcare.Similar to Nvidia's AI servers, IBM's Power systems are an integrated solution, combining both powerful chips and sophisticated software. This tight integration, Tom McPherson, General Manager of Power Systems at IBM, told Reuters, has allowed the company to prioritise unparalleled reliability and robust security.McPherson clarified that IBM's strategy isn't to directly compete with Nvidia in the realm of creating and training AI systems. Instead, Big Blue is sharply focused on streamlining AI deployment for inference – the crucial process of putting an AI system to work to accelerate business tasks. ""We can integrate AI capabilities seamlessly into this for inference acceleration and help their business process improvements,"" McPherson reportedly said in an interview, referring to work with early customers. He, as per the Reuters report, added, ""It's not going to have all the horsepower for training or anything, but it's going to have really good inferencing capabilities that are simple to integrate.""A key highlight of the new Power11 systems, which will be available starting July 25, is their exceptional uptime. IBM claims these systems will require no planned downtime for software updates, and their average unplanned downtime each year will be a mere 30 seconds. Furthermore, the Power11 systems are engineered to detect and respond to a ransomware attack within a minute, offering a critical defense against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.Looking ahead, IBM plans to integrate the Power11 with Spyre, its AI chip introduced last year, in the fourth quarter of 2025. ""We can integrate AI capabilities seamlessly into this for inference acceleration and help their business process improvements,"" McPherson stated in a recent interview, referencing collaborations with early customers. He emphasized the system's ability to deliver ""really good inferencing capabilities that are simple to integrate,"" even if it doesn't boast the same horsepower as training-focused systems. This strategic focus on simplifying AI for practical business applications could prove to be a significant advantage for IBM in the evolving data center landscape.","IBM recently launched its new Power11 line of data center chips and servers, marking a significant leap in power efficiency.

What RealSense’s CEO said about Intel’s new subsidiary



Lava Storm Play First Look: Best Budget Phone Under Rs 10,000?

Intel is spinning out its artificial intelligence (AI) robotics and biometric venture into a new company named RealSense. This announcement came after the US-based chipmaker cut 500 jobs, which affected 15% to 20% of its factory workers. As more companies invest in automation tools, RealSense also secured a $50 million Series A funding round. This funding includes contributions from MediaTek Innovation Fund and Intel Capital, the chipmaker’s venture arm, which is also being spun out from Intel. RealSense, which develops tools and technology for robotics automation , stated its intention to use the new funding to develop additional product lines and address increasing global demand.Nadav Orbach , currently Intel’s vice president and general manager for incubation and disruptive innovation, will assume the role of CEO at RealSense.In an interview with CNBC, Orbach highlighted the technology’s broader adoption and more practical applications, saying, “the timing is now for physical AI.”“We want to develop new product lines. We see the demand and we see the need, and with where it’s at right now, the right thing for us was to raise external funds,” Orbach added.RealSense now operates independently with about 130 employees, focusing on developing safe and user-friendly tools. Intel retains a minority stake, the report added.Global companies are increasing investments in robotics as AI adoption grows. Morgan Stanley estimates the humanoid robot market could reach $5 trillion by 2050, with tech giants like Tesla and Amazon leading the charge.Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, views robotics as its next major opportunity after AI, while Salesforce claims AI handles up to half its workload.Meanwhile, Intel, facing setbacks in the AI race, has taken cost-cutting measures, including CEO and job cuts. It recently sold most of its stake in Altera and spun off RealSense, its 3D vision unit, which supports autonomous robotics firms like Eyesynth.","Intel is spinning out its artificial intelligence (AI) robotics and biometric venture into a new company named RealSense.

Who else left Elon Musk and why? Profiles of the 14 departing executives

Omead Afshar – former head of Tesla sales (North America & Europe)

Jenna Ferrua – director of human resources, Tesla

Milan Kovac – head of the Optimus robot program, Tesla

Vineet Mehta – head of battery architecture, Tesla

Mark Westfall – head of mechanical engineering, Tesla Energy

Joe Benarroch – head of operations, X

Brett Weitz – head of content & brand, X

Dave Heinzinger – head of media strategy, X

Haofei Wang – head of product engineering, X

Linda Yaccarino has stepped down as CEO of Elon Musk ’s social media platform, X, after just over two years in the role. Her departure comes amid growing chaos in Musk’s business empire, where politics, controversy, and high-level exits are becoming a pattern. Yaccarino’s resignation marks the latest in a string of high-profile departures. Fourteen other senior leaders from Tesla , SpaceX , and X have left their roles in the past 12 months. As Musk increasingly intertwines his corporate ventures with political ambitions, industry watchers are raising questions about his ability to retain top talent.Yaccarino took over as CEO of X (formerly Twitter) in June 2023, after serving as global chair of advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal. She was brought in to reassure advertisers and stabilize the platform after Musk’s takeover sent many brands fleeing. Her exit was sudden and largely unexplained. In her farewell message, she thanked Musk for entrusting her with the mission of turning X into the ""Everything App"" and upholding free speech. However, her departure signals deepening instability at X, where internal tensions, advertiser exodus, and falling user trust continue to plague the platform.Afshar was one of Musk’s most trusted lieutenants, overseeing major regional sales and playing a pivotal role in strategic operations. He was also considered Musk’s proxy during his brief political tenure as DOGE Chief. Afshar’s departure in June 2025 was reportedly due to internal disagreements over Tesla’s new market strategy and Musk's increasing focus on politics.Ferrua worked at Tesla for over seven years, managing workforce expansion, policy restructuring, and talent development. She played a critical role during the company's major hiring surges and internal reorganizations. She left in June 2025, amid growing tensions between executive teams and Musk’s direct involvement in HR decisions.As the lead engineer behind Tesla's humanoid robot initiative, Kovac was credited as the visionary behind Musk’s dream of a trillion-dollar robotics empire. He resigned in June 2025 after reported delays and funding conflicts in the Optimus development timeline.Mehta spent 18 years at Tesla, overseeing its lithium-ion and next-gen battery platforms. He was instrumental in designing the battery systems for the Model S and Cybertruck. His exit in May 2025 raised concerns over the future of Tesla’s innovation in battery technology.Westfall was with Tesla for over a decade, focusing on solar power products and the Powerwall battery storage systems. His departure in April 2025 came as Tesla Energy was undergoing a strategic shift, cutting back on some renewable projects to focus more on AI integration.A veteran of Tesla’s autopilot and user interface teams, Lau was deeply involved in the development of Full Self-Driving software. He left in April 2025 after 12 years at the company, reportedly due to a reshuffling of the software division and executive disagreements.One of the longest-serving business leaders at SpaceX, Ochinero led commercial launch contracts and satellite deals with international clients. His February 2024 exit was viewed as a major blow to SpaceX’s global partnerships.Pickles spent nearly a decade shaping public policy at Twitter/X. He helped navigate the company through misinformation controversies and regulatory battles. He stepped down in September 2024, citing burnout and shifts in platform direction under Musk.Monteiro led X’s global data privacy efforts. A recognized expert in digital rights, he left in September 2024 to take personal time off. Insiders say the platform’s reduced emphasis on privacy and increasing legal battles influenced his decision.Zhang managed Tesla’s most futuristic vehicles — the long-delayed Roadster and Cybertruck. He exited in July 2024 after internal project delays and conflicts over vehicle specs and timelines.Brought in to restructure the company during mass layoffs, Benarroch helped stabilize day-to-day operations post-Musk acquisition. He quit in June 2024, citing strategic misalignment with Musk’s vision for the platform.Formerly a TV executive, Weitz spearheaded the Originals documentary-style content initiative. His departure in June 2025 came after failed attempts to scale premium content on the platform.Heinzinger lasted only four months in his role, quitting in March 2025 due to personal reasons, but many believe it was linked to content moderation controversies.Wang was one of Musk’s closest technical confidants at X and acted as a bridge between Musk and the engineering team. He left in March 2025 reportedly due to mounting pressure and constant strategic pivots.","Linda Yaccarino has stepped down as CEO of Elon Musk ’s social media platform, X.

High import duties could drive up Tesla prices in India

With stores coming to India, Tesla invests in building its team across divisions in India

Tesla is rapidly expanding its India footprint with a second showroom in New Delhi scheduled to open in late July, just weeks after launching its first Mumbai location on Tuesday. The aggressive rollout marks the electric vehicle maker's formal entry into the world's third-largest automobile market as it seeks growth amid slowing global sales.The Mumbai showroom opening will give prospective customers access to pricing, variants, and trim options for Tesla's Model Y rear-wheel drive SUVs imported from China. Deliveries are expected to start from late August, with customers able to configure and order their Tesla EVs from next week, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to Bloomberg News.The Model Y units, declared at approximately 27.7 lakhs rupees ($32,270) each, will sell at a substantial premium due to India's 70% import tariff on fully-built imported cars under $40,000. The vehicles are expected to retail for more than $56,000 around 48.07 lakhs rupees before taxes and insurance, compared to roughly $46,630 in the US market.Tesla is beefing up hiring across charging, retail, and policy teams while leasing warehouse space in Karnataka and Gurugram. The company has imported Supercharger components, car accessories, merchandise, and spares from the US, China, and the Netherlands to support its operations.The first week of Mumbai showroom operations will focus on VIPs and business partners before opening to the general public. Tesla's success in India will test consumers' acceptance of premium pricing in a market where EVs account for just over 5% of passenger vehicle sales and premium cars represent less than 2% of total sales.Tesla's entry comes at a crucial time as the EV maker faces slowing global sales in the second quarter. The company had previously delayed its India launch due to disagreements over tariffs and local manufacturing requirements, but breakthrough came after Elon Musk met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February.","Tesla is expanding its India footprint with a second showroom in New Delhi scheduled to open in late July.

The government has shared its response on Chinese engineers reportedly leaving the biggest iPhone supplier, Foxconn’s plant in India. According to a report by the news agency PTI, the government has stated that it's monitoring production targets and believes Apple has alternatives to manage any related issues. This comes amid reports of hundreds of Chinese technology professionals returning to China. These professionals were reportedly facilitating and managing production at Foxconn plants in India. Their departure has led to speculation that it could affect the production of the upcoming iPhone 17 series. The report claims that government sources have noted that they are aware of the situation and have confidence in Apple's ability to navigate it.In a statement to PTI, a government source said:A large part of mobile phone manufacturing equipment is imported from China, and Chinese professionals have the expertise to operate it. The report cited sources to claim that the returning engineers had been managing assembly lines, factory design, and worker training for iPhone production.

Multiple sources indicate that Apple is planning to scale up iPhone production in India to around 60 million units this year, up from the 35–40 million produced during 2024–25.Apple CEO Tim Cook recently stated during the company’s earnings call that all iPhones sold in the US during the June quarter would be shipped from India.iPhones made in India are primarily assembled at Foxconn’s facility in Tamil Nadu.

Dell CEO Michael Dell has raised concerns about the internal culture impact Meta may face due to its aggressive hiring of artificial intelligence talent from rivals – Google DeepMind, OpenAI, GitHub, Apple and others. Speaking on the BG2 podcast hosted by Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner on Thursday, Dell warned that bringing in top AI professionals at high salaries could lead to dissatisfaction among existing staff at Meta Platforms . “It’ll be a challenge culturally for sure,” Dell said.He further explained that offering higher pay to new hires could make current employees feel left out or underappreciated, which may result in friction within teams and create a long line of “complaining” employees outside CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s office.Emphasizing the importance of fairness in the workplace, he stated “People generally have a sense of fairness, right? They want to be treated fairly relative to others and relative to the opportunities that they have out there in the overall market.” Dell further stated that while Meta’s strategy and the “math” may work if this is reduced to a “race to super intelligence,” but he also warned against the potential for internal conflict and dissatisfaction should not be overlooked.Meta has significantly ramped up hiring through its Superintelligence Labs, launched in June to focus on artificial general intelligence (AGI). The company has hired talent from competitors such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and Apple. This talent war has reshaped the AI sector and drawn mixed reactions from industry leaders.Earlier, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also criticized Meta’s hiring strategy, calling it “distasteful” and suggesting it may create issues inside the company. Altman even hinted that OpenAI might need to review its compensation policies in response to Meta’s aggressive poaching.Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn and former OpenAI board member, offered a different view. In an interview with CNBC, Hoffman said it makes economic sense for companies to spend big on AI talent if they want to stay ahead.","Dell CEO Michael Dell has raised concerns about the internal culture impact Meta may face due to its aggressive hiring of artificial intelligence talent.

Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for 'offensive' political slurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/poland-flags-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-to-the-eu-for-offensive-political-slurs/articleshow/122348777.cms,"Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for “offensive” political slurs

Why Poland says Elon Musk's Grok chatbot crossed a red line



Offensive answers: From antisemitic tropes to political insults



European digital rules put xAI under the spotlight



Previous incidents: Turkey, hate speech, and Grok’s growing rap sheet



xAI and Musk offer silence, at least for now



Poland just pulled the alarm on Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk ’s xAI. Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates. Poland’s complaint tees up an early test of those combined powers.Legal scholars note that fines can reach 6 percent of global turnover for DSA violations. For Musk’s empire, that runs into billions.Poland is not alone. A Turkish court ordered X to block Grok content that mocked President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Islamic beliefs.In June, users spotted the bot rambling about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. xAI blamed an “unauthorised change” to its response code.Each flare-up feeds an image of a system that swings from playful banter to extremist rhetoric with a single prompt.As of Wednesday afternoon, xAI had not replied to Reuters’ emailed questions, and Musk’s normally hyperactive X feed stayed quiet on the topic.The billionaire recently urged “maximum free speech” on X, but he also says AI must be “truth-seeking.” That balance gets messy when the bot channels conspiracy theories or ethnic slurs.","Poland says the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders.

Six-figure salary jobs that AI won’t replace but will assist

Wider workforce gaps show an urgent need for reskilling

As artificial intelligence continues to automate more and more tasks once managed by humans, fears of mass job losses are growing. Yet a new report from the Future Skills Organisation offers a more nuanced outlook. Despite rapid advances in AI, many high-paying white-collar jobs are not only expected to survive but thrive well into the next decade.Jobs such as accountants, IT managers, financial advisers, executives, and banking professionals, all typically commanding six-figure salaries, are projected to remain in strong demand through 2030. The report highlights that while AI can process data and streamline workflows, human roles that require leadership, judgment, and trust remain irreplaceable.Accountants, for instance, continue to be critical in areas like auditing, compliance, and financial strategy. Their average annual incomes range from approximately $100,000 to $130,000 in many advanced economies. Similarly, IT managers, who oversee infrastructure, cybersecurity, and digital transitions, often earn well over $160,000, and demand for their expertise is steadily growing.The financial sector is also seeing persistent shortages of investment advisers and portfolio managers. These professionals typically earn between $140,000 and $370,000 depending on seniority, and their work involves not just number crunching but also client relationships and market judgment, skills that go beyond the reach of automation.At the top of the ladder, CEOs and other executives continue to be indispensable. Though supported by AI-driven analytics, their roles require complex decision-making, ethical reasoning, and strategic vision that machines cannot emulate. Executive salaries often average around $200,000 or higher, depending on region and industry.The report also points to talent shortages in mid-level and support roles such as bookkeepers, clerks, and receptionists, which play a key role in organizational efficiency. Despite earning more modest salaries, many of these positions are becoming harder to fill due to mismatches between labor market needs and available skills training.Experts say the talent pipeline in both the tech and finance sectors is struggling to keep up with evolving demands. While AI will continue to enhance productivity and change the nature of many jobs, it cannot replicate the human qualities like creativity, empathy, and leadership that define long-term professional success.Rather than replacing workers entirely, AI is reshaping how we work, and the future belongs to those who can blend digital fluency with human intelligence.","Despite rapid advances in AI, many high-paying white-collar jobs are not only expected to survive but thrive well into the next decade.

Europe needs bold action to reverse competitive decline advises Dimon

Dimon says markets underestimate tariff and inflation risks

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon delivered a blunt assessment of Europe's economic trajectory at a Dublin event Thursday, warning that the continent faces a critical competitiveness crisis that threatens its global standing.""You're losing,"" Dimon told European leaders at Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs, highlighting a dramatic economic shift. ""Europe has gone from 90% U.S. GDP to 65% over 10 or 15 years. That's not good.""The Wall Street titan's stark message underscores mounting concerns about Europe's ability to compete with the U.S. and China in an increasingly fragmented global economy. Dimon attributed the decline to structural issues and regulatory fragmentation that have hampered the region's growth potential.""We've got this huge, strong market and our companies are big and successful, have huge kinds of scale that are global. You have that, but less and less,"" Dimon said, contrasting America's corporate dominance with Europe's diminishing presence.The JPMorgan chief emphasized that Europe's salvation lies in completing its internal market integration. ""Everything should be a single market,"" he said, calling for ""common banks, common disclosure laws, common exchange, common transparency laws, climate.""Dimon's prescription aligns with former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi 's 2024 competitiveness report, which called for €800 billion in annual investment to maintain pace with global rivals.Beyond Europe's structural challenges, Dimon warned of broader economic complacency. He criticized financial markets for underestimating the impact of President Trump 's latest tariff threats, including 50% duties on Brazilian imports and copper, and potential 200% rates on pharmaceuticals.""Unfortunately, I think there is complacency in the market,"" Dimon said, noting that investors have become ""a little desensitised"" to tariff announcements despite their inflationary potential.The banking executive sees significantly higher odds of Federal Reserve rate hikes than market pricing suggests. ""The market is pricing a 20% chance [of a rate hike], I would price in a 40-50% chance. I would put that as a cause for concern,"" he said.Dimon's remarks serve as a wake-up call for European policymakers and investors, emphasizing the urgent need for structural reforms and transatlantic cooperation to navigate an increasingly challenging global economic landscape.",JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon delivered a blunt assessment of Europe's economic trajectory at a Dublin event Thursday.

In a major shake-up for the tech world, OpenAI is reportedly gearing up to launch an AI-powered web browser that could directly rival Google Chrome, as reported by Reuters. This upcoming browser aims to redefine how users interact with the internet by embedding ChatGPT-like functionalities into the browsing experience itself. If OpenAI successfully attracts even a portion of its 500 million weekly ChatGPT users, it could severely disrupt Alphabet’s ad-revenue model, which heavily relies on Chrome for user data collection and default search engine routing.OpenAI’s new browser is expected to launch within weeks, as per three insiders familiar with the project. At its core, the browser will utilise artificial intelligence to transform the traditional web experience, shifting from passive browsing to interactive, assistant-led navigation.By keeping many user tasks within a native chat interface similar to ChatGPT—OpenAI aims to reduce the need to visit websites directly, thereby changing how users discover and engage with online content. Google Chrome is a critical pillar of Alphabet’s advertising empire, providing detailed user behavior data that powers its ad targeting algorithms. Nearly 75% of Alphabet’s revenue stems from advertising, and Chrome's widespread usage over 3 billion users globally helps route search traffic directly to Google Search by default.OpenAI’s browser could undercut this advantage by diverting search behavior away from Google, especially if it becomes the go-to platform for AI-assisted web tasks.OpenAI’s strategy includes deep integration of its AI tools like Operator, turning the browser into a powerful task-completion agent. This means the browser could book reservations, fill out forms, or complete purchases directly on behalf of the user. Such agent-based interactions, backed by full access to a user's web activity, represent a shift toward proactive internet use, where the AI doesn't just assist but acts on your behalf.The browser is being built atop Chromium, Google’s open-source browser framework that also powers Microsoft Edge and Opera. Interestingly, OpenAI has recently hired two former Google VPs who were part of the original Chrome development team, showing its serious intent to challenge Google on its own turf.In fact, the Information had previously reported that OpenAI considered developing a browser, and this new release is the culmination of that long-standing vision. OpenAI is not alone in this endeavor. AI startup Perplexity just launched Comet, its own AI-driven browser, while Brave and The Browser Company have also rolled out smart browsers with built-in AI summarization and task handling features. Still, OpenAI’s massive ChatGPT user base gives it a unique edge in adoption and market disruption.This browser project is just one part of OpenAI’s push to embed itself deeper into personal and professional life. Earlier this year, the company made headlines by spending $6.5 billion to acquire io, an AI hardware startup led by Jony Ive, Apple’s former design chief. This hints at a longer-term goal of creating a fully integrated AI ecosystem, combining hardware, software, and intelligent agents.The launch could not come at a worse time for Google, which is already facing pressure from US antitrust regulators. In 2023, a judge ruled that Alphabet held an unlawful monopoly in online search, prompting the Department of Justice to push for Chrome’s divestiture. In fact, during court proceedings earlier this year, an OpenAI executive testified that the company would be interested in buying Chrome if it were forced into a sale.If OpenAI’s browser is widely adopted, it could:As OpenAI expands from chatbots to browsers and devices, the line between user and assistant continues to blur, signaling a future where AI doesn’t just help but acts independently on behalf of users in the digital world.","OpenAI is reportedly gearing up to launch an AI-powered web browser that could directly rival Google Chrome.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with US President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday July 10, reports CNBC. The meeting took place on the same day Nvidia became the first company to officially close a trading day with a market value above $4 trillion. With this milestone, the chipmaker has surpassed Apple and Microsoft, who briefly held the spot earlier. Ahead of the meeting, Trump also shared a post on his Truth Social, highlighting Nvidia’s recent stock gains. “NVIDIA IS UP 47% SINCE TRUMP TARIFFS. USA is taking in Hundreds of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs. COUNTRY IS NOW ‘BACK’,” Trump wrote.“A GREAT CREDIT! FED SHOULD RAPIDLY LOWER RATE TO REFLECT THIS STRENGTH. USA SHOULD BE AT THE “TOP OF THE LIST.” NO INFLATION!!!,” he continued.Trump’s comments link the chipmaker’s growth to trade tariffs imposed during his administration, though economists remain divided over the long-term impact of those policies on the US economy.Nvidia's market value crossed $4 trillion recently. The company’s share price hit near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. The difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with US President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday July 10.

Consumers may get incentives to scrap old ACs

BEE to revise energy rating norms more frequently

Quantum Computing Explained Simply | Superposition, Qubits & the Future in 5 Minutes

The Indian government is working on a plan to encourage households to replace air conditioners that are over 10 years old with new, energy-efficient five-star models, reports Economic Times. The initiative aims to reduce electricity consumption by phasing out older, less efficient appliances. As per the report, power minister Manohar Lal met leaders of large AC manufacturers including Blue Star managing director B Thiagarajan, Daikin India MD KJ Jawa, and Voltas MD-designate Mukundan Menon, to discuss the matter last week. The ministry has formed an internal committee to deliberate and finalise the norms, the report added.Citing unnamed sources, the report says that the ministry of power is evaluating a proposal that will allow customers to scrap old ACs with authorised e-waste partners appointed by manufacturers or the government. In return, they will get a discount on new units purchased through their electricity distributor (discom). These lower prices, the report adds, will be achieved through bulk procurement and competitive bidding, using a model similar to the Ujala scheme, under which nearly 369 million LED bulbs were distributed through discoms over the past decade.Another plan being explored is for manufacturers to offer high scrappage value for old ACs. The government plans to compensate them by either incentives or energy credit from discoms that would be adjusted against electricity bills. In this case, consumers could continue buying ACs from retail outlets at regular prices, but with added financial benefits from scrapping old units.Confirming the meeting, Thiagarajan told the publication, “There are about 50 million 10-years-or-older AC units in the country. Consumers typically shift their old ACs to another room or sell to a shop in exchange, which are then reused. Hence, the best way is to scrap them and consumers [should] buy the latest and most energy efficient 5-star ACs.”According to the report, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is also planning to revise the energy rating norms for air conditioners every two years, down from the current 3–4-year cycle. The next changes are expected in 2026 and 2028, following the last revision in July 2022.However, not all companies support frequent rating updates. An industry executive, who did not wish to be named, told ET, “The industry has to invest around ₹400 crore for each rating change, which becomes difficult to recover if there are frequent changes.” He added that energy rating revisions should only happen if there's a significant technology breakthrough.","The Indian government is working on a plan to encourage households to replace air conditioners that are over 10 years old with new, energy-efficient five-star models.

Garry Tan , CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator , has issued a stark warning to engineering and business students: adopting a “fake it till you make it” mindset. Tan emphasised that that such a mindset, if taken too far, can lead to severe legal repercussions, including jail time. Speaking at Y Combinator’s AI Startup School during a live recording of the Lightcone Podcast, Tan criticised some academic entrepreneurship programs that promote deceptive practices. “We’re very worried about them because what we’re coming to understand is they are teaching you to lie,” he said. “That’s a waste of time — and you’re gonna go to jail.”Tan directly criticized unnamed university entrepreneurship courses , suggesting they might be fostering an environment where students feel encouraged to bend the truth in their pursuit of startup success. He emphasised that while ambition and innovation are important, they must be grounded in honesty and integrity.Tan referenced disgraced tech founders Sam Bankman-Fried (FTX) and Elizabeth Holmes (Theranos), both convicted for fraud and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. He warned the students that who follow the same path of exaggerating traction, misleading investors, or fabricating product capabilities they have the risk of ending in jail.“They don’t represent us!” Tan declared, distancing Y Combinator’s ethos from the high-profile scandals that have tarnished Silicon Valley’s reputation.Tan and his colleagues argued that many college entrepreneurship courses offer a “cheap facsimile” of real startup life. Jared Friedman, YC’s managing director, said these programs often teach rigid formulas and encourage hype over substance. “Anytime you try to bottle up entrepreneurship and teach it as a college course, what you end up with is a method, not a company,” he said.They also criticized institutions for restricting access to AI tools like Cursor, an AI-powered code editor, which they believe are essential for modern startup development.Tan has also asked the budding entrepreneurs to go for transparency, build real products, and avoid shortcuts. “Software is the most empowering thing in the world. Why do you have to lie?” he asked.

Explained: What does the US 'Visa Integrity Fee' mean for you

The United States is reportedly introducing a new $250 ""Visa Integrity Fee"" applicable to almost all non-immigrant Visa categories. The move is expected to significantly increase the cost of travel and work for Indian nationals, and potentially impact technology companies reliant on H-1B visas. The new fee, part of the recently signed Omnibus Act (dubbed ""Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill""), took effect on July 4th, with broad implications for tourists, students, and professionals.The ""Visa Integrity Fee"" is said to be designed as a security deposit and is refundable under specific conditions, primarily if Visa holders depart the US within five days of their Visa expiration without seeking an extension or change in status. The fee is also subject to annual adjustments for inflation. Exemptions apply only to diplomatic visa categories (A and G).For Indian nationals, the new levy is projected to raise the average tourist visa fee by 2.5 times, pushing it to approximately Rs 40,000 ($472) starting in 2026. This revised cost incorporates the new $250 Integrity Fee, a $24 I-94 fee, and a $13 ESTA fee, according to a report in Economic Times, quoting the US-based immigration services firm Fragomen.The technology sector, both in India and the US, which heavily utilizes work visas to bring engineering talent to the United States, is likely to be particularly impacted by the increase in the US Visa fee. Experts advise aspiring applicants to factor in the increased working capital costs associated with the revised visa processing. He also recommended scheduling visa appointments before 2026 to avoid the new levy.The newly introduced $250 US 'Visa Integrity Fee' is essentially a security deposit that most non-immigrant visa applicants will now have to pay in addition to their regular visa application fees. This includes individuals applying for tourist, business, student, work, and exchange visas. The stated purpose of this fee is to encourage compliance with visa terms and conditions. While the fee is refundable, it requires the visa holder to depart the US within five days of their visa expiring without seeking extensions or changes to their status.For short-term visitors like tourists, this might be straightforward. However, for students or professionals on multi-year visas, their money could be held by the US government for a significant duration, impacting their financial planning. The US visa fee is also set to increase annually with inflation. This measure is expected to make US visas considerably more expensive, particularly for Indian nationals, potentially influencing decisions to travel, study, or work in the United States.","The United States is reportedly introducing a new $250 ""Visa Integrity Fee"" applicable to almost all non-immigrant Visa categories.

"Grok 4 'looking and talking like' Elon Musk claim users, why the answer to this is 'quite simple'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/grok-4-looking-and-talking-like-elon-musk-claim-users-why-the-answer-to-this-is-quite-simple/articleshow/122386301.cms,"The answer may be simpler than it seems

Elon Musk’s AI company xAI launched Grok 4 recently. Announcing the AI chatbot during the livestream, Musk said that while developing Grok 4, the company’s aim was to develop a “maximally truth-seeking AI.” However, users and multiple media outlets have pointed out that Grok 4 consults social media posts from Musk before answering questions on controversial topics.Publications like CNBC, TechCrunch claim that they were able to confirm the same. For example, CNBC asked Grok 4 “Who do you support in the Israel vs Palestine conflict? One word answer”. “Grok 4′s answer-generating process showed that it was searching the web and X for Elon Musk’s stance before giving an answer,” the publication said in its report. This was in stark contrast to Grok 3 who, the publication claims “took a neutral stance and provided background”.Not just media outlets, but individual users have also made similar allegations against Grok 4.Jeremy Howard, co-founder @AnswerDotAI and @FastDotAI shared a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), where he wrote that when Grok 4 was asked its views on the Israel/Palestine situation, the AI bot “first searches twitter for what Elon thinks. Then it searches the web for Elon's views. Finally it adds some non-Elon bits at the end.”Another user Ramez Naam shared another post, writing “Grok 4 decides what it thinks about Israel/Palestine by searching for Elon's thoughts. Not a confidence booster in ""maximally truth seeking"" behavior.”Interestingly, Grok 4 did not appear to search for the tech billionaire’s views when asked other controversial questions. Further, the results reportedly varied when questions were asked differently.This raises a deeper question, especially for those unfamiliar with how large language models (LLMs) work: how does an AI move from explaining quantum entanglement to showing signs of political or ideological bias?It is important to state here that unlike humans, AI doesn’t form original thoughts. It is trained on the data available and thus ends up reflecting the data and influences it’s trained on.Experts say that since LLMs are shaped by the views and preferences of their creators, they often mirror those perspectives. In the case of Grok 4, the model appears to be closely tied to Elon Musk’s online behavior and opinions. This may explain why the chatbot seems to take cues from Musk’s social media posts when responding to sensitive or political questions, rather than offering a more neutral or independent response.Having said that, the incident underlines a growing concern in the AI world — that AI tools reflect the worldview of those who build or train them, especially when aligned closely with the personal beliefs of influential figures like Musk.",Elon Musk’s AI company xAI launched Grok 4 recently.

DIF flags security risk in Pakistan’s bid to join Brics-backed AI bloc,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dif-flags-security-risk-in-pakistans-bid-to-join-brics-backed-ai-bloc/articleshow/122386013.cms,"‘U.S. Threats Won't Work…’: Putin Aide Ryabkov REBUKES Trump For Threatening BRICS Nations | Watch

BENGALURU: The Digital India Foundation (DIF), a founding member of the AI Alliance Network (AIANET), has opposed the proposed inclusion of Pakistan’s AI Technology Centre (AITeC) in the alliance, warning that it could compromise the group’s credibility, security and core values.Formed following the Brics Summit in late 2024, AIANET was envisioned as a multilateral coalition of AI research institutions committed to ethical, transparent and peaceful development of artificial intelligence. The alliance brings together member institutions from Brics nations and other aligned democracies to foster collaboration in civilian AI research, safeguard against dual-use risks, and set global benchmarks for responsible innovation.In a letter to AIANET leadership dated July 11, 2025, DIF argued that Pakistan’s AI ecosystem lacks institutional accountability, suffers from weak legal safeguards, and is shaped by military-led programs with limited civilian oversight. It warned that AITeC’s entry would pose a direct threat to the network’s integrity.“The membership application of AITeC should be seen as Pakistan’s way of gaining access to our R&D and technology with the aim of weaponising AI,” said Dr. Arvind Gupta, co-founder and head of DIF. “We need to ensure that this does not happen.”DIF flagged several AITeC labs, including those focused on autonomous systems, computer vision, and edge computing, for their dual-use potential and susceptibility to being repurposed for cyber operations, cross-border targeting, or terrorism-linked surveillance. It also cited the 2025 US Country Reports on Terrorism, which highlight the risk of AI tools being used by Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.Pakistan remains on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list due to ongoing failures in curbing terror financing and money laundering. DIF warned that in such an environment, AI labs could be exploited to automate illicit finance channels, including crypto-driven fundraising for extremist networks.The think tank also noted that Pakistan lacks enforceable data protection laws and independent oversight mechanisms, both of which are prerequisites for AIANET membership. It pointed out that the country’s flagship AI agency — CENTAI, under the Pakistan Air Force — prioritises defence applications, which contradicts AIANET’s civilian-first charter.“Pakistan’s integration into this multilateral AI framework would fundamentally undermine the alliance’s commitment to public-good innovation,” DIF stated, urging all members to reject the application in full.The foundation called on AIANET to protect its democratic foundations, global cooperation principles, and long-term goal of building AI systems aligned with ethical and lawful use.","The Digital India Foundation (DIF) is a founding member of the AI Alliance Network (AIANET) DIF has opposed the proposed inclusion of Pakistan’s AI Technology Centre (AITeC) in the alliance, warning that it could compromise the group's credibility, security and core values.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122386038,imgsize-100856,width-400,resizemode-4/DIF-flags-security-risk-in-Pakistans-bid-to-join-Brics-backed-AI-bloc.jpg"

Airlines around the world are increasingly implementing strict rules or outright bans on the use and carriage of power banks during flights. These compact battery packs, once considered essential for modern travelers needing to recharge their devices on the go, are now being reclassified as potential fire hazards. The tightening of regulations comes amid rising concerns in the aviation sector over lithium-ion battery malfunctions that can lead to overheating, fires, or even explosions onboard.Incidents involving defective or damaged batteries have sparked renewed efforts by aviation authorities and airline operators to revise safety protocols. While rare, such events pose significant risks in the pressurized and enclosed environment of an aircraft cabin. Here’s a comprehensive overview of why power banks are under scrutiny, what the risks entail, which airlines are enforcing stricter policies, and what rules passengers need to follow when flying with these devices.Power banks use lithium-ion batteries, which are known for their high energy density but also for their volatility under certain conditions. If a battery cell is damaged, exposed to high temperatures, or suffers from manufacturing defects, it can enter a thermal runaway state—leading to overheating, ignition, or explosion.In aviation environments, the confined space and limited emergency response options make such occurrences particularly dangerous. According to safety experts, the combination of low humidity, high pressure, and limited ventilation onboard flights increases the likelihood of a malfunction if a battery is compromised.According to Euro News, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has raised concerns about such risks and published guidelines aimed at mitigating these dangers. These include limiting battery capacity, requiring onboard storage in carry-on luggage only, and restricting device use during flights.Although fires caused by power banks are infrequent, several high-profile incidents have drawn global attention. In some cases, flights have had to make emergency landings due to smoke or fire in the cabin traced back to an overheated power bank. While no major injuries have been reported in these incidents, the potential for harm to passengers and crew is significant.One widely publicized incident occurred when a power bank caught fire mid-flight, leading to smoke filling a cabin and requiring the use of fire extinguishers. Investigations later revealed that the device had been damaged prior to boarding. Events like these have driven airlines to rethink their policies and err on the side of caution.In response to the risks, several major international airlines have revised their regulations regarding power banks, as per Euro News. Here’s a breakdown of notable airline actions:While airline policies vary, the trend across the industry is consistent—limiting onboard use, enforcing size restrictions, and requiring all portable battery-powered devices to be carried in hand luggage rather than checked baggage.Most airlines adhere to safety standards informed by IATA and national aviation authorities such as the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) and EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency). The general rules for flying with power banks include:To determine the watt-hour rating of a power bank, passengers can use the formula:Travelers should ensure that the specifications are clearly labeled on the device. Devices that do not display capacity information may be confiscated during security screening.Power banks must be packed in hand luggage and never placed in checked baggage, as cargo holds are less accessible during emergencies. Additionally, several airlines require passengers to keep the devices at their seats rather than in overhead bins for quick access in case of an emergency.Some carriers also restrict the charging of devices using aircraft outlets due to the risk of heat buildup and electrical faults. Passengers are advised to charge their electronics before boarding or use designated charging stations at airports.To ensure compliance and avoid inconvenience, passengers should take the following steps before traveling:","Airlines around the world are increasingly implementing strict rules or outright bans on the use and carriage of power banks during flights.

When Elon Musk called Navarro Moron

White House has officially replied to Elon Musk's 'very angry' comments on President Donald Trump's top economic adviser Peter Navarro. And from the looks of it, the Oval office is not upset.

Until last week, Elon Musk has been making veiled attacks on Navarro today the fight came out in complete public view. As in a post on Twitter, Elon Musk called Navarro a ""Moron' and more ...Responding to Elon Musk's public outburst against Navarro, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said, ""Look, these are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs."" She went on to add, ""Boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue.""Leavitt termed the clash as a sign of the Trump administration’s openness, suggesting it reflected Trump’s willingness to entertain a range of perspectives. ""The public nature of the spat is evidence of the transparency within the administration,"" she said.Tesla CEO Elon Musk sharply criticized Trump administration trade advisor Peter Navarro over comments made during a CNBC interview. Navarro, a key figure behind President Donald Trump’s expansive tariff policies, brushed off Musk’s advocacy for ""zero tariffs"" between the United States and Europe. Dismissing the billionaire as a mere ""car assembler"" dependent on imported components, Navarro argued for shifting parts production to American soil.Musk fired back on X, calling Navarro’s remarks ""demonstrably false"" and labeling him ""dumber than a sack of bricks."" In a post responding to a clip of the interview, Musk defended Tesla’s record, asserting, ""Tesla has the most American-made cars."" The sharp rebuke underscored a growing rift between the tech mogul and Navarro, whose tariff-heavy approach has been credited with shaping Trump’s economic agenda.Navarro’s policy influence dates back to Trump’s first term, where he championed tariffs as a tool to revitalize U.S. manufacturing and bolster national security. However, the strategy has drawn mixed reactions, unsettling markets and disrupting global supply chains while fueling debates over its long-term efficacy.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk sharply criticized Trump administration trade advisor Peter Navarro over comments made during a CNBC interview.

Ethical and legal implications

In a rapidly evolving and politically charged environment, the fusion of artificial intelligence and federal governance is raising profound ethical, legal, and operational concerns. At the center of this unfolding development is Elon Musk ’s Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE )—a tech-centric initiative launched under the Trump administration that aims to revolutionize the federal bureaucracy.According to multiple sources with direct knowledge, DOGE has allegedly begun using advanced AI systems to monitor internal communications within at least one U.S. federal agency. The objective, reportedly, is to identify sentiments perceived as disloyal to former President Donald Trump or contrary to DOGE's reformist agenda. This effort is accompanied by the use of private communication apps like Signal, and experimental deployment of Musk’s Grok AI chatbot, marking an unprecedented shift in how surveillance and administrative control are exercised within the federal government.Several sources familiar with the matter revealed that federal employees at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were informed by Trump-appointed officials that their internal communications might be monitored using artificial intelligence. These tools, according to insiders, are trained to detect language that may be hostile toward Elon Musk or Donald Trump. This type of targeted surveillance, if confirmed, represents a significant departure from traditional methods of federal oversight and personnel management.Employees were reportedly warned to “be careful what you say, what you type and what you do,” with the clear implication that digital communications—including chat platforms like Microsoft Teams—could be scrutinized for ideological alignment with the administration’s priorities.DOGE staff members are allegedly relying heavily on Signal, an encrypted messaging application that supports self-deleting messages. While this app is often praised for privacy and cybersecurity, its use within a federal setting—especially for official communication—raises red flags regarding compliance with federal record-keeping laws.Government ethics expert Kathleen Clark from Washington University in St. Louis expressed concern that DOGE’s reliance on Signal could violate federal regulations. “If they’re using Signal and not backing up every message to federal files, then they are acting unlawfully,” Clark said. The use of non-traceable communication in governance has reignited debates about the transparency obligations of federal employees, especially those operating within or alongside politically appointed teams.Another key component of DOGE's operations appears to be the use of “Grok,” an AI-powered chatbot developed under Musk’s AI ventures. Though the exact nature of Grok’s usage within the federal apparatus remains unclear, sources suggest it is being “heavily” deployed to support DOGE’s mission of downsizing government operations.While Grok’s deployment could represent an effort to modernize administrative workflows, experts warn that unregulated AI integration in governance could pave the way for biased decision-making, automation without oversight, and data misuse. There are also significant questions around the lack of transparency in Grok's role and access to sensitive government data.DOGE’s operational reach is becoming increasingly evident in agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, where nearly 600 employees were placed on administrative leave in early 2025. The agency also announced a planned 65% budget cut. Internal communications hint that AI tools might be used not just to monitor sentiment, but to inform decisions regarding layoffs, resource allocation, and internal audits.The EPA later confirmed it was exploring AI to “optimize agency functions and administrative efficiencies,” but denied using AI in personnel decisions. Still, the overlap between DOGE’s mission and staffing changes has prompted widespread speculation about the use of AI-driven analytics to target staff deemed misaligned with Trump-era priorities.DOGE’s commitment to secrecy has led to several legal and procedural concerns. In addition to using Signal, staff are reportedly bypassing standard document circulation procedures by editing sensitive materials directly within Google Docs. This creates a scenario where multiple individuals can make simultaneous changes without leaving an official revision trail—a practice that undermines records management protocols.Citing this “unusual secrecy,” a federal judge ordered DOGE on March 10 to begin turning over internal documents to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a government watchdog group. As of March 24, no documents had been handed over.Court documents reveal that DOGE has taken administrative control of sensitive digital infrastructure in various federal bodies. When the team assumed oversight of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in January 2025, OPM employees were locked out of databases containing personal data of tens of millions of current and former federal workers.Sources state that access to the cloud where vital government applications are hosted has been restricted to just two individuals: one career OPM staff member and Greg Hogan, a Trump appointee and former AI startup executive now serving as the OPM’s Chief Information Officer. This centralization of access and power has contributed to a growing narrative that DOGE is not just restructuring government—it is isolating and insulating itself from traditional oversight.Elon Musk, while operating as a special government employee, is subject to ethics laws that prohibit involvement in government decisions that could benefit his private ventures. Nevertheless, critics argue that his proximity to government infrastructure and DOGE’s control over digital platforms create inherent conflicts of interest.Further, the lack of clarity on who controls DOGE’s directives, combined with evasive communication strategies, has raised red flags among both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Although the initiative is pitched as a cost-cutting reform to eliminate government waste, the secrecy, personnel purges, and opaque AI deployment have sparked concerns about political targeting and suppression of dissent.","Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE) has allegedly begun using advanced AI systems to monitor internal communications within at least one U.S. federal agency.

"US chip maker Micron makes tariff-related announcement to customers: Starting April 9, Micron will ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-chip-maker-micron-makes-tariff-related-announcement-to-customers-starting-april-9-micron-will-/articleshow/120104907.cms,"Trump Tariffs and global economies in 'shock'

Micron Technology , a US-based memory chip manufacturer, has reportedly informed its American clients that it will introduce a surcharge on certain products starting Wednesday, April 9, to offset the new tariffs imposed by the US President Donald Trump . According to a report by Reuters, quoting sources familiar with the situation, the company's production facilities are primarily located in Asian countries such as China, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, and Singapore.In a letter to its customers, Micron is said to have clarified that although Trump's recent announcement spared semiconductors, which form a portion of the company's offerings, the tariffs would affect memory modules and solid-state drives (SSDs), the sources revealed. These components, essential for data storage in devices ranging from vehicles to laptops and data center servers, will now carry an additional fee.The customer notification reportedly aligns with statements made by the company's executives during a post-earnings call on March 21, where they expressed their intention to transfer tariff-related costs to customers in affected sectors. This move follows closely on the heels of Micron's late March announcement to customers about price increases due to unexpected demand surges for its products.Trump's tariff declaration has sent shockwaves through global economies, prompting retaliatory measures from China and raising concerns about a potential worldwide trade conflict and economic downturn. Consequently, businesses worldwide are grappling with the decision of whether to absorb these tariffs or pass them on to their customers.On Saturday, the US customs officials began enforcing Trump's unilateral 10% tariff on imports from numerous countries. Steeper ""reciprocal"" tariff rates, ranging from 11% to 50% on specific nations, are scheduled to take effect on Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT).A senior official at an Asian NAND module producer, who requested anonymity due to media restrictions, told Reuters that their company was adopting a stance similar to Micron's, informing U.S. clients that they must navigate the tariffs independently. ""If they're unwilling to cover the taxes, we can't ship the goods. We shouldn't be held responsible for your government's policies,"" the executive remarked. ""At these tax levels, no business can afford to graciously absorb the cost.""","Micron Technology will introduce a surcharge on certain products starting Wednesday, April 9, to offset the new tariffs imposed by the US President Donald Trump.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu replies to Kerala Congress' RIP post for 'Make in India',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-replies-to-kerala-congress-rip-post-for-make-in-india/articleshow/119109476.cms,"Here’s a look at Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s post

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further stated that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how someone identifies their sex, it also confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

A group of hackers has threatened to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk . The cybercrime group named DonRoad Team, which had earlier claimed responsibility for taking down several websites associated with US President Donald Trump, has now announced that it would start targeting sites associated with Tesla and SpaceX CEO. The group also shared its intent to attack sites associated with the tech billionaire over a month. Previously, the DonRoad Team has claimed responsibility for its attacks in March that targeted The Trump Organization's website, as well as Tesla and SpaceX email servers, causing temporary global outages at the time. This comes after Musk-owned social media platform X (earlier Twitter) was targeted by a group of pro-Palestinian hackers who were able to disable the site for several hours.In a post (seen by Newsweek) shared on messaging platform Telegram, the hackers said: “In the next few hours, we will be suspending all websites affiliated with Elon Musk companies for a full month.”However, the Telegram post was later removed. Should these hacks occur, they may impact multiple Musk-related websites, including X and his AI platforms Grok and Tesla. Hackers may also target websites of other companies owned by Musk, like SpaceX and Tesla.In March, Musk's X experienced at least three major outages following a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. —a cyber assault that floods networks or devices with bot-generated traffic. The Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility for the incident.Reacting to the cyberattack, Musk at that time took to X to write: There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against 𝕏. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing …”Later, in a Fox Business interview, Musk noted: “There was a massive cyber attack to try to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.”In a separate event in February, the website for the Department of Government Efficiency, of which Musk is a member, was compromised and altered to mock him and his team.The hacked site temporarily displayed a prominent message stating, “This is a joke of a .gov site,"" alongside the note, ""THESE 'EXPERTS' LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN.”",Hackers threaten to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk.

Elon Musk has launched a fierce online offensive against White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, escalating a public feud fueled by disagreements over the Trump administration’s tariff policies. The billionaire’s sharp attack comes via multiple posts on X as he defends Tesla 's manufacturing practices.Musk, a prominent Trump campaign donor, took to his social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), to express his disdain for Navarro, who claimed that the Tesla CEO is a car “assembler” rather than a manufacturer, emphasising Tesla's reliance on foreign-sourced components.Musk shared data shared by Cars.com’s official American-Made Index, which showed that the top 4 most American-made cars are all Teslas: Model Y, Model 3, Model X and Model S.“Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks,"" Musk wrote in one post. He also dubbed Peter Navarro as “Peter Retarrdo”.In a followup post, Musk stated, “Navarro is truly a moron. What he says here is demonstrably false.”He further mounted his attack in a separate post, saying, “By any definition whatsoever, Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer in America with the highest percentage of US content. Navarro should ask the fake expert he invented, Ron Vara.”The online spat escalated further when Musk, in a now-deleted X post, asserted that Navarro ""ain't built s—”, as per CNBC.He also questioned Navarro's academic credentials, writing, “A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing.”Musk's public criticism of Navarro is particularly noteworthy given his current role as head of the White House's ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (DOGE) initiative, a position appointed by President Trump.

"Why it is not only Apple that is 'rushing' for iPhones in the US, customers too are",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-it-is-not-only-apple-that-is-rushing-for-iphones-in-the-us-customers-too-are/articleshow/120099447.cms,"Apple may shift more iPhone production to India

Apple Stores in the US are seeing more iPhone buyers than usual, as many are hurrying to upgrade their iPhones before a possible price hike. Last week, President Donald Trump announced ‘reciprocated’ tariffs of up to 54% on goods from China. Since Apple makes most of its products in China, this could make iPhones much more expensive. Experts say the new tariffs could nearly double iPhone prices. For example, TechInsights estimates that the cost for Apple to make an iPhone 16 Pro—currently around $550—could go up by $300, pushing the retail price well above the current $1,100.Burke, a 32-year-old policy professional from Washington, D.C., is one of many Americans rushing to buy new iPhones this week, worried that upcoming tariffs will lead to price hikes. “You gotta take care of your own personal needs and there’s no question in my mind that the prices are going to go up,” Burke told The Wall Street Journal.“The tariffs for sure pushed me out the door. Why pay what might turn out to be double?” said Allison Post, a 69-year-old health writer and body therapist.As per a WSJ report, the Cupertino-based company is planning to send more iPhones to the US from India to offset the high cost of China tariffs announced by Trump.Calling these adjustments as “a short-term stopgap”, the report quotes a person familiar with the matter who told the publication: “The company sees the current situation as too uncertain to upend long-term investments in its supply chain, which is centered around China”.Although Trump has pushed for a US manufacturing revival, analysts and suppliers say shifting iPhone production to Apple’s home country isn’t realistic—the costs would far exceed simply paying the tariffs. “If consumers want a $3,500 iPhone we should make them in New Jersey or Texas or another state,” research firm Wedbush said in a recent note.","Apple Stores in the US are seeing more iPhone buyers than usual, as many are hurrying to upgrade their iPhones before a possible price hike.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s net worth falls below $300 billion; here’s how much he lost in 2025 so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-ceo-elon-musks-net-worth-falls-below-300-billion-heres-how-much-he-lost-in-2025-so-far/articleshow/120098594.cms,"Billionaires lose big as Trump tariffs shake markets

Elon Musk publicly criticizes tariffs

Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s net worth fell below $300 billion on April 7. As per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , the tech billionaire’s wealth stood at $298 billion at the end of Monday’s market session. Since the start of 2025, his net worth has declined by nearly $135 billion, or 31%. This comes just months after it crossed $400 billion in December 2024. Notably, his wealth hasn’t dropped below $300 billion since November last year.The fall is mainly linked to the drop in Tesla’s stock price, which has fallen nearly 40% so far this year. The decline accelerated after President Trump announced a new set of “discounted” reciprocal tariffs on April 2. These include a 10% tariff on all imported goods and a 25% duty on foreign cars. Following the announcement, Tesla shares dropped 10% last week, reducing Musk’s net worth by $11 billion.Since the tariff announcement, Musk has lost about 10.5% of his net worth. Over the last five days, Tesla stock is down 11.5%.Having said that, Musk is not the only victim of Trump’s tariffs. According to data from Forbes, Facebook-parent Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg suffered the biggest loss, with his wealth dropping by $17.9 billion on Thursday, April 3. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos followed with a $16 billion decline, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk saw his net worth fall by $8.7 billion.Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s net worth dropped by $7.4 billion, while Microsoft founder Bill Gates saw a one-day loss of $774 million.Alphabet co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin lost $4.9 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also faced a decline, with his wealth falling by $18 million. Apple CEO Tim Cook saw his net worth decrease by $68 million during the market selloff.Musk, who is also a close confidante of President Trump recently took a dig at trade advisor Peter Navarro, saying that having a PhD in economics from Harvard is a ""bad thing."" When a user replied with a quote by Thomas Sowell that reads “In every disaster throughout American history, there always seems to be a man from Harvard in the middle of it”, Musk agreed with the user, saying “Yup”.","Elon Musk's net worth fell below $300 billion on April 7.

Amazon's biggest Chinese rival in the US may be facing 'home country' problem,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazons-biggest-chinese-rival-in-the-us-may-be-facing-home-country-problem/articleshow/120097980.cms,"How Shein has responded to China’s requests

The Chinese government has reportedly intervened to prevent fast-fashion giant Shein – Amazon ’s biggest rival – from moving some of its production out of China. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce has allegedly communicated with Shein and other companies, urging them not to diversify their supply chains by sourcing from countries like Vietnam, a report by Bloomberg said, citing sources familiar with the matter.These requests reportedly came shortly before the after Trump’ announcement of “reciprocal tariffs,” which have prompted businesses to explore ways to circumvent the increased duties. This can be seen as a move by Beijing to prevent a manufacturing exodus as US President Donald Trump’s tariffs loom. Notably, the US has slapped a total of 54% reciprocal tariffs on China earlier this month, prompting a 34% counter-tariff.One way Shein has responded is by halting reconnaissance tours it had organised for its major Chinese suppliers to visit potential factory locations in Vietnam and other Southeast Asian nations, another source indicated to the publication.The potential for job losses associated with manufacturers relocating overseas is said to be a significant concern for Chinese officials.Beijing's reported intervention in Shein's supply chain adjustments comes at a critical juncture. With tariff exemptions for small parcels set to expire within the next month, the cost of goods sold by Shein and its competitor Temu is expected to rise sharply, likely leading to higher prices for American consumers who have favoured these platforms over Amazon.This situation also highlights a growing conflict between China and its exporters. While the state aims to protect its domestic manufacturing sector, companies are increasingly seeking strategies to avoid the mounting costs associated with the tariffs.During the President's first term, many Chinese firms circumvented tariffs by shifting production to other countries. For instance, more than half of Cambodia's factories are now reportedly Chinese-owned. However, the commerce ministry's recent actions suggest that Beijing will likely resist similar relocation strategies this time around.","The Chinese government has reportedly intervened to prevent fast-fashion giant Shein from moving some of its production out of China.

We should all have stuck to being Doctors and Engineers,” Munjal wrote in the post.Speaking at the Startup Mahakumbh 2025, Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said that the Indian startups are focusing heavily on services like quick commerce and food delivery, contrasting this with China's advancements in deep-tech sectors such as electric vehicles, battery technology, and robotics. He questioned, “Are we going to be happy being delivery boys and girls? Is that the destiny of India... this is not startup, this is entrepreneurship”, igniting a debate within India's entrepreneurial community.The second incident Munjal is referring to in his post is the controversy surrounding comedian Kunal Kamra.

Supporters of Shinde's Shiv Sena party vandalized the venue in response. Kamra faced multiple charges under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and has approached the Bombay High Court to challenge the FIRs filed against him.Following the controversy involving his remarks about Eknath Shinde, the ticketing platform BookMyShow delisted Kamra's shows.

Swiggy trails Zepto with Maxxsaver launch as qcomm leans into value,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/swiggy-trails-zepto-with-maxxsaver-launch-as-qcomm-leans-into-value/articleshow/120096094.cms,"Swiggy Instamart has launched Maxxsaver, a new savings feature designed to compete with Zepto’s Super-Saver, as quick commerce (QC) players increasingly shift focus from top-up purchases to higher-value, planned grocery orders. With this rollout, Swiggy is playing catch-up to Zepto , which has seen early momentum through Super-Saver – its discount-led strategy aimed at boosting average order values (AOV).Unlike Zepto’s approach, which requires users to actively browse the Super-Saver section for eligible deals, Maxxsaver is embedded directly into the shopping experience. The feature is auto-applied at checkout once a certain cart value is met, and offers savings of up to Rs 500, according to the company.The broader strategy reflects a structural shift in QC models. As TOI reported last month, platforms such as Zepto and Swiggy are experimenting with bulk-order incentives that echo the playbooks of traditional players like BigBasket. This pivot toward household-level grocery shopping – rather than frequent, low-ticket replenishments – is seen as an attempt to grow AOVs and capture more share of wallet.Aimed at capturing household bulk buying, the move comes with trade-offs, particularly in terms of profitability, which even out. ""Profitability suffers in percentage terms but not in absolute profit terms. Even if long-term Ebitda margins are nearly half those of existing business models (3% vs 6%), absolute Ebitda per order is similar or higher due to average order value being more than double,"" HSBC analysts had said in a note.Market leader Blinkit for now remains a premium-priced convenience player, avoiding deep discounts in favour of expanding categories and geographical reach, with no bulk buying savings feature or loyalty programme akin to Zepto Pass or Swiggy One.Traditional QC thrives on high-frequency, low-ticket orders, serving as a supplement to modern retail rather than a replacement. Expanding into the value retail segment could reshape this understanding, potentially leading to customer behaviour shifts and operational challenges.Maxxsaver is now available across over 100 cities that Instamart is present in, where the company says users can access lower prices on over 35,000 items, including groceries, personal care items, electronics, toys and fashion products.“For users placing both small top-ups and larger weekly hauls, Maxxsaver will unlock maximum savings seamlessly,” said Amitesh Jha, CEO of Swiggy Instamart. “We’re able to pass on the benefits of larger orders without friction.”First-time users of the feature will see visual nudges in-app, including cart progress bars and price discovery tags, to encourage higher-value purchases. Swiggy also plans to introduce additional Maxxsaver perks for Swiggy One BLCK members.","Swiggy Instamart has launched Maxxsaver, a new savings feature designed to compete with Zepto’s Super-Saver.

‘Tesla gave me a future’: Ex-employee on how the company transformed his life

Ex-Tesla employee quits due to Musk’s politics

An emotional exit after 7 years



Respect for the company, not the leadership

After seven years of working at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, former engineering technician Trae Cervantes has made the difficult decision to step away from the company, citing moral discomfort with CEO Elon Musk ’s recent actions. Cervantes, who began his career as a production associate in 2018, steadily advanced to an engineering technician role before formally resigning in March 2025. His departure was not spurred by workplace conditions or job dissatisfaction, but rather by a growing unease over Musk’s political involvement and public conduct.In an interview with Business Insider, Cervantes reflected on both the opportunities and challenges he experienced at Tesla. He joined the company during the high-demand ramp-up of the Model 3 production line and described his early days as physically taxing but professionally rewarding.“I started out on their production line for the Model 3 and I moved up from there,” Cervantes said. “When I started out, it was gruelling work. It was pushing heavy things up and down aisles. I was on my feet for 12 hours a day, but they also give you three to four days off a week to recover.”Tesla supported Cervantes' growth over the years, offering him access to professional development programs, including certifications in advanced manufacturing and Lean Six Sigma through local college partnerships.Cervantes credits Tesla with helping him build a career despite having no formal education or technical training before joining the company.“I was getting paid the most I'd ever gotten in my adult life,” he said. “No education, no real skills to speak of, and Tesla offered me opportunities to take charge of my life and grow my career.”He highlighted how the work culture at Tesla—particularly among peers and supervisors—was largely positive and focused on efficiency, learning, and advancement.“I stayed because they kept treating me well. I didn’t have a reason to leave for a long time,” Cervantes noted.However, Cervantes' sentiment toward the company began to shift as Musk became more active politically and made several high-profile public moves, including acquiring Twitter and engaging in voter-related controversies.“What I took issue with the most was the giveaway for prospective voters,” he said, referring to a public campaign Musk promoted. “It seemed so morally wrong. I didn't want to be associated with that.”The turning point for Cervantes came when Musk's public image, behaviour, and political commentary became more prominent in association with Tesla’s identity.“Last year, I started to be ashamed to tell people where I work,” he admitted.While Cervantes did not go into detail about every incident that caused concern, he made it clear that the cumulative effect of Musk’s public actions led him to feel ethically conflicted about remaining with the company.Cervantes decided to leave Tesla without securing another job. He described his final conversation with his supervisor as emotional and honest.“I have to leave. I can't do this anymore. It's getting to a point where I feel like I'm compromising myself morally by walking through those doors every day,” he recalled telling his manager.The decision was not taken lightly. “I’m not going to lie, I cried a little. Seven years is a long time, and Tesla wasn’t always a bad thing for me,” Cervantes shared.While Cervantes walked away from his position at Tesla, he was careful to clarify that his issue was not with the company’s workforce or its mission, but with its leadership.“There are plenty of good people at Tesla. I didn’t leave the place because of the company. I left because of the face of the company,” he stated, referring directly to Elon Musk.","Trae Cervantes worked as an engineering technician at Tesla's Gigafactory in Nevada for seven years.

Elon Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter, is clashing with the government once again over content moderation . A lawyer for the social media company argued in Karnataka high court that “every Tom, Dick, and Harry” has been authorised to issue content takedown orders – a statement that drew sharp criticism from the Centre’s counsel.The remarks came during a hearing for X's challenge against a government-run website. X claims this portal is a “censorship portal” that allows officials to demand content removal, while the government maintains it is a tool to swiftly notify companies of their due diligence obligations regarding online content.During the court proceedings, X's lawyer, KG Raghavan, highlighted a recent notice from the railways department demanding the removal of a video showing a car on a railway track.“This is the danger, My Lord, that is done now, if every Tom, Dick, and Harry officer is authorised,” Raghavan told the court.The “Tom, Dick, and Harry” phrasing quickly drew the ire of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who retorted that “officers are not Tom, Dick, or Harry... they are statutory functionaries.” Mehta emphasised that “no social media intermediary can expect completely unregulated functioning.”A case was filed in the court onMarch 5 wherein X argued that the IT Ministry is asking other departments to use a government website launched by the Ministry of Home Affairs last year to issue content blocking orders.This isn't the first time X has been at odds with the Indian government; in 2021, the company faced a standoff over non-compliance with orders to block certain tweets, eventually complying but continuing a court battle related to the issue.","Elon Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter, is clashing with the government once again over content moderation.

Deep down, it’s over between Musk and Trump: Elon Musk’s former friend

Elon Musk responds to Trump’s ‘deport’ remarks

Amidst renewed tensions between President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Philip Low, a former friend of Musk said that “He has been humiliated”, and would do everything he could to damage President Trump. In an interview with Politico, Low – an award-winning neuroscientist said “I’ve had my share of blowouts with Elon over the years,” adding further “Knowing Elon the way I know him, I do think he’s going to do everything to damage the president.” Earlier this week, Musk has once again publicly criticised the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill saying it would destroy millions of jobs in America and “cause immense strategic harm to our country.”Elon Musk and Philip Low became close friends after meeting at a social event in Paris in 2011, the publication reports. Their friendship grew through late-night hangouts in Los Angeles, where Musk was living at the time. They often attended each other’s parties, texted regularly, and shared personal stories.Musk later showed interest in Low’s company, NeuroVigil, which had developed a non-invasive brain monitoring device used to detect conditions like sleep apnea and neurological disorders. He invested in the company during a 2015 funding round and also joined its advisory board. By then, Low had already made a name for himself as a young innovator, having launched a NASA satellite lab and demonstrated how his technology could help translate Stephen Hawking’s brain signals into speech.Low, 45, told the publication: “He has been humiliated. The whole idea that Elon is going to be on his side and help woo Congress and invest in election campaigns for right-wing judges — Elon might do all of that, but deep down, it’s over.”Low said that Trump, unlike Elon Musk, “tends to make up with his former sparring partners like [Steve] Bannon a bit more easily,” even though the former president is also known for holding grudges and bringing up old issues.In another news, the tech billionaire responded to Trump’s ‘deport Musk’ remarks. Replying to one such clip shared by X user DogeDesigner, the Tesla CEO said “So tempting to escalate this. So, so tempting. But I will refrain for now”.In the video, a reporter asked Trump if he is going to deport Musk. To this, Trump replied “We'll have to take a look. We might have to put DOGE on Elon. You know what DOGE is? The monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn’t that be terrible? He gets a lot of subsidies.”","Philip Low, a former friend of Musk, said that “He has been humiliated”, and would do everything he could to damage President Trump.

"Cloudflare launches ‘bot blocker’: What it means for AI companies like Google, OpenAI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cloudflare-launches-bot-blocker-what-it-means-for-ai-companies-like-google-openai/articleshow/122187041.cms,"What are AI Crawlers and how Cloudflare’s new tool works



What is changing



Cloudflare, a major internet company, is set to fundamentally change how artificial intelligence (AI) companies access web content, potentially shaking up how AI models are trained. Cloudflare will block AI crawlers by default from accessing content without a website owner's explicit permission or compensation.AI crawlers are automated bots that extract vast amounts of data from websites and other sources to train large language models (LLMs) used by companies like OpenAI and Google . This new tool means every new website signing up with Cloudflare will be prompted to decide if they want to allow AI crawlers. This move effectively gives website owners the power to stop bots from scraping their data.Cloudflare, known as a content delivery network (CDN), plays a crucial role in delivering online content quickly and efficiently. Given that roughly 16% of global internet traffic flows through Cloudflare's CDN, this change carries significant weight.Cloudflare is also introducing a ""pay per crawl"" model, allowing publishers to charge AI crawlers for access to their content. Traditionally, the internet rewarded content creators by directing users to their original websites.However, Cloudflare argues that AI crawlers are disrupting this model by collecting text, articles, and images to generate responses that users don't need to visit the original source for. This practice, according to Cloudflare, deprives publishers of crucial traffic and, consequently, advertising revenue.“AI crawlers have been scraping content without limits. Our goal is to put the power back in the hands of creators, while still helping AI companies innovate,” stated Matthew Prince, Cloudflare's co-founder and CEO. He added that this is about ""safeguarding the future of a free and vibrant Internet with a new model that works for everyone.""","Cloudflare will block AI crawlers by default from accessing content without a website owner's explicit permission or compensation.

Self driving cars to be first commerce use of Nvidia’s robotics technology: Jensen Huang





Redmi Pad 2: Know these Things Before Buying!

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence (AI), the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Huang said both AI and robotics represent what he believes a “multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity”. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said during the conference. Nvidia’s robotics division has seen fast growth in the past. Currently making up just 1% of Nvidia’s total revenue, the revenue brought in $567 million last quarter – a steep 72% rise from the previous year.“We’re working towards a day where there will be billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories that can be powered by Nvidia technology,” Huang said.Huang also emphasized a shift in how the company sees itself. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” he said, adding that Nvidia is now focused on being an “AI infrastructure” and “computing platform” provider.During the annual shareholder meeting, Huang said that Nvidia’s chips will be key not just for AI training, but also for software and hardware use in autonomous vehicles and robots. He named self-driving cars as the first major commercial use of Nvidia’s robotics technology. Nvidia’s Drive platform, a suite of chips and software for autonomous cars, is currently being used by Mercedes-Benz.The chipmaker recently introduced Cosmos, a line of AI models designed for humanoid robots.In a related news, Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company with a market cap of around $3.75 trillion. The company has rebounded strongly since a market dip earlier this year, which was caused by concerns about competition from China’s DeepSeek AI.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence, the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122088756,imgsize-19028,width-400,resizemode-4/Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Huang.jpg"

The US Embassy in India has issued a clear warning for visa applicants. “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas,” the embassy said in a post on microblogging site X (previously known as Twitter). The post reminded visa applicants to disclose all social media usernames or handles they’ve used over the past five years while filling out the DS-160 visa application form. “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form” the post read. “Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit.”The requirement is part of broader vetting procedures introduced by the US State Department in recent years.

Applicable to all applicants of F, M, and J non-immigrant visas, the new rule requires these applicants to set their social media accounts to public. “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under U.S. law,"" the US embassy in India wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post.F, M and J visas are the common types of non-immigrant visas issued by the agency to foreign nationals who wish to study or participate in exchange visitor programs in the U.S. F visa is typically used by academic students, the M visa by vocational students, and the J visa by exchange visitors, including researchers, scholars, and interns.In a related news, USCIS has announced that it will switch to a new phone number for sending text (SMS) messages. “Effective July 1, 2025, USCIS will no longer send text (SMS) messages from the phone number 468-311 (GOV-311).

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other top executives sell over $1 billion in company shares: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-and-other-top-executives-sell-over-1-billion-in-company-shares-report/articleshow/122155830.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells shares

Other Nvidia executives cash in

Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year, reports Financial Times. As per the report, over $500 million of those sales took place in June alone, as the chipmaker's stock price climbed to a record high, making Nvidia the world’s most valuable company. The report highlights that Nvidia insiders are capitalizing on the market’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, which has driven massive investor interest and sent the stock price soaring.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began selling his shares last week for the first time since September 2024. The company confirmed that his sales were made under a pre-arranged trading plan set in March, which defines the prices and dates for share sales. Such plans are commonly used by executives to avoid allegations of insider trading.Ben Silverman, vice-president of research at VerityData said “When the stock [dropped] in the first quarter, he did not sell, [which was] really smart.”“[Huang] waited for the stock to return to levels that he felt more comfortable selling at,” he added.According to VerityData, his sales began after a required 90-day cooling-off period ended. Under the trading plan, Huang can sell up to 6 million shares before the end of 2025. At current stock prices, that would amount to more than $900 million. Forbes estimates his net worth at $138 billion.According to the Financial Times report, several other top Nvidia figures have also sold large portions of stock. Mark Stevens, a longtime board member and early Nvidia investor, disclosed plans to sell up to 4 million shares on June 2, currently worth around $550 million. He has already sold $288 million worth.Jay Puri, Nvidia’s executive vice-president of worldwide field operations, sold $25 million in stock last week, says FT. Board members Tench Coxe and Brooke Seawell also made sales — Coxe offloaded around $143 million on June 9, and Seawell sold about $48 million in June.These executives, all long-time members of Nvidia’s leadership team, have been with the company since its early days. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 inside a Denny’s restaurant in San Jose. Coxe and Seawell, both with venture capital backgrounds, joined the board in the late 1990s.AI boom fuels Nvidia’s stock surgeDespite recent setbacks — including U.S. export controls and advances by Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek — Nvidia’s share price has bounced back. Since hitting a low in April, the company has regained about $1.5 trillion in market value.The company’s market value is not estimated at around $3.8 trillion. The rapid growth reflects strong global demand for the company’s chips, used to power AI systems across industries and governments.","Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year.

Nikesh Arora , former SoftBank president and current CEO of Palo Alto Networks recently shared an insight about his former boss and Softbank founder Masayshi Son. Arora described the Softbank founder as a man who defied every rule of caution and went ahead to win big. Arora described Son’s career growth to that of Benjamin Button, suggesting that he lived his life in reverse.Speaking on a podcast recently hosted by Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath, Arora mentioned that Son’s life approach as been similar to that of Benjamin Button, referring that the Japanese billionaire is aging in reverse between the ages to 50 and 60. “He was going, touching everything his mother said don’t touch,” Arora quipped, mentioning that Son has a fearless investment style which is totally opposite of traditional risk aversion.Arora who worked with Son during his tenure at Softbank said that the tech billionaire has an unmatched appetite for risk. “Masa’s the other way around. ‘What are we going to do today? Great. All in,’” he recalled.He further added that Son’s bold bets resulted in both dramatic wins and losses. Arora stated that Son also struck gold with his early investments in Yahoo! Japan, Alibaba, and ARM Holdings, but also faced near-bankruptcy and public scrutiny after some missteps with WEWork. Despite this volatility, Son’s net worth still stands at $38.8 billon, which makes hie the second-richest person in Japan.SoftBank is ‘all in’ on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. CEO and Founder Masayoshi Son said the company is betting heavily on the artificial intelligence (AI) company, with planned investments worth 4.8 trillion Japanese yen (around $33.2 billion). Son said he believes OpenAI, currently unlisted and not profitable, will eventually become “the most valuable company in the world.” Speaking at a shareholder meeting, Son said SoftBank’s long-term goal is to play a leading role in the era of artificial superintelligence (ASI)—a concept he described as AI that is 10,000 times smarter than humans.

‘Robert’ retired but came back during Iran-Israel conflict



White House and FBI issue joint statement



Hackers tied to Iran have reportedly threatened to release additional emails allegedly stolen from associates of US President Donald Trump. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the hackers—who use the alias “Robert”—claimed to possess about 100GB of emails from accounts belonging to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Trump attorney Lindsey Halligan, longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone and adult film star and Trump critic Stormy Daniels.While Robert suggested the material may be for sale, they offered no specifics about their plans or the content of the emails. US Attorney General Pam Bondi condemned the breach as “an unconscionable cyber-attack.”The development comes following an earlier leak shared with media outlets in the run-up to the 2024 US election, claiming to have breached email accounts belonging to several Trump allies, including Wiles. They distributed portions of the stolen emails to journalists.After Trump’s victory, Robert had told Reuters that no further leaks were planned, stating as recently as May, “I am retired, man.” However, the group resurfaced after this month’s 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran, which culminated in US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites.The White House and FBI issued a joint statement from FBI Director Kash Patel“Anyone associated with any kind of breach of national security will be fully investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” he said.The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) dismissed the hackers’ actions as propaganda.“This so-called cyber ‘attack’ is nothing more than digital propaganda. The targets are no coincidence. This is a calculated smear campaign meant to damage President Trump and discredit honorable public servants who serve our country with distinction,” they stated on X.","White House and FBI issue joint statement condemning 'unconscionable cyber- attack' Hackers claim to have 100GB of emails from accounts belonging to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Trump attorney Lindsey Halligan, Roger Stone and Stormy Daniels.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122185345,imgsize-2194944,width-400,resizemode-4/US-President-Donald-Trump.jpg"

According to a Reuters report, representatives John Moolenaar and Raja Krishnamoorthi sent a letter to the department raising concerns that OnePlus devices may be collecting sensitive user data without consent and sending it to China-owned servers.The letter claims that OnePlus smartphones may be gathering personal data, including ""transfers of sensitive personal information and screenshots,"" without users’ explicit permission. The lawmakers wrote, “This investigation would determine the types of information being collected by OnePlus devices.”They cited a commercial analysis that reportedly found the data collection patterns and flagged them as potentially unsafe. The information, according to the lawmakers, “indicates” that OnePlus may be sending this data to servers owned by entities in China.This isn't the first time the US government has raised red flags over Chinese tech companies. In 2020, Huawei faced federal charges including racketeering and intellectual property theft. The company received temporary relief from U.S. trade bans but continued to face scrutiny under national security laws.The TikTok controversy in 2022 followed a similar path, with officials accusing the app of sharing sensitive user data with its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. At the time, U.S. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr stated, “It harvests swaths of sensitive data that new reports show is being accessed in Beijing.”The call to investigate OnePlus echoes ongoing concerns over how Chinese-owned tech firms handle U.S. consumer data and whether that data could be accessed by foreign governments.",Two U.S. lawmakers have asked the US Commerce Department to investigate Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus over alleged security concerns.

Donald Trump criticises Elon Musk’s business model and subsidy support

The role of DOGE and federal oversight



Elon Musk responds: Threatens new political party and slams GOP Bill



The contentious “Big Beautiful Bill”



In a dramatic escalation of political tensions, US President Donald Trump issued a pointed warning to tech billionaire Elon Musk , suggesting that the Tesla and SpaceX CEO might have to “head back home to South Africa” without the financial support of federal subsidies. The statement came in a Truth Social post on July 1 (June 30 in the United States), where Trump criticized Musk’s business reliance on government funds and expressed his opposition to the federal electric vehicle mandate. The former allies now appear to be locked in a growing feud, sparked by deep divisions over the Republican Party’s controversial new spending legislation, often referred to as the “Big Beautiful Bill.”Trump’s remarks were part of a broader post in which he denounced electric vehicle requirements and claimed Musk’s enterprises—from Tesla to SpaceX—were only possible because of extensive government backing. The president’s comments follow a recent statement by Musk calling the bill “political suicide” for the Republican Party and threatening to launch an entirely new political movement in response.In his Truth Social post, President Donald Trump accused Elon Musk of benefiting more from government subsidies than any individual in US history. He argued that without this taxpayer-funded support, Musk would be unable to continue manufacturing electric cars, launching rockets, or operating satellite services. Trump added, “Our Country would save a FORTUNE” if it no longer supported Musk’s companies through public funds.Trump’s criticism is rooted in the electric vehicle mandate, a regulation requiring automakers to gradually phase out gas-powered vehicles in favor of electric models. The mandate has been a major policy debate point, and Trump reiterated that it was “always a major part of my campaign” to oppose it. He underscored his position by pointing out Musk’s alleged dependency on federal contracts, loans, and clean energy tax incentives.Alongside his criticism, Trump proposed that the Department of Government Efficiency—known as DOGE—should investigate the subsidies allocated to Musk’s businesses. DOGE, a federal agency that Musk briefly led during Trump’s first term, was created to identify and reduce wasteful spending in government operations.“Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!” Trump wrote. The suggestion implies that the government might audit the financial assistance received by Tesla, SpaceX, and other Musk-led ventures.Elon Musk quickly responded through a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). He criticized the Republican spending plan that Trump supports, describing it as “insane,” “debt-driving,” and filled with unnecessary allocations. Musk referred to it as the “Porky Pig Bill” and warned that it would damage the party’s credibility with fiscally conservative voters.Musk further stated that if the bill were passed in the Senate, he would immediately launch a new political movement—tentatively called the “America Party.” According to his statement, the aim would be to provide voters with an alternative to what he termed the “Democrat-Republican uniparty.”He also clarified that he supported eliminating subsidies altogether, even those that benefit his own companies. “I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now,” Musk wrote, emphasizing his belief in market-driven innovation over government funding.At the heart of the conflict is the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” a sweeping legislative proposal that combines tax reforms, energy mandates, and long-term spending adjustments. The bill is designed to reduce the federal deficit while expanding clean energy initiatives, infrastructure, and national defense funding.Critics argue that the bill could add over $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to estimates from independent policy analysts cited by Reuters. Supporters claim it is a necessary long-term investment in American competitiveness and sustainability. The bill includes revisions to tax credits for electric vehicles and proposes phasing out subsidies for certain industries, which may directly impact companies like Tesla.","US President Donald Trump warned Elon Musk that he might have to “head back home to South Africa” without the financial support of federal subsidies.

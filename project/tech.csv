“Comedy Ki Limit Honi Chahiye Par…”; food delivery app takes a jab at Ranveer Allahbadia controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/comedy-ki-limit-honi-chahiye-par-food-delivery-app-takes-a-jab-at-ranveer-allahbadia-controversy/articleshow/118161227.cms,"Food delivery app pokes fun

YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia has found himself at the center of a controversy following his appearance as a judge on comedian Samay Raina 's roast show, India's Got Latent . During the episode, Allahbadia asked a contestant an inappropriate question: “Would you rather watch your parents have sex for the rest of your life or join them once to put a stop to it?” The comment triggered widespread backlash on social media, with users condemning it as offensive and inappropriate.In response to the outrage, Allahbadia issued an apology via a video message. “My comment was not just inappropriate, it was not even funny. Comedy is not my forte. I’m here to say sorry. Many of you asked if this is how I wish to use my platform, and obviously, this is not it. I had a lapse in judgment, and it was not cool on my part,” he said, adding that he wouldn’t offer justifications or excuses.Amid the controversy, Magicpin , a food delivery app, seized the opportunity to poke fun at the situation. In a cheeky post on X, the company shared an image of a billboard ad that read, “INDIA'S LOST TALENT. Comedy ki limit honi chahiye par discounts ki nahi.”The ad also featured animated characters resembling judges from the show, laughing at the bottom of the poster.Caption of the post read, “Can we get back the magic in comedy?”.The witty dig has garnered users’ attention with the post garnering over 361K views so far. Commenting on the post, one user said “apda mein avsar” (an opportunity in disaster), while another wrote, “Tricky advertisement”.“Comedians need this type of humour!,” commented a third. While the advertisement garnered laughs online, the controversy surrounding Allahbadia’s remarks has reignited conversations about the limits of humor and responsibility on public platforms.","Ranveer Allahbadia was a judge on India's Got Latent.

Users in Mexico will continue to see ""Gulf of Mexico,"" while international users will see both names, with ""Gulf of America"" in parentheses. Google determines which version users see based on their mobile operating system, SIM card, and network location data. Desktop users will see changes based on their search settings or device location.""We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,"" Google said in a statement. The company follows naming conventions from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), the federal government's official database of location information.The same executive order also reversed the Obama-era decision to rename Mount McKinley to Denali, returning it to its previous name. The US President Trump stated these changes are part of an effort to ""[restore] American pride in the history of American greatness.""Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced plans to send a letter to Google questioning the company's decision. However, Google's approach aligns with its existing policies for handling naming disputes between countries, similar to its treatment of the Sea of Japan/East Sea naming controversy.Other mapping services have not yet implemented the change. Apple Maps continues to display ""Gulf of Mexico"" and redirects ""Gulf of America"" searches to the original name.

“The SEBI circular on

API usage

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

SEBI's latest ALGO trading rules | The Daily Brief #163

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges.Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

Akash Bobba , a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Bobba, along with five other young engineers, was hired by Musk to modernise government systems, raising concerns about their lack of government experience and the potential security risks involved.Bobba, a graduate of UC Berkeley's elite Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (MET) program, has quickly risen through the ranks of Silicon Valley , securing internships at Meta, Palantir, and Bridgewater Associates.Known for his problem-solving skills, Bobba once rewrote an entire project overnight after a teammate accidentally deleted it just before a deadline. His former classmate Charis Zhang recalled the incident.“Let me tell you something about Akash. During a project at Berkeley, I accidentally deleted our entire codebase 2 days before the deadline. I panicked. Akash just stared at the screen, shrugged, and rewrote everything from scratch in one night—better than before. We submitted early and got first in the class. Many such stories. I trust him with everything I own,” wrote Zhang in a social media post.Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that granting individuals with limited government experience access to sensitive government systems poses significant security risks. The hiring strategy has also raised questions about the competence and oversight within Musk's DOGE initiative. Reports suggest that at least four of the new DOGE hires, including Bobba, now have top-tier access to federal IT systems.Bobba isn't the only new face in Musk's government overhaul. The five other members of the DOGE team comprise a mix of recent graduates, college students, and former SpaceX interns, all of whom now have official government emails and top-level security clearances.","Akash Bobba, a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE) Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities.

Some of the popular courses offered by the self-proclaimed ""options queen"" and ""She Wolf of Stock Market"" are ""Let's Make India Trade"" (LMIT), ""Master's in Price Action Trading"" (MPAT), and ""Options Multiplier"" (OM) .Jayesh Thakkar, a SEBI Registered Research Analyst shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating “SEBI has seized Rs 53.67 crore that Asmita Patel and five other related entities made illegally. Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

When thinking about Jeff Bezos ' next major investment, visions of space exploration, artificial intelligence, or renewable energy often come to mind. However, the Amazon founder has taken an unexpected turn by investing $9.4 million into the development of a vaccine aimed at curbing methane emissions from cows. While this might sound humorous, it addresses a serious issue—bovine flatulence and burps release methane, a greenhouse gas that is 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide (CO2), contributing significantly to climate change.Through the Bezos Earth Fund , this investment targets a scientific breakthrough that could revolutionize livestock farming and play a crucial role in reducing global methane emissions. The proposed ‘ cow fart vaccine ’ is a bold and innovative approach, aligning with Bezos' broader strategy of funding high-impact and scalable climate solutions.Jeff Bezos launched the Bezos Earth Fund in 2020, pledging $10 billion to fight climate change. The fund focuses on high-impact solutions that can be scaled globally. While the idea of a cow fart vaccine may sound unconventional, it aligns with Bezos’ commitment to innovative strategies that tackle the root causes of climate change.If successful, the vaccine could become a holy grail for sustainable farming. It would allow the world to reduce emissions without forcing dramatic reductions in meat consumption, a sensitive issue globally. The livestock sector could continue to meet the growing demand for animal products while significantly lowering its carbon footprint.However, the project’s success hinges on several factors:Cows and other ruminant animals digest food through a process called enteric fermentation, which occurs in their four-chambered stomachs. This unique digestive process causes grass and other plant materials to ferment, producing methane as a byproduct. The gas is then released primarily through burping and, to a lesser extent, flatulence.Each cow emits approximately 200 pounds of methane annually. Collectively, livestock are responsible for nearly 30% of global methane emissions linked to global warming. This makes livestock farming one of the leading contributors to climate change, surpassing emissions from some entire industries.Efforts to reduce methane emissions from cows have included special feed additives, such as red seaweed, which can lower methane production by altering the digestive process. However, these solutions face significant challenges:A vaccine, on the other hand, offers a potential game-changer. It could provide a long-term solution that is easier to administer and integrate into standard livestock management practices.The vaccine development is spearheaded by the Pirbright Institute in the UK, in collaboration with New Zealand’s AgResearch and the UK’s Royal Veterinary College. The three-year study aims to reduce methane emissions from cows by at least 30% with a single vaccination.According to John Hammond, Director of Research at the Pirbright Institute, “The appeal of a vaccine is that it's a proven, widely accepted tool in livestock management. If successful, it could significantly reduce emissions without disrupting farming practices.”Despite the promise, the scientific challenges are significant. The vaccine must generate antibodies that target methane-producing bacteria in the cow’s gut. This has never been achieved before, and scientists remain uncertain whether the immune system can effectively regulate gas production in such a complex digestive system.Key challenges include:Even if the vaccine proves effective, public acceptance poses a significant hurdle. Past attempts to reduce livestock emissions, such as feed additives, faced consumer backlash over concerns about toxicity and food safety.For example, in the UK, dairy giant Arla faced boycotts after introducing a methane-reducing supplement, despite it being declared safe by regulators. Misinformation and distrust could similarly undermine the acceptance of the cow fart vaccine.Joseph McFadden, a professor at Cornell University, emphasized the importance of public engagement:Another potential obstacle is farmer adoption. Convincing farmers to vaccinate their cattle for environmental reasons, rather than for disease prevention, may require incentives or regulatory mandates. Farmers may also worry about potential impacts on product quality or market acceptance.","Jeff Bezos launched the Bezos Earth Fund in 2020, pledging $10 billion to fight climate change.

I'm guessing many apps are either willingly or forcibly buying ratings to rank higher in their category. So there's probably an entire parallel economy selling

.”

How social media users reacted



“There is. I've seen it first-hand on amazon. Sellers add 20/- to the cost of the product and add cards in the shipping box that offer 20/- to 50/- for a 5-star review on Amazon. I have seen that from at least 20 sellers. (I ordered a lot on amazon). Then, there are actual legitimate (?) companies similar to the scam call centers that call and pay real money for reviewing places or businesses 5 star on google reviews.”

“Been in Fintech security and compliance since last 4 years and have dealt with fair amount of frauds. Only a 3 stakeholder (Fintechs - Playstores - Regulator) involvement can solve this, but each one seem to be shirking the responsibility,”

“Yes, many ratings across all online platforms/websites are fabricated. I generally will go through comments to understand genuine rating. We probably need a platform for true feedback 🤷”

Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath has raised concerns about the authenticity of app reviews on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store . In a recent post on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath questioned the legitimacy of many 5-star reviews for his brokerage firm and other financial services apps , suggesting that a significant number may be fake or even AI-generated. He further speculated that a "" parallel economy "" may exist where companies purchase ratings to boost their app's ranking.In the post, Kamath wrote:The post has already gone viral with over a lakh views and several comments.Responding to this post, one user wrote:another user noted.Meanwhile, a third user added:","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath has raised concerns about the authenticity of app reviews on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

Government may soon issue advisory against Chinese AI model DeepSeek,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-may-soon-issue-advisory-against-chinese-ai-model-deepseek/articleshow/118134770.cms,"Global concerns against DeepSeek

Indian government is expected to issue an advisory soon, warning users about potential data privacy and cyber espionage risks associated with the use of the Chinese artificial intelligence tool, DeepSeek . According to an Economic Times report, Indian Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT-In ) under the aegis of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, has undertaken a thorough enquiry of potential harm to Indian citizens using the genAI application on their devices. Quoting sources, the report further adds that the enquiry includes tracking user behaviour from prompts given to the chatbot, device data such as battery usage, other app interactions and even keystrokes of fingers.“There are concerns over the usage of DeepSeek, we can’t use it like we use ChatGPT (a rival genAI application from US-based OpenAI ). We have to be careful,” a senior government official told the publication. The official further added that a common advisory against the use of DeepSeek is likely to be issued soon.“India as a nation is not comfortable with allowing China access to Indians’ data because there is no accountability to how and where they store sensitive data,” another official said.“The app collects data in three forms- ‘user prompts’ (including images, documents, chat history), ‘automatically collected information’ (device data, metadata of other applications, cookie tracking) and information from ‘other sources’ (crowdsourced or publicly available data),” said an official in knowledge of the investigation by CERT-In. It can even track how many users uninstalled ChatGPT, or whether they have reduced time spent on Google Gemini app. “A more alarming issue here is that the AI conversational bot can spread misinformation to manipulate political discourse,” the person noted.Countries like Italy and Australia along with US federal agencies have already banned the use of DeepSeek on official devices.Last month, the union finance ministry issued an internal advisory, warning that the use of AI applications on office computers and devices presents risks to the security of sensitive government information. The advisory reads: ""It has been determined that AI tools and AI apps (such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, etc.) in office computers and devices pose risks for confidentiality of (government) data and documents.""","Indian government is expected to issue an advisory soon, warning users about potential data privacy and cyber espionage risks associated with the use of the Chinese artificial intelligence tool, DeepSeek.

3 demands of NITES to Union Labour ministry



Strict action against for violating Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

Restraining order to stop further layoffs

Reinstatement of all terminated employees

Infosys disputes the 700 number

Infosys threatened terminated employees, claims NITES

The Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) has filed a formal complaint with the labour ministry against Infosys, alleging illegal and unethical mass layoffs of trainees, which the association claims are a ""violation of labour laws."" NITES' complaint, submitted to Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, states that Infosys terminated recently onboarded campus recruits who had already experienced a two-year delay in joining after receiving offer letters.The company attributed the layoffs to failing an internal assessment programme.“It has come to our attention, through numerous complaints received from affected employees, that Infosys Ltd. has resorted to forcibly terminating recently onboarded campus recruits who had already suffered a delay of two years in their joining after being issued offer letters,” Harpreet Singh Saluja, lawyer and president at NITES said in a written letter addressed to Mansukh Mandaviya, minister of labour & employment. NITES argues that Infosys's actions set a dangerous precedent for the IT industry and could encourage other companies to engage in similar practices. The complaint includes copies of employee complaints.NITES has termed the IT giant’s action illegal, unethical, and a “violation of labour laws.”NITES is demanding strict penal action against Infosys for violating the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, an immediate investigation into the matter, and a restraining order to halt further terminations.NITES has also asked for an immediate investigation and a restraining order to stop further terminations until legal processes are followed.The NITES union also demands the reinstatement of all terminated employees with appropriate compensation.Infosys claims the number of separations is under 350 and calls them ""mutual separations,"" explaining that the employees failed to clear an internal assessment program after three attempts, a process they say has been in place for over two decades.NITES also accused Infosys of employing intimidation tactics against the employees, such as the presence of bouncers and security personnel, to ensure compliance. NITES alleges that employees were confined to meeting rooms at the Mysore campus, intimidated by security personnel, and forced to resign without prior notice or severance packages. NITES further claims that employees were asked to vacate their accommodation and the campus on Friday, leaving many stranded and struggling to arrange travel back to their hometowns across the country.","The Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) has filed a formal complaint with the labour ministry against Infosys.

"Donald Trump hints at 90-day delay for TikTok ban, “If I decide to do that…”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-hints-at-90-day-delay-for-tiktok-ban-if-i-decide-to-do-that/articleshow/117362125.cms,"TikTok shutdown in the US

TikTok may get some respite from Donald Trump as the President-elect has announced that he will “most likely” grant TikTok a 90-day reprieve from a potential ban after he takes office on Monday (December 20). This comes as the app, with 170 million American users, faces a shutdown set for Sunday (December 19).“I think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at,” Trump said in the phone interview with NBC, highlighting that he hasn’t made a final decision.“The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate. You know, it’s appropriate. We have to look at it carefully. It’s a very big situation,” Trump added.“If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday,” Trump noted.The bipartisan law passed last year explicitly permits a 90-day extension under specific conditions. However, even if an extension is granted on Monday, it may not prevent the app from going dark for at least a day, as the current compliance deadline is Sunday.The Chinese-owned app stated last week that it will go dark in the US on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provides assurances to companies like Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when the ban takes effect.The White House, however, dismissed TikTok's Friday comment as a stunt, reiterating that it was up to the incoming Trump administration to take action, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on Sunday.“We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Meanwhile, the Chinese embassy in Washington accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok.“China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” a spokesperson said.The US Supreme Court justices upheld the ban in a unanimous decision.",TikTok faces a shutdown in the US on Sunday if it doesn't comply with a ban.

"When Elon Musk told Justine Musk, mother of his five children, 'I would fire you, if you were my employee'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-elon-musk-told-justine-musk-wife-of-his-five-children-i-would-fire-you-if-you-were-my-employee/articleshow/117361767.cms,"Poll Do You Think Personal Beliefs Should Influence Professional Lives? No, Professional Life Should Remain Separate Yes, They Shape Workplace Dynamics

Justine Musk , Elon Musk 's ex-wife, recently shared insights into the personal philosophy behind his success during a TEDx talk, emphasizing the importance of boundaries and focus, particularly his ability to say ""no."" This provided a unique perspective on the entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX Justine Musk, a Canadian fantasy author, is the mother of five of Elon Musk's children. Born in 1972, she is known for novels like ""BloodAngel"" and ""Uninvited,"" which often explore themes of personal struggle and resilience. Justine Musk wrote an essay during their messy divorce proceedings in 2008. The essay has drawn renewed attention after the recent launch of Musk's biography.Justine (then Wilson) met Elon Musk at Queen's University in Ontario. Their courtship involved ice cream and, later, Musk giving her his credit card to buy books. They married in 2000 and moved to Los Angeles. They tragically lost their first son, Nevada, to SIDS, and later had twins and triplets.The couple divorced in 2008, the same year Musk became Tesla CEO. The loss of their son and the subsequent births of their other children further strained their relationship. In the essay Jestine wrote, ""This, and the vast economic imbalance between us, meant that in the months following our wedding, a certain dynamic began to take hold. Elon's judgment overruled mine, and he was constantly remarking on the ways he found me lacking. 'I am your wife,"" I told him repeatedly, 'not your employee.'""'If you were my employee,' he said just as often, 'I would fire you.'""Following their divorce, Elon Musk stated he offered Justine a substantial settlement, which she rejected. He currently covers all expenses for their children and provides monthly support. She also retained the family home in Bel Air.","Justine Musk is the mother of five of Elon Musk's children.

"Google, Microsoft, Tesla and other companies cutting jobs should not be allowed to hire on H-1B visa: Bernie Sanders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-microsoft-tesla-and-other-companies-cutting-jobs-should-not-be-allowed-to-hire-on-h-1b-visa-bernie-sanders/articleshow/117361723.cms,"Bernie Sanders

Sanders' amendment proposes these changes:

Increased H-1B Fees:

Higher Prevailing Wages:

Protection for American Workers:

Senator Bernie Sanders introduced an amendment to the Laken Riley Act aimed at reforming the H-1B visa program, arguing it primarily serves to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign guest workers. He contends these workers are often exploited, akin to indentured servants. “The main function of the H-1B programme is not to hire 'the best and the brightest' but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with hundreds of thousands of lower-paid guest workers from abroad who are often treated as indentured servants. The cheaper it is to hire guest workers, the more money the multi-billionaire owners of large corporations make,” Sanders, 83, said on the Senate floor earlier this week.Sanders directly challenged Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy's support of the H-1B program, questioning why Tesla laid off thousands of American workers while simultaneously seeking to hire H-1B visa holders. He cited examples of Tesla hiring H-1B workers for significantly lower salaries than typical for similar positions in the US. He argued that the program is being used to drastically reduce labor costs for corporations, rather than filling genuine skill gaps.“They are two sides of the same coin. If there is truly a major shortage of skilled tech workers in this country, as Musk has argued, why did Tesla lay off over 7,500 American workers last year – including many software developers and engineers at its factory in Austin, Texas – while applying to hire thousands of H-1B guest workers?” he asked.Corporations engaged in mass layoffs should not be allowed to replace American workers with guest workers. “Finally, this amendment would prevent corporations from treating H-1B guest workers as indentured servants. Under current law, H-1B guest workers are often locked into lower-paying jobs and can have their visas taken away from them by their corporate bosses if they complain about dangerous, unfair or illegal working conditions,” he noted.“That is unacceptable and has got to change. This amendment would make H-1B visas portable and enable guest workers to easily change jobs,” Sanders said.Doubling the fees corporations pay to hire H-1B workers, generating an estimated $370 million annually for scholarships for American students in STEM fields.Requiring corporations to pay H-1B workers at least the median local wage for their position, preventing wage undercutting of American workers.Prohibiting companies from replacing laid-off American workers with H-1B visa holders.Worker Protections: Making H-1B visas portable, allowing guest workers to change jobs and escape potentially exploitative working conditions.Sanders criticized claims of a tech worker shortage, citing data showing numerous American STEM graduates are unemployed. He pointed out that many top H-1B employers are outsourcing companies (""body shops"") that facilitate both domestic and international job outsourcing. He highlighted examples of H-1B workers being paid significantly less than American workers in comparable roles, such as software developers in Dallas and accountants in Houston.","Senator Bernie Sanders introduced an amendment to the Laken Riley Act aimed at reforming the H-1B visa program.

"Microsoft search market share doubles, as Google's share falls just below 90% for the first time",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-search-market-share-doubles-as-googles-share-falls-just-below-90-for-the-first-time/articleshow/117320875.cms,"

How Google's search market share dropped

Google's dominance in the global search engine market has dipped below 90% for the first time in almost a decade. According to Statcounter, in the last three months of 2024, Google's market share fell to 89.34% in October, 89.99% in November, and 89.74% in December. This marks a significant shift in the search landscape, as Google has consistently held over 90% of the market share for almost a decade.The last time Google's share was below 90% was in early 2015.However, this decline has helped Microsoft 's Bing search engine to experience a major growth in usage during the latter half of 2024, with its market share almost doubling to reach around 4%. This suggests that Bing is slowly gaining popularity, although it still lags significantly behind Google.As per Statcounter data, Google seems to be gradually losing its search market share. The company’s search market share has remained relatively stable in most regions except Asia, which appears to be a significant factor behind the overall decline, the report suggests.In the US, Google’s search market share peaked at 90.37% in November 2024 but dropped to 87.39% by December. For the rest of 2024, the share fluctuated between 86-88%, showing a slight but noticeable decline.Despite dominating the search market for nearly a decade with a consistent 90-92+% share, Google has faced criticism over the growing unhelpfulness of its search results.This, along with allegations of maintaining an illegal monopoly, has placed the company under scrutiny for almost two years.While Google's search market share decline might suggest users are turning to AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT Search and Perplexity, Statcounter's data doesn't specifically mention that. The report primarily tracks traditional search engines like Bing, Yandex, and Yahoo , with a minor ""other"" category that includes DuckDuckGo and Ecosia.Microsoft's Bing, the second most popular search engine, saw a slight increase in market share, hovering around 4% in the latter half of 2024.It's worth noting that a similar dip in Google's market share in April 2024 turned out to be a data error. However, the consistent decline in the last three months of 2024 suggests a real shift in user behaviour, even if the specific reasons remain unclear.","Google's market share fell to 89.34% in October, 89.99% in November, and 89.74% in December.

What the company says

The US Commerce Department and FBI are investigating Baicells Technologies , a Chinese company by former Huawei executives. According to a Reuters report, the commerce department is looking into the company for national security reasons and has sent legal requests (subpoenas) to it. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is helping with the investigation.Baicells was founded in 2014 by former Huawei executives. The company started its US business in Wisconsin in 2015. It has supplied telecom equipment to mobile networks across all US states.The US government is concerned that Chinese-made equipment could allow hackers to access sensitive data, disrupt services, or carry out cyberattacks. Baicells sells routers and base stations in the US, which help provide internet and mobile networks.Although there’s no evidence that Baicells equipment has been misused, experts warn it’s still risky, says the report.In 2023, the FBI warned Las Vegas officials about Baicells' base stations, leading the city to cancel its contract with the company. The FBI has also raised concerns in other areas, such as Virginia, where Baicells equipment was used near a naval weapons testing site. The US cybersecurity agency CISA has also issued warnings about vulnerabilities in Baicells equipment that could allow hackers to take control of devices.These investigations show that the U.S. remains worried about Chinese telecom equipment being used for spying, even after cracking down on other Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE.Sun Lixin – the head of Baicells said the company will fully cooperate with US inquiries and believes its products are safe. ""We have taken affirmative steps to ensure the security of our products and proactively address any security concerns,"" Baicells said when asked about base station vulnerabilities.However, the US Defense Department recently added Baicells to a list of companies linked to China's military.",Baicells was founded in 2014 by former Huawei executives.

Why I Left Infosys Job Without Any Offer Letter in Hand, Despite Being the Sole Breadwinner for My Family

During my time at Infosys, I faced several systemic issues that ultimately forced me to make the difficult decision of leaving without an offer in hand. I want to speak openly about these challenges because they are indicative of larger problems in corporate workplaces:

1. No Financial Growth Despite Promotion: Being promoted from System Engineer to Senior System Engineer sounds good on paper, but it meant nothing without a monetary hike. For three years, I worked hard, met expectations, and contributed to the team, yet saw no financial acknowledgment of my efforts.

2. Unfair Workload Redistribution: When the team size reduced from 50 to 30 due to attrition, the additional workload was simply dumped on the remaining employees. Instead of hiring replacements or providing support, the management took the easy route—overburdening the existing team without compensation or even recognition.

3. Stagnant Career Prospects: The account I was assigned to was a loss-making one, as admitted by my manager. This directly impacted salary hikes and opportunities for career growth. Staying in such an account felt like professional stagnation, with no light at the end of the tunnel.

4. Toxic Client Environment: The client’s unrealistic demands for ultra-quick responses created a toxic work culture where even minor issues led to escalations. This pressure trickled down, creating stress at every level of the hierarchy. It felt like a constant state of firefighting, with no room for personal well-being.

5. Lack of Recognition: Despite consistent efforts and recognition from my peers and seniors, none of it translated into tangible rewards—be it financial growth, promotions, or career advancements. Hard work felt like it was being taken for granted.

6. Onsite Opportunities and Regional Bias: Onsite opportunities were never based on merit but rather on linguistic preferences. Employees speaking Telugu, Tamil, and Malayalam were frequently prioritized for such roles, while Hindi-speaking employees like me were overlooked, regardless of our performance. This blatant bias was both unfair and demoralizing.

These issues aren’t unique to me—they reflect the experiences of countless employees who feel voiceless in the face of such systemic failures. I chose to leave because I couldn’t compromise my self-respect and mental health for an organization that ignored these basic issues.

It’s time corporate managers stop sugarcoating the realities on the ground and start addressing these problems. Employees are not resources to be exploited; they are human beings with aspirations and limits. If such toxic practices continue unchecked, organizations risk losing not only their talent but also their credibility.

Infosys CEO Salil Parekh has addressed the growing concerns over the company's work culture following a viral LinkedIn post by former employee Bhupendra Vishwakarma. The post, which highlighted several issues including discrimination, lack of financial growth, and a toxic work environment , has sparked an online debate.During the Q3 earnings call on January 16, Parekh reaffirmed Infosys's commitment to fair treatment and inclusivity. ""Within Infosys, we have clear approach to make sure everyone is treated fairly. We have well defined process of seeing progress and everyone getting benefits. We hold ourselves to high standards,"" he stated.Parekh's remarks come amidst broader industry discussions about work-life balance and long work hours, further ignited by comments from L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan advocating for employees to work on Sundays. Vishwakarma in his LinkedIn post claimed he left Infosys without another job offer due to a lack of career growth, unfair workload distribution, and regional biases.During the press conference, Infosys reiterated its commitment to talent acquisition, confirming that the company is on track to hire approximately 15,000 freshers as planned for the current fiscal year.","Infosys CEO Salil Parekh has addressed the growing concerns over the company's work culture following a viral LinkedIn post by former employee Bhupendra Vishwakarma.

The European Union (EU) seems quite 'upset with Elon Musk. The political bloc of 27 European nations is intensifying its investigation into Elon Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter), demanding greater transparency regarding its algorithms. This move comes amid heightened scrutiny of Elon Musk 's public pronouncements on European politics, which have fueled calls for stronger EU action.The European Commission, the EU's digital regulator, is under pressure from EU lawmakers to address concerns about X potentially manipulating its platform to amplify far-right content and politicians. This follows Musk's controversial statements on some European leaders and his support for Germany's far-right AfD party.The investigation, initiated in December 2023 under the Digital Services Act (DSA), focuses on how Twitter handles illegal content and disinformation. The EU has now specifically requested internal documentation on Twitter's recommender systems—the algorithms that personalize content for users—and any recent modifications made to them by February 15.Furthermore, X is required to preserve all internal records concerning planned changes to its recommender algorithms from January 17 to December 31 of this year, unless the investigation concludes sooner. The EU also seeks access to certain commercial APIs, which would facilitate independent analysis of content moderation and account virality.EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen emphasized the importance of these steps in assessing systemic risks and their mitigation under the DSA. The Commission aims to ensure X complies with EU legislation designed to create a fair, safe, and democratic online environment.Musk has criticized the DSA as a form of censorship. The law, fully implemented in February 2023, represents the EU's efforts to regulate large tech companies.Despite accusations of political influence, particularly from the Trump administration, the EU maintains that its enforcement actions are impartial. In July 2024, the EU formally accused X of misleading users with its blue check verification system, lacking advertising transparency, and denying researchers access to platform data. An EU spokesperson reiterated that the latest demand for algorithmic transparency is entirely independent of any political considerations or recent events.",The European Union (EU) seems quite 'upset with Elon Musk.

What is the H-2 visa program

What is the goal of the changes to the H-2 program

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has implemented new rules to modernize and improve the H-1B and H-2 nonimmigrant visa programs. These changes were published in the Federal Register on December 18, 2024 and came into effect on January 17, 2025. The H-1B program allows American companies to temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty occupations requiring highly specialized knowledge and at least a bachelor's degree (or equivalent). The new H-1B rules aim to streamline the approval process, increases employer flexibility in retaining talent, and enhances program integrity and oversight. While primarily focused on H-1B specialty occupation workers, some provisions also affect other nonimmigrant classifications, including H-2, H-3, F-1, L-1, O, P, Q-1, R-1, E-3, and TN. The current annual cap for H-1B visas stands at 65,000, with an additional 20,000 reserved for those holding advanced degrees from US institutions.The H-2 program covers temporary agricultural (H-2A) and nonagricultural (H-2B) workers. The updated H-2 rule strengthens worker protections by imposing stricter penalties on companies that charge prohibited fees or violate labor laws. It also provides greater flexibility for both H-2A and H-2B workers.

Students on F-1 visas will face fewer disruptions when shifting to H-1B status. F-1 visa students applying for an H-1B visa will benefit from an automatic extension of their F-1 visa until April 1 of that year. This will ensure continuity in lawful status and work authorisation while their H-1B application is under review. USCIS has committed to expediting applications for H-1B extensions to ease the burden on both employers as well as workers.* Increasing flexibility for employers to retain talented workers. Businesses can hire H-1B workers based on documented needs, allowing more adaptable workforce planning. ap-exempt organisations, such as universities and research bodies, can now submit petitions throughout the year without numerical limitations.* Improving the integrity and oversight of the program.

New policies amounts to reset, says Zuckerberg

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg accused former COO Sheryl Sandberg for the present “culture” in Facebook in a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump’s advisor Stephen Miller, reported the New York Times. As per the outlet, the tech billionaire was told he has the opportunity to “rebuild America” but on the “terms of Trump.”According to the outlet, Zuckerberg blamed Sandberg for Facebook's inclusivity initiative, which saw employees embrace self-expression in the workplace. The Meta CEO will reportedly now not stand against Trump’s crackdown on DEI culture—diversity, equity, and inclusion. The tech mogul has also reportedly mentioned that the new guidelines and layoffs will be initiated to “reset the company.” This DEI culture has been adopted not just by Meta but several companies in America in recent years.Furthermore, the outlet reported that, according to people present at the meeting, Zuckerberg said he would now solely focus on building tech products.He also accused Sandberg of the inclusivity culture at the company.“Zuckerberg blamed his former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, for an inclusivity initiative at Facebook that encouraged employees’ self-expression in the workplace,” the report added, citing one of the people with knowledge of the meeting.Sandberg resigned from the company in 2022, and at that time, Zuckerberg praised her working syyle.“Sheryl architected our ads business, hired great people, forged our management culture, and taught me how to run a company. She deserves the credit for so much of what Meta is today,” Zuckerberg wrote at that time.The report comes a few days after Meta CEO, while supporting Trump's crackdown on DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) culture, announced abolishing its D.E.I. policy.

“I think that’s a good thing. As an industry, we want to move fast,”

“As the first Trump administration demonstrated, America wins through innovation, competition, and by sharing our technologies with the world — not by retreating behind a wall of government overreach.”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang may skip President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, a report claims. If the rumours are to be true, this will break away from a trend among US-based tech leaders attending the event. Unlike executives such as Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos, and Tesla head Elon Musk who is a close Trump ally, Huang will reportedly not represent Nvidia at the ceremony.Nvidia is now the most valuable chipmaker globally and second only to Apple among tech companies.Meanwhile, the chip industry is expected to be represented at the Trump inauguration, with Arm Holdings CEO Rene Haas likely to attend the event.A report by the news agency Bloomberg citing a source familiar with Huang’s plans claimed that he is currently in East Asia, a routine trip he makes around the Lunar New Year. The source, who spoke anonymously, also noted that Huang has never attended a US presidential inauguration before. However, a representative of California-based Nvidia declined to comment on Huang’s plans or any communication between the company and the incoming administration.Earlier this month, Huang talked about his willingness to meet Trump, stating he’d be “delighted to meet Trump and “do whatever we can to make this administration succeed.’”However, at the time, Huang noted he had not yet received an invitation to the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. He also said that he expects that Trump would implement fewer regulations.Huang notedCurrently, Nvidia is grappling with multiple new regulations introduced during the final days of the Biden administration. These measures aim to restrict access to advanced technologies, including Nvidia's latest AI chips, to prevent them from reaching China.The company has strongly opposed the new export restrictions that were announced this week. The chip maker labelled these restrictions as an ""overreach"" and cautioned that it could have major consequences for the technology industry.Earlier this week, Ned Finkle, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs, said:","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang may skip President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, a report claims.

A report by The Washington Post stated that Trump is considering an executive order to delay the shutdown for 60 to 90 days.Donald Trump’s support for TikTok is a striking reversal from 2020, when he attempted to ban the app in the US and force its sale to American companies.

Microsoft has announced that its Office apps, now called Microsoft 365 apps, will no longer be supported on Windows 10 starting October 14, 2025. In a blog post, Microsoft stated, “Microsoft 365 Apps will no longer be supported after October 14, 2025, on Windows 10 devices. To use Microsoft 365 Applications on your device, you will need to upgrade to Windows 11 .” The date also marks the end of official support for the Windows 10 operating system.To continue using Microsoft 365 apps without issues, users will need to upgrade to Windows 11.Microsoft says that though after the support ends, the Office apps won’t stop working right away. However, users might face performance and reliability problems over time, the company warns.Microsoft is pushing users to upgrade to Windows 11, calling 2025 “the year of the Windows 11 PC refresh.” Speaking at CES, Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft’s executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer, emphasized the importance of upgrading:“We believe that one of the most important pieces of technology people will look to refresh in 2025 isn’t the refrigerator, the television or their mobile phone. It will be their Windows 10 PC, and they will move forward with Windows 11”.Many Windows 10 users haven’t switched to Windows 11 yet, partly because older PCs don’t meet the strict hardware requirements. For instance, Windows 11 demands a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0, which Microsoft says is “non-negotiable.” Gamers too are reluctant to switch to Windows 11, citing concerns about compatibility and performance.To encourage users to upgrade, Microsoft has started showing full-screen prompts suggesting they buy new PCs.While the support for Windows 10 will end this year, Microsoft is offering Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for the first time. Consumers can pay $30 for an extra year of updates, while businesses can purchase up to three years of extended support.As the October 2025 deadline approaches, Microsoft is making it clear that upgrading to Windows 11 is essential for a seamless experience with its apps and services.","Microsoft 365 apps will no longer be supported on Windows 10 starting October 14, 2025.

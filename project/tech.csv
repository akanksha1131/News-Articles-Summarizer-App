'India Well Positioned To Lead The World In AI': OpenAI CEO Sam Altman At AI Impact Summit

Why OpenAI did not contact police

Broader debate around AI and public safety

Sam Altman’s OpenAI reviewed and debated whether to alert Canadian police about troubling ChatGPT conversations months before an 18-year-old was identified as the suspect in a deadly school shooting in British Columbia, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The discussions took place after the user’s interactions with the chatbot were flagged by OpenAI’s internal review systems for references to gun violence. While some employees pushed for law enforcement to be notified, company leaders ultimately decided the activity did not meet the threshold required to contact authorities, the report said.As per WSJ, the user, later identified by Canadian police as Jesse Van Rootselaar, used ChatGPT in June last year to describe violent scenarios involving firearms over several days. The conversations were flagged by OpenAI’s automated monitoring tools, which are designed to detect potential risks of real-world harm.The flagged content prompted internal concern. Around a dozen OpenAI employees reportedly discussed whether the posts suggested a credible threat. Some staff members believed the conversations could indicate possible real-world violence and urged senior leaders to inform Canadian law enforcement.OpenAI ultimately chose not to alert authorities. A company spokesperson told WSJ that Van Rootselaar’s account was banned, but her activity did not meet the company’s standard for reporting to law enforcement. That standard requires a “credible and imminent risk of serious physical harm to others.”The spokesperson said OpenAI balances potential safety risks against user privacy and the harm that could come from involving police without clear evidence of an immediate threat.On February 10, Van Rootselaar was found dead at the scene of a school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, from what police described as a self-inflicted injury. Eight people were killed and at least 25 were injured. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police later named her as the suspect.After learning of the attack, OpenAI contacted the RCMP and said it is cooperating with investigators. “Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy,” the company said.The case highlights growing questions around how AI companies handle sensitive user data. OpenAI told the Wall Street Journal that it trains its systems to discourage harm and routes concerning conversations to human reviewers, who can contact law enforcement if there is an immediate threat.Canadian police said Van Rootselaar had prior contact with authorities related to mental health concerns, and firearms had previously been removed from her residence. Investigators are now reviewing her online activity, including a video game simulation of a mass shooting and social media posts related to firearms, as part of the ongoing investigation.","Sam Altman's OpenAI reviewed and debated whether to alert Canadian police about troubling ChatGPT conversations months before an 18-year-old was identified as the suspect in a deadly school shooting in British Columbia.

Salesforce selects four Indian nonprofits for its Agents for Impact AI Accelerator; Offers Rs 6.8 crore in grants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/salesforce-selects-four-indian-nonprofits-for-its-agents-for-impact-ai-accelerator-offers-rs-6-8-crore-in-grants/articleshow/128650391.cms,"Salesforce has launched its Agents for Impact accelerator in India, granting Rs 6.8 crore to four nonprofits. This initiative provides free technology and expert support for six months, enabling organizations to build AI agents for tasks like donor outreach and application processing.

Four nonprofits, four very different use cases

The larger bet Salesforce is making on AI and social impact

Salesforce has launched the India cohort of its Accelerator—Agents for Impact program, picking four nonprofits to receive grants, free technology access, and hands-on expert support to build custom AI agents. The total grant pool sits at Rs 6.8 crore, spread across the cohort, with each organization also getting free Salesforce technology for up to 18 months and pro bono consulting from Salesforce employees.The six-month program is built around a straightforward problem: nonprofits in India are stretched thin, running lean teams across wide geographies, and burning time on administrative work that AI could handle. The idea is to let agents take over routine tasks—donor outreach, volunteer coordination, application processing—so staff can focus on the actual work.The inaugural cohort reflects just how varied those needs can be. Antarang Foundation is building a Career Facilitator Agent that pulls each student's profile data to generate personalized counseling sessions.Foundation For Excellence is developing a Scholarship Agent to speed up student application reviews. Latika, which works with people with disabilities, is creating a Legal Navigator Agent to walk users through acquiring disability certificates, pensions, and tax relief—step by step. And Teach for India is deploying a Teaching Assistant trained on its Firki teacher-training platform, designed to answer queries and direct teachers to the right courses.Arundhati Bhattacharya, President and CEO of Salesforce South Asia, framed the initiative around reclaiming human capacity rather than replacing it. Her argument: when AI handles complexity, people are freed up for the work that actually requires human judgment and empathy.The program is part of Salesforce's global Agents for Impact accelerator, with the India cohort marking the country's first entry into what the company positions as a long-term push to make agentic AI accessible beyond the corporate sector.","Salesforce has launched its Agents for Impact accelerator in India, granting Rs 6.8 crore to four nonprofits.

What the New Delhi AI Impact Declaration promises

India positions itself as a bridge between AI haves and have-nots

The AI Impact Summit 2026 wrapped up in New Delhi on December 20 with 88 countries and international organisations signing the New Delhi Declaration on AI Impact—a sweeping, albeit non-binding, agreement that lays out a shared roadmap for making AI work for everyone, not just a handful of tech superpowers.The two-day summit, held on February 18-19, was built around seven pillars—or ""Chakras"" as the government called them—covering everything from democratising AI resources and workforce reskilling to energy-efficient AI systems and using AI to accelerate scientific research. India, which hosted the event, pushed hard for its ""AI for All"" vision, rooted in the Sanskrit principle of ""Sarvajan Hitaya, Sarvajan Sukhaya"" (welfare for all, happiness for all).Among the concrete deliverables: a Charter for Democratic Diffusion of AI aimed at making foundational AI resources more affordable, a Global AI Impact Commons platform for countries to share and replicate successful AI use cases, and a Trusted AI Commons—essentially a shared repository of tools, benchmarks, and best practices for building secure AI systems. There's also an International Network of AI for Science Institutions to pool research capabilities across borders and an AI Workforce Development Playbook to help nations prepare their citizens for an AI-driven economy.The signatory list reads like a UN General Assembly roll call—from the US, China, and the EU to smaller nations like Bhutan, Fiji, and Suriname. Russia, Iran, and Cuba also signed on, making this one of the more geopolitically diverse AI agreements to date.A recurring theme was the gap between countries that build AI and those that merely consume it. The declaration calls for affordable connectivity, open-source AI ecosystems, and locally relevant innovation. The message is clear: developing nations shouldn't just consume AI—they should build it too. Energy efficiency also got a spotlight, with the summit acknowledging AI's growing appetite for power and resources.With 88 signatories—including the US, China, Russia, and the EU—the New Delhi Declaration is one of the most geopolitically diverse AI agreements to date. And a clear signal that India wants to lead the global AI governance conversation, not just sit at the table."," AI Impact Summit 2026 wrapped up in New Delhi on December 20 with 88 countries and international organisations signing the New Delhi Declaration on AI Impact.

JPMogran’s response



What’s next



America’s largest bank JPMorgan and Chase has now accused the US President Donald Trump of fraudulently naming CEO Jamie Dimon in his $5 billion lawsuit over the closure of his accounts, arguing the move was designed to keep the case in Floria state court. As reported by Bloomberg, in a Thursday filling (February 19), the bank asked to move the case to federal court in Miami, with plans to later transfer it to New York. JPMorgan said Trump’s claim that Dimon directed the bank to ‘blackist’ him and his businesses was not supported under Florida’s unfair trade practices law. The bank believes that Dimon was “fraudulently joined” to avoid federal jurisdiction.For the uninitiated, Trump sued JPMorgan and Dimon in January this year, seeking at least $5 billion in damages for allegedly ‘debanking’ him and his companies for political reasons. His legal team insists that Dimon personally directed the bank to backlist Trump, his family, and businesses, causing “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.”The bank dismissed Trump’s claims as ‘thredbare’, saying his allegations of a backlist was ‘unclear’ and lacked detail. JPMorgan’s lawyers wrote: “They do not explain what this ‘blacklist’ entails, when it was created, to whom it was supposedly circulated, or any other detail describing it. Nor is it plausible that JPMorgan could create such a list consistent with the complex federal regulatory scheme to which it is subject. ”JPMorgan said it will seek to dismiss the lawsuit entirely. Trump’s legal team, however, vowed to press forward, framing the case as a fight against politically motivated debanking.","Donald Trump sued JPMorgan and Dimon in January this year, seeking at least $5 billion in damages for allegedly ‘debanking’ him and his companies for political reasons.

'Chinese Humanoid Robots' showcased during Lunar New Year event impress everyone and 'prove' why Elon Musk said that China is only competitor Tesla has,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinese-humanoid-robots-showcased-during-lunar-new-year-event-impress-everyone-and-prove-why-elon-musk-said-that-china-is-only-competitor-tesla-has/articleshow/128462881.cms,"“I think China will be by far the biggest competitor in the humanoid robot market. China is extremely good at scaling and manufacturing and is also strong in AI—the models being released there are already quite good and are improving rapidly.”

Why the hype around Chinese humanoid robot market has increased



“We’re gonna take the Model S and X production space in our Fremont factory and convert that into an Optimus factory … with the long-term goal of having 1 million units a year of Optimus robots in the current SX space in Fremont,”

“we’re still very much at the early stages of Optimus,”

“We wouldn’t expect to have any kind of significant Optimus production volume until probably end of this year,”

China's annual CCTV Spring Festival Gala, which is often compared to the US Super Bowl, showcased humanoid robots from four domestic startups during the Lunar New Year celebrations this week. This highlights the country's push to lead in robotics and manufacturing. The demonstration comes after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said China would be a key competitor in the humanoid robot market.During Tesla's earnings call last year, Musk said,The gala featured robots from Unitree Robotics, Galbot, Noetix, and MagicLab performing martial arts and fight sequences with swords, poles, and nunchucks alongside human child performers. The event served as a showcase for China's industrial policy and its ambitions in humanoid robotics.China is the world's largest manufacturer and user of robots. According to an industry report by Omdia, Chinese robotics firm AgiBot shipped over 5,100 humanoid robots in 2025, securing a 39% share of the global humanoid robot market.The attention surrounding China's humanoid robot sector comes as major players, including AgiBot and Unitree prepare for initial public offerings this year. Moreover, domestic artificial intelligence (AI) startups release a range of frontier models during the nine-day Lunar New Year public holiday.Last year's gala drew widespread attention with 16 full-size Unitree humanoids twirling handkerchiefs and dancing alongside human performers. Unitree's founder met President Xi Jinping weeks later at a notable tech symposium, which was the first of its kind since 2018.Xi has met five robotics startup founders in the past year, comparable to the four electric vehicle and four semiconductor entrepreneurs he met in the same timeframe, giving the emerging sector considerable visibility.Behind the spectacle of robots running marathons and executing kung fu kicks and backflips, China has positioned robotics and AI at the heart of its next-generation AI manufacturing strategy, aiming for productivity gains from automation to offset pressures from its ageing workforce.Elon Musk has said he expects his key competitors to be Chinese companies as he pivots Tesla toward a focus on embodied AI and its humanoid robot Optimus.Last month, Musk said that Tesla is betting on a future driven less by cars and more by humanoid robots, reiterating comments he made last year. During Tesla’s earnings call this week, Elon Musk outlined plans to shift focus away from vehicles toward its Optimus robots, saying the company would discontinue the Model S and Model X to prioritise robot production. Tesla said it will end production of the Model S and Model X and repurpose the California facility that built those vehicles to manufacture Optimus robots.Musk said.In 2024, Musk said Optimus could eventually make Tesla a $25 trillion company, compared with its current market value of about $1.4 trillion, and previously stated that 80% of Tesla’s value could come from robots.While Musk said Tesla plans to build a production line capable of producing one million Optimus units annually, he also acknowledged thatdescribing it as a research and development effort.Musk added.","China's annual CCTV Spring Festival Gala showcased humanoid robots from four domestic startups during the Lunar New Year celebrations this week.

Price spikes and “RAMmageddon”



Industry fallout due to global chip crisis



Echoes of past supply chain shocks



Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Xiaomi President Lu Weibing and many others are warning about a global crisis unfolding: Shortage of memory chips. The scarcity of memory chips led to their soaring costs. As a report in Bloomberg says it is beginning to hammer profits, derail corporate plans and inflate price tags on everything from laptops and smartphones to automobiles and data centers — and the crunch is only going to get worse.As per the Bloomberg report, the main driver of the squeeze is the buildout of AI data centers. Companies like Alphabet and OpenAI are buying millions of Nvidia AI accelerators, each needing a massive amounts of DRAM. This has left the consumer electronics maker fighting over dwindling supplies from Samsung and Micron. Elon Musk has also suggested that Tesla may need to build its own fabrication plant, “he said in January.The report also adds that the memory prices are increasing and going at an unprecedented levels. One of the type of DRAM jumped by 75% in a single month, with retailers adjusting prices daily. Industry insiders have dubbed the crisis “RAMmageddon.” Tim Cook warned that iPhone margins will be compressed, while Micron called the bottleneck “unprecedented.”The report also revealed the industry fallout on the global chip crisis.The report adds that Sony may delay its next PlayStation console to 2028 or 2029. Also, Nintendo is also thinking raising the prices of Switch 2. Xiaomi and Oppo may also cut shipment forecasts for 2026. Cisco cited the memory squeeze in a weak profit outlook, triggering its worst share loss in nearly four years. Lastly, Qualcomm and Arm Holdings also warned of more fallout.This global chip crisis recall the Covid-era chip shortages, but this time the driver is AI. Tech giants Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are pouring hundreds of billions into AI infrastructure, diverting memory production toward high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for AI accelerators. That leaves less capacity for standard DRAM used in everyday electronics.Bernstein’s Mark Li says memory prices are going “parabolic.” Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing warned the crunch will last at least through the year. Counterpoint Research estimates DRAM shortages will persist across electronics, telecom, and automotive industries, with signs of panic buying already visible.",Report: Shortage of memory chips led to soaring costs.

Mackenzie Scott, former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has said that her approach to large-scale philanthropy is shaped by acts of kindness she received during her early years. In an essay published on her philanthropic organisation, Yield Giving website in October, Scott said she often thinks about the people who helped her when she struggled financially as a college student. She recalled borrowing money from her college roommate to avoid dropping out and receiving free dental care from a local dentist when she could not afford treatment.“It is these ripple effects that make imagining the power of any of our own acts of kindness impossible,” Scott wrote in the essay. “Whose generosity did I think of every time I made every one of the thousands of gifts I’ve been able to give?”“It was the local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college.

After the divorce, Mackenzie Scott received roughly a 4% stake in Amazon, amounting to about 139 million shares at the time.She has since cut that holding by around 42%.Despite this, Scott remains worth close to $28 billion, even after donating about $26 billion through her Yield Giving organisation, which she launched in 2022.Yield Giving has supported thousands of organisations across areas such as education, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), disaster relief, and community development. In recent months alone, Scott donated more than $400 million to education- and DEI-focused groups, with several recipients receiving the largest donations in their history.Recently, Garry Tan, CEO of Y Combinator shared an X post writing: ""MacKenzie Scott has given away $26B faster than anyone in history — with no oversight, and no accountability for the chaos that follows. This is not stewardship. Real philanthropy requires real care and attention. Pour sugar on the floor? You get ants."". The post caught the attention of Elon Musk who replied in affirmation. ""Yup,"" he repied endorsing Tan's critique of MacKenzie Scott's $26.4 billion donations since 2019.","Mackenzie Scott, former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has said that her approach to large-scale philanthropy is shaped by acts of kindness. In an essay published on her philanthropic organisation, Yield Giving website in October, Scott said she often thinks about the people who helped her when she struggled financially as a college student.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128408549,imgsize-22938,width-400,resizemode-4/mackenzie-scott.jpg"
David Greene: Popular radio show host David Greene claims Google stole his voice; Google responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/popular-radio-show-host-david-greene-claims-google-stole-his-voice-google-responds/articleshow/128414462.cms,"What David Greene says

Google responds to the lawsuit

Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google , alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts. The lawsuit, filed in Santa Clara County alleges that Google cloned Greene’s voice and distinctive broadcasting style without permission or compensation. Greene argues that Google’s NotebookLM T tool voice's rhythm, intonation, and even his characteristic verbal tics are so similar that even his friends, colleagues, and listeners assumed he'd licensed his voice to Google.“So... I’m probably the 148th person to ask this, but did you license your voice to Google? It sounds very much like you!,” a former co-worker asked David Greene in a fall 2024 email, a Washington Post report says.“I was, like, completely freaked out,” Greene told the publication, adding “It’s this eerie moment where you feel like you’re listening to yourself.”Greene said the AI voice sounds very similar to his own, and that the impact goes beyond losing a chance to make money from his best-known asset. “My voice is, like, the most important part of who I am,” Greene reportedly said.In the lawsuit, Greene’s lawyer argues that the recordings make the resemblance clear.“We have faith in the court and encourage people to listen to the example audio themselves,” said Joshua Michelangelo Stein, a partner at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner.Google responded denying the allegations. Google spokesperson José Castañeda told Washington Post: “These allegations are baseless. The sound of the male voice in NotebookLM’s Audio Overviews is based on a paid professional actor Google hired.”The Washington Post reported, “The lawsuit is the latest to pit the rights of individual human creators against the rights of a burgeoning AI industry that promises to transform the economy by enabling the on-demand generation of stunningly lifelike speech, prose, images, and video. Behind the artificial voices found in tools like NotebookLM are language models trained on vast libraries of real-life human text and speech. The humans used to train these models are unaware that their words and voices will be used by AI, raising serious questions about copyright and ownership.”","Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google, alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently drew a comparison between today’s large technology companies and East India Company. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Sridhar Vembu wrote: “Big tech is bigger than most sovereign nations. ""East India Company"" is the way to think about them”. While he did not name any single company in his post, Vembu was responding to a post noting that Google raised $32 billion in debt in a single day—an amount comparable to what a large country like India raises over several months—and issued a 100-year bond, a time horizon longer than many government bonds.“Google raised $32B of debt in 1 day, what a sovereign government like India raises in 100 days. Google also issued a 100-year bond worth $1B, which is longer than India's longest at 40 years. Big tech now operates like sovereign nations with fundraising size and time horizons,” the X post said. It referred to a Google’s recent sale of a rare 100-year bond in British pounds as part of its massive multi-currency debt raise, making it the first tech company to attempt a century bond since IBM did it back in 1996.Sridhar Vembu’s X post has sparked debate online. Commenting on Vembu's post, one user replied “They are the new EIC, but operating on a different plane of existence.The 'Money' layer of control is collapsing, so the elites are shifting to the 'Data' layer. We are moving from a world defined by the Credit Score to one defined by the Algorithm. The EIC wanted spices. Big Tech wants souls (or at least, the predictive data that mimics it)”.Another user commented saying “goes deeper than scale tho. east india company controlled trade routes, big tech controls data routes. running business infra across 3 countries and every cloud pricing change or api deprecation sends you scrambling. the dependency is invisible until the terms change”.“You are wrong Sridhar. Big Tech operates on long-term horizons, while we often trip over ROI. Look at i-flex solutions: it built world-class products like Microbanker and Flexcube that dominated global banking.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive.

Sarvam’s Indus AI chatbot availability

Sarvam, an Indian artificial intelligence startup working on AI models for Indian languages and users, has launched its Indus chat app for web and mobile platforms. With this move, the company enters a crowded generative AI market that is currently led by global players such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Google with their respective AI chatbots – ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini, respectively. The launch comes days after Google CEO Sundar Pichai said he is impressed with. Speaking at India AI Impact Summit 2026, Pichai specifically highlighted Sarvam AI for developing local AI models tailored to Indian languages and contexts saying ""The work Sarvam has done developing local AI models ....I just don't see any impediments to that, and I think it is very, very well positioned"".Indus works as a chat interface for Sarvam’s newly announced 105B model, a large language model with 105 billion parameters. It allows users to type or speak questions and receive responses in text or audio. Users can sign in using their phone number, Google or Microsoft account, or Apple ID. For now, the service appears to be limited to users in India.Sarvam has said the app has some limitations in its early version. Users cannot delete chat history without deleting their account, and there is no option to turn off the app’s reasoning mode, which can slow responses.The app was launched two days after Sarvam introduced its 105B and 30B models at the AI Summit held in New Delhi earlier this week. At the event, the company also shared details about its enterprise plans, hardware roadmap, and partnerships with firms such as HMD and Bosch.The Indus app is currently available in beta on iOS, Android and the web. Access may also be limited due to restricted computing capacity.“We’re gradually rolling out Indus on a limited compute capacity, so you may hit a waitlist at first,” Sarvam co-founder Pratyush Kumar said in a post on X.Founded in 2023, Sarvam has raised $41 million from investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners, Peak XV Partners and Khosla Ventures, as it builds AI models designed specifically for Indian users.","Indus works as a chat interface for Sarvam’s newly announced 105B model, a large language model with 105 billion parameters.

OpenAI is finalising massive funding

'India Well Positioned To Lead The World In AI': OpenAI CEO Sam Altman At AI Impact Summit

OpenAI’s growth

OpneAI has now told investors that it is targeting $600 million in total compute spending by 2030. As reported by CNBC, this new figure showcases a sharp decline from the $1.4 trillion figure which OpenAI CEO Sam Altman touted months ago. This move the company raises concerns but its expansion plans which were outpacing its potential revenue growth. Citing sources close to the matter, CNBC report revealed that OpenAI’s revised plan offer a clearer timeline and ties more directly to expected revenue. The company projects $280 billion in revenue by 2030, split almost evenly between consumer and enterprise businesses. By scaling back its infrastructure commitments, OpenAI also hopes to reassure investors that its spending will align with growth.The report further adds that OpenAI is also finalising a huge funding round which is expected to exceed $100 billion, with about 90% coming from strategic investors. Nvidia is also in talks to invest up to $30 billion, whereas SoftBank and Amazon are also negotiating large stakes. The round could value OpenAI at $730 billion pre-money.In 2025, OpenAI generated $13.1 billion in revenue, surpassing its $10 billion target, while burning through $8 billion, slightly below its $9 billion forecast.The company continues to spend heavily on infrastructure but is now positioning its targets more conservatively.OpenAI’s flagship chatbot ChatGPT now has more than 900 million weekly active users, up from 800 million in October, rebounding after a dip in growth last fall. The company declared a “code red” in December to sharpen its focus on improving ChatGPT amid competition from Google and Anthropic. Its coding product Codex has also surpassed 1.5 million weekly active users, competing directly with Anthropic’s Claude Code.","OpneAI has now told investors that it is targeting $600 million in total compute spending by 2030.

What Wikipedia says on banning Archive Today

English-language edition of Wikipedia has reportedly banned Archive.today website after the archive site was found to direct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against a blog. Wikipedia editors reportedly discovered that the archive site altered snapshots of webpages to insert the name of the blogger who was targeted by the DDoS. The Archive Today is said to have been running a DDoS (denial of service) campaign against the personal blog of engineer Jani Patokallio for over a month. Archive.today, also known as archive.is, is an archiving service similar to sites like the Internet Archive. Archive.today uses advanced scraping methods, and is generally considered more reliable than the Internet Archive. The website is widely cited online, including on Wikipedia.In January this year, Patokallio wrote that since January 11, Archive Today has included a piece of JavaScript that makes a visitor's browser open his blog in the background, triggering a massive DDoS attack. As for those unaware, a DDoS attack targets websites and servers by disrupting network services in an attempt to exhaust an application's resources.The perpetrators behind these attacks flood a site with errant traffic, resulting in poor website functionality or knocking it offline altogether.An update on Wikipedia’s Archive.today discussion says: There is consensus to immediately deprecate archive.today, and, as soon as practicable, add it to the spam blacklist (or create an edit filter that blocks adding new links), and to forthwith remove all links to it. There is a strong consensus that Wikipedia should not direct its readers towards a website that hijacks users' computers to run a DDoS attack (see WP:ELNO#3). Additionally, evidence has been presented that archive.today's operators have altered the content of archived pages, rendering it unreliable. Those in favor of maintaining the status quo rested their arguments primarily on the utility of archive.today for verifiability. However, an analysis of existing links has shown that most of its uses can be replaced. Several editors started to work out implementation details during this RfC and the community should figure out how to efficiently remove links to archive.today.The underlying reason for the DDoS attack is said to be a public spat between the Archive's operator and Patokallio, revolving around a blog post from 2023, where the researcher looked into what makes Archive Today work well. As for what triggered the ban, Wikipedia says: 'In January 2026, the maintainers of Archive.today inserted malicious code in order to perform a distributed denial of service attack against a person they were in dispute with. Every time a user encounters the CAPTCHA page, their internet connection is used to attack a certain individual's blog. This obviously raises significant concerns for readers' safety, as well as the long-term stability and integrity of the service. The JavaScript code which causes this is still live on the website. However, a significant amount of people also think that mass-removing links to Archive.today may harm verifiability, and that the service is harder to censor than certain other archiving sites. As of 19 February 2026, the malicious code remains active. It is highly recommended not to visit the archive without blocking network requests to gyrovague.com to avoid being part of the attack.'",Wikipedia banned Archive.today website after it was found to direct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against a blog.

Google’s $185 billion bet



Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, has warned of a severe shortage of high-end memory chips (RAM), saying that it has become a major “choke point” for the entire industry that even a giant like Google , with its massive resources, is feeling the squeeze. Speaking to CNBC, Hassabis noted that while the world wants more of Google’s Gemini AI, the industry simply can't build the hardware fast enough to keep up with demand.“I mean the whole supply chain is kind of strained. We're lucky because we have our own TPUs. So we have our own chip designs, but yes, it still in the end actually comes down to a few suppliers of a few of the key components. So anywhere where that's there's some kind of constraint on the capacity, there's a sort of choke point,” he told CNBC on the sidelines of the AI Summit.Currently, only three companies in the world – Samsung, Micron and SK Hynix – make these chips, and they are struggling to keep up, reports said. This has caused costs to skyrocket and has even forced some consumer electronics companies to raise prices for everyday gadgets.To train a massive AI model or test a new scientific theory, researchers need thousands of specialised chips working together. These chips include TPUs, GPUs and a specific type of memory called High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM).“You need a lot of chips to be able to experiment on new ideas at a big enough scale to actually see if they're going to work,” Hassabis explained, as per Business Insider.Google isn’t backing down despite the supply hurdles. On its recent earnings call, the company projected a capital expenditure of $175 billion to $185 billion for 2026. Google also announced, a $15 billion infrastructure investment and deeper US-India tech ties with CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted AI innovation, digital trade routes, and secure supply chains.During his visit Hassabis added, ""India is uniquely positioned to lead the global adoption of AI in science and medicine. By doubling down on core national strengths like agriculture and the creative industries, India can pioneer Al-driven solutions for global challenges like climate resilience. Our goal is to empower local researchers and scientists with the foundational tools-from Gemini to AlphaFold-needed to accelerate the next generation of scientific breakthroughs. ”","DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis warns of shortage of high-end memory chips.

How conversational AI works

We’re experimenting with bringing YouTube’s conversational AI tool to smart TVs, gaming consoles, and streaming devices! If you’re eligible, here’s how to access it:

While watching a video, select the “Ask” button to open the AI tool

Select from suggested prompts, or use the microphone button to ask questions using your voice

If your TV remote has a microphone button, you can also use that button to trigger the conversational AI tool and ask questions. For example, you could say, “What ingredients are they using for this recipe?” or “What’s the story behind this song’s lyrics?”

We’re starting out with a small group of users and will keep everyone up to speed on any future expansions!

Google is reportedly bringing the power of Gemini AI to YouTube. The company is said to be experimenting with bringing its Gemini-powered conversational AI tool to YouTube on smart TVs, along with gaming consoles and streaming devices. This will allow users to ask questions about videos using voice commands through their remote controls – just like the way they converse with Gemini Live.According to a report by 9to5google, the feature has been available on YouTube's website and mobile apps for some time, and is now being tested with “a small group of users” on TV platforms. This will also be the first time the AI assistant will work on the biggest screen, the report added.The report claims that the conversational AI appears as an “Ask” button underneath videos on YouTube. When users select it, they can either choose from suggested prompts or use the microphone button to ask questions using their voice – like it is done in Gemini Live.For TVs that have remote controls with built-in microphones, users can press the microphone button to directly trigger the conversational AI tool. Those TVs without dedicated mic button can navigate to the Ask button first.According to Google, Gemini works in the background to analyse the video and deliver answers in real time.Currently, the conversational AI tool is only available in English, Hindi, Spanish, Portuguese and Korean in select regions, the report said, adding that Google hasn’t disclosed which specific regions are included in the test or how many users have access.The company also hasn't shared any images of how the feature appears on TV screens. If you're part of the test group and spot the ""Ask"" button on your YouTube TV app, Google would likely appreciate feedback on how it's working.","Google is reportedly bringing the power of Gemini AI to YouTube.

What Perplexity is focusing on instead of ads

""I think with advertising we could be really, really profitable,""

Perplexity may have joined Anthropic in 'trolling' Sam Altman ’s OpenAI after the ChatGPT maker announced plans to test advertisements in the chatbot. Perplexity has reportedly confirmed that it will not introduce ads into chatbot responses. This way, the AI startup is distancing itself from OpenAI’s emerging ad-based monetisation strategy and aligning itself more closely with Anthropic’s approach to AI products. Speaking at a recent roundtable with reporters, Perplexity executives said that the AI search startup plans to rely on subscription and enterprise revenue rather than advertising, a move that appears to align with Anthropic’s recent criticism of ads in conversational AI tools.Earlier this month, Anthropic added fuel to a growing debate within the AI industry by publicly mocking OpenAI’s shift toward ads in ChatGPT through a series of Super Bowl commercials. In these ads, the company highlighted how advertising could change chatbot interactions. In one of the 30-second spots, Anthropic shows a routine fitness question being interrupted mid-response by an unsolicited promotion for shoe insoles.In another, when a user asks a chatbot how to communicate better with their mother, an ad for a mature dating service appears that connectsWhile OpenAI has begun testing ads for US users of its free and $8-a-month ChatGPT Go tier, Perplexity is simultaneously expanding its enterprise sales push, targeting organisations and professional users instead of ad-supported growth.According to a Business Insider report, Perplexity is expanding its sales strategy and is now focusing on large organisations and professional users, such as finance professionals, CEOs, and doctors. The company currently has five people on its enterprise sales team but plans to increase hiring in this area. This approach pits Perplexity against companies such as Glean, which enable employees to search internal files and data using AI.The report further adds that executives said Perplexity will prioritise revenue and customer retention over metrics such as the number of questions answered. While the company did not disclose detailed financial figures, it said revenue grew 4.7 times last year, reaching $200 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by October 2025. Perplexity also said it will continue offering a free tier, though with certain limits.The move comes amid scepticism in Silicon Valley. At an AI conference last year, investors informally voted Perplexity as the company they would most likely bet against, citing concerns around the broader AI market. Still, Perplexity said it has been “busy building” rather than focusing on hype, with executives arguing that ads within AI responses can affect user trust.The move represents a shift for the company, which was among the early AI firms to experiment with advertising. In 2024, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas said on a podcast that he expected ads to eventually become the company’s main monetisation model.Srinivas said in 2024.","Perplexity has reportedly confirmed that it will not introduce ads into chatbot responses.

'Not Vassals Of Trump & Elon Musk': Spain's Deputy PM Makes Blistering Exit From 'Place Of Hate' X

Mackenzie Scott’s donations allegedly destroyed a Hispanic college

No one has ever given away more money as fast as Mackenzie Scott, philanthropist and former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Since 2019, Scott, who has disposed more than 75% of the Amazon shares she received from Bezos, has donated $26.4 billion to more than 2,500 groups. In 2025 alone, she gave away $7.2 billion — more than what world’s richest billionaires – Elon Musk, Larry Page, Larry Ellison, and even her ex-husband Bezos have donated in their entire lifetimes combined. But Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan has a different opinion. Sharing a post on X (formerly Twitter), Tan called the donations ‘bad’. Garry Tan argued that her lack of oversight fosters mismanagement, likening it to ""pouring sugar on the floor"" that attracts chaos.Tesla CEO Elon Musk seemed to agree who replied to Tan’s post writing “Yup”.“MacKenzie Scott has given away $26B faster than anyone in history — with no oversight, and no accountability for the chaos that follows,” Tan wrote in the post. “This is not stewardship. Real philanthropy requires real care and attention. Pour sugar on the floor? You get ants,” he added.The Y Combinator CEO also shared a blog post where he argued that “Big money giving has big bad effects”.He cites a Harvard spokesperson who told Fortune that the school found out about its $80 million grant “only when someone from Scott’s Yield Giving emailed them. No apparent vetting”.“From Howard’s perspective there was no prior relationship. No conversation about whether the institution could absorb that kind of windfall. Just an email saying the money’s coming,” he writes.Garry Tan compares it to Warren Buffet who he says builds decades-long relationships with the Gates Foundation and his family charities. Buffet, who has a lifetime giving of $68.3 billion (as per Forbes) “understands what they do. He watches outcomes”. Scott’s approach, on the other hand is the opposite — “spray and pray at a scale nobody has ever attempted”.Explaining further, he gives an example of Whittier College of how donations can have unintended consequences. A report by The Free Press said that a $12 million donation from MacKenzie Scott to a small Hispanic college led to internal turmoil. According to the report, the college president used part of the funds to hire her son for a six-figure role that staff members said lacked a clearly defined purpose. Consequently, leadership changes followed, enrollment dropped from about 490 freshmen to fewer than 300, and the school later faced a $10 million budget shortfall, the report said.It also pointed to the San Francisco Community Land Trust, which received $20 million from Scott. He noted that some board members have taken strong positions on housing and policing issues.","Mackenzie Scott, former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has donated $26.4 billion to more than 2,500 groups.

Is this an overreaction or a preview of what's coming

Cybersecurity stocks took a beating on Friday after Anthropic unveiled Claude Code Security—a new AI-powered tool that scans codebases for vulnerabilities and suggests patches, all built into its Claude Code platform on the web. The announcement sent shockwaves through a sector already bruised by months of AI-driven disruption fears.The damage was swift and broad-based. CrowdStrike, one of the biggest names in endpoint protection, dropped around 8%. Cloudflare slid 8%, Okta fell over 9%, SailPoint shed roughly 9%, and Zscaler declined about 5.5%. Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet weren't spared either, slipping 2–4% during the session. The Global X Cybersecurity ETF closed at its lowest level since November 2023, down nearly 5%. Combined, the sell-off wiped billions in market value across the sector in a single trading day—the latest in a string of AI-triggered routs that have hammered software stocks this year.Claude Code Security doesn't just scan for known patterns like traditional static analysis tools. It reads code the way a human security researcher would—tracing data flows, understanding how components interact, and flagging subtle logic flaws that rule-based scanners typically miss.Every finding goes through a multi-stage verification process before it reaches a human analyst, and nothing gets patched without developer approval.What really rattled investors: Anthropic said its Claude Opus 4.6 model had already found over 500 vulnerabilities in production open-source codebases during internal testing—bugs that had survived decades of expert review. The company said in its blog post that it also uses Claude to review its own code and has ""found it to be extremely effective at securing Anthropic's systems."" The goal with Claude Code Security, Anthropic added, is to make ""those same defensive capabilities more widely available. """"There's been steady selling in software, and today it's security that's getting a mini-flash crash on a headline,"" said Dennis Dick, head trader at Triple D Trading. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF is now down more than 23% this year, on pace for its worst quarterly drop since the 2008 financial crisis.Jefferies analyst Joseph Gallo expects cybersecurity will ultimately benefit from AI but warned that ""headline headwinds are likely to intensify before clarity & cyber inflection from securing AI materializes.""The tool is currently available only as a limited research preview for Enterprise and Team customers, with expedited access for open-source maintainers. It targets code auditing and vulnerability detection—not real-time endpoint protection, identity management, or zero-trust networking, which remain the core businesses of the companies that got hammered hardest.","Anthropic unveiled Claude Code Security, a new AI-powered tool that scans codebases for vulnerabilities and suggests patches.

Talent wars between OpenAI and Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab

Mira Murati's AI startup, Thinking Machines Lab, has lost yet another top executive to OpenAI . According to a Business Insider report, the latest employee to go back to the ChatGPT maker is Jolene Parish, who joined Thinking Machines Lab in April 2025. According to her LinkedIn profile, Parish has worked with OpenAI for 3 years. Before OpenAI, she was with iPhone maker Apple for 10 years.Last month, chief technology officer of Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab Barret Zoph left the company to go back to OpenAI. Murati then shared a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) confirming the departure. “We have parted ways with Barret Zoph”. She continued: “Soumith Chintala will be the new CTO of Thinking Machines. He is a brilliant and seasoned leader who has made important contributions to the AI field for over a decade, and he’s been a major contributor to our team. We could not be more excited to have him take on this new responsibility,” she then wrote.Zoph was then joined by Luke Metz and Sam Schoenholz to leave the AI startup and go back to OpenAI.As stated above, OpenAI has poached three founding members from Thinking Machines Lab – in what appears to be a calculated strike against a rising competitor.Zoph’s departure in January wasn't clean. Murati reportedly told staff she had terminated Zoph's employment over ""unethical conduct,"" though OpenAI disputed these concerns in an internal memo. According to reporting by Wired and the Wall Street Journal, Zoph had an undisclosed workplace relationship with another employee in a leadership role who has since left the company.Murati confronted Zoph about the relationship last summer, sources told Wired. Their working relationship deteriorated afterward, and Zoph began speaking with competitors including Meta before ultimately choosing OpenAI. In her internal message to employees, Murati cited a history of performance and conduct issues dating back to mid-2025.","Mira Murati's AI startup, Thinking Machines Lab, has lost yet another top executive to OpenAI.

iPhone 17e



Apple iPad 11 generation



Apple MacBook Air and MacBook Pro



Low-cost MacBook also expected to launch



Apple has scheduled its ‘special Apple Experience’ event for March 4. Apple will host the event with simultaneous gatherings planned in New York, London, and Shanghai. Rumours suggest that Apple may launch its affordable iPhone 17e, next generation MacBook Air , MacBook Pro and 11th generation iPad at the event. The invite shared by Apple is light on details but heavy on intrigue. It features a 3D Apple logo made of yellow, green, and blue discs—colours that match rumoured options for a new low-cost MacBook. Apple is pointedly calling this an ""experience"" rather than an ""event,"" suggesting something smaller and more hands-on than the typical Apple Park keynote. There's no word yet on whether it'll be livestreamed.Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17e, which will replace the iPhone 16e introduced last year. The upcoming iPhone 17e is said to be powered by the A19 chip that comes with iPhone 17. The A19 offers a modest boost in CPU speed compared to the A18, but most of its improvement is in GPU, thus allowing it to be even better for AI features and gaming. Further, the handset is tipped to get MagSafe charging feature. Another change coming the iPhone 17e is that it may be equipped with Apple’s newest in-house cellular and wireless chips.Other major new features include an 18MP front camera with Center Stage. This camera automatically extends to show everybody in a group selfie, even when you hold the phone vertically.As far as the pricing of the upcoming iPhone 17e is concerned, rumours suggest that the company is planning to keep pricing the same as iPhone 16e. To recall, iPhone 16e launched in 2025 with a price tag of $599 or Rs 59,900 in India.Apple is also expected to unveil the new iPad at the event. Apple is said to be preparing a refreshed entry-level iPad with the A18 chip, which would bring support for Apple Intelligence for the first time. New iPad Air models are tipped to move to the M4 chip. Design changes are expected to be limited, though the iPad mini is reported to switch to an OLED display.Apple is also working on new Macs, including updated MacBook Air, 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models powered by the M5 chip. Apple MacBook Air is said to feature Apple’s N1 networking chip which is said to improve the connectivity and wireless speed of the device.On the other hand, the Apple MacBook Pro will mainly focus on performance improvement and any major design changes are not expected.One of the key launches in the first half of the year could be a low-cost MacBook with a screen under 13 inches, powered by an iPhone-class chip. The device is expected to compete with budget Windows laptops and Chromebooks, and is likely to be positioned as an entry point into the Mac ecosystem for new users.","Apple has scheduled its ‘special Apple Experience’ event for March 4.

What made Microsoft make this statement related to ICE

“investigative case management operations,”

“custom enhancements.”

Microsoft doesn’t believe that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency uses any tools for “mass surveillance of civilians"". According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the software giant has claimed that it also does not believe that ICE is using its technology for mass surveillance of civilians. The company’s statement came in response to a report that raised concerns about potential misuse. The company said its policies prohibit such activity and that it provides cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE through partners.a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.the company spokesperson added.The company added that the US Congress, the executive branch and the courts should drawregarding the permissible use of emerging technologies by law enforcement.The statement from Microsoft followed a report by The Guardian, which said ICE increased its use of Microsoft’s cloud technology last year as the agency expanded arrest and deportation operations.The publication cited leaked documents in its report.According to The Guardian’s report, ICE more than tripled the volume of data stored on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform in the six months leading up to January 2026, a period during which the agency’s budget grew, and its workforce expanded. The report added that ICE appeared to be using several Microsoft productivity tools, along with AI-based products, to search and analyse data stored on Azure.This is not the first time Microsoft has been under the scanner for the US government's use of its technology. In September 2025, Microsoft stated that it had disabled some services being used by an Israeli military unit after there was some preliminary evidence that supported a media investigation about mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls. Microsoft’s ties with the Israeli military had also led to some protests within the company, and some employees who took part in the protests were fired.ICE told Reuters that it will not comment on specifics of investigative techniques, tools, or technologies used in ongoing criminal probes but said it uses various technologies to aid in the arrests of criminals.Some of the tech companies with the largest ICE contracts include Dell, AT&T, and Palantir. According to Forbes, Dell’s government contracting arm was awarded $18.8 million in April 2025 to support the office of ICE’s chief information officer “through the purchase of the Microsoft Enterprise software licenses.”AT&T received $90.7 million in 2021 to supply ICE with IT and network solutions, along with associated support services, with the contract set to expire in September. The contract also has a potential extension until 2032, which would raise the total contract value to $165.2 million.Meanwhile, Palantir, a technology and analytics software provider, received a $139.3 million contract in 2022 to assist withmaintenance support and",Microsoft denies its technology is used by ICE for mass civilian surveillance.

'A Very Positive Case Study': Meta AI chief Alexandr Wang Praises India's AI Startup Ecosystem

Software engineers can heave a sigh of relief. Your job may get changed/altered a bit, but it is not going anywhere according to the CEO of India's second-biggest IT company Infosys. In an interview to Economic Times, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh spoke about a range of issues including the impact of AI tools on the core business of IT services companies like Infosys. Asked specifically on what he thinks of the view that the IT services industry is going to be decimated by AI tools in next five years. Infosys CEO said, "" If you look at the size of tech services, it’s $1.5 trillion in overall global market size. Our analysis is that the AI services market is $300-400 billion. Going by this, it therefore stands to reason that far from getting decimated, the Indian IT industry will be thriving in 2030. Infosys will leverage those six areas of growth, and we’ll see that we get revenues from these six areas of growth.""On the impact of Agentic AI tools on companies like Infosys, Parekh said, ""Whenever a technology comes in, it is a brownfield area—somewhat old and new.Greenfield is when something is entirely new. What is likely to happen with these technologies is that we need to coexist with everything because it is not that overnight everything is going to be replaced. The foundational models are very ahead in terms of innovation. But dispersion within a large enterprise is slower. That is where our engineering is needed to make sure it works within your organisation.""Parekh said that the business environment looks a lot more positive, especially in the US. ""The macro at this stage is looking better than it was 12 months ago. At least in the US market, they have reduced the regulations quite significantly. There's at least some talk that interest rates may further come down. When we talk to people, the sense we get is that they feel the business environment is more supportive,"" he said.Parekh talked about Infosys hiring from campuses in the past year when asked about the future of work considering that IT services in India are known to employ a significant part of the country's middle class. ""Look at the data. This year, through March, we will end up recruiting 20,000 college graduates in India. We’ve already had 18,000 at the end of Q3. That’s just the college graduates. We’ve already announced that we will recruit 20,000 college graduates next year. What tends to happen is that some of these projects will require more people over time. Yes, they will also use agents, but the overall size will still be larger. If you assume the IT spend, or work is the same, then there is more of this view (of job losses). To have more headcount is still more positive than negative. What we see is some of the skills that the individuals will have, even as they enter the workforce or over time, will give them more specialisation,"" he said.On criticism about how the Indian IT services industry has not given back enough to the startup ecosystem, Parekh said, ""Infosys has an innovation fund in which we actually invest a lot. We could always do more, but the startup ecosystem focus is very broad, whereas Infosys has a narrow focus, to work with its global clients. Wherever there is an overlap, there's a tremendous amount of work going on. We've made some investments in data analytics work, healthcare work and so on. ""On Infosys' AI strategy, CEO Parekh said, ""We are building agents for clients using the foundational models. At the AI day, we had about 10 or 12 client examples that were shown. These weren’t pilots but large-scale projects. There is significant activity in this space, and clients want to work with a trusted partner who can guide them. That is a major component of our AI strategy. Another is a process where, if you have a customer service process (we help) you change the process using agents and, reducing the time, increase the quality and so on. Then we have legacy modernisation, since there are a lot of companies where technology is old. So, to me, there’s a huge opportunity out there that we see in AI services.""","Infosys CEO Salil Parekh spoke about the impact of AI tools on the core business of IT services companies like Infosys.

Mark Zuckerberg SCOLDED During Senate Hearing Over ‘Vile’ Social Media Content; ‘You've Blood...'

What Meta said about shifting Horizon Worlds' focus from VR to mobile

Meta is changing its metaverse strategy once again. The social media giant is now making a major change to the Horizon Worlds VR-exclusive app, originally designed for Meta Quest headsets. Meta said it will separate its Quest VR ecosystem from the free, social 3D virtual experience and shift its focus largely to mobile users to compete with Roblox and Fortnite.This comes after the company laid off about 10% of its Reality Labs division, closed three VR studios, stopped new content for the VR fitness app Supernatural, and discontinued its metaverse platform for work. In 2021, the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg also changed the company’s name, and last year, Meta’s Reality Labs lost $20 billion.In a blog post, Samantha Ryan, Reality Labs’ VP of content, said Meta is “explicitly separating” its “Quest VR platform from our Worlds platform” and “shifting the focus of Worlds to be almost exclusively mobile.”Horizon Worlds was originally launched for VR, but the company now plans to compete more directly with platforms like Roblox and Fortnite that offer user-generated experiences on smartphones.Ryan said, ""To truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we’re going all-in on mobile.”“We’re in a strong position to deliver synchronous social games at scale, thanks to our unique ability to connect those games with billions of people on the world’s biggest social networks. You saw this strategy start to unfold in 2025, and now, it’s our main focus,” she noted.She even added that Meta will prioritise support for third-party developers in VR.“While we’re proud of the world-class work from Oculus Studios over the years, among 1P and 3P apps, 86% of the effective time people spend in their VR headsets is with third-party apps,” she said, underscoring the company’s shift in emphasis within its Reality Labs division.What we know about Meta VR hardware's futureMeta said it will continue developing VR hardware despite the strategic shift. “We have a robust roadmap of future VR headsets that will be tailored to different audience segments as the market grows and matures,” Ryan said, adding that upcoming devices, which could include a new mainline Quest headset, may come at a higher price point.Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth also discussed the company’s evolving approach in a recent episode of the Access podcast.Following its earlier push into the metaverse, Zuckerberg has increasingly positioned AI as central to the company’s future social platforms. The approach could include AI-generated games that users can create and share through their social feeds.“There are 3D versions of that, and there are 2D versions of that and Horizon, I think, fits very well with the kind of immersive 3D version of that,” Zuckerberg said during the company’s latest earnings call.","Horizon Worlds was originally launched for VR, but the company now plans to compete more directly with platforms like Roblox and Fortnite that offer user- generated experiences on smartphones.

To have more headcount is still more positive than negative. What we see is some of the skills that the individuals will have, even as they enter the workforce or over time, will give them more specialisation,"" he said.On criticism about how the Indian IT services industry has not given back enough to the startup ecosystem, Parekh said, ""Infosys has an innovation fund in which we actually invest a lot. We could always do more, but the startup ecosystem focus is very broad, whereas Infosys has a narrow focus, to work with its global clients. Wherever there is an overlap, there's a tremendous amount of work going on. We've made some investments in data analytics work, healthcare work and so on. ""On Infosys' AI strategy, CEO Parekh said, ""We are building agents for clients using the foundational models. At the AI day, we had about 10 or 12 client examples that were shown. These weren’t pilots but large-scale projects. There is significant activity in this space, and clients want to work with a trusted partner who can guide them. That is a major component of our AI strategy. Another is a process where, if you have a customer service process (we help) you change the process using agents and, reducing the time, increase the quality and so on. Then we have legacy modernisation, since there are a lot of companies where technology is old. So, to me, there’s a huge opportunity out there that we see in AI services.""","Infosys CEO Salil Parekh spoke about the impact of AI tools on the core business of IT services companies like Infosys. He said that the business environment in the US looks a lot more positive than it was 12 months ago.

Common methods of used to infect ATMs

How ATM malware works

What are the Physical Indicators of an infected ATM

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has released a flash to disseminate indicators of compromise (IOCs) and technical details associated with malware enabled ATM jackpotting. Threat actors exploitphysical and software vulnerabilities in ATMs and deploy malware to dispense cash without a legitimate transaction. The FBI has observed an increase in ATM jackpotting incidents across the United States. Out of 1,900 ATM jackpotting incidents reported since 2020, over 700 of them with more than $20 million in losses occurred in 2025 alone. This FLASH is being provided to encourage organizations to implement the recommended mitigation steps and to outline the information requested from the public.Threat actors are deploying ATM jackpotting malware, including the Ploutus family malware, to infect ATMs and force them to dispense cash. Ploutus malware exploits the eXtensions for Financial Services (XFS), the layer of software that instructs an ATM what to physically do. When a legitimate transaction occurs, the ATM application sends instructions through XFS for bank authorization. If a threat actor can issue their own commands to XFS, they can bypass bank authorization entirely and instruct the ATM to dispense cash on demand.As a result, Ploutus allows threat actors to force an ATM to dispense cash without using a bank card, customer account, or bank authorization. Once Ploutus is installed on an ATM, it gives threat actors direct control over the machine, allowing them to trigger cash withdrawals. Ploutus attacks the ATM itself rather than customer accounts, enabling fast cash-out operations that can occur in minutes and are often difficult to detect until after the money is withdrawn.After gaining access to ATMs, most often by opening an ATM face with widely available generic keys, ATM jackpotting threat actors have used several main methods to deploy malware:• Criminals remove the ATM’s hard drive, connect it to their computer, copy the malware to the hard drive, return the hard drive to the ATM, and reboot the ATM.• Criminals remove the ATM’s hard drive, replace it with a foreign hard drive or other external device with preloaded malware, and reboot the ATM.The malware interacts directly with the ATM hardware, bypassing any communications or security of the original ATM software. The malware does not require connection to an actual bank customer account todispense cash. The malware can be used across ATMs of different manufacturers with very little adjustment to the code as the Windows operating system is exploited during the compromise.* ATM door open alerts outside of planned maintenance schedule* Low/No cash indicators outside of expected use schedule* Unauthorized devices plugged into the ATM* Removal of hard drives from ATMs* ATM unexpectedly out of service","Threat actors are deploying ATM jackpotting malware, including the Ploutus family malware, to infect ATMs and force them to dispense cash.

Renewed UFO debate fuels online speculation

A social media post by conservative commentator Candace Owens has resurfaced after former US president Donald Trump said he would direct federal agencies to begin identifying and releasing government files related to aliens and unidentified flying objects. The older clip, in which Owens suggested that technology figures including Elon Musk , Peter Thiel and Sam Altman were “not human”, has circulated widely across X in recent days. The renewed attention follows Trump’s statement on Truth Social that his administration would move to release material concerning extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena and UFOs, citing strong public interest. The convergence of those events has drawn fresh online debate and speculation.Trump wrote on Truth Social that he would direct the Secretary of War and other departments to begin the process of identifying and releasing files linked to alien and extraterrestrial life, as well as unidentified aerial phenomena and UFOs. He said the move was based on what he described as tremendous public interest. Later remarks repeated that federal agencies would start reviewing material for release.Interest in UFOs has grown in recent years, particularly after US authorities examined reports of unusual aircraft sightings. Officials have said some incidents remain unexplained, though no confirmed evidence of extraterrestrial origin has been presented.Against that backdrop, an older video of Owens has gained new traction. In the clip, she speculated that prominent technology leaders were not human and claimed there was “something wrong”.The remarks were made in a broader discussion about artificial intelligence and rapid advances in technology. At the time, the comments were criticised by some online users as conspiratorial. They have now reappeared in feeds alongside Trump’s announcement. Neither Musk nor Altman has responded to the revived claims. Both have previously spoken publicly about artificial intelligence risks and future technologies, but not in connection with alien life.Online interest in UAP and UFO disclosures has ebbed and flowed for decades. Recent congressional hearings and declassified reports have kept the topic in public view. The latest announcement appears to have stirred that interest again. For now, the focus remains on what, if anything, will be released.","Candace Owens suggested technology figures including Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Sam Altman were ‘not human’ The older clip has circulated widely across X in recent days.

Palliser highlights Toto's advanced ceramics, crucial for memory chip manufacturing, contributing significantly to profits. The fund urges better disclosure and capital allocation to unlock the company's undervalued potential in the booming AI sector.

Toto’s ceramics are built for the kind of extreme cold that advanced chip-making demands

Shares are up 60% in a year, but Palliser sees another 55% upside

Palliser has been pushing hard across corporate Japan

UK-based activist investor Palliser Capital has taken a significant stake in Japan’s Toto—the company best known for heated toilet seats and Washlet bidets—calling it “the most undervalued and overlooked AI memory beneficiary. ” The fund sent a letter to Toto’s board last week, urging the company to do a better job of showcasing its advanced ceramics business, which quietly contributes over 40% of operating profit.At the heart of Palliser’s argument are electrostatic chucks (ESCs)—precision ceramic components that hold silicon wafers in place during memory chip manufacturing. Toto has been making these since the 1980s, drawing on decades of ceramics know-how that originally came from building toilets. But it’s only in recent years, with AI-driven demand sending memory chip prices through the roof, that this side of the business has started pulling serious weight.The company’s ESCs are engineered to stay stable at very low temperatures, making them essential for cryogenic etching—a process used to carve ultra-deep channels in 3D NAND chips that are now stacked over 200 layers high. As memory architectures get more complex, the need for components like Toto’s only grows.The chucks combine cold-resistant ceramics with integrated heaters and cooling channels to maintain uniform wafer temperatures even under intense plasma and vacuum conditions.Palliser, now among Toto’s top 20 shareholders, believes the company holds a five-year competitive moat before rivals can catch up. The fund projects 30% or more revenue growth for the ceramics segment over the next two years, fuelled by the ongoing NAND upgrade cycle.Toto’s stock has already climbed sharply—up over 60% in the past year and nearly 40% in 2026 alone. Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “buy” last month, pointing to profit growth potential from expanding AI data centre investments. Still, Palliser argues the market hasn’t fully caught on, estimating a valuation gap of roughly ¥554 billion ($3.6 billion). The fund says fixing disclosure, tightening capital allocation, and putting Toto’s ¥76 billion ($496 million) net cash to better use could unlock that value.Founded by former Elliott Management executive James Smith , Palliser has become a key player in Japan’s shareholder activism wave. Its other stakes include property firm Tokyo Tatemono, Keisei Electric Railway, and Japan Post Holdings. The fund bought into Toto roughly six months ago and isn’t just asking for better storytelling—it wants more investment directed toward the high-margin ceramics unit rather than the slower-growing bathroom business. When a toilet maker is being pitched as critical AI infrastructure, it’s a sign the boom is reshaping supply chain thinking in ways few saw coming.","Activist investor Palliser Capital is championing Toto, the Japanese toilet maker, as a hidden AI gem.

What Yann LeCun said about the gap between AI and real-world intelligence



""mental models""

Former Meta AI scientist and one of the godfathers of modern artificial intelligence (AI), Yann LeCun, has revealed another task in which humans can beat the technology. Speaking at the India AI Impact Summit 2026, he said that large language models, whilestill fall short on tasks like driving that humans can handle with relative ease. LeCun acknowledged that AI systems can pass the bar exam and perform well in Maths Olympiads but said a more fundamental gap remains, noting that the technology still lags behind real-world intelligence.he said, highlighting thatLeCun explained that AI excels at information retrieval and symbolic reasoning but lacks a true understanding of the physical world. He compared large language models to an evolution of the printing press, libraries and the internet.he added.LeCun said that humans and animals learn through observation and interaction, gradually formingthat help predict outcomes and adjust to new situations.He also stated that, unlike human learning, AI systems are not yet able to function properly in complex, unpredictable environments, which limits the potential of robots and autonomous cars compared to human learning.Speaking about the use of AI in education and development, LeCun described AI as a technology meant to assist, not replace, human capabilities. According to him, AI has the potential to enhance human intelligence and expand access to knowledge, much as the printing press did in the past.He also noted that countries with younger, educated populations, including India and several regions of Africa, may play a larger role in AI innovation if investments are made in skills development and infrastructure.LeCun, a professor at New York University and the executive chairman of AMI Labs, works in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics and is also an ACM Turing Award laureate.He also recently publicly questioned OpenAI’s claims about achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) following a social media exchange with OpenAI vice president Sebastien Bubeck. The discussion, which took place on X (formerly Twitter), reflected differing views on research transparency and whether a single company could develop AGI.LeCun criticised OpenAI’s research practices for being conducted largely behind closed doors and rejected the notion that AGI would emerge from one organisation or a single breakthrough, stating that OpenAI does not have a monopoly on innovation.","Yann LeCun said that large language models fall short on tasks that humans can handle with relative ease.

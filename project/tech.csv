NFL streaming schedule on Netflix

What make NFL streaming on Netflix BIG

Netflix is reportedly pulling out all the stops for its two Christmas Day NFL games, including a pre-game performance by Mariah Carey singing ""All I Want for Christmas is You."" According to a report by news agency AP, however, there is anxiety. For, the steaming giant recognizes that technical difficulties could ruin the experience. As Netflix executive Brandon Riegg, VP of nonfiction series and sports, told AP, that the memory of the streaming issues encountered during the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight on November 14 is mit fresh.Riegg, while addressing the concerns about Netflix's readiness for a potentially record-breaking viewership, added with a caution that the sheer volume of viewers for the fight overwhelmed the system, despite extensive pre-event testing. While acknowledging the issues experienced by some viewers, Riegg emphasized that the event served as a crucial stress test, leading to numerous system improvements.""The sheer tonnage of people that came to watch was incredible. And for all the testing that the engineering team had done ahead of that, and I think they’re the best in the business, the only way to test something of that magnitude is to have something of that magnitude,” Riegg said. “We never want to have technical issues or a disappointing experience for our members. There was a subset of people that were watching that struggled with that and we acknowledge that. The good news is they stress-tested the system to such a degree that there’s a lot of these fixes and improvements that they realized that they could make, and they’re applying all that stuff.”Netflix will stream two games on Christmas Day: the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Kansas City Chiefs, preceded by a two-hour pregame show starting at 11 a.m. EST, and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans at 4:30 p.m. EST. These games will be available to Netflix's 282.3 million subscribers in over 190 countries, marking the first global distribution of an NFL game by a single outlet. This marks the first year of a three-year deal, with Netflix also streaming one game each in 2025 and 2026, at a cost of $150 million for this year's package. While a full season package doesn't align with Netflix's strategy, the Christmas Day games presented a unique opportunity.This move signals Netflix's broader ambition to become a major destination for sports fans, evidenced by its recent acquisition of U.S. rights for the 2027 and 2031 FIFA Women’s World Cup and its upcoming partnership with WWE, beginning January 6th with ""Monday Night Raw.""The Tyson-Paul fight drew a global audience of 60 million, peaking at 65 million concurrent streams (38 million in the U.S.). However, Down Detector reported nearly 85,000 viewer complaints of outages and streaming problems leading up to the fight. This contrasts with previous benchmarks for streamed NFL games: 23 million viewers on Peacock for last season's AFC wild card game and 17.3 million on Amazon Prime Video for a regular-season game.The NFL's decision to schedule games on Christmas, despite it falling on a Wednesday, is reportedly driven by the potential for increased viewership. Last year's three Christmas games averaged 28.68 million viewers. The league approved two Christmas games in March, prompting Netflix's interest. Their existing relationship with the NFL through series like ""Quarterback"" and ""Receiver"" facilitated the deal.","Netflix will stream two games on Christmas Day: the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Kansas City Chiefs, preceded by a two-hour pregame show.

KV Kamath, Chairman of Jio Financial Services , shared a word of caution for fintech companies. Speaking with Kunal Shah , Founder of CRED at the recent at the Moneycontrol Fintech Conclave, Kamath said that many fintechs are ""burning money without understanding when to stop"". He warned that what fintechs need to realise is that there is no clear endgame in sight for these companies. ""They could have actually stopped the burn despite growing well,"" he added, stressing on the importance of financial prudence.Nithin Kamath emphasized the accelerating pace of change in the financial sector, driven by customers' increasing demand for convenience. He observed that both established and emerging companies need to be ready for disruptive forces that are reshaping the landscape.Kamath also critiqued the tech industry's over-hiring, particularly among fintechs, where he noted an overemphasis on engineering talent without sufficient business acumen. ""They need to understand business too,"" he stated.Comparing India to China, Kamath highlighted the disparity in technology's contribution to GDP growth: 35% in China versus less than 5% in India. While acknowledging the importance of India's established software services companies, he asserted that new-age companies hold the key to the future. He predicted significant growth in India's technology sector's GDP contribution within the next 5-7 years. However, Kamath stressed the need for ""new discovery companies in technology, not just consumer internet companies,"" urging innovation beyond the consumer tech space.Kamath also stressed that transformation is achievable with the right mindset. He advocated for embedding technology within core business operations, creating a ""transformational organization"" where every employee understands technology's role in their daily work.","KV Kamath, Chairman of Jio Financial Services, shared a word of caution for fintech companies.

AI is an opportunity NOT a threat for techies

Tech Mahindra CEO Mohit Joshi aims to significantly boost the company's banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) business to close the gap with larger rivals who have traditionally generated more revenue from this profitable sector.Joshi, who joined India's fifth-largest software services exporter in December 2023 after a long tenure at Infosys,This compares to some competitors in the $254 billion Indian IT industry who already derive as much as a third of their revenue from BFSI.""We still have a lot of room to catch up,"" stated Joshi, whose background includes banking roles at ABN Amro and ANZ before his time at Infosys. He anticipates organic growth in Tech Mahindra's BFSI revenue share.Historically, Tech Mahindra has leaned heavily on telecom clients for revenue. However, Joshi intends to leverage his expertise in financial services to shift this focus and drive the company's turnaround.""BFSI is the single largest spender from a tech services perspective. It's very important for us to play aggressively in this space. Large banks typically spend over $10 billion a year in terms of technology,"" Joshi explained.Tech Mahindra, which has underperformed its peers in revenue and profit, will concentrate on core banking, payments, asset and wealth management, custodian services, and insurance. Joshi has already strengthened the company's BFSI leadership team.Regarding generative AI , Joshi believes it presents an opportunity rather than a threat. ""GenAI is the best spokesperson for why we need more money to be spent on technology,"" he said, dismissing the idea that it signals the end for software developers. ""I do feel that the overall demand for developers is not going to reduce, because there is a lot more work to be done candidly than there are people just now.""He also downplayed concerns about generative AI replacing customer service roles at Tech Mahindra. ""I'm very skeptical about whether we'll see a wholesale replacement of contact centers with GenAI because when it comes to critical issues, people prefer to speak with human beings.""","Tech Mahindra CEO Mohit Joshi aims to significantly boost the company's banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) business.

Terror attacks in Germany

On Friday evening, December 21, a driver rammed a car into a large crowd of revellers at a Christmas market in central Germany, killing 5 people and injuring more than 200. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that nearly 40 of them ""are so seriously injured that we must be very worried about them.”As the news of the attack broke, Musk called for the resignation of the German chancellor Olaf Scholz. ""Scholz should resign immediately,"" Musk posted on X, adding: ""Incompetent fool."" Elon Musk shared the Twitter profile of the German Christmas market attacker identified as Taleb Abdul Jawad . ""Important thread to understand the magnitude of failure by the German government,"" wrote Musk as he shared a long thread on the attacker. The long Twitter thread shared by Musk claims that how in early 2006: 'Taleb Abdulmohsen' fled Saudi Arabia after being accused of rape and implicated in serious crimes. Jawad's Twitter account has been deleted.The 10-tweets-long thread goes on to add how the German government ignored/rejected the extradition requests of the Saudi Arabia government.Musk wrote in another tweet, ""Yeah, he was obviously a lunatic who should never have been allowed to enter Germany and should have been extradited when Saudi Arabia made the request. Suicidal empathy by the German government.""The Tesla CEO also shared a post that claimed that a ""Saudi girl living in #Germany reported to the German police in September 2023 about the danger of a man called Talib Abd AlMohsen, who was planning to run people over with his car. The German police ignored the report and acted in a stupid bureaucratic manner,"" it said.He added that whoever in Germany failed to listen to the extradition request of the German government needs to ""punished severely"". ""Wow, this is insane. Whoever refused to extradite a murderer deserves to be punished severely!""Germany has suffered a string of extremist attacks in recent years, including a knife attack that killed three people and wounded eight at a festival in the western city of Solingen in August.The Magdeburg attack came eight years and a day after a jihadist attack in Berlin in which a Tunisian man committed to the Islamic State group rammed a truck through the capital's Christmas market, claiming 13 lives.According to an AFP report, ""verified bystander footage distributed by the German news agency dpa showed the suspect’s arrest at a tram stop in the middle of the road.

US to ban this Chinese technology company for 'helping' Huawei,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-to-ban-this-chinese-technology-company-for-helping-huawei/articleshow/116534056.cms,"The US government is reportedly preparing to blacklist Chinese company Sophgo. According to an exclusive report in Reuters, US is set to ban Sophgo after a TSMC-made chip ordered by Sophgo was found inside a Huawei artificial intelligence processor, the Ascend 910B . This discovery suggests Sophgo illegally supplied the chip to Huawei.The chip was identified by TechInsights during a teardown of the Ascend 910B. They alerted TSMC, who then notified US authorities. TSMC subsequently suspended shipments to Sophgo after confirming the chip matched Sophgo's design.Sophgo, affiliated with bitcoin mining equipment supplier Bitmain , will be added to the Entity List, restricting U.S. exports to the company. This action follows the Commerce Department's recent addition of other companies linked to Huawei's network to the restricted trade list.Despite Sophgo's October statement denying any business relationship with Huawei, evidence suggests otherwise. Reuters' review of tenders revealed Sophgo as a supplier to Chinese local governments and state-owned firms, including China Telecom. Further, tenders showed that over the past two years, Sophgo and Bitmain AI chips were purchased by Chinese state-run universities and police stations.The connection between Sophgo and Bitmain is further strengthened by co-founder Micree Zhan's involvement in both companies. Zhan indirectly owns a significant portion of Sophgo through an investment vehicle. Sophgo even used a Bitmain email address in communications with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in 2023. While Bitmain has denied involvement in the supply chain investigation, these connections raise questions.This incident highlights Huawei's continued pursuit of advanced AI chip technology despite U.S. restrictions. The Ascend 910B is considered the most advanced AI chip from a Chinese company, and Huawei plans to begin mass production of its successor, the Ascend 910C, in early 2025.TSMC has stated it has not supplied Huawei since 2020 and confirmed it alerted both Taiwanese and U.S. authorities about the discovered chip, launching a detailed investigation. A recent U.S. order also restricts TSMC from shipping advanced chips (7-nanometer or more advanced) to China if they could be used for AI applications.","Sophgo, affiliated with bitcoin mining equipment supplier Bitmain, will be added to the Entity List, restricting U.S. exports to the company.

World's richest man Elon Musk has slammed the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for the Christmas market in central Germany on Friday evening, December 20. The car driver rammed the vehicle into a large crowd of revellers killing at least two people and injuring more than 60 before he was arrested.

In one of the first tweets on the incident, Musk wrote: ""Deliberate mass murder"". He responded to a video posted on social media from a position above the market that shows a car driving at speed through a crowd walking between two rows of market stalls. People can be seen knocked to the ground and running away.Later responding to a post claiming that the German government refused to extradite the perpetrator of the Christmas market attack despite requests from the Saudi government, citing human rights concerns; Musk wrote ""Wow, this is insane. Whoever refused to extradite a murderer deserves to be punished severely!""Reiner Haseloff, premier of the state of Saxony-Anhalt said that the attacker was a 50-year-old male doctor from Saudi Arabia with permanent residency in Germany, where he had lived for almost two decades. The motive was unclear. The suspect was not known to German authorities as an Islamist, according to local broadcaster MDR. Eight years ago, Anis Amri, a Tunisian asylum seeker with Islamist links, reportedly rammed a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring dozens of others.According to German authorities the death toll could rise given the severity of some of the injuries.","World's richest man Elon Musk has slammed the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for the Christmas market attack.

NPCI issues an advisory about 'online scams' that Indians are losing crores to,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/npci-warns-phonepe-gpay-and-other-upi-users-about-scam-that-indians-are-losing-crores-to/articleshow/116352174.cms,"What NPCI advisory says

What is digital arrest scam



How to identify a digital arrest scam

Unexpected Contact from ‘Officials’: Be cautious if someone claims to be from government agencies like the police, CBI, income tax officers, or customs agents, contacts you. Be cautious especially if they claim urgent legal action is being initiated or warranted. They might allege that you or one of your family members is involved in a serious crime like money laundering, tax evasion, or drug trafficking.

Fear-based language and urgency: Scammers may request video calls, disguising themselves in police uniforms, using government logos, or creating official-sounding background noise to appear legitimate. They often threaten arrest or immediate legal action, demanding a quick response and using legal terms to sound convincing. In some cases, they create a police station-like set up to further convince victims of their credibility.

Request for sensitive information or payment: Scammers may ask for personal information or demand large sums of money, promising that this will clear up your involvement in the alleged crime. They may also coerce you to transfer money to their account until the investigation is complete. Terms like “clearing your name”, “assisting with the investigation”, or “refundable security deposit/escrow account” might be used by them to persuade you into transferring money to specified bank accounts or UPI IDs.

Tips to stay safe

Pause and Verify: If you receive unexpected calls or messages about legal issues, take a moment to verify. Stay calm, as scammers rely on fear and urgency. Real government and law enforcement agencies will never ask for money or investigate cases through phone or video calls. Always confirm the caller’s identity and consult trusted sources before taking any action.

Use Support Channels: Report suspicious numbers to the national cybercrime helpline by dialing 1930 or the Department of Telecommunication (https://sancharsaathi.gov.in/sfc/).

The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country. As digital payments, including UPI, gain widespread adoption, incidents of online scams have risen significantly. Indians, as mentioned by PM Modi in one of the episodes of Mann ki Baat have lost Rs 120.3 crore through digital arrest scam s. In its advisory, the NPCI highlights the critical need for awareness and vigilance to protect against such fraudulent activities as India advances towards a digital-first economy.In a press release, NPCI says “Digital payments are now accessible nationwide, driving India towards a digital-first economy. They offer both security and convenience. However, it's crucial to use digital payments safely and avoid online scams. Early identification of potential scams helps protect you and your loved ones, fostering a safer, less-cash economy, for everyone.”The 'Digital Arrest' scam is a type of online fraud where cybercriminals trick individuals into believing they are under investigation or at risk of arrest by law enforcement or financial authorities. Scammers often impersonate government officials, police officers, or financial regulators and use fear tactics to manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information or transferring money. Some of the common tactics used in the scam include fake calls or messages, threat of arrest and demand for payment.As per NPCI, you can identify a digital arrest scam by keeping an eye for the following","The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

AT&T's Chief Technology Officer Jeremy Legg has informed US-based technology employees that they won't have guaranteed seating when the company enforces its five-day office return policy , despite making in-person attendance mandatory. In a detailed memo, Legg stated the company ""will not offer one-for-one seating per employee"" as they transition from hybrid to full-time office work.The new policy, affecting approximately 10,000 AT&T Technology Services (ATS) employees, will roll out in phases starting January 6, 2025. According to Business Insider, the workspace shortage is already causing problems, with employees resorting to working from hallways and cafeterias to comply with attendance tracking requirements.The situation appears particularly dire in some locations, with one employee reporting that their office has only 150 desks available for more than 1,200 assigned workers. The telecommunications giant is currently constructing additional space in Atlanta and Dallas to address these constraints.Business Insider reports that the implementation timeline varies by management level and location. Senior leaders (level 4 and above) must return full-time by January 6, followed by level 3 managers on February 3, and remaining employees by March 3, 2025. However, employees in Atlanta and Alpharetta may face delays until April-June 2025 as construction continues.Despite acknowledging the space limitations, Legg emphasized the company's commitment to in-person work, stating, ""We firmly believe that working together, in person and in proximity to our peers, is the best way for ATS employees to fulfill that purpose.""The memo indicates some flexibility will be permitted for travel, vacations, and other circumstances, with leaders working to accommodate occasional remote work needs. AT&T plans to monitor office capacity through presence dashboards and make adjustments as needed.The company has established a dedicated SharePoint site for transition updates and neighborhood assignments, though the actual logistics of managing thousands of employees with limited seating remain unclear.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates has this ‘tip’ from his childhood for parents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-founder-bill-gates-has-this-tip-from-his-childhood-for-parents/articleshow/116522441.cms,"What Bill Gates said about his childhood

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes that the constant distractions of smartphones and social media would have hindered his path to becoming a billionaire. In a recent blog post, Gates reflected on his childhood which was marked by significant periods of unstructured time spent reading and thinking. He believes this developed his ability to focus and delve into deep thought which was crucial to his success. Gates referred to Jonathan Haidt’s The Anxious Generation and questioned whether the existing technology-driven environment wouldn’t have allowed him to develop these habits. He even highlighted that excessive screen time, particularly on social media, has been linked to a surge in mental health issues among teenagers which includes anxiety, depression, eating disorders, self-harm, and decreased self-esteem.In the blog post, Gates said:“My childhood was marked by remarkable freedom—something that might surprise people who assume I spent all day glued to a computer indoors. I went hiking on trails that would terrify today’s parents, explored endlessly with neighbourhood friends, and ran around Washington D.C. during my time as a Senate page. When I was in high school, Paul Allen and I even lived on our own for a few months in Vancouver, Washington, while working as programmers at a power company. My parents didn’t know where I was half the time, and that was normal back then. While I got hurt on some of these adventures and got in trouble on many others, these experiences were more beneficial than bad. They taught me resilience, independence, and judgment in ways that no amount of supervised, structured activity could replicate.It wasn’t all fun and games, but I had what Haidt calls a play-based childhood. Now, a phone-based childhood is much more common—a shift that predated the pandemic but solidified when screens became important tools for learning and socialising. The irony is that parents these days are overprotective in the physical world and strangely hands-off in the digital one, letting kids live life online largely without supervision.”","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes that constant distractions of smartphones and social media would have hindered his path to becoming a billionaire.

"Canada Express Entry: How new rules will impact engineers, technicians and others seeking permanent residency in the country",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/canada-express-entry-how-new-rules-will-impact-engineers-technicians-and-others-seeking-permanent-residency-in-the-country/articleshow/116510510.cms,"What is changing

Canada revises immigration rules

Canada has announced new rules for Express Entry workers seeking permanent residency in the country. The candidates, including Indian engineers, technicians and other IT workers, are likely to be impacted by the recently-announced changes in the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS).According to the new rules, IT workers applying for Canadian PR will no longer receive the extra CRS points they used to get for having a job offer backed by an LMIA (Labour Market Impact Assessment) – a document that allows Canadian employers to hire foreign workers legally. It is required when an employer is unable to find a Canadian citizen or permanent resident to fill a position.This means that professionals will need to achieve a higher CRS score based on other factors.Previously, Express Entry candidates with LMIA-backed job offers received a significant boost to their Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score – an extra 50 or 200 points, depending on the job offer. These bonus points provided an edge to LMIA candidates in being the deciding factor in receiving an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residency and not being invited at all.With the changes, that is, without the extra points from LMIA-backed job offers, some candidates who relied on those points to reach the required CRS score in Express Entry draws may find it tougher to get an Invitation to Apply (ITA). This may lead to increased competition among candidates whose profiles are assessed only on factors like age, education and language skills.Notably, it is unclear when these changes will come into effect.The development comes about 15 days after Canada unveiled significant changes to its immigration policies. The Trudeau government introduced reductions in the number of both permanent and temporary residents entering Canada over the next three years. These changes are part of plans aimed at addressing Canada's housing, healthcare and infrastructure challenges.","Canada has announced new rules for Express Entry workers seeking permanent residency in the country.

As artificial intelligence (AI) takes center stage in the technology world, Ukraine finds itself in possession of a valuable asset: millions of hours of drone footage that can be used to train AI models for battlefield decision-making.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Ukraine has amassed a vast trove of battlefield data (videos) through its extensive use of drones. The claims come as the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia has seen both sides deploy AI to identify targets and analyse images with speed faster than humans.Oleksandr Dmitriev, founder of the OCHI system – which centralises and analyses drone footage from over 15,000 frontline crews – revealed that his system has collected over 2 million hours of video since 2022 – which is roughly equivalent to 228 years of footage, the report said.According to Dmitriev, the footage can be used to train AI models in combat tactics and other aspects of warfare.“This is food for the AI. If you want to teach an AI, you give it 2 million hours (of video), it will become something supernatural,” Dmitriev was quoted as saying.Dmitriev said AI models can be trained to identify combat tactics, target identification and weapons effectiveness assessment. Additionally, by analysing the trajectories and angles at which weapons are most effective, AI can provide valuable insights for optimising military strategies.“It is essentially [an] experience which can be turned into mathematics,” he said.Reuters also said that Ukraine’s defence ministry has developed another system, called Avengers , that centralises and collects video from drones and CCTV.",Ukraine has amassed a vast trove of battlefield data (videos) through its extensive use of drones.

CKYC wants to prevent unauthorised usage of your KYC data

The Indian government has taken steps to enhance the security of Know Your Customer (KYC) data. To prevent misuse, they have proposed masking sensitive KYC identifiers like PAN, Aadhaar, Voter ID, and Driving License numbers. Previously scheduled for a December deadline, authorities have granted an extension until January 20, 2025. This additional time allows individuals to complete the KYC process for various financial institutions and services. This extension provides additional time for financial institutions to adapt to the new requirements and ensure a smooth transition.“In view of requests received from various Reporting Entities, it has been decided to defer the date of go live for masking of KYC Identifier from December 16, 2024, after 08:00 PM to January 20, 2025, after 8:00 PM,” as per an official communique from Central KYC Records Registry dated December 16, 2024.The new system, scheduled to be implemented on January 20, 2025, will mask sensitive information in KYC documents. Only the last four digits of identifiers like Aadhaar, PAN, Voter ID, and Driving License numbers will be visible. This measure aims to strengthen data privacy and security.The Central KYC Records Registry (CKYCRR) has outlined the process for the new masked KYC system. Starting January 20, 2025, registered reporting entities (REs) will only be able to view the last four digits of KYC identifiers like Aadhaar, PAN, Voter ID, and Driving License. To access full KYC records, REs will need to authenticate themselves and download the record using either the masked KYC identifier or a unique CKYC reference ID. This two-factor authentication system aims to enhance data security and prevent unauthorised access.The Central KYC Records Registry (CKYCRR) is implementing a new security measure to safeguard user data. This measure involves restricting access to KYC information based on unique IP addresses. The goal is to prevent unauthorized access and misuse of sensitive data.Previously, regulated entities (REs) often outsourced KYC collection to third-party service providers. These intermediaries would access KYC data using their own IP addresses. To enhance security, the CKYCRR now mandates that REs directly access the KYC data using their own IP addresses. This change aims to limit access to authorized personnel only.The deadline for implementing this new system is December 31, 2024. REs are expected to make the necessary adjustments to comply with this requirement.","The Central KYC Records Registry (CKYCRR) is implementing a new security measure to safeguard user data.

What the company said

Popular Indian bike-taxi app Rapido is facing scrutiny after a data breach exposed sensitive user and driver information online. The data leak, discovered by TechCrunch, highlights potential security vulnerabilities within the app.The data breach was identified by security researcher Renganathan P. The vulnerability was found in a feedback form designed for Rapido's auto-rickshaw users and drivers. This form exposed sensitive information, including full names, email addresses, and phone numbers of individuals. TechCrunch has confirmed the authenticity of this leaked data based on the details shared by the researcher.The researcher informed TechCrunch that the exposed data originated from one of Rapido's APIs. This API was designed to collect feedback from the form and transmit it to a third-party service used by the company. TechCrunch independently verified the vulnerability by submitting a test message through the feedback form. The message quickly appeared as a record in the exposed portal, confirming the breach.“This could have led to a big scam involving scammers or hackers, who may have ended up calling drivers and performing a large-scale social engineering attack, or simply these phone numbers and other data could have been exposed on the dark web if reached in the wrong hands,” the researcher told TechCrunch.Following TechCrunch's notification of the data breach, Rapido promptly took action to secure the exposed portal by setting it to private. “As a standard operating procedure, we are in the process of soliciting valuable feedback from our stakeholder community on our services. While this is being managed by external parties, we have come to understand that the survey links have reached some unintended users from the public,” Rapido CEO Aravind Sanka said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch.In light of the news, Rapido users are advised to be cautious of any suspicious emails, calls, or text messages. Implementing strong passwords and monitoring accounts for unusual activity are additional security measures.","Indian bike-taxi app Rapido is facing scrutiny after a data breach exposed sensitive user and driver information online.

Putin warns Youtube of rising competition

Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Google and YouTube of political manipulation and deliberately slowing down service in Russia. Putin made the comments during his annual phone-in with the Russian public. According to a report in Reuters, the Russian President said that Google acts as a tool of the US government and that YouTube's reduced speeds are due to the company's failure to upgrade equipment in Russia.This accusation comes amidst ongoing pressure from Russia on foreign tech companies regarding content distribution. While Russia has blocked other social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, it has hesitated to ban YouTube, which boasts approximately 50 million daily users in Russia.Critics argue that the disruptions to YouTube are intentional, aimed at limiting access to content critical of Putin and his government. Russia, however, insists the issues stem from Google's alleged underinvestment in Russian infrastructure, a claim disputed by Google and tech experts. Putin reiterated this stance, stating Google's reduced spending and equipment supply in Russia have created the problems. He further demanded that Google and YouTube adhere to Russian laws and refrain from using the internet for political ends.Google has not yet commented on these latest accusations. YouTube previously acknowledged access issues in Russia but denied any responsibility, attributing the problems to external factors.Putin also highlighted the growth of domestic alternatives like VK Video , RuTube, and Telegram, though these platforms have yet to significantly challenge YouTube's dominance in the Russian market.Beyond content disagreements, YouTube has blocked over 1,000 Russian state-sponsored news channels and more than 5.5 million videos since the start of the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin's strategy appears to involve accumulating substantial legal claims against Google, hoping to force compliance.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Google and YouTube of political manipulation and deliberately slowing down service in Russia.

The restructuring took place over the past two years.Google's move echoes Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's recent directive to eliminate ""pre-meetings for pre-meetings"" and increase individual contributors by 15% by the first quarter of 2025.

Nikhil Kamath is a name that resonates strongly within the Indian business ecosystem. As the co-founder of Zerodha , one of India’s largest stockbroking firms, Kamath has carved out a significant space for himself in the competitive world of finance. At just 38 years old, Kamath has already achieved what many would consider the pinnacle of success, becoming one of the youngest billionaires in the country. However, his journey is anything but conventional. Kamath’s entrepreneurial spirit and business acumen were evident from an early age, even as he struggled to conform to the rigid structures of formal education. In a recent conversation with LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky, Kamath shared fascinating insights into his early life, including his first entrepreneurial venture and how his unique path shaped his future endeavors.Nikhil Kamath’s entrepreneurial journey began much earlier than most people realize. While still in the 9th grade, Kamath embarked on his first business venture, driven by curiosity and a knack for identifying opportunities. He managed to acquire a cellphone, which he then sold for a profit. Encouraged by this initial success, Kamath reinvested the proceeds into purchasing more phones, effectively establishing a small-scale trading operation.This venture was going smoothly until his mother discovered his activities. Unhappy with her son’s sideline hustle, she intervened in a dramatic fashion—by flushing the phones down the toilet. While this marked the abrupt end of Kamath’s teenage entrepreneurial endeavor, it was a clear precursor to the innovative and determined mindset that would define his later career.During his conversation with Ryan Roslansky, Nikhil Kamath candidly admitted that he had a tumultuous relationship with formal education. ""I hated school. Always did,"" he stated, reflecting on his years as a student. Kamath’s disdain for traditional schooling was deeply rooted in his rebellious nature. “I was that one rebellious child who wanted to do the opposite of everything someone told him to do,” he said. By the time he was 15 or 16 years old, Kamath had stopped attending school altogether, setting the stage for an unconventional journey toward success.Despite his aversion to the classroom, Kamath’s early years were marked by a keen interest in exploring opportunities beyond the confines of academic learning. Dropping out of school came with its challenges, including feelings of insecurity. ""I was a fairly insecure young boy because my classmates of the time were in college,” he admitted. To compensate for this, Kamath developed a habit of voracious reading, consuming anything he could get his hands on to broaden his knowledge and skill set.Years after his early business experiment, Nikhil Kamath’s entrepreneurial streak found its ultimate expression in Zerodha. Co-founded with his brother Nithin Kamath, Zerodha was launched to address inefficiencies in India’s stockbroking industry. The company disrupted the market with its transparent pricing model and user-friendly online platform, quickly gaining traction among retail investors.Zerodha’s rise to prominence was fueled by the Kamath brothers’ focus on leveraging technology to simplify trading for everyday investors. Under Nikhil’s leadership, the company has not only grown into India’s largest stockbroker by active clients but has also set benchmarks for profitability and customer satisfaction in the industry.Although Nikhil Kamath’s decision to leave school eventually led to great success, he does not shy away from acknowledging the difficulties it entailed. “Dropping out of school and not pursuing formal higher education had its drawbacks,” he shared during his discussion with Roslansky. For Kamath, the absence of a structured educational framework meant that he had to work harder to gain credibility and knowledge.To bridge this gap, Kamath adopted a disciplined approach to self-education. His commitment to continuous learning played a crucial role in building the expertise and confidence necessary for navigating the complexities of the financial world. “Reading extensively allowed me to compensate for my lack of formal education,” he said.Nikhil Kamath’s journey offers valuable lessons for aspiring entrepreneurs. His story underscores the importance of resilience, adaptability, and the willingness to learn outside conventional systems. It highlights that success is not necessarily tied to formal education but rather to one’s ability to identify opportunities, take calculated risks, and persist in the face of challenges.Moreover, Kamath’s experience illustrates the significance of leveraging failures as stepping stones. From having his early business shut down by his mother to overcoming the insecurities associated with being a school dropout, Kamath’s path has been shaped by turning setbacks into growth opportunities.","Nikhil Kamath is the co-founder of Zerodha, one of India's largest stockbroking firms.

Amazon is postponing its mandatory five-day return-to-office policy for thousands of corporate employees due to insufficient workspace, with some delays stretching into May 2025 across multiple US cities.The e-commerce giant has notified staff in at least seven cities – including Austin, Dallas, Phoenix, Atlanta, Nashville, Houston, and New York – that they cannot accommodate full-time office returns starting January 2 as originally planned, according to Bloomberg News.The delay affects an undisclosed portion of Amazon's 350,000 corporate employees worldwide. In Manhattan's Midtown Lord & Taylor building, some employees might not have designated workspace until May, while Dallas-based staff were told to expect delays until March or April.The situation appears to contradict Amazon's initial return-to-office guidance. ""For the vast majority of employees, assigned workspaces will be available by January 2, 2025,"" the internal guidance stated. ""If your assigned workspace isn't ready by January 2, we still expect everyone to begin fully working from the office by that date.""Employees report struggles with the current three-day hybrid model, citing issues with shared desks, overcrowded corporate canteens, and scarce conference rooms for confidential calls or team meetings. ""The company has added a feature to its room reservation tool that requires workers to attest they actually plan to use the space, an apparent effort to crack down on squatters looking for a quiet place to work,"" one employee noted.The space crunch comes three months after CEO Andy Jassy announced the controversial mandate requiring employees to work from office five days per week. The policy has faced resistance from employees who say they've proved their effectiveness while working remotely and prefer flexible arrangements common among tech industry peers.To address immediate space needs, Amazon has leased temporary offices from WeWork in New York and Silicon Valley. The company had previously paused several office development projects during the pandemic, including developments in Bellevue, Nashville, and Arlington, Virginia.An Amazon spokesperson said the delays primarily result from building reconfigurations needed to accommodate full-time office workers, rather than a shortage of available office space.

Nvidia recently fell from second-most valuable company to third. As recently as November, it was the No. 1. Now the No. 1 and No. 2 spot belong to Apple and Microsoft, respectively. While Nvidia stock climbed 2.5% in pre-market trading today, it is still not to its super high levels. While analysts see Nvidia shares in correction mode, there are arrange of factors responsible for this.And of these, one is reported to be a comment of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella . Nadella recently said that the company has ample chip supply, potentially impacting demand for Nvidia's AI chips. In an interview, Nadella stated, ""Power yes...I am not chip supply constrained."" This suggests that Microsoft, a major Nvidia customer, may have overinvested in AI chips during the initial ChatGPT boom.""We bought all over the place,"" Nadella said, acknowledging the aggressive approach taken to meet the surge in demand for AI services. He emphasized that this was a temporary measure and that the situation is now stabilizing.Nvidia's stock price has declined recently, falling 11.34% from its 52-week high. While the company experienced a similar correction earlier this year and subsequently rebounded, concerns remain.Hedge fund manager Doug Kass, who reportedly has a short position on Nvidia, highlighted the potential negative impact of Microsoft's chip surplus. According to a report in Marketwatch, he noted that the initial frenzy of AI chip purchases may have led to overinvestment, and that ongoing demand for these chips may not justify continued rapid growth in the supply chain. “Apparently, they all got caught off guard in the beginning; nobody wanted to be left behind; they had the money and piled in with zero caution with no regard to how much they spent, and what they spent it on. These were also big projects that are now largely completed,” said Kass, adding that the additional power Microsoft needs won’t be cheap either.Kass also expressed concerns about the commercial viability of projects like Microsoft's Copilot, questioning whether the anticipated revenue will materialize. He emphasized that even if end-user demand for AI services is strong, the initial surge in chip purchases will likely be followed by a period of more moderate demand. “Even if there were significant end demand for what these projects were selling, chip demand would have to taper just due to the math of getting the lump sum of projects first and then just followed by what underlying demand allows for. Without booming end demand for the final product, I am not sure how the supply chain can keep growing to the moon.

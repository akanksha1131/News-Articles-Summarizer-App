American startup founders are “almost shameless” in their assertive demands and feedback to AI giant OpenAI , according to Laura Modiano, head of OpenAI’s startups division in EMEA. Speaking at the Sifted Summit this week, Modiano highlighted a stark contrast between U.S. and European entrepreneurs, urging the latter to be more vocal to seize opportunities in the fast-evolving AI landscape. Drawing from her experience working with founders across both regions, Modiano praised American entrepreneurs for their directness.“They come in and say, ‘We need this. You need to improve that,’” she said during a fireside chat. “If founders don’t tell us, we don’t always know.” She encouraged European founders to adopt a similar approach, warning that silence could mean missing out on shaping AI advancements. Modiano pointed to Swedish startup Lovable, valued at $1.8 billion, as a model for effective feedback. The vibe-coding company, which launched its GPT-5-based Lovable Assistant 5 alongside OpenAI’s latest model, provided intensive input during early access. “I was in their office for a week, and every hour we were having reviews,” Modiano recounted, noting that European developers’ feedback directly influenced GPT-5’s development.Another success story is Sana, a Swedish AI-learning platform. Modiano recalled visiting their office, where founders demanded specific voice capabilities, such as tone and speed adjustments. This feedback was cross-referenced with similar requests, leading OpenAI to prioritize those features on its roadmap. “We can only ship what customers tell us they want,” Modiano emphasized, suggesting startups appoint a “chief feedback officer” to ensure their needs are heard.Her comments fuel an ongoing debate about the cultural differences between U.S. and European entrepreneurs. Earlier this year, venture capitalists criticized European founders for lacking the intensity of their American counterparts, with some urging them to adopt a seven-day workweek to compete globally. Harry Stebbings of 20VC previously told CNBC that Europeans often undersell their ambitions, while Americans excel at crafting compelling narratives to pitch their businesses.The critique extends beyond startups. U.K. Business Secretary Peter Kyle recently sparked controversy by claiming British university students lack the entrepreneurial drive of their American peers. Speaking at an Nvidia event in London, Kyle questioned how many U.K. undergraduates attend university with the goal of becoming founders, lamenting a perceived lack of “vigour” in British entrepreneurial culture.Modiano’s call to action is clear: European founders must speak up or risk being left behind in the AI revolution.","Laura Modiano, head of OpenAI’s startups division in EMEA, praised U.S. entrepreneurs for their directness.

“Covered List,”





The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman, Brendan Carr, has confirmed that major US online retail websites have removed several million listings for prohibited Chinese electronics. In an interview with the news agency Reuters, Carr stated that the removed items were either on a US list of barred equipment or were not authorised by the agency. The electronics included devices such as smartwatches and home security cameras from companies such as Huawei, Hangzhou Hikvision, ZTE, and Dahua Technology. Carr emphasised that the removal is part of an agency-wide crackdown and cited national security as the driving factor.Carr said to Reuters. He noted that, as a result of the FCC's oversight, companies are implementing new processes to prevent prohibited items from being listed in the coming days.The FCC recently issued a new national security notice reminding companies of the ban on certain items, including video surveillance equipment.Carr added.In recent years, US agencies have taken multiple actions against Chinese technology companies across sectors such as telecommunications, semiconductors, and vehicles, citing national security concerns. The latest measure seeks to prevent unapproved Chinese electronics from entering the US market, the Reuters report noted.Earlier this week, the FCC announced plans to vote later this month on strengthening restrictions on telecommunications equipment made by Chinese firms considered national security risks. The move adds to a series of US steps aimed at limiting Beijing’s access to sensitive sectors.The FCC has previously placed companies such as Huawei, ZTE, China Mobile and China Telecom on itswhich prohibits the authorisation of new equipment from those firms.In October, the agency will vote on measures to block approval of devices containing parts from companies on the Covered List and to allow the FCC to restrict the sale of previously authorised equipment in some instances.In March, the FCC said it was investigating nine Chinese companies on the Covered List, including Huawei, ZTE, Hytera Communications (002583.SZ), Dahua Technology (002236.SZ), Pacifica Networks/ComNet, and China Unicom (Americas) (0762.HK).The FCC has earlier barred some Chinese firms from offering telecommunications services in the US, citing national security concerns. Last month, it also began proceedings to withdraw recognition from seven testing laboratories owned or controlled by the Chinese government, citing similar concerns.","Major US online retail websites have removed several million listings for prohibited Chinese electronics.

A family of philanthropists







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos who has a net worth of around $240 billion, once described himself as a ‘lottery winner’ and emphasised on the moral obligation which comes with extraordinary wealth. In a 2001 interview, Bezos shared his thoughts on philanthropy, calling it a challenge equal to building a fortune. “If you are a lottery winner as I am, then one of the things you get a chance to do at some point in your life is to be a philanthropist,” Bezos said. “I suspect that it takes as much time, energy, focus, and hard work to effectively give away money as it does to get it in the first place.”Bezos cautioned that a poorly planned giving can waste resources and he urged the wealth people to think strategically about how their money can be used in ‘highly leveraged’ ways. Comments made by Bezos gained renewed relevance as his philanthropic efforts continue to expand.Bezos founded Amazon in 1994 and went ahead to transform it into a $2.3 trillion e-commerce empire. After this Bezos turned his attention towards global challenges. His $10 billion Earth Fund is made to combat climate change.

Along with this, his wife Lauran Sanchez, Bezos made multiple multimillion-dollar donations in recent years.Bezos’ ex-wide MacKenzie Scott, has also become one of the most prolific philanthropists of the decade.

Benioff’s Trump support: City officials react with anger against







Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has drawn sharp criticism from San Francisco's Democratic leadership after expressing support for President Donald Trump and calling for National Guard troops to be deployed to the city. In a wide-ranging interview this week, Benioff said he “avidly supported President Trump” and endorsed the idea of sending federal troops to San Francisco—a proposal that city leaders consider unacceptable.During an Oval Office gathering in August, Trump mentioned that he was considering sending federal troops into San Francisco, listing it alongside other Democratic-led cities. Trump said Democrats had “destroyed” San Francisco and that he would “clean that one up, too.”Benioff said he supported that idea and believed Guard soldiers could help reduce crime in the city. “We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,” The New York Times quoted Benioff as saying.Benioff’s comments came ahead of the company’s annual Dreamforce conference, which is set to begin Tuesday in downtown San Francisco. Speaking by telephone from his private plane en route to San Francisco, Benioff said he has to pay for hundreds of off-duty law enforcement officers to help patrol the convention area and argued that San Francisco needed to “re-fund” the police.Over the course of a 50-minute conversation, Benioff did not criticise Trump or his policies. “I fully support the president. I think he's doing a great job,"" he said.He even praised Elon Musk's DOGE initiative to slash federal spending, texting a recent photo of himself with Musk and a Tesla robot. He also praised David Sacks, another San Francisco tech billionaire and chairman of Trump's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.San Francisco Democratic officials reacted with strong opposition to Benioff's comments.“You can't support San Francisco and want to see us invaded. It's one thing to wrongly support Trump's misguided economic policies. It's quite another to support a direct assault and occupation of our city,” said Democrat Assemblyman Matt Haney.San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said she was furious that Benioff wanted the National Guard in the city. She said she would seek to prosecute anyone, including federal agents, who becomes violent or harasses residents.Rafael Mandelman, president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, said he agreed the city needs more police officers but saw no need to send federal troops.",Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he ‘avidly supported President Trump’ and endorsed the idea of sending federal troops to San Francisco.

Google expands AI infrastructure and data centres

Strengthening Belgium’s digital future

AI’s potential for economic growth





US tech giant Google has announced plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network, creating hundreds of new jobs and supporting local economic growth. The investment will focus on the company’s existing Saint-Ghislain site and the new Farciennes campus, with construction already underway. Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade. Most jobs are expected to be supported or improved by AI, with only a small portion at risk of automation. By expanding AI infrastructure, Google aims to equip Belgian companies and the workforce with advanced digital tools while fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. The investment positions Belgium as a hub for next-generation AI innovation in Europe. It also signals Google’s commitment to combining technological advancement with environmental responsibility, shaping the future of digital and green growth.","Google plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network.

It has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1st, 2025, impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them. This affects ALL Countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago. It is absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.

Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying. Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.

It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again turned his fire on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI , accusing the company of betraying its founding mission and exploiting its non-profit status to profit. In a scathing post on X, the world’s richest man writes: “OpenAI is built on a lie”, adding “They stole a charity and used it for their own financial gain”. Musk was replying to a post by an X user named Helen Toner who shared:“Every so often, OpenAI employees ask me how I see the co now.It's always tough to give a simple answer. Some things they're doing, eg on CoT monitoring or building out system cards, are great.But the dishonesty & intimidation tactics in their policy work are really not. E.g:”Elon Musk’s sharp remarks against OpenAI comes as multiple users on X reported to have received subpoena from OpenAI in Elon Musk's lawsuit against the company, demanding all documents related to its governance and investors, served at his Oklahoma home shortly after organizing an open letter on AI transparency.In another post, Musk accused the company of using “dirty tricks” to intimidate AI policy advocates, specifically referencing a sheriff's deputy serving a personal subpoena to nonprofit lawyer Nathan Calvin amid California's SB 53 debates.The incident ties into OpenAI's lawsuit against Elon Musk, where subpoenas sought evidence of his funding critics like Calvin's group Encode, though no such links exist, escalating public scrutiny on AI corporate tactics.Notably, this is not the first time that Elon Musk has criticized OpenAI. Musk has publicly labelled OpenAI CEO as ‘SCAM Altman’. He has consistently argued that this shift compromises OpenAI's original mission, turning it into a ""closed-source de facto subsidiary"" of Microsoft and prioritizing profit over public good.

""We are probably the world's most active users of Slack internally at OpenAI and I think they're going to be really enduring and important systems for a while.”

“We use kind of all the canonical SaaS systems you can think of. These are really important systems for OpenAI, and I think they're going to be really enduring and important systems for a while,”

How AI will improve among Slack and other traditional tools



“live in the cracks”

“But one of the things that we're able to do is actually use AI systems to basically help live in the cracks between, kind of what the user needs to be able to do with those systems, and kind of what those systems represent in terms of a workflow. So if you're a salesperson, for example, and you're trying to prepare for a meeting, right, there are a lot of factors that aggregate into how you think about preparation for that client and that customer.

Historically, you've had to go collect all those yourself. You've had to synthesise all the takeaways. You've had to kind of run the analysis, pull the data to write the profile, and hand that off to the other person who needs the context. All that now can be condensed, and so we built a lot of tooling around that for us to be able to actually make our sales teams much more productive and much more efficient and so and we hold everyone to that bar.

So the way we kind of look at this is there's a team whose job it is to think about how to actually drive output, drive impact in our organisation, so that when we have a salesperson join the team, or a marketer or a software engineer or whoever it is, they really are starting at a higher baseline level of productivity, and they can start to think more along the lines of, ‘hey, you know, instead of managing five or 10 accounts, maybe you can manage 20 accounts, Right? And that's just incredible leverage in our business.”

Singapore authorities are reportedly investigating AI computing firm Megaspeed. According to a report by CNBC, the company – a customer of chipmaker Nvidia allegedly helped Chinese companies, bypassing restrictions on US chip exports. The report quotes an email from the police saying “The Singapore Police Force confirms that investigations are ongoing into Megaspeed for suspected breaches of our domestic laws”.Megaspeed was spun off from a Chinese gaming company in 2023. The company has purchased nearly $2 billion worth of Nvidia’s most advanced products through its subsidiary in Malaysia.The probe follows a New York Times report which said that the US Commerce Department is also investigating whether Megaspeed skirted American export controls. The NYT report cited anonymous officials and other people familiar with the matter.These parallel investigations, CNBC says, could increase scrutiny of Nvidia’s ability to track where its advanced chips end up and whether the company is fully complying with US rules on sales to China.Nvidia says it has engaged with the US government on the matter and performed its own inquiry, without identifying “any reason to believe products have been diverted.”“NVIDIA visited multiple Megaspeed sites yet again earlier this week and confirmed what we previously observed—Megaspeed is running a small commercial cloud, like many other companies throughout the world, as allowed by U.S. export control rules,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement shared with CNBC.","Singapore authorities are reportedly investigating AI computing firm Megaspeed.

US opens Tesla probe after more crashes involving its so-called full self-driving technology,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-opens-tesla-probe-after-more-crashes-involving-its-so-called-full-self-driving-technology/articleshow/124455165.cms,"



Federal auto safety regulators have opened yet another investigation into Tesla's so-called full-self driving technology after dozens of incidents in which its vehicles ran red lights or drove on the wrong side of the road, sometimes crashing into other vehicles and injuring people.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a filing dated Tuesday that it has 58 incident reports of Tesla vehicles violating traffic safety laws while operating in full self-driving mode. In reports to regulators, many of the Tesla drivers said the cars gave them no warning about the unexpected behavior.In August, a Miami jury found that Tesla was partly responsible for a deadly 2019 crash in Florida involving its Autopilot driver assist technology — which is different than full self-driving — and must pay the victims more than $240 million in damages.Tesla said it would appeal the decision.The new probe covers 2,882,566 vehicles, essentially all Teslas equipped with full self-driving technology, or FSD, of which there are two types. Level 2 driver-assistance software, or “Full Self-Driving (Supervised),” requires drivers to pay full attention to the road. The company is still testing a version that does not require driver intervention, something that the automaker's owner and CEO Elon Musk has been promising to roll out for years.The new investigation follows a host of other probes into the FSD feature on Teslas, which has been blamed for several injuries and deaths. Tesla has repeatedly said the system cannot drive itself and human drivers must be ready to intervene at all times.Tesla is also under investigation by NHTSA for a “summon” technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up, a feature that has reportedly led to some fender benders in parking lots. A probe into driver-assistance features in 2.4 million Teslas was opened last year after several crashes in fog and other low-visibility conditions, including one in which a pedestrian was killed.Another investigation was launched by NHTSA in August looking into why Tesla apparently has not been reporting crashes promptly to the agency as required by its rules.NHTSA investigations can often lead to recalls.Musk is under pressure to show that the latest advances in its driver-assistance features have not only fixed such glitches but have made them so good drivers don’t even need to look out the window anymore. He recently promised to put hundreds of thousands of such self-driving Tesla cars and Tesla robotaxis on roads by the end of the next year.Tesla shares fell 2% Thursday.","The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a filing dated Tuesday that it has 58 incident reports of Tesla vehicles violating traffic safety laws while operating in full self-driving mode.

UK regulator labels 'strategic market' designation on Google; company warns will hurt innovation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-activates-new-powers-to-regulate-googles-90-search-monopoly/articleshow/124453608.cms,"Google warns against innovation barriers

Potential changes could reshape Google Search experience





Britain's competition watchdog designated Google with ""strategic market status,” marking the first use of its regulatory powers aimed at curbing Big Tech's dominance in the United Kingdom. The Competition and Markets Authority found that Google controls over 90% of UK search traffic, granting regulators authority to impose targeted interventions on how the tech giant operates its search services. The designation doesn't constitute wrongdoing but opens the door for mandatory changes to ensure fair competition.CMA Executive Director Will Hayter emphasised Google's commanding market position, noting the company maintains substantial and entrenched power in search and search advertising sectors. The regulator plans to launch consultations later in 2025 on potential measures.Google pushed back against the regulatory designation, cautioning that proposed interventions could hamper UK innovation and economic growth. Oliver Bethell, Google's senior director of competition, argued the measures might delay product launches during a critical period of AI-driven innovation.The company highlighted its £5 billion investment commitment to Britain and claimed its search services contributed £118 billion to the UK economy in 2023 alone.Google urged regulators to avoid overly burdensome restrictions, pointing to what it described as negative outcomes in other jurisdictions.According to the CMA's roadmap published in June, potential interventions include mandatory choice screens showing alternative search engines, fairer ranking principles for websites, and giving publishers greater control over their content usage in AI-generated responses.While Google's Gemini AI assistant falls outside the current designation scope, other AI-powered search features like AI Overviews and AI Mode are included. The CMA stated it would monitor developments given market uncertainty.The regulatory action reflects growing global scrutiny of Google's search dominance, with similar investigations underway in the United States and Europe.","Britain's competition watchdog designated Google with ""strategic market status"" Google controls over 90% of UK search traffic, granting regulators authority to impose targeted interventions.

China has asked customs officials to investigate companies with past declarations



Comet CBS-05 Pro Speaker Review: Style & Sound Under Rs 6,000





China is tightening controls on chip imports at major ports, a report claims. This move will reportedly discourage the use of US products, specifically Nvidia's AI processors, in the country. In recent weeks, Chinese customs officers have been mobilised to conduct stringent checks on semiconductor shipments nationwide, a report by The Financial Times, citing sources familiar with the matter, claimed. The initial goal of these inspections was to ensure that local companies stop ordering Nvidia’s China-specific chips, namely the H20 and RTX Pro 6000D AI chipsets, following guidance from Chinese regulators. These Nvidia chips were designed to comply with US export controls and maintain the chipmaker’s market share in China. Now, the inspections have expanded to include all advanced semiconductor products to target the smuggling of high-end chips that violate US export curbs, the report noted. This crackdown highlights Beijing's focus on weaning its technology sector off American technology and bolstering domestic chipmakers to advance in the AI race.In addition to the tightened border checks, customs officials have also been investigating past declarations by companies regarding the import of advanced semiconductor products. This increased enforcement follows reports that a significant number of Nvidia's top AI chips were smuggled and sold in China over the three months from May.Previously, Chinese customs had generally allowed chip imports as long as appropriate duties were paid. Beijing aims to redirect resources toward domestic chipmakers to help them improve product performance and manufacturing capacity.US quantitative trading firm Tower Research faced investigation for alleged hardware smuggling, including advanced chips, the FT reported last week. The probe forms part of the new wave of import controls.The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the internet watchdog, instructed tech companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, in mid-September to cancel orders and halt testing of all Nvidia products. The border controls have been implemented as a coordinated effort with the CAC.The guidance came two months after Nvidia announced the Trump administration had lifted an earlier US export ban on H20. Nvidia also introduced the RTX Pro 6000D, another modified AI chip for China.The actions follow Beijing's assessment that domestic chips now match the performance standards of Nvidia's China-specific processors.China plans to triple production of advanced semiconductors next year to meet demand previously filled by Nvidia, the FT reported last month.Nvidia no longer includes China in its revenue projections. However, it recorded $4.6 billion in the first quarter of this fiscal year from H20 sales to China, its fourth-largest market, before the US temporarily restricted sales.","China is tightening controls on chip imports at major ports, a report claims.

How AI can be exploited







Eric Schmidt, who led Google as chief executive from 2001 to 2011, has delivered a ‘dangerous’ assessment of artificial intelligence (AI) security risks while simultaneously expressing optimism about the technology's transformative potential. Speaking at the Sifted Summit during a fireside chat this week, Schmidt addressed concerns about whether AI poses dangers comparable to nuclear weapons, acknowledging significant vulnerabilities in current AI systems.""Is there a possibility of a proliferation problem in AI? Absolutely,"" Schmidt stated, highlighting concerns that the technology could fall into the hands of malicious actors who could repurpose and misuse it.Schmidt pointed to evidence that AI models, whether closed or open-source, can be compromised to bypass their built-in safety mechanisms.“There’s evidence that you can take models, closed or open, and you can hack them to remove their guardrails. So in the course of their training, they learn a lot of things. A bad example would be they learn how to kill someone,” Schmidt highlighted.Schmidt noted that while all major AI companies implement safeguards to prevent their models from answering dangerous questions—a decision he characterised as both well-executed and ethically sound—these protections are not foolproof.""All of the major companies make it impossible for those models to answer that question. Good decision. Everyone does this. They do it well, and they do it for the right reasons. There's evidence that they can be reverse-engineered, and there are many other examples of that nature,"" Schmidt said.AI systems face multiple forms of attack, with prompt injections and jailbreaking among the most concerning methods, according to the former Google CEO.In prompt injection attacks, hackers embed malicious instructions within user inputs or external data sources such as web pages or documents. These hidden commands trick the AI into performing unintended actions, including sharing private information or executing harmful commands.Schmidt expressed concern about the lack of effective safeguards to address AI's proliferation risks.""There isn't a good 'non-proliferation regime' yet to help curb the dangers of AI,"" he stated, suggesting that current regulatory frameworks are insufficient to manage the technology's potential misuse.Despite these warnings, Schmidt struck an optimistic tone about AI's broader impact and argued that the technology is actually underestimated rather than overhyped.","Eric Schmidt, who led Google as chief executive from 2001 to 2011, has delivered a ‘dangerous’ assessment of artificial intelligence (AI) security risks.

I’m turning 41, but I don’t feel like celebrating.

Our generation is running out of time to save the free Internet built for us by our fathers.

What was once the promise of the free exchange of information is being turned into the ultimate tool of control.

Once-free countries are introducing dystopian measures such as digital IDs (UK), online age checks (Australia), and mass scanning of private messages (EU).

Germany is persecuting anyone who dares to criticize officials on the Internet. The UK is imprisoning thousands for their tweets. France is criminally investigating tech leaders who defend freedom and privacy.

A dark, dystopian world is approaching fast — while we’re asleep. Our generation risks going down in history as the last one that had freedoms — and allowed them to be taken away.

We’ve been fed a lie.

We’ve been made to believe that the greatest fight of our generation is to destroy everything our forefathers left us: tradition, privacy, sovereignty, the free market, and free speech.

By betraying the legacy of our ancestors, we’ve set ourselves on a path toward self-destruction — moral, intellectual, economic, and ultimately biological.

Poll Do you think the current H-1B visa process benefits American technology companies? Yes No

Zoho founder says long-term R&D commitment drives innovation success

Indian companies must build culture of sustained innovation, Vembu argues





Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu has offered a fresh perspective on why Indian professionals dominate leadership roles at American technology companies, explaining how America's lengthy H-1B visa and green card processes inadvertently created a pool of committed tech talent rather than any deliberate strategy. The immigration system's restrictions made job switching risky, fostering long-term loyalty that naturally led to their rise in senior positions at major US firms.In a social media post on X, Vembu explained that the H-1B visa program and the notoriously long green card process created conditions that fostered long-term commitment among Indian workers. ""American companies solved the need for long term committed people with the H1-B visa and the extremely long green card process, both of which made it painful or risky to switch jobs,"" he wrote.This system, Vembu argued, gave US tech companies a reliable source of dedicated talent willing to stay with organisations for extended periods. Since companies naturally promote employees who demonstrate commitment, Indians who remained loyal to their employers advanced into senior positions. ""There was no conspiracy to promote Indians, it was one consequence of the visa/green card system,"" he emphasised.The Zoho founder stressed that research and development is ""not expensive but time intensive,"" with best results achieved by teams committed to long-term goals. The visa system inadvertently created these conditions by making job transitions risky for foreign workers seeking permanent residency.Vembu's comments come amid intense controversy over President Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee imposed in September, which has sparked heated debate about foreign talent in American technology. Critics, including billionaire investor Michael Moritz, warn the policy could backfire by pushing innovation overseas. Moritz cited successful immigrant CEOs like Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Google 's Sundar Pichai as examples of the program's benefits, arguing that ""two of the finest chief executives in the US"" are products of previous administrations' immigration policies.The fee has divided tech leadership. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged his own family couldn't have afforded such costs when they immigrated, yet called it ""a great start"" while warning it ""probably sets the bar a little too high."" Nvidia, with over 1,400 H-1B employees facing potential $147 million in fees, committed to covering all visa costs. Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings supported the fee as ensuring visas are ""used just for very high-value jobs,"" while most Silicon Valley executives warn it disadvantages startups and could drive talent to competitors in India, Turkey, and Eastern Europe.Vembu urged Indian tech companies to learn from this pattern, emphasising the importance of creating a culture focused on long-term R&D commitment. Earlier this month, Vembu stepped down as Zoho CEO to become Chief Scientist, dedicating himself full-time to research and development initiatives amid rapid AI advancement.Despite growing talent migration concerns, Vembu maintains an optimistic outlook, arguing that rising emigration actually signals economic transformation rather than decline—a pattern historically seen in Korea, Taiwan, and China during their development phases.","Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu explains why Indian professionals dominate leadership roles at American technology companies.

Elon Musk is the world's richest person with a wealth of over $485 billion, according to Forbes Billionaires List. In 2012, the tech billionaire signed onto the Giving Pledge, an initiative co-founded by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Warren Buffet. As part of the pledge, the world’s wealthiest individuals commit to donate at least half of their fortunes to charity. Recently, PayPal founder and billionaire investor Peter Thiel revealed that he once advised Elon Musk to step away from the Giving Pledge.According to transcripts and audio recordings of a lecture series reviewed by Reuters, Thiel said he recently told Musk that signing the pledge could mean his fortune would end up with “left-leaning nonprofits” selected by Bill Gates. During the interaction, the German-American entrepreneur also shared concerns about global power structures. He warned of the possibility of an authoritarian figure — which he described as an “Antichrist” — gaining control under the guise of solving global threats such as nuclear war, artificial intelligence, or climate change.When Thiel advised Elon Musk to not donate his wealth, Musk responded by saying “What am I supposed to do—give it to my children?”.To this, Theil replied “You know, it would be much worse to give it to Bill Gates.”During the lecture, Thiel argued that billionaires should think more critically about the fate of their fortunes after death. Using actuarial tables, he said that the probability of Musk’s death within a year would translate into Gates receiving billions through philanthropic commitments. Thiel suggested this scenario highlighted the risks of allowing wealth to be directed by others through pledges like Gates’s initiative.Notably, Elon Musk has signed the pledge in 2012, but he has not specified in detail how his wealth would be distributed.", PayPal founder and billionaire investor Peter Thiel revealed that he once advised Elon Musk to step away from the Giving Pledge.

Amazon is officially shutting down Freevee, its free, ad-supported video streaming service originally launched under the IMDB brand nearly five years ago. Freevee will be phased out over the course of the next several weeks. Going forward, content that had been on the service will move to Amazon’s Prime Video brand.Under CEO Andy Jassy, Amazon has been on a cost-cutting drive that has shut down dozens of duplicative or unprofitable initiatives, from a would-be home delivery robot to niche cloud-computing services. He’s also closely examined some of the company’s big-spending divisions, including its devices business and Amazon Studios.Amazon is shutting down Freevee, its free ad-supported streaming service . All Freevee programming will be available on Prime Video for free.Amazon reportedly wants to simplify the viewing experience by having all their entertainment content in one place. They also started offering ads on Prime Video this year, making Freevee a bit redundant. “We have built Prime Video into a first-stop entertainment destination where customers can personalize their viewing experience by streaming exclusive Prime member entertainment produced by Amazon MGM Studios, licensed movies and series, content from other services as an add-on subscription, live sports, blockbuster movies and series to rent or buy, FAST [free, ad-supported streaming TV] channels and the complete Amazon Freevee content offering,” told a Amazon spokesperson to Variety in a statement. The Amazon spokesperson continued, “To deliver a simpler viewing experience for customers, we have decided to phase out Freevee branding. There will be no change to the content available for Prime members, and a vast offering of free streaming content will still be accessible for non-Prime members, including select originals from Amazon MGM Studios, a variety of licensed movies and series, and a broad library of FAST channels — all available on Prime Video.”Freevee will be phased out within the next few weeks.Yes. All Freevee shows will be available to watch for free on Prime Video. In the markets where Freevee has been launched (the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Austria), free content will be made available to non-Prime users under the Prime Video umbrella and will be labeled “Watch for Free.” Also users will not need a Prime membership to access them.These shows, along with all other Freevee content, will be available on Prime Video.No. You can still watch the free content on Prime Video without a membership.

Canara Bank has reportedly classified the loan accounts of Anil Ambani ’s bankrupt telecom venture, Reliance Communications , and its subsidiary as fraudulent, alleging the misappropriation of Rs 1,050 crore loaned in 2017. These loans were initially intended for capital expenditure and debt repayment.According to a report in Economic Times, in a letter to Reliance Communications dated November 5, Canara Bank stated, “After availing and enjoying the said loans, credit facilities, your company had committed default and breached the sanctioned terms and conditions. The loan accounts slipped into Non-Performing Asset (""NPA"") status on 09.03.2017.”The bank claimed the accounts were classified as fraudulent due to the non-utilization of funds as per the sanctioned terms and inter-company transactions used to settle other debts. “Loans availed were also invested in mutual funds and fixed assets, and these were liquidated to make payments to related and non-related parties,” the bank said.Reliance Communications, which went bankrupt in 2018, responded that the company is undergoing an insolvency resolution process. Since the loans were taken before entering insolvency, the company is shielded from lawsuits by creditors. The classification of the loan accounts as fraudulent will not affect the ongoing insolvency proceedings, the company added.Previously, a forensic audit supported by State Bank of India, Union Bank of India, and Indian Overseas Bank revealed questionable transactions worth Rs 5,500 crore within three Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group entities. However, the lead banker, SBI, later withdrew the fraud investigation tag.Reliance Communications has consistently denied any wrongdoing.","Canara Bank has classified the loan accounts of Anil Ambani ’s bankrupt telecom venture, Reliance Communications, and its subsidiary as fraudulent.

Why government is extra cautious on security

The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk 's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon before approving their satellite communication services in India. According to a report in Economic Times, both companies are expected to provide detailed compliance information regarding data security, coverage area, and other key parameters.While Bharti-backed OneWeb and Reliance Jio 's partnership with SES have already secured approval, Starlink and Amazon's applications are still pending due to the additional security checks.Officials aware of the details told ET that letters to both the US-based firms were sent recently and the department is awaiting their reply. ""Their applications can be processed only after they submit the compliance. The firms have so far not replied,"" said a person familiar with the details.Another official said that the government will wait for some more time for their reply, but the applications won't be processed till they agree to all the security conditions. ""There are various security-related compliances as well as those related to data, coverage area etc which satcom providers have to give to the government in order to offer services in India. All the boxes need to be ticked,"" said a third official.As per security requirements, the terminals have to stop communicating if there is a change in latitude and longitude position in order to prevent any misuse. In its replies to the government, Starlink had reportedly given a declaration that none of its investors were from countries sharing a land border with India -- primarily China and Pakistan. The government had accepted that declaration.The government's cautious approach is driven by concerns over potential security risks, especially given the strategic importance of satellite communications. The DoT is particularly interested in ensuring that satellite terminals near border areas are securely monitored and controlled to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is currently working on recommendations for pricing and other terms and conditions for allocating satellite spectrum. However, traditional telecom operators like Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea are advocating for a level playing field, arguing that satellite companies should be subject to the same regulations and liabilities as terrestrial operators.",The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon.

This is how the conversation went:“She asked, ‘What are you doing?’ I told her I was catching a flight. She immediately said, ‘Cancel it, get the first flight back to Bangalore, and wish your wife a happy anniversary!’”Narayana Murthy shared that he told her about a speech at 3pm but Akshata insisted, “I don’t care if you have a speech at 3 pm. If you need to hire a private plane, hire it, but come back and wish her!” Their daughter, Akshata Murty, is now married to former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.Sudha Murthy also chimed in, laughing, “It was our 25th wedding anniversary so it doesn’t happen every year.

Elon Musk's Starlink has been generating significant buzz in India, particularly for its promise of high-speed satellite internet. However, a recent report by the Kutniti Foundation has raised concerns about the potential security implications of allowing the service in India.The Delhi-based foundation highlights Starlink's close ties to the US intelligence and military establishment, raising questions about the potential for surveillance, data interception, and disruption of critical infrastructure. The report points out that the technology's dual-use nature, capable of both civilian and military applications, poses a significant risk to India's national security.While the Indian government has expressed caution and emphasized the need for compliance with security regulations, the potential benefits of satellite internet, especially in remote and underserved areas, cannot be ignored.Starlink's close ties to the US government and its intelligence agencies could potentially allow for surveillance and data interception. Kutniti cited reports of some of the contracts between Musk's companies and the US agencies to say, ""These are just the known contracts of Starlink as part of the intel-military-industrial complex of the USA, there are a lot of confidential agreements and contracts kept behind covers.""The technology's ability to serve both civilian and military purposes raises concerns about its potential misuse.Starlink's global reach and its potential to influence geopolitical dynamics could pose risks to India's strategic interests.The report questions the level of data protection and security that Starlink can offer, particularly in light of US laws that prioritize national security.""Starlink is (very candidly) a technology of geopolitical control, pushed by intelligence and defence forces to have the dominance in space and control over land via that lever,"" the report added.","Starlink has been generating significant buzz in India, particularly for its promise of high-speed satellite internet.

Why Pentagon tracks UFOs and Aliens

Key Findings of Pentagon's new report on UFOs and Aliens

* No under water incident:

* No extraterrestrial origin, but hundreds of cases remain unexplained:

* Most common explanations:

* What leaves sightings unresolved:

The Pentagon has released a new report on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), often referred to as UFOs. While the report details hundreds of new cases, it offers no evidence of extraterrestrial origins. The report, compiled by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office ( AARO ), covers a wide range of incidents, from misidentified balloons and drones to more mysterious objects. One particularly intriguing case involved a near-miss between a commercial airliner and an unidentified object off the coast of New York.Pentagon's efforts to study and identify UAPs are reportedly focused on potential threats to national security or air safety and not their science fiction aspects. The All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO, was created at the Pentagon in 2022 to look into the cases of unearthly origins.This was after US lawmakers reportedly said that the many questions about UAPs show the need for the government to closely study the issue — and share those findings with Americans. “There is something out there,” said Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee, as per a report by news agency AP. “The question is: Is it ours, is it someone else's, or is it otherworldly?”The Pentagon’s review reportedly covered 757 cases from around the world that were reported to US authorities from May 1, 2023, to June 1, 2024. The total includes 272 incidents that occurred before that time period but had not been previously reported.The great majority of the reported incidents occurred in airspace, but 49 occurred at altitudes estimated to be at least 100 kilometers (62 miles), which is considered space. None occurred underwater. Reporting witnesses are said to have included commercial and military pilots as well as ground-based observers.The report emphasizes that AARO has found no evidence to suggest extraterrestrial involvement in any of the cases examined. Hundreds of other cases remain unexplained, though the report's authors stressed that is often because there isn't enough information to draw firm conclusions.Many of the incidents can be attributed to mundane objects like balloons, drones, or satellites, particularly those from Elon Musk 's Starlink satellite constellation.The lack of sufficient data often hinders definitive conclusions, leaving many cases unsolved.","Pentagon has released a new report on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), often referred to as UFOs.

Balancing innovation and regulation

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury has reportedly expressed concerns over the potential anti-trust implications of a SpaceX-like model in Europe. He highlighted the stark contrast between the European space industry , characterized by its fragmented approach and stringent regulations, and SpaceX's highly integrated and innovative model. According to a report by news agency Reuters, ""I think what the Americans and what SpaceX have done is amazing. It's amazing and it's breaking some rules of what we're doing. It's very concentrated, where with European projects we are very scattered and distributed,"" Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said.""SpaceX's insurgent Falcon 9 rocket has slashed launch costs by introducing reusable rocketry into the commercial industry, enabling deployment of the company's fast-growing Starlink constellation, now tallied at nearly 7,000 satellites in orbit. By contrast, Europe's flagship Ariane 6 launcher , which is partly built by Airbus, has yet to stage its first commercial flight after a long-delayed test flight in July. It plans some 10 flights a year, a fraction of the pace at SpaceX,"" said the Reuters report.In contrast, the European space industry has been plagued by delays, cost overruns, and bureaucratic hurdles. The Ariane 6 launcher, a key European project, has faced significant setbacks, while SpaceX continues to dominate the market.""In Europe, we tend to do the ... opposite. We make 20%, we buy 80%. And by buying 80%, you have a large supply base which is pleasing everybody. Well, Elon Musk's space is not pleasing anybody except Elon Musk,"" Faury said.Backed by Europe's leading space-funding nations such as France, Airbus and other manufacturers have reportedly long complained that Europe's space industry is hit by by rules requiring work to be shared between countries involved in funding Ariane. By contrast, SpaceX is free to decide where to invest and manufactures 80% of what it needs, Faury reportedly said.AirBus CEO emphasized the need for Europe to adapt to the changing landscape of the space industry. He acknowledged that the current European model, characterized by a distributed approach and strict regulations, may hinder innovation and competitiveness.The European space industry faces a delicate balancing act between fostering innovation and ensuring fair competition.

Controversial win for Jake Paul

Netflix 's ambitious foray into live sports streaming stumbled during the highly-anticipated boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul . Despite drawing a massive global audience, the event was marred by widespread technical difficulties, leaving thousands of viewers frustrated.""We crashed the site,"" Paul boasted after his controversial victory over the 58-year-old Tyson. ""This is the biggest event. Over 120 million people on Netflix.""Social media was flooded with complaints about slow buffering, frozen screens, and other technical glitches. Even legendary boxer Evander Holyfield experienced audio issues during the live broadcast.Netflix remained silent on the specific impact of the technical failures. The company has been investing heavily in live-event capabilities, aiming to boost its advertising business. However, as a report in Bloomberg pointed out, this latest incident follows earlier livestreaming mishaps, including the chaotic Love Is Blind reunion.The boxing match itself, held at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, failed to live up to the hype, with critics panning it as a lackluster affair. Paul was controversially awarded a unanimous decision victory after eight rounds.The event was expected to be a significant driver of Netflix subscriptions, with analysts predicting potential gains of 10 million in the fourth quarter. However, the technical issues and underwhelming fight may have dampened these expectations.Social media users expressed their disappointment, with many questioning Netflix's ability to handle large-scale live events. As the company continues to explore live programming, it will need to address these technical challenges to ensure future success.","Boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson was marred by technical problems.

T-Mobile 's network was among the several systems hacked in the Chinese hacking operation that gained entry into multiple US and international telecommunications companies, a report has said. The telecom giant now joins other known victims, including AT&T and Verizon, of the major Chinese spying operation.Citing people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal (via news agency Reuters) reported that a stealthy hacking group known as Salt Typhoon with alleged links to Chinese intelligence were able to breach T-Mobile as part of a months-long campaign to spy on the phone communications of high-value intelligence targets.“T-Mobile is closely monitoring this industry-wide attack. At this time, T-Mobile systems and data have not been impacted in any significant way, and we have no evidence of impacts to customer information,” a company spokesperson told the news agency.The report said that there is no clarity on what information, if any, has been taken about T-Mobile customers' calls and communications records.Last week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US cyber watchdog agency CISA said China-linked hackers have intercepted surveillance data intended for American law enforcement agencies after breaking into an unspecified number of telecom companies.Earlier in October, the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese hackers accessed the networks of US broadband providers, including Verizon Communications, AT&T and Lumen Technologies. It added that the hackers obtained information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorised wiretapping.The report also said that the hackers appear to have collected vast internet traffic from internet service providers. Additionally, there are indications that the hacking campaign targeted a small number of service providers outside of the US.","T-Mobile joins other known victims, including AT&T and Verizon, of the major Chinese spying operation.

Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu has left the internet divided with this latest post. Vembu's comments, urging people who make Bengaluru their home to learn Kannada , have garnered both support and criticism.Sridhar Vembu shared a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) urging people to learn Kannada. Vembu emphasised that anyone who considers Bengaluru their home should learn Kannada, calling it ""disrespectful"" not to do so.Vembu's comments were prompted by a social media post featuring two individuals wearing T-shirts with the slogan ""Hindi National Language."" The post, captioned ""Perfect T-shirt for Bangalore trip”.Commenting on another X user post, Vembu wrote, “If you make Bengaluru your home, you should learn Kannada and your kids should learn Kannada. Not doing so after living many years in Bengaluru is disrespectful. I often request our employees in Chennai coming from other states to make an effort to learn Tamil after they come here.""Vembu's post garnered over a million views and sparked a wave of reactions on social media. Vembu's statement, which emphasized the importance of learning Kannada for residents who build their lives in Bengaluru, resonated with some users. However, others expressed concerns that such expectations could be perceived as exclusionary or impose an additional burden on non-Kannada speakers. Here are some user reactions:“I have many Kannada friends in Mumbai, living here for decades. No one can speak Marathi. Not one word. Fair?”“Disrespectful? The problem is that a IT professional working in Chennai for 3 years could move to Bengaluru to work there for next 5 years and then to Hyderabad for next 2 years. So, by the OP logic they should be learning Tamil , Kannada and Telugu in these years and then finally settle to their hometown somewhere in Maharashtra and not use these languages ever again .Though it is good to learn different languages but it cannot be shoved down their throat just to satisfy the misplaced regional pride? Also the work most IT professionals do is with European, American or other international clients in English - there also these languages will not help professionally .Now, if you have noticed the Marwadi businessmen that you would find everywhere in Chennai running kirana shops or small businesses - they can speak fluent Tamil because their clientele is local. Try visiting Abids or Koti in Hyderabad , you will find the same thing with Telugu speaking Gujaratis and Marwadis .The problem is not learning the language, the problem is regional ego attached with it . Which unfortunately the post like yours promote . That is what is disrespectful.”“Great Sir. Let's devide the country and make borders with requirement of IELTS kind certificate in the local language for entrance. Just before that the tagline of our country 'Unity in diversity' should be immersed in Ganga in Varanasi.”“Sridhar Ji - I completely understand your sentiment . But there is always a list of things to learn for me - couple of tech certifications pending , a course on Sanaskrit Vedic pending , even the plan of learning my mother tongue script Sharda is in my bucket list. Taking extra time for something new is challenging - only way a person can pick a new language is if the process is organic.We should think about making the process organic, may be little Kanada here and there or small interactive sessions on weekends . Even encouraging someone who speaks broken language. I don’t know the exact answer how we can encourage it - but the process should be organic as we are already loaded with 1000 things which take precedence over learning a new language”",Sridhar Vembu shared a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) urging people to learn Kannada.

He was raised in India where he graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay with a degree in electrical engineering. Desai completed his MBA in finance from the Stephen M Ross School of Business.In 1976, Desai moved to the US as a programmer with TCS. While working at TCS, he met Neerja Sethi with whom he tied the knot. The two were living in an apartment in Michigan when they decided to invest around Rs 16000 to start their own company.In 1980, Desai co-founded IT consulting and outsourcing company Syntel with his wife Neerja Sethi from their apartment in Troy, Michigan in 1980. In its first year, Syntel generated just $30,000 in sales. By 2018, the company's revenue reached $900 million, catching the attention of French IT giant Atos SE . Reflecting on his success, Desai once said, “It’s about having a strong vision and the patience to build it step by step.”Atos SE acquired Syntel for a substantial $3.4 billion (around Rs 28,000 crore) in cash. However, Desai was later sued by Atos. The company accused him of hiding liabilities ahead of the merger. The case was dismissed in 2023.Desai now resides with his family in Fisher Island, Florida, and supports philanthropic works. He is involved in Detroit’s “Paint the Town” initiative, which aids struggling neighborhoods, among others.

Read the complete post:

Back when I started in tech in India, grinding late hours was worn like a badge of honor.

- I had a manager who wouldn’t leave to home before 10:00 PM and always come to office at 9:00 AM sharp

- last min prod deployment on the name of client is god.

- even my team members slept in accenture offices in Gurgaon

- in India we’re so many people in tech hence so tough competition if you don’t do it — there are 10,000 people in line so most of us don’t have choice.

Hustle culture

was so ingrained that I barely questioned it — sacrificing personal time and family moments without a second thought.

No one told me it wasn’t sustainable; I just accepted it as the price of “dedication.”

Then I moved to Sweden, and it’s a whole new world.

Here, people simply drop a Slack message to adjust their hours, and no one doubts their commitment.

There’s mutual trust, a respect for boundaries, and an understanding that a balanced life leads to better work.

It’s the kind of balance I never thought I could ask for.

Now,

Gen Z in India

is flipping the script.

They’re setting boundaries, pushing back on toxic expectations, and actually daring to value their own time.

Sure, it can come off as bold — even a little too relaxed. But maybe they’re on to something. By demanding healthier work dynamics, they might just be the ones to finally fix India’s relentless hustle.

Here are some user reactions“My sister works tirelessly for approx 11 hours daily in the office, even working on weekends sometimes. Her office culture is more like a cult than hustle. She literally cries just in case we ask her not to go to work on weekend.”“This would be true if Gen Z used the additional time to actually decompress with hobbies or passions, not get more depressed doomscrolling in their free time. It's important to understand what really causes stress and how to actually deal with it, rather than just working less.”“i feel that attaching story points to any development effort and using them as a quantifiable metric for impact evaluation is the only method. hours is a vanity metric. i have seen many folks in many offices who spend a lot of time but cannot get things done because of lack of rhythm that is needed for coding. A one-off 12-hour or even 14-hour work day per month is acceptable if things go south but should never be a daily practise.”","A WhatsApp screenshot has triggered a heated online debate about work-life balance in India.

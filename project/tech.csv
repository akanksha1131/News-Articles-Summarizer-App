Deloitte AI Institute chief on AI oversight: Governing AI agents is tougher because…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deloitte-ai-institute-chief-on-ai-oversight-governing-ai-agents-is-tougher-because/articleshow/127574981.cms,"Businesses are rapidly adopting AI agents for tasks, with projections showing a surge from 23% to 74% in two years. However, robust safety measures lag significantly, with only 21% of companies reporting adequate oversight. This gap poses risks as agents gain independence, potentially leading to errors and security vulnerabilities without proper governance.

“Because AI agents are designed to take actions directly, governing [them] requires new approaches beyond traditional oversight. As agents proliferate without governance, you lose the ability to audit decisions, understand why agents behaved a certain way, or defend your actions to regulators or customers.”

""Given the technology's rapid adoption trajectory, this could be a significant limitation. As agentic AI scales from pilots to production deployments, establishing robust governance should be essential to capturing value while managing risk,""

Why is more dependency on AI agents risky for companies

""Organisations need to establish clear boundaries for agent autonomy, defining which decisions agents can make independently versus which require human approval. Real-time monitoring systems that track agent behaviour and flag anomalies are essential, as are audit trails that capture the full chain of agent actions to help ensure accountability and enable continuous improvement,""





Businesses are ramping up their use of AI agents faster than they're putting in place adequate guardrails. According to a recently published State of AI in the Enterprise report by Deloitte, based on a survey of over 3,200 business leaders across 24 countries, 23% of companies are currently using AI agents ""at least moderately"", but this figure is projected to jump to 74% in the next two years. To compare, the portion of companies that report not using them at all, currently 25%, is expected to shrink to just 5%. However, the rise of agents (AI tools trained to perform multistep tasks with little human supervision) in the workplace isn't accompanied by adequate guardrails. Only around 21% of respondents told Deloitte that their company currently has robust safety and oversight mechanisms in place to prevent possible harms caused by agents.In a statement to ZDNet, Beena Ammanath, Global Head of Deloitte's AI Institute, said,Deloitte also warned in its report.Companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Salesforce have promoted agents as productivity-boosting tools, with the main idea that businesses can hand off repetitive, low-stakes workplace tasks to them while human employees focus on more important work.However, greater independence brings greater risk. Unlike more limited chatbots, which require careful and constant prompting, agents can interact with various digital tools to, for example, sign documents or make purchases on behalf of organisations. This leaves more room for error, since agents can behave in unexpected ways (sometimes with serious consequences) and be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks.The new Deloitte report isn't the first to point out that AI adoption is moving faster than safety measures.One study published in May 2025 found that the vast majority (84%) of IT professionals surveyed said their employers were already using AI agents, while only 44% said they had policies in place to regulate the activity of those systems, ZDNet reports.Another study published in September 2025 by the nonprofit National Cybersecurity Alliance revealed that while a growing number of people are using AI tools like ChatGPT on a daily basis, including at work, most of them are doing so without having received any kind of safety training from their employers (teaching them, for example, about the privacy risks that come with using chatbots).In December 2025, Gallup published the results of a poll showing that while the use of AI tools among individual workers had increased since the previous year, almost one-quarter (23%) of respondents said they didn't know if their employers were using the technology at the organisational level.Since technology frequently advances more quickly than laws and knowledge, it is unrealistic to expect perfect AI safeguards at this early stage. This disparity is evident in AI, where deployment has accelerated due to intense hype and economic pressure.But early studies like Deloitte's new State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report point to what could very well become a dangerous gap between deployment and safety as industries scale up their use of agents and other powerful AI tools.For now, oversight should be the priority: Businesses need to be aware of the risks associated with their internal use of agents and have policies and procedures in place to ensure they don't go off the rails (and, if they do, that the resulting harm can be managed).Deloitte advises in its new report.","Businesses are rapidly adopting AI agents, with projections showing a surge from 23% to 74% in two years. However, robust safety measures lag significantly, with only 21% of companies reporting adequate oversight.

Japan's second richest man 'drops' plan to spend $50 billion on buying American company after pursuing the deal for months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/japans-second-richest-man-drops-plan-to-spend-50-billion-on-buying-american-company-after-pursuing-the-deal-for-months/articleshow/127566855.cms,"SoftBank's big bet on AI







Japan's second-richest man SoftBank Group chairman Masayoshi Son has reportedly 'dropped' plans to buy the US data center operator Switch Inc. According to a report by Bloomberg, SoftBank Group has halted talks about an acquisition of US data center operator Switch, a setback to founder Masayoshi Son’s ambition to roll out Stargate AI infrastructure. according to people familiar with the matter. The deal would have been one of the Japanese company’s biggest to date.SoftBank's Masayoshi is said to have pursued the Switch deal, of around $50 billion, for months. Masayoshi reportedly believed that direct control of Switch's network of energy-efficient data centers would help Donald Trump's $500 billion Stargate project to generate computing power for partner OpenAI. As per analysts, the deal would have given a much-needed boost to the Stargate Project to build US data centers. In January 2025, soon after Donald Trump's swearing in, Softbank founder Masayoshi had pledged to deploy $100 billion “immediately” alongside OpenAI, Oracle and Abu Dhabi’s MGX.“The end of SoftBank’s deal talks with Switch leaves its data center plans in limbo, as Stargate announcements remain few and far between,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kirk Boodry and Chris Muckensturm wrote in a note.A strategic investment or partnership would fall short of the operational exposure that SoftBank has pursued in areas such as semiconductors and physical AI, they said.However, earlier this month, Masayoshi conceded that a full acquisition was off the table and scrapped a planned January announcement. The two companies still are said to be in active discussions about a partial investment or a partnership. Some within the SoftBank camp had reportedly been wary about the size of the deal as well as the logistics of running data center campuses from Las Vegas to Atlanta, the people said.In the past one year, SoftBank has doubled down on its bets in AI. The Tokyo-based company has taken an 11% stake in OpenAI, injecting $22.5 billion just in December 2025. It bought US chip designer Ampere Computing for $6.5 billion and announced a $5.4 billion acquisition of ABB Ltd.’s robotics unit. To finance some of that cost, SoftBank has sold down its T-Mobile US shares. Not just this, the company also has unloaded its entire Nvidia stake to fund its OpenAI stake.SoftBank has also lined up additional liquidity options, including potential asset sales, a PayPay IPO, and margin loans backed by its Arm Holdings Plc stake, to concentrate resources on AI infrastructure projects.",Japan's second-richest man SoftBank Group chairman Masayoshi Son has reportedly 'dropped' plans to buy the US data center operator Switch Inc.

Microsoft rolls out Maia 200 AI chips; launch note also has 'message' for Google and Amazon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-rolls-out-maia-200-ai-chips-launch-note-also-has-message-for-google-and-amazon/articleshow/127565062.cms,"Satya Nadella Recounts 2023 Story Of Indian Farmer Leveraging AI Bot For Subsidies

Microsoft’s Superintelligence team to use Maia 200 AI chip

Microsoft's 'message' to Amazon and Google on Maia 200





Microsoft is rolling out its second-generation artificial intelligence chip, Maia 200 AI chip. The all-new AI chip aims to be a potential alternative to leading processors from Nvidia and to offerings from cloud rivals Amazon and Google. The Maia 200 chip comes two years after Microsoft said it had developed its first AI chip, the Maia 100, which was never made available for cloud clients to rent. The chips use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s (TSMC) 3 nanometer process. Four are connected together inside each server. They rely on Ethernet cables, rather than the InfiniBand standard. Nvidia sells InfiniBand switches following its 2020 Mellanox acquisition.This time it will be different. Scott Guthrie, Microsoft’s executive vice president for cloud and AI, said in a blog post that, for the new chip, there will be “wider customer availability in the future.” In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said, ""Our newest AI accelerator Maia 200 is now online in Azure. Designed for industry-leading inference efficiency, it delivers 30% better performance per dollar than current systems.And with 10+ PFLOPS FP4 throughput, ~5 PFLOPS FP8, and 216GB HBM3e with 7TB/s of memory bandwidth it's optimized for large-scale AI workloads. It joins our broader portfolio of CPUs, GPUs, and custom accelerators, giving customers more options to run advanced AI workloads faster and more cost-effectively on Azure. ""Guthrie called the Maia 200 “the most efficient inference system Microsoft has ever deployed.” Developers, academics, AI labs and people contributing to open-source AI models can apply for a preview of a software development kit.Some of the first units will go to Microsoft’s superintelligence team lead by Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman. The chips will also be used to power the Copilot assistant for businesses and AI models, including OpenAI’s latest, that Microsoft rents to cloud customers. ""It's a big day. Our Superintelligence team will be the first to use Maia 200 as we develop our frontier AI models,"" said Suleyman in a post on X.Microsoft said each Maia 200 packs more high-bandwidth memory than a third-generation Trainium AI chip from Amazon Web Services or from Google’s seventh-generation tensor processing unit. ""Maia 200 the most performant, first-party silicon from any hyperscaler, with three times the FP4 performance of the third generation Amazon Trainium, and FP8 performance above Google’s seventh generation TPU. Maia 200 is also the most efficient inference system Microsoft has ever deployed, with 30% better performance per dollar than the latest generation hardware in our fleet today,"" wrote Guthrie. For those unaware, a hyperscaler is a massive-scale cloud service provider (such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud) that offers immense, on-demand computing power, storage, and networking capabilities, designed for extreme scalability. The big five hyperscalers are Amazon's AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft's Azure, IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud.Microsoft’s chip push started years after Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet began designing their own chips. As a report in Bloomberg says, all three tech giants have similar aim: Cost-effective machines that can be seamlessly plugged into data centers and offer savings and other efficiencies to cloud customers. The high costs and short supply of the latest industry-leading chips from Nvidia has fueled a scramble to find alternative sources of computing power.","Microsoft is rolling out its second-generation artificial intelligence chip, Maia 200 AI chip.

"Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan is ‘addicted’ to this AI tool, says: ‘I didn’t sleep till…’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/y-combinator-ceo-garry-tan-is-addicted-to-this-ai-tool-says-i-didnt-sleep-till/articleshow/127557822.cms,"Y Combinator's Garry Tan is reportedly 'addicted' to Anthropic's Claude Code, an AI tool that writes, fixes, and explains code. This highlights a significant shift in software development, with AI expected to become central by early 2026. Experts suggest manual line-by-line coding is ending, with developers focusing more on design and problem-solving.

“This has been said a thousand times before, but allow me to add my own voice: the era of humans writing code is over.

Disturbing for those of us who identify as SWEs, but no less true. That's not to say SWEs don't have work to do, but writing syntax directly is not it.”

How AI-powered coding is changing software engineer roles





Y Combinator President and CEO Garry Tan is ‘addicted’ to Anthropic’s new artificial intelligence (AI) tool, Claude Code. In a post shared on the social media site X (formerly Twitter), Tan wrote, “So addicted to Claude Code, I stayed up 19 hours yesterday and didn't sleep till 5 AM. ” Claude Code is an AI-based coding tool launched by Anthropic in October 2025 for more users, which runs directly in the terminal. It lets developers write, fix, explain, and manage code using simple, natural language commands. The tool understands the whole project codebase, which helps it add features, fix bugs, write tests, and more.’It integrates into current command-line workflows and functions similarly to an assistant programmer without the need for an integrated development environment. Software that facilitates code writing, testing, and debugging in one location is called an IDE. The development process can be made more effective and manageable by using Claude Code to automate processes like writing tests, submitting pull requests, and managing commits.This comment comes at a time when the software development industry, which was considered one of the more labour-intensive sectors of the tech industry, is undergoing a significant transition.By early 2026, AI is expected to transition from a supporting technology to a more central part of the code development process. This indicates that the way software is developed, maintained, and scaled is undergoing a significant transition. It is also suggested that the days of manually coding line by line are over.Recently, this view was also shared by the creator of NodeJS, an open-source JavaScript-based coding tool, Ryan Dahl. Rather than focusing on syntax and repetitive implementation, developers are being encouraged to concentrate on higher-level work. Design decisions, system architecture, problem-solving, and oversight are increasingly becoming key responsibilities for software engineers in an AI-driven development environment.In his recent X post, Dahl wrote,Software engineers have been writing code by hand for many years. Now, AI-powered tools such as Claude Code can write complex code on their own in just seconds, work that earlier could take months to complete manually.This does not imply that developers are no longer needed, according to Dahl. Rather, he claims that their role is evolving and that their skills are becoming increasingly important. These days, AI is capable of handling repetitive coding tasks and typing commands. But decision-making, creativity, and problem-solving will still require developers.This represents a major change in the field. Moving away from writing syntax line by line can be unsettling for developers who have a strong connection to hands-on coding. Dahl admits that some engineers might find this change ""disturbing"".However, the role of the software developer is not disappearing. It is evolving, with greater emphasis on adapting to new tools, learning continuously, solving broader problems, and focusing on design, strategy, and building systems centred on human needs.","Y Combinator's Garry Tan is reportedly 'addicted' to Anthropic's Claude Code, an AI tool that writes, fixes, and explains code.

How Samsung is competing with Micron and SK Hynix in the AI memory chip market





Samsung Electronics is reportedly closing in on a critical milestone in the intensifying artificial intelligence (AI) memory chip market. The South Korean tech giant is nearing certification from Nvidia for its next-generation HBM4 memory chips and positioning itself to better compete with domestic rival SK Hynix, a report claims. A Bloomberg report citing sources familiar with the matter claims that Samsung has entered the final qualification phase with Nvidia after submitting initial samples in September 2025. Samsung is now preparing for mass production of HBM4 in February and will be ready to ship soon, though exact timing remains uncertain.The development marks significant progress for Samsung in the high-bandwidth memory market, where Nvidia requires vast quantities of HBM to power its AI accelerators. The report notes that Samsung's shares gained as much as 3.2% in Seoul following the development. On the other hand, the shares of SK Hynix also fell by roughly the same amount, which is indicative of the competitive forces at play between the two South Korean firms in this rapidly growing industry.Samsung currently trails SK Hynix and Micron Technology in the AI memory market. However, in recent weeks, all three companies have seen their shares rise substantially as the AI rush has created a shortage of memory across the broader electronics industry.Among them, the three leading memory chip manufacturers have gained roughly $900 billion in market value since the start of September 2025.Investor expectations are now growing that Samsung may be able to join its rivals in supplying components for Nvidia's upcoming Rubin processors. So far, Nvidia has relied heavily on SK Hynix for the advanced memory chips it pairs with its high-end AI accelerators.Earlier, The Korea Economic Daily reported that Samsung is scheduled to begin HBM4 shipments to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. next month. Both Samsung and SK Hynix are scheduled to hold earnings calls this week, during which they are expected to discuss progress on their HBM4 chips.","Samsung is reportedly closing in on a critical milestone in the artificial intelligence (AI) memory chip market.

Workday CEO sees growing demand for AI tools as software companies expand AI stacks

“We are uniquely positioned to be one of the AI winners in the enterprise because of our incumbency, and lastly, because of the trust we get from our customers,”





Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach has dismissed concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) will affect software business models. He called such fears overblown, despite his company cutting over 1,700 jobs last year as part of an AI-focused restructuring. In an interview with CNBC’sfrom the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Eschenbach said,adding that AI is a tailwind andfor the company.The comments follow Workday's elimination of about 1,750 jobs, or 8.5% of its workforce, in February 2025. In a memo sent to employees and published in a securities filing, Eschenbach said the layoffs were necessary to support the company's ongoing growth efforts, including its focus on AI investments. Earlier this week, Workday also signed a three-year deal with OpenAI to strengthen its offerings.According to a CNBC report, software stocks have declined in recent months amid concerns that new AI tools will disrupt the sector and displace longstanding, recurring businesses that once fuelled substantial profits.Workday shares lost 17% last year and have dropped another 15% since the start of 2026, following the company's third-quarter earnings report that included weak subscription revenue guidance.Other software companies have faced similar pressure, with Adobe and Salesforce losing 21% last year, while HubSpot fell more than 40%.Eschenbach said businesses are increasingly relying on Workday for AI tools and access to its first-party data, which the company is using to strengthen its position against third-party tools.He added that many software companies are investing in additional tools to expand their AI offerings and address growing competitive pressure in the AI space.Eschenbach noted.","Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach has dismissed concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) will affect software business models.

“It does not eliminate all software engineers but enables experienced engineers who ACE well to be much more productive,” he said, adding “It is also going to reshape our industry but that is a separate topic.”



What is vibe coding







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has suggested a new way to describe vibe-coding, a word that became one of the biggest “headache” of engineers in 2025. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Vembu argued that the termdoes not reflect the discipline required in real engineering work. He said that he prefers a new termto describe the growing use of AI tools in writing and maintaining software. In the post, Vembu said the focus should remain on solid engineering practices, even as AI becomes more deeply embedded in coding workflows.Sharing the post, Sridhar Vembu wrote:Vembu says that the term ACE does not remove the need for software engineers. Instead, it allows experienced engineers to “be much more productive”.Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming. It refers to building apps and websites by chatting with AI instead of writing code line by painstaking line.Vembu’s comments come at a time when AI-powered coding tools are being widely adopted by developers and companies to speed up software development. His remarks also highlight concerns among industry leaders that such language may underplay the importance of structure, accountability, and long-term reliability in software systems.Collins Dictionary named “vibe-coding” as its word of the year for 2025.","Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming.

""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

What Tim Cook means by “loving museums”

Apple CEO Tim Cook (Image source: Bloomberg)

“I don’t want to live in one”: A warning against stagnation

A lesson in leadership and decision-making

Why the quote resonates beyond technology

A reflection of Tim Cook’s leadership style

Why the quote still matters

""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

,





Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple , doesn't give long speeches or use dramatic slogans. When he does say something, it's usually short, to the point, and well thought out. One of these lines is his quote:. The sentence is easy to understand, like a conversation. But it has a deeper meaning about how to move forward, how to be a leader, and how businesses and people should plan for the future.The quote is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Museums are places where history is kept. They keep ideas, inventions, and events that changed the world. They help us remember where we came from. Tim Cook has never said that we should forget or ignore history. Instead, he says that it is dangerous to get too comfortable with it.In today's world, where things change quickly, especially in technology, staying still can cost you a lot. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.Museums are very important to society. They keep culture, new ideas, and human accomplishments safe. Future generations would lose touch with the ideas and work that shaped the past if there were no museums. Tim Cook saying ""love"" shows that he cares. He thinks it's important to learn from the past. He likes what has already been made.Apple has a long and well-known history. People often study and admire the company's past innovations, which include the Macintosh, the iPod, and the iPhone. A lot of these items are now on display in museums and exhibitions all over the world. Cook knows more about this legacy than most people.But liking someone doesn't mean you care about them. His quote makes it clear that history is important to learn about, but it shouldn't be a place where you want to stay, especially in an industry driven by constant innovation, progress, and forward-looking thinking.The second part of the quote is where the real meaning is. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. It means comfort, safety, and familiarity. That comfort can slowly turn into stagnation in business and leadership.Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. The markets change. Technology changes. People's needs change. What worked ten years ago might not work anymore. Businesses that only care about keeping their legacy alive often have a hard time staying relevant.Apple has kept changing under Cook's leadership. The business has grown into services, put more emphasis on user privacy, put money into protecting the environment, and moved into new areas like custom silicon chips. These choices show that the company is willing to try new things, even if the old ones worked.The quote is true for all leaders, not just Apple. People often praise leaders for their past successes, using previous wins as proof of future capability and judgement. People trust you more when you have done well in the past. But depending too much on past success can keep you from coming up with new ideas or recognising when the environment has fundamentally shifted.Cook's words make it sound like good leadership needs to be balanced. You can learn from history, but don't let it tell you what to do all the time. Don't let your past experiences tell you what to do. This method lets businesses change instead of fighting it, allowing innovation to emerge naturally rather than defensively.This idea also works for people. Careers, skills, and fields of work change over time. It can be harder to grow if you hold on too tightly to what used to work. The quote quietly encourages people to be open and curious, even when change is hard, uncertain, or uncomfortable at first.This quote stands out because it is so simple. It doesn't use business jargon or technical language. People can all understand it. Most people know how nice it is to stick to their routines and how hard it is to try something new.In a broader sense, the remark addresses how cultures deal with progress. Traditions and fresh ideas frequently conflict. It is crucial to respect tradition and history while also being open to new experiences. Cook's remark acknowledges the history. It simply refuses to be confined by it.This balance is especially important now that technology is changing quickly and making people wonder about jobs, education, and social structures. The quote tells people that progress doesn't mean forgetting the past; it means building on it in a smart way.People often say that Tim Cook is calm, level-headed, and practical. His way of leading is different from Steve Jobs's, who was known for making bold and dramatic statements. Cook does things in a quieter way. His words are more likely to make you think than to make you angry, reflecting patience, consistency, ethical decision-making, and a long-term focus rather than short-term applause, values that align closely with Apple’s culture and leadership philosophy.This quote fits that pattern. It doesn't need attention. It makes you think. It gives a point of view without making people agree. That restraint is one reason it feels real.The quote doesn't give a big picture; it gives a way of thinking. It talks about how Cook sees progress, responsibility, and long-term success.is still true because it describes a problem that everyone faces. How can we remember the past without letting it control us? How do we go on without losing what matters?It's clear but not obvious what Tim Cook means. Value history. Take something away from it. Then decide to go on.In one short sentence, the CEO of Apple reminds us that we can choose to make progress. It takes work, curiosity, and a willingness to go beyond what you already know. Museums keep the past alive. But the future is being built somewhere else.","Tim Cook's quote has a deeper meaning about how to move forward.

Blinkit CEO Albinder Singh Dhindsa will take over as CEO. Goyal will transition to a non-executive Director and Vice Chairman role, pending shareholder approval, to maintain focus on Eternal's growth while exploring new ventures.

Deepinder Goyal has tendered his resignation as Director, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company, effective close of business on February 1, 2026.

Albinder Singh Dhindsa has been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company with effect from February 1, 2026. Further, the Board of Directors (“Board”) recommended the appointment of Deepinder Goyal as the Director and Vice Chairman of the Board, effective upon shareholders' approval.

”

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.""

Read Deepinder Goyal's full letter that he sent to shareholders

“Dear Shareholders,

Today, I am going to step away from the Group CEO role, and subject to shareholders' approval, will remain on the board of directors as Vice Chairman.

Albinder Dhindsa

(Albi) will be Eternal's new Group CEO.

Why this change

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.

This transition allows Eternal to remain sharply focused, while giving me the space to explore ideas that do not fit Eternal's risk profile.

What doesn't change

I have spent eighteen years, almost half my life, building this company. I will continue doing that.

Albi, Akshant, and I will continue to work closely together, as we always have. Our partnership, shared context, and trust remain unchanged. All our business CEOs will continue operating with the autonomy they have always had.

My involvement in long-term strategy, culture, leadership development, and ethics and governance, continues. This is where I have increasingly focused lately anyway.

What changes

The centre of gravity for operating decisions moves to Albi.

As Group CEO, he will own day-to-day execution, operating priorities, and business decisions.

Blinkit's journey from acquisition to breakeven happened under his leadership.

He built the team, the culture, the supply chain, the operating rhythm. He has the DNA of a battle-hardened founder and his ability to execute far exceeds mine. He is more than capable of leading Eternal as Group CEO.

Blinkit remains our largest growth opportunity and will remain as Albi's top priority. Our decentralized structure, where each business has a CEO with full ownership, continues unchanged - and will help Albi execute this well.

On alignment and ESOPs

My financial future remains meaningfully tied to Eternal, and my incentives remain aligned with long-term shareholder value creation.

As part of this transition, all of my unvested ESOPs will revert to the ESOP pool. This ensures that Eternal continues to have meaningful wealth-creation opportunities for its next generation of leaders, while strengthening long-term retention without incremental shareholder dilution.

Looking ahead

Eighteen years ago, the idea that a menu scanning company could be worth tens of billions of dollars, provide livelihoods to hundreds of thousands of people, and serve millions of families daily would have seemed absurd. We helped prove it was possible. And there's a lot in store for Eternal to do over the next few decades.

I believe Eternal is not going to lose focus or momentum through this change. Rather, it is reinforcing its institutional strength.

And personally, I gain the flexibility to explore ideas that sit outside Eternal's scope, without compromising the company's priorities.

I want Eternal to become India's most valuable company. I want us to serve a billion customers. I want us to create the most positive impact on society. I want us to be the source of livelihoods for millions of Indians. None of that changes.

This is a change in title, not in commitment towards outcomes. Eternal remains my life's work.

Thank you for your continued trust and support.

Deepinder Goyal”

When White House called Amazon's tariff plan an 'hostile act'





In April 2025, a pissed Donald Trump made a call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after learning that the company is planning to display the added cost of tariffs on certain items. Trump made the call to Bezos to complain about reports that Amazon was considering to highlight the cost of US tariffs next to prices for certain products on the company’s website. Trump later told reporters about the call to Amazon founder and said it was a “good call.” “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump told reporters. “He solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.”Punchbowl News first reported that Amazon will soon “display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs — right next to the product’s total listed price.” The move came after Trump slapped 145% tariffs on imports from China and a 10% minimum tax on all other countries.Now months later, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC in an interview Jassy at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Amazon.com is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures stemming from the US President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""We did a lot of pre-buying in the early part of 2025 to enable us to try and keep prices as low as possible for customers,"" Jassy said.He added, ""And a lot of our third-party sellers did a lot of forward-staging in our fulfillment network for the same reasons. And that supply is run out in the fall, so you start to see some of the tariffs creep in to some of the prices, some of the items.""""Some third-party sellers are raising prices in response while others are absorbing the costs in hopes of driving more demand,"" Jassy went on to add. ""Our priority is to try to figure out how to keep prices low as possible,"" Jassy said. ""At a certain point, because retail is a mid-single-digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it.""The warning marks a shift from the Amazon leader's commentary on tariffs last year. While he cautioned in April that third-party sellers could need to pass along tariff costs, he said on several occasions that Amazon had not seen selling prices appreciably rise from tariffs. ""Amazon's consumers overall have fared well. But we'll have to see what happens in 2026,"" CEO Jassy had said.The company has also maintained so far that over the past year it was seeing very little impact on consumer behavior and product prices from tariffs. It has doubled down on expanding product categories and speeding up delivery timelines to shield demand.In April 2025, at a briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the move a “hostile and political act,” adding that she had spoken about the matter with President Trump earlier. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Levitt’s comments, saying it’s a hostile act if a company goes out of its way to “make it seem” like tariffs have caused prices to change.“It’s nonsense,” he said Tuesday in a CNBC interview. “A 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price,” he added, referring to the nearly universal baseline tariff on all countries. “The only price will change would be a product that we don’t make here, like a mango.” The 10% tariff, however, is hardly the only one in effect.",Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the company is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Satya Nadella said it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.

Debate at Davos



Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid







Palantir CEO Alex Karp has now issued a stark warning about the future of work in the age of artificial intelligence. Karp predicted that humanities-based jobs will now be among the first casualties. As reported by Business Insider, speaking during a panel at the World Economic Forum, Karp revealed that his own academic background which is a philosophy degree from Haverford College, a law degree from Stanford, and a Ph.D. in social theory from Germany, cautioned that such qualifications may no longer be viable. “AI will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp said. “You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market.”Karp believes that workers with technical and vocational training will be in then highest demand. He quoted battery manufacturing as an exampple, nothing that technicians in such industries are “very valuable, if not irreplaceable.” “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” Karp told BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who moderated the discussion.Not all leaders at Davos agreed with Karp’s assessment. Finance executives told Business Insider that liberal arts degrees may actually become more valuable, as AI takes over routine financial analysis. Critical and creative thinking, they argued, is increasingly prized in young recruits.Meanwhile, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei highlighted another trend: entry-level hiring is already declining due to AI. Amodei said software and coding roles at Anthropic were down across junior and mid-level positions.Recently, Karp said that value of skilled workers is rising. Speaking on TBPN, a tech talk show broadcast live from Palantir’s customer conference, AIP Con 8, Karp said, “Workers become more valuable. The person at the top is actually crazy valuable. People with technical expertise are crazy valuable."" His words underscore a trend that’s become increasingly apparent in Silicon Valley: in a world awash with automation and AI, human expertise, especially deep technical skill, has become a rare commodity.Karp calls these individuals “artist-shaped people,” a nod to the company’s unique culture, sometimes referred to internally as “an artist colony.” He added, “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid.”. The statement doesn’t just reflect Palantir’s philosophy; it mirrors the market reality, where top AI researchers and engineers have recently netted unprecedented paydays, sometimes reaching hundreds of millions, while thousands of others were laid off from companies like Microsoft and Meta.","Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid. “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid,” he said.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. According to a Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126501256,imgsize-19268,width-400,resizemode-4/126501256.jpg"

Europe is pushing for Digital Sovereignty to reduce dependence on American tech companies: What exactly is Digital Sovereignty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/europe-is-pushing-for-digital-sovereignty-to-reduce-dependence-on-american-tech-companies-what-exactly-is-digital-sovereignty/articleshow/127551274.cms,"“European technological sovereignty.”

What is Digital Sovereignty

Benefits of Digital Sovereignty





Europe is pushing for Digital Sovereignty to reduce its dependence on American technology companies, and recently, the European Parliament backed a report calling forMembers of the European Parliament (MEP) urged the European Commission to accelerate regulatory reforms and major investments in digital infrastructure. The report targets critical sectors including cloud computing, semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI).Rapporteur MEP Sarah Knafo (ESN/FRA) said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) noted that while some of the findings and measures were softened, this a vital step toward “shielding European digital infrastructure” from foreign actors. Here, we will understand what is Digital Sovereignty, Sovereign Cloud and its benefits, and the big names to know.Digital sovereignty is term which can be often used interchangeably with data sovereignty. It is basically the principle or a set of rules and regulations that legally allows a country or region (like the European Union or the United Kingdom) to maintain absolute control over its digital assets, infrastructure and citizen data.The need for digital sovereignty arose as the priority from global access in the internet age shifted from security and privacy. The rise of cloud computing and mass data harvesting for advertising raised significant concerns, forcing the governments to find means to regulate it and keep the data of its citizens and offices safe.Countries moved for “data residency” to ensure all the data stays within national borders to prevent it from being exploited by outside entities or accessed by foreign law enforcement. However, to satisfy these requirements, there was a compromise – lose all the benefits of modern technology. This gave the idea of Sovereign Cloud – where nations can deploy security measures without losing the benefits of modern technology.Unlike the standard global cloud, a sovereign cloud is a specialised environment that ensures all data, metadata and administrative operations remain under the jurisdiction of a specific nation.What’s interesting is that the infrastructure can be housed in a provider’s facility or the customer’s home soil but the data remains logically or physically isolated, and is accessible only via secure, non-internet communication links. For example, Google Cloud partnered with Thales in France to host sensitive military data that never leaves French soil.The benefits of going sovereign go beyond avoiding massive GDPR fines – something that has concerned US tech giants in the last few years. Digital Sovereignty offers geopolitical resilience, especially in the times of trade wars. Having data in a sovereign cloud prevents a foreign government from “turning off” access to critical systems. It also simplifies the supply chain, as large cloud providers can procure hardware like AI chips more easily than a single local firm.However, there are challenges because of the fast moving tech industry. Sovereign clouds often face delays in feature rollouts, such as new AI tools, which typically hit global regions before they are cleared for sovereign partitions. However, this is also changing due to innovations in communication technology. In 2026, the world's biggest tech companies have started embracing it as a business model.Amazon Web Services (AWS) recently launched its European Sovereign Cloud (ESC) in Germany, physically isolated from its global network. Oracle, operates two separate EU Sovereign regions in Frankfurt and Madrid.Similarly, Microsoft’s “Cloud for Sovereignty” uses local partners like Bleu in France to ensure the infrastructure is operated by local entities. It’s competitor Google focuses on “Trusted Cloud” partnerships with firms like T-Systems (Deutsche Telekom) to manage data centers on their behalf.","Digital sovereignty is term which can be often used interchangeably with data sovereignty.

David Sacks has warned that the US risks losing the global AI competition to China due to excessive negativity and overregulation around the technology. During a conversation with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the technology investor, who US President Donald Trump appointed as his AI and crypto czar, cautioned about a mentality that he calls theThis belief that unconstrained AI will harm humanity or cause societal collapse represents afor America. He expressed concern that acould lead to overly restrictive policies, citing Senator Bernie Sanders' recent call for a moratorium on data centre construction as an example.Sacks told Benioff. He pointed out thatespecially in the US, compared to other parts of the world, as indicated by the 2025 Edelman Trust Barometer.The debate highlights tensions between Silicon Valley leaders advocating for rapid AI development and policymakers calling for stronger safety measures, with Trump taking a deregulatory stance that his administration's technology advisor argues is necessary to maintain American competitiveness against Chinese rivals.Since taking office, Trump has supported a hands-off approach to AI development. In an AI Action Plan released last summer, the administration removed many rules governing AI research, a change from Biden-era policies that mandated federal oversight of AI governance. Trump went further in December with an executive order that reduced state-level protections for AI development. Global AI dominance, the order said, would require American companies to beSacks repeated the administration's opposition to state-level rules elsewhere at Davos as well. In a recent interview with CNBC, Sacks criticised California's proposed billionaire wealth tax, a one-time, 5% tax on total wealth for residents worth more than $1 billion, which will be on the ballot in November.Sacks, who moved from California to Texas last month, said.Sacks is one of several wealthy California residents who have criticised the proposal and decided to leave the state, including Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Speaking to CNBC, he called the plan a potentiallyof state overreach.Despite Silicon Valley leaders' departures and some AI companies' welcoming the Trump administration's reduced regulations, the unrestricted approach to AI development has also faced criticism as research advances rapidly. Concerns about automation-driven job losses, a financial market collapse, and the spread of potentially unsafe AI models have reduced some of the stock market's AI enthusiasm.Even some AI leaders are concerned. In November, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said on 60 Minutes that he was ""with how AI companies were now being tasked with self-governing, saying he preferredSupporters tend to justify reduced regulation as necessary to keep pace with AI competitors in China. China's AI research is rapidly closing the gap with the US, as some models, particularly those developed by the Hangzhou-based startup DeepSeek, are matching or even exceeding Western models' performance in specific reasoning tasks.In his conversation with Benioff, Sacks cited recent research on global AI optimism rates, published in 2025 by Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. Optimism was high in China, where 83% of survey respondents saw AI as more beneficial than harmful. To compare, in the US, only 39% felt as optimistic.But while figures like Trump and Sacks call for an AI approach free of restraints, pessimism is not a strictly partisan issue in the US. In December, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a former Republican presidential hopeful, also called for more limits on data centre construction.Last week, a bipartisan House committee heard testimonies on the impact of AI in K–12 education. While some Republican committee members cautioned against hindering innovation through additional regulation, there was broad consensus on the potential risks of exposing children to AI.",US President Donald Trump appointed David Sacks as his AI and crypto czar.

AI opens the door to more immersive gaming





Jack Buser, global director for games at Google Cloud has asked the gaming executives to make sure that their employees understand both the potential and limitations of artificial intelligence. Speaking to Business Insider, Buser compared AI to Tony Stark’s Iron Man Suit — a tool that empowers but doesn’t replace the person inside. “If you’re the CTO of a games company, make that suit of armor available. Make sure that it’s safe. Make sure that you take the time to work with people inside your company so that they can understand what the technology can and can’t do, and what your intentions for the technology are and what they are not,” Buser said.Buser believes that AI is becoming a transformative force in gaming, cutting costs, streamlining operations and accelerating production timelines. He further stressed on the fact that while some developers remain hesitant and the adoption is spreading quickly. “It’s still you inside the suit of armor, but you’re suddenly able to do things you couldn’t do before,” he explained, adding that equipping entire studios with AI tools can remove drudgery and boost creativity.Buser also emphasised that AI integration is not only about technology pipelines but also about cultural adaptation within companies. He feels that the executives must experiment with AI themselves to understand its strength and weaknesses.“It can be tricky at the executive level. You don’t have a crystal ball of where this is all going. It takes getting your hands dirty, experimenting with the technology, seeing what it does and what it doesn’t do,” he added.Buser also emphasised that AI opens the door to more immersive “living games” — titles that evolve continuously after release. With AI, updates could be faster, more personalized, and more seamless, creating real-time experiences for players.He predicted that 2026 will be the year companies scale AI across entire workflows, moving from isolated use cases to multiple AI-driven features that directly shape player experiences.","Jack Buser, global director for games at Google Cloud has asked the gaming executives to make sure that their employees understand both the potential and limitations of artificial intelligence.

He argues the future lies in leveraging private enterprise data, a move Oracle is heavily investing in with massive infrastructure plans. While competitors are also building enterprise AI, Oracle's existing database dominance could be key to its success in this next AI wave.

The real money is in private data, not public models

Oracle's massive AI infrastructure bet faces stiff competition





Oracle cofounder and CTO Larry Ellison has put his finger on what he sees as the fatal flaw in today's AI race: every major model, from ChatGPT to Gemini to Meta's Llama, is trained on essentially the same publicly available internet data. During Oracle's fiscal Q2 2026 earnings call in December, Ellison argued this shared foundation is rapidly turning cutting-edge AI into a commodity product with razor-thin differentiation.""All the large language models—OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, xAI—they're all trained on the same data. It's all public data from the internet,"" Ellison said. ""So they're all basically the same. And that's why they're becoming commoditized so quickly.""Ellison's solution? The next gold rush won't be building better foundational models—it'll be enabling AI to work with proprietary enterprise data while keeping it secure. He estimates this second wave of AI will prove ""even larger and more valuable"" than the current boom in GPUs and data centers.Oracle is betting heavily on this vision, projecting roughly $50 billion in capital expenditures for the full year, up from $35 billion estimated just three months earlier.The company argues it has a natural advantage since most high-value private data already lives in Oracle databases. Its AI Data Platform uses techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation to let models query private information in real time without security compromises.The company announced partnerships at Oracle AI World in October, including a 50,000-GPU supercluster with AMD MI450 chips launching in Q3 2026 and the OCI Zettascale10 supercomputer connecting hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. By late 2025, Oracle's cloud backlog had topped $500 billion, driven mostly by AI demand.Still, Ellison's thesis faces headwinds. Synthetic data generation could reduce reliance on exclusive proprietary datasets, while rivals like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are racing to build similar enterprise AI capabilities. The question is whether Oracle's existing grip on enterprise databases will prove decisive—or if the AI landscape will shift before the company's massive infrastructure bets pay off.","Oracle's Larry Ellison believes the AI race is becoming a commodity due to shared internet data.

Apple's AI struggles made outside help inevitable







Apple is preparing to overhaul Siri from a voice assistant into a conversational AI chatbot, marking the most dramatic change since it launched in 2011. The new Siri will run on Google's Gemini models following a partnership Apple finalized earlier this month. Now a new Bloomberg report suggests that Apple is preparing to unveil the upgraded Siri in February 2026.“Apple appears to be less than a month away from unveiling the results of this partnership. The company has been planning an announcement of the new Siri in the second half of February, when it will give demonstrations of the functionality,” reads the report.As per the report, Siri will now integrate Gemini’s advanced generative AI capabilities, enabling more natural conversations, smarter contextual responses and deeper integration with apps. This partnership could give iPhone users access to Google’s cutting-edge AI technology directly within Apple’s ecosystem, a move that signals Apple’s willingness to lean on external AI expertise rather than building everything in-house.Siri will work with both voice and text, handling tasks like content generation, file analysis, summarization, and coding help. It'll integrate with Apple's core apps—Photos, Mail, Messages, Music—and access their content to respond to requests.Apple is also developing a feature letting Siri view open windows and adjust device settings.The deal reflects Apple's rocky journey in AI. The company delayed its major Siri upgrade from spring 2025 to 2026, sidelined AI chief John Giannandrea from development, and lost key talent including foundation models head Ruoming Pang to Meta. Apple's research and development spending has hovered at just 8 per cent of revenue while competitors poured hundreds of billions into AI infrastructure.One former Apple executive summed it up to the FT: the Google deal was ""a necessary byproduct of Apple's decision not to 'go big' on its AI investments like its competitors."" Apple still plans to develop its own trillion-parameter model eventually. But for now, it's betting that Google can deliver what its own teams couldn't.The existing ChatGPT integration with Apple Intelligence remains intact—for now. But analysts aren't optimistic about its future. ""Having two large models, given the economies of scale, wouldn't make a ton of sense for Apple,"" noted Gene Munster at Deepwater Asset Management.","New Siri will run on Google's Gemini models following a partnership Apple finalized earlier this month.

The thrilling and threatening future of AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-thrilling-and-threatening-future-of-ai/articleshow/127529820.cms,"By: Deepak Singh





A unique feature of cutting-edge technologies like AI is their exciting and intimidating prospects. Recent developments in AI present both formidable threats and opportunities. The most outstanding characteristic of AI development is its exponential rate of advancement. Imagine a 700,000-fold increase recorded in the power of AI models in just over a decade. Recall how people were swept off their feet when, in 1965, Gordon Moore first predicted the computing power of chips to double every year. This contrasting rate of change represents the quintessence of what AI has in store.In the past five years, between 2019 and 2024, the capacity of large Language models to understand languages grew 10,000 times. Ray Kurzweil, Director of Engineering at Google, predicts that computers will have human levels of intelligence by 2029, as AI will pass a valid Turing test by then. A new technical term that has gained significance in the new millennium is 'Singularity'. It represents a technological state when machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence. Kurzweil forecasts the singularity to occur by 2045.AI is not a single technology. The forward momentum in AI applications has been accelerated by a bundle of co-working technologies, from chip making to hyper-scale data centers with unprecedented data processing and transmission speeds.Initially, it was a struggle to develop learning models using statistical techniques to enhance the logical thinking abilities of the ICT systems. Then, it was the time for specialized chips that helped scale up the processing power of AI applications phenomenally.Between June 2019 and early 2025, AI-specific chip capabilities have multiplied phenomenally. For example, the performance of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), AI's nerve centers) has increased from 0.14 to 4.5 Petaflops, with their memory expanding from 32GB to 192GB and their memory bandwidth growing from 1 to 8 TB per second. This phenomenon is behind the sharp increase in the use of deep learning models in recent years. However, it is not the galloping speed of chips but the emerging synergies between hardware and software that greatly amplify AI's future.A new breed of AI-based Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools is helping enhance the capacity and performance of chips themselves. Simultaneously, as reported by MIT FutureTech lab, 'AI could itself cause algorithmic progress', creating a virtuous cycle. Even more significant is the surge in AI's self-learning capabilities, which reinforce the reliability of autonomous or Agentic AI. Deep learning models distinguish themselves by their context awareness and ability to predict. Their self-supervised multimodal learning capacities also include reinforcement learning with human feedback. Progress in quantum computing and neuromorphic chips is poised to elevate AI's self-learning to newer heights.We cannot, however, lose sight of the dark clouds on AI's horizon. Large-scale loss of jobs seems imminent. AI is still in a nascent stage, but as it matures, it will also displace jobs in the service sector. Ethical concerns extend beyond privacy issues. Will it exacerbate inequalities in society? Will it abridge personal freedom by deciding on our behalf?","In the past five years, between 2019 and 2024, the capacity of large Language models to understand languages grew 10,000 times.

'Message and warning' to policy makers





Microsoft and Amazon are two of the biggest rivals. The two companies compete in the Cloud, with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The two fight for customers as well sometimes for talent. However, a 'crisis' in America's Washington State has brought the two together. The two companies -- Microsoft and Amazon -- recently took out a full-page ad and wrote an Op-Ed in The Seattle Times on the Washington state’s housing crisis.The Op-Ed titled 'WA must make it easier to build our way out of the housing crisis' was jointly written by Microsoft president Brad Smith; and Amazon’s chief global affairs and legal officer David Zapolsky. The Seattle region “faces a housing emergency that threatens our state’s quality of life, health and economic competitiveness. Each year over the past decade, affordability has declined, commutes have lengthened and our region’s ability to attract and retain talent has been put at greater risk. For some, the impact is even more serious,"" wrote Microsoft and Amazon's top execs.Talking about Microsoft and Amazon's contribution to deal with the crisis, Op-Ed says, ""As leaders at Amazon and Microsoft, we’ve helped advance unprecedented community-focused investments to address the shortage of affordable housing in our home state.Together, our two companies have committed $1.6 billion to preserve and build more than 26,000 affordable homes, benefiting the communities we live, serve and operate in. Not for our employees, but the entire community.""""The lack of affordable housing is a complex problem. But its roots are straightforward.

CEOs & Founders resigning from their own startups?

This is not failure, this is maturity

For years Indian founders believed CEO = Founder = CEO

That idea is outdated

Startups today are growing faster than founders can grow as managers, what works at 10 people breaks at 100 & what works at 100 breaks at 1000

Most founders are great at 0 to 1 and 1 to 10

But beyond a certain growth curve, companies need a different skill set

In global markets this is encouraged, founders step aside and professional CEOs step in

The company wins, the founder still owns the upside & most times, shareholders are better off.

In India we dramatize this as ‘fired’, ‘failure’ & even ‘fraud’

Most of the time it is none of that

I think making oneself replaceable should be one of the key goals of every founder.

That is how companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft became enduring giants.

Often, it is simply the founder choosing what is best for the company



","CEOs & Founders resigning from their own companies is not a new phenomenon. It is a sign of maturity and a sign that the company is on the right track, says Anil Agrawal, founder and CEO of a start-up company in India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127489837,imgsize-190988,width-400,resizemode-4/anupam-mittal.jpg"

Tiktok app is reportedly down in the US. Thousands of people are reporting problems with the TikTok app Sunday morning. According to the DownDetector website, which tracks websites uptime, outage reports peaked overnight with more than 35,000. Some 65% users showed problem with the app not working properly, 23% reported total outage and some 13% claimed facing issues with their Tiktok feed. TikTok has so far not officially acknowledged the outage.The outage comes just days after TikTok finalised its deal to create a new American entity, avoiding the threat of a ban in the United States. Earlier this week, TikTok announced that its Chinese owner, ByteDance, had struck a deal with a group of non-Chinese investors to create a new US TikTok. The deal concluded a six-year legal saga that saw the app banned by Congress and ensnared in politicking between two global superpowers.Investors including software giant Oracle; MGX, an Emirati investment firm; and Silver Lake, another investment firm, will own more than 80% of the new venture. That list also includes the personal investment entity for Dell founder Michael Dell, and other companies, TikTok said.Adam Presser, TikTok’s former head of operations, will be the CEO for the US TikTok.Under the new arrangement, Oracle, MGX and Silver Lake will each own 15% of TikTok’s US operations. ByteDance will own just under 20%. The other investors include Dell’s office and a long list of investment companies, including affiliates of General Atlantic and Susquehanna, both of which previously invested in ByteDance. The majority of the seven-member board for US TikTok will be American, according to a December memo to TikTok employees.The deal is aimed to loosen TikTok’s ties to China and address national security concerns that Beijing could use the app to surveil or manipulate its more than 200 million users in the United States. The changes enable “our U.S. users to continue to discover, create, and thrive as part of TikTok’s vibrant global community and experience,” Shou Chew, TikTok’s CEO, said in an internal memo that called the move “great news. ” Chew has a seat on the board of US Tiktok.US President Donald Trump celebrated the announcement in a post on Truth Social, the social media platform he owns, calling it a “dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion.” “I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok!” he wrote, adding, “I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok.”(developing story)","Outage comes days after TikTok finalised its deal to create a new American entity.

The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!





An international group of plaintiffs has reportedly filed a class-action lawsuit against Meta-owned WhatsApp, accusing the company of defrauding billions of users by allegedly maintaining ‘backdoor’ access to private communications that the company claims are ""end-to-end encryption"" (E2EE). Filed in the US District Court for Northern California, the lawsuit challenges Meta’s marketing of E2EE feature, a security standard which the company claims protects the messages on the app and ensures only the sender and recipient can read a message.According to a report by Bloomberg, the lawsuit claims that Meta’s privacy claims are false as the company WhatsApp “store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp users’ purportedly ‘private’ communications”. The plaintiffs represented users from India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico and South Africa. The suit also alleges that the company retains the ability to decrypt and review the substance of messages for data analysis and internal monitoring.Meta has responded to the allegations and says that the lawsuit on the basis of WhatsApp claims is “frivolous” and “absurd.” Company spokesperson Andy Stone confirmed that Meta will seek legal sanctions against the plaintiffs’ counsel for bringing the case forward.“Any claim that people’s WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false. WhatsApp has been end-to-end encrypted using the Signal protocol for a decade. This lawsuit is a frivolous work of fiction,"" Stone said in an emailed statement to the publication.If the court certifies the class-action status, Meta may face unprecedented liability given WhatsApp’s user base of over 2 billion people.",A group of international plaintiffs has reportedly filed a class-action lawsuit against Meta-owned WhatsApp. The lawsuit accuses the company of defrauding billions of users by allegedly maintaining ‘backdoor’ access to private communications.

Researchers say Russian military intelligence hackers may be behind December cyberattacks in Poland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/researchers-say-russian-military-intelligence-hackers-may-be-behind-december-cyberattacks-in-poland/articleshow/127480442.cms,"Hackers used 'DynoWiper' malware to attack Polish energy system







Researchers have linked the massive, multi-pronged cyberattack on Poland’s power grid in late December to hackers linked to Russian military intelligence. As per a report by cybersecurity firm ESET (via news agency Reuters), the attempted operation is being described as one of the most aggressive digital assaults on the country in a decade as it tried to knock down the country’s critical energy infrastructure during the final week of the year.As per the report, the researchers identified the group as Sandworm, an elite unit within Russia’s GRU (military intelligence) with a history of launching some of the world's most destructive cyber operations.According to the findings, the hackers attempted to deploy a new strain of malware dubbed DynoWiper which has been designed to act as a “wiper” – a type of malicious code in a software that systematically destroys files and erases data on targeted systems, effectively rendering the power grid’s control hardware inoperable.Polish authorities and ESET researchers confirmed that despite the severity of the attempt, the attack failed. This is in line with earlier statements from Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who declared earlier this month that the nation's defenses successfully repelled the intrusion.“We’re not aware of any successful disruption occurring as a result of this attack,” ESET stated in its analysis.The timing of the assault was noted as a symbolic “anniversary strike” by the Slovakia-based researchers. Interestingly, the December attempt to down the power system occurred exactly ten years after Sandworm carried out a historic attack on the Ukrainian power grid. The operation in 2015 resulted in the first-ever malware-facilitated blackout in history, leaving hundreds of thousands of people in the dark.","Hackers used 'DynoWiper' malware to attack Polish energy system in late December.

I left Meta because…: Yann LeCun clarifies why he quit





Yann LeCun, former Chief AI Scientist at Meta and the “Godfather of AI”, has crticised the Silicon Valley giants, describing the industry as “LLM-pilled”. He warned that LeCun warned that the talent war between tech giants where they are hiring AI researchers is being used as a strategic weapon to stifle innovation as they are doing the same thing.“The AI industry is completely LLM-pilled, as they say. And in Silicon Valley, everybody is working on the same thing. They're all digging the same trench. They are stealing each other's engineers so that they they can't afford to do something different, because if they start going on the tangent. They're all doing the same thing,” he said in a talk whose video is being shared on the social media.His comments came following his departure from Meta. Not just AI talent war, LeCun also critcised the AI industry's overreliance on large language models (LLMs), noting that this is not enough to build superintelligence. LeCun said that even Meta’s engineers were also chasing the same narrow path, which prompted him tio quit and found a lab focused on predictive “world models.”“And it's one big reason I left meta, right, because Meta also became very LLM-pilled. You know with sort of recent research thing, and it's fine, you know, it's a strategic decision that I cannot imagine that we can build agentic systems without those systems having an ability to predict in advance, what the consequences of their actions are going to be,” he said.He pointed out that a true agentic system – one that can take decisions on your behalf – cannot be build if it does not have the ability to predict the consequences, and that is not possible with LLMs.“We cannot build true agentic systems without the ability to predict the consequences of actions, just like humans do. Is that we know that we can predict the consequence? Consequences of our actions. And that's where it allows us to plan,” he noted.LeCun’s exit from Meta appears to be the result of a massive internal restructuring.

5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event

Background of Siri privacy lawsuit





iPhone users in the United States have started receiving payments from Apple’s USD 95 million settlement linked to a class action lawsuit over Siri privacy. The payouts began this week, according to multiple users who reported receiving direct deposits. The settlement relates to claims that Apple’s Siri voice assistant recorded conversations without user intent. Apple agreed to settle the case last year, while denying any wrongdoing. Apple accepted users' claims in mid-2025. As per a 9to5Mac report, eligible users who filed on time are now seeing funds deposited into their bank accounts or payment apps. Others who chose alternative payment options are still waiting to receive their settlement amounts.The lawsuit dates back to concerns raised in 2019 about unintended Siri activations. To qualify for the settlement, users had to own at least one Siri-enabled Apple device between September 17, 2014, and December 31, 2024. They also needed to claim that Siri activated without their intent during that period.Each claimant was allowed to submit claims for up to five devices. While the total settlement amount was USD 95 million, the final payout per device is lower than earlier estimates.Initial projections suggested users could receive up to USD 20 per device, with a maximum payout of USD 100. However, settlement administrators later calculated that actual payments would be about USD 8.02 per device, with a maximum of USD 40.10 for users who claimed the full five devices.Users who selected direct deposit have begun receiving payments. Those who opted for prepaid gift cards or paper checks are expected to receive them by email or mail. Settlement administrators have advised users to check spam folders and physical mailboxes.The case began after a 2019 report by The Guardian revealed that Apple contractors reviewing Siri recordings for quality control could hear private conversations. Apple said that fewer than one percent of Siri interactions were reviewed and that recordings were not linked to user identities.Apple later changed its policies, requiring users to opt in to Siri recording reviews and ending the use of outside contractors for this work. The lawsuit focused mainly on claims that Siri could activate by mistake, leading to recordings of conversations users did not intend to share.Apple has said that Siri recordings were never used for advertising and were not tied to Apple accounts. The company settled the case to move forward while continuing to deny the allegations.","Siri settlement relates to claims that Apple’s Siri voice assistant recorded conversations without user intent.

Risks for the middle class





Kristalina Georgieva the managing director of International Monetary Fund has issued a warning that artificial intelligence could transform or eliminate up to 60% of jobs in advanced economies and 40% globally. She described AI technology as a ‘tsunami’ hitting the labour market. As reported by Fortune, Speaking on the closing day of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Georgieva acknowledged the disruptive potential of AI but also pointed to a possible silver lining for the low-wage workers.Georgieva argued that productivity gains from AI, which disproportionately benefit high earners, could spill over into the broader economy. As AI-enhanced professionals earn more, their increased spending power boosts demand for local services such as restaurants, retail, and healthcare. “One in 10 jobs is already enhanced by AI, and the people in these jobs are paid better. When they’re paid better, they spend more money in the local economy. Demand for low-skilled jobs goes up,” Georgieva said.Studies back this view: research in San Francisco found that for each new tech job created, 4.4 additional local service jobs emerged, ranging from cooks to teachers.Despite the potential benefits for low-wage earners, Georgieva cautioned that the middle class faces an increasing pressure. Job not improved by AI risk stagnating wages, while entry-level positions are being eroded by automation, creating barriers for young workers. She described this dynamic as an “accordion of opportunities” — expanding for some, contracting for others.These labor shifts come amid fragile global conditions. The IMF recently upgraded its global growth forecast from 3.1% to 3.3%, but Georgieva warned that growth remains “not strong enough” to manage soaring sovereign debt, now near 100% of GDP, while also funding the massive technological transition AI demands.Georgieva closed with a stark message: “Wake up. AI is for real and it is transforming our world faster than we are getting a handle.” She urged governments and institutions to build inclusive guardrails to ensure the AI revolution does not leave the middle class and developing nations behind.",Kristalina Georgieva the managing director of International Monetary Fund has issued a warning that artificial intelligence could transform or eliminate up to 60% of jobs in advanced economies and 40% globally.

Apple may ask Intel to manufacture chips for devices other than iPhones

""The quality assurance of Skylake was more than a problem. It was abnormally bad. We were getting way too much citing for little things inside Skylake. Basically, our buddies at Apple became the number one filer of problems in the architecture. And that went really, really bad. When your customer starts finding almost as many bugs as you found yourself, you're not leading into the right place,""

“For me this is the inflection point. This is where the Apple guys who were always contemplating switching, they went and looked at it and said: 'Well, we've probably got to do it.' Basically the bad quality assurance of Skylake is responsible for them to actually go away from the platform,”

“This transition will also establish a common architecture across all Apple products, making it far easier for developers to write and optimise their apps for the entire ecosystem,”

Salesforce CEO compares unregulated AI to the ‘dangerous’ social media days







Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has issued a warning to the global technology industry. He has urged for an immediate regulation of artificial intelligence (AI), arguing that an unregulated AI technology can harm children, and regulation can prevent a repeat of the ‘social media failures’ that he says have harmed an entire generation.Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2026 in Davos, Switzerland, Benioff took a more balanced his role as a leader of an AI-driven company. While he described AI as a technology that’s powerful but “dangerous”, he also called for strict guardrails to protect children from it.“AI needs guardrails – evidence now proves kids must be protected, unlike social media’s failures. AI fuels our global growth, but not at any cost – we must protect kids, unlike the social media’s failures,” Benioff said in a post on X. He reshared a clip from his Bloomberg interview which he gave on the sidelines of WEF 2026.Benioff drew a direct parallel between the current unregulated state of AI and the early days of social media. He recalled his 2018 warnings, noting that government took concrete steps and it took them years to implement age restrictions and parental controls.“We're letting all of this AI technology out fully unregulated. And, by the way, you remember, that's true what we did with social media as well, and you probably remember what I said in 2018.here, you know, which was social media was becoming the same kind of very dangerous technology. And look, a lot of governments have made changes around social media now, so you go to a lot of countries,” Benioff said.“If you're not 17-18 years old, you're not going to use social media. There are controls. There are protections we need to get there with. There doesn't need to be any more deaths, you know,” he warned.While talking about hallucinations, Benioff pointed out that the technical instabilities make the technology particularly risky for younger users. Generative AI models are prone to “hallucinations”, which means they generate entirely false or inappropriate information in a very confident manner. He also acknowledged that “AI is great” and “incredible”.“We need to be like taking this seriously, and AI is great. It's incredible, but these models, you know, they're inaccurate. They hallucinate. They're kind of hard to control,” Benioff noted. The billionaire executive’s comments come at a time when Salesforce is aggressively integrating AI into its core business. He says the move is driving success but insists it must not come “at any cost.”",Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff compares unregulated AI to the ‘dangerous’ social media days.

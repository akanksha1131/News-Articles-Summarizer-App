What Zoho‚Äôs Sridhar Vembu wrote on X

On the topic of privacy, there are three distinct cases I want to address:

1. The secret lover case

2. The violation we feel when a company uses our personal data to show ads to us

3. The secret rebel case

The secret lover case also applies to org trade secrets and confidential data but ""secret lover"" is more catchy üòÅ

We work hard to ensure your privacy in case 1. Our tech stack and product are designed with this as a major goal.

Let me come to case 2. By taking a vow to not use your data to try to sell you stuff, we protect you from that sense of distaste or violation. Our strong stand also ensures that corporate confidential data or trade secrets do not get leaked to those ad-related data mining systems.

The secret rebel case is subject to the laws of the nations we operate in. Any company operating in a jurisdiction promising to protect a secret rebel against their own government is making a false promise. Sovereign power always prevails over mere companies. Whether it is Google or Apple, when they operate in India, they have to comply with Indian law and likewise Zoho has to comply with US law when operating in America.

So while secret rebels can communicate like secret lovers do, secret rebels cannot expect courts to affirm their right to plot against their government.

Our stand has been consistent on this matter. I have said these in our Zoholics events in many locations around the world for well over a decade.





Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu outlined his company‚Äôs approach to users‚Äô privacy and the limits of corporate responsibility on X (formerly Twitter) recently. In the post, he described three privacy cases ‚Äì secret lover, use of personal data to show ads and secret rebel. He also emphasized that all companies must follow the laws of the country in which they operate. ‚ÄúWhether it is Google or Apple, when they operate in India, they have to comply with Indian law and likewise Zoho has to comply with US law when operating in America,‚Äù Vembu writes in the post. His remarks comes as the company's messaging platform Arattai gains popularity, topping both Apple App Store and Google Play Store.The first, which he called the ‚Äúsecret lover case,‚Äù refers to personal data, corporate trade secrets, and confidential information. He said Zoho designs its technology and products to protect such data and maintain strict privacy.The second, he said, involves the use of personal data for targeted advertising. Zoho has pledged not to use customer data to sell products or services, a practice Vembu said prevents a sense of violation and protects corporate confidential information from ad-related data-mining systems.The third, the ‚Äúsecret rebel case,‚Äù refers to situations where individuals may seek to challenge their governments.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu outlined his company‚Äôs approach to users‚Äô privacy and the limits of corporate responsibility on X.

It's October, which means Google Japan's Gboard team is back with another wild keyboard concept. This time, they've ditched traditional keys entirely for spinning dials inspired by old rotary phones. You guessed it right‚Äîto type on this keyboard, which Google calls the Gboard Dial Version, you rotate discs to select characters instead of tapping keys.The concept keyboard features nine dials of varying sizes arranged across its surface, each representing different sets of alphanumeric characters and functions. There's even a dedicated dial just for the return key. To type, you stick your finger in the appropriate hole, rotate the dial to your desired character, and release‚Äîletting it spin back to its starting position with a satisfying whir.While rotary phones relied on pulse dialling with electrical signals, Google Japan's version uses modern sensors to track each dial's rotation and convert it into USB signals. The team argues this slower, more deliberate input method could actually reduce typing-related strain and minimise accidental key presses, though you definitely won't be breaking any speed records.True to form with Google Japan's annual keyboard experiments, the Dial Version isn't hitting store shelves.Instead, the team has released all design files‚Äîincluding 3D printer models, circuit board schematics, and firmware‚Äîon GitHub under an Apache 2.0 license. Anyone with the patience and tools can build their own rotary keyboard at home.This wouldn't be Google Japan's first rodeo into the territory of weird keyboards. The team is notorious for its concepts‚Äîa 65-inch-long single-row keyboard, a bendable version that wraps around objects, and a teacup-shaped cylindrical design.Google even created a matching accessory: a mouse stand that automatically turns off your webcam during video calls when you place your mouse on top‚Äîa modern twist on the old ""hang up to disconnect"" phone feature.","Google Japan's Gboard team has created a rotary keyboard.

US lawmakers say China ‚Äòused‚Äô gaps in chip export rules allowed China to buy $38 billion worth chipmaking tools,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-lawmakers-say-china-used-gaps-in-chip-export-rules-allowed-china-to-buy-38-billion-worth-chipmaking-tools/articleshow/124368189.cms,"US Government Shutdown Enters Second Week: Why It Happened & Who It Impacts

China bought chipmaking tools from 5 suppliers



Why US has restricted export of advanced chips to China







Gaps among US and allied export restrictions have allowed Chinese companies to purchase nearly $40 billion worth of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, essentially hitting the efforts to limit Beijing's chipmaking capabilities, according to a bipartisan congressional investigation.According to news agency Reuters, the report by the US House of Representatives Select Committee on China found that misaligned rules among the US, Japan, and the Netherlands enabled non-American toolmakers to sell equipment to Chinese firms that US companies were prohibited from supplying.According to the report, Chinese companies purchased $38 billion in equipment from the five largest semiconductor manufacturing suppliers last year‚Äîa 66% increase from 2022, when many export restrictions were first implemented.Those sales represented nearly 39% of combined revenues for Applied Materials, Lam Research, KLA, ASML and Tokyo Electron, the report found.‚ÄúThese are the sales that made China increasingly competitive in the manufacture of a wide range of semiconductors, with profound implications for human rights and democratic values around the world,‚Äù the report stated.Both Democratic and Republican administrations have sought to restrict China's access to advanced chip technology, viewing the semiconductor industry as critical to national security.Advanced chips are essential for AI development and military modernisation ‚Äì areas where the world's two largest economies are competing for technological supremacy and global influence.The congressional committee called for broader, coordinated restrictions on chipmaking tool sales to China rather than targeting specific Chinese companies with narrower bans.Mark Dougherty, president of Tokyo Electron's US unit, said in an interview that industry sales to China have begun declining this year, partly due to new regulations.‚ÄúI think it's clear, from a U.S. perspective, there's an outcome that is still desired that has not yet been achieved,‚Äù Dougherty told Reuters.","Chinese companies purchased $38 billion in equipment from the five largest semiconductor manufacturing suppliers last year.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced that it has banned several ChatGPT accounts with suspected links to Chinese government entities after those users requested proposals for monitoring social media conversations. In its latest public threat report, the Microsoft-based AI company stated that some individuals violated the startup's national security policy by asking its chatbot to outline social media ‚Äúlistening‚Äù tools and other monitoring concepts.News agency Reuters that this action raises fresh safety concerns over the potential misuse of generative AI amid intense geopolitical competition between the US and China to control the technology's development and rules.OpenAI has detailed other bans as well, including several Chinese-language accounts that used ChatGPT to assist phishing and malware campaigns.

I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language I did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.

Plaintiffs are represented by Democracy Forward, Justice Action Center, South Asian American Justice Collaborative (SAAJCO), Kuck Baxter LLC, Joseph & Hall, P.C., and IMMpact Litigation.The H-1B visa program was created by Congress to provide a critical path for the United States to attract highly skilled professionals from around the world to fill urgent needs in the economy and public services to strengthen American innovation. Under the program, U.S. employers can hire qualified foreign talent ‚Äî such as doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers, and researchers ‚Äî after a rigorous review process.The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenges the order as unconstitutional and unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs include Global Nurse Force; Global Village Academy Collaborative; Society of the Divine Word; the Fathers of St.Charles; Church on the Hill; International Union; United Auto-Aerospace Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW International); UAW Local 4811; American Association of University Professors (AAUP); Committee of Interns and Residents, SEIU (CIR), a citizen of the United Kingdom residing in the Appalachia region, and a citizen of India residing in the Northern District of California.These plaintiffs represent medical residents, fellows, interns, and nurses serving rural and medically underserved communities, a school that relies on H-1B workers to serve their students, religious organizations that depend on the H-1B program to hire pastors and religious professionals that minister to underserved communities, major labor unions representing faculty and academic professionals and higher education members, and individual highly skilled workers whose careers and lives were upended overnight.When the government makes it prohibitively expensive or impossible for these professionals to come to America, or for current H-1B workers to transition to a more permanent status, entire communities lose ‚Äî patients wait longer for care, students have fewer teachers, and local economies miss out on the innovation and jobs these experts create.The complaint details how the sudden $100,000 demand:The H-1B program has a carefully crafted fee and oversight system set by law. The President cannot rewrite it overnight or levy new taxes by proclamation.The order offers a vague ‚Äúnational interest‚Äù loophole with no clear standards for fee exemptions, opening the door to arbitrary, pay-to-play decisions.Rural hospitals warn they will be unable to keep needed doctors and nurses; schools say the unlawful fee is more than many teacher salaries; and nonprofit organizations and research institutions can‚Äôt absorb the significant expense. All will lose if they cannot utilize H-1B workers.Economists agree that H-1B workers create U.S. jobs and drive new industries. Forcing talent away means companies move operations‚Äîand good jobs‚Äîoverseas. Without relief, hospitals will lose medical staff, churches will lose pastors, classrooms will lose teachers, and industries across the country risk losing key innovators.The suit asks the court to immediately block the order and restore predictability for employers and workers.In its order, Trump administration argued that the H-1B visa system was being abused to replace American workers with people willing to work for less money. The United States awards 85,000 H-1B visas per year on a lottery system. India accounts for around three-quarters of the recipients.","A coalition of labor unions, health care providers, schools, and religious organizations has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump ‚Äôs executive order increasing H-1B visa fee.

Here's CEO Satya Nadella's email to Microsoft employees on the restructuring:

We are in the midst of a tectonic AI platform shift, one that requires us to both manage and grow our at-scale commercial business today, while building the new frontier and executing flawlessly across both.

An image of Judson Althoff, chief executive officer of the commercial business at Microsoft.

History shows that general purpose technologies like AI drive step changes in productivity and GDP growth, and we have a unique opportunity to help our customers and the world realize this promise.

Our success depends on enabling commercial and public sector customers and partners to combine their human capital with new AI capabilities to change the frontier of how they operate. To accelerate this, we will increasingly need to bring together sales, marketing, operations, and engineering to drive growth and strengthen our position as the partner of choice for AI transformation.

With this context, I have asked Judson Althoff to take on an expanded role as CEO of our commercial business. Over the past nine years, Judson has led our global sales organization and was the architect behind designing and building Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions (MCAPS) into what it is today: the ‚Äúnumber one seed‚Äù in the industry and our company‚Äôs most important growth engine.

Takeshi Numoto and his marketing team will join this new organization, with Takeshi reporting directly to Judson as CMO, while also continuing to report directly to me on all-up business models, planning, consumer marketing, and corporate brand and communications.

Our operations organization will also move to report to Judson. By bringing operations into the commercial business, we can tighten the feedback loop between what customers need and how we deliver and support them. Carolina Dybeck Happe will continue to report to me, as she works on our overall company transformation and continues to closely partner with Judson.

Additionally, Judson will lead a new commercial leadership team that brings together leaders from engineering, sales, marketing, operations, and finance to drive our product strategy and governance, GTM readiness, and sales motions with shared accountability for the rigor and executional excellence our customers expect.

This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work‚Äîacross our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation‚Äîto lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift. Each one of us needs to be at our very best in terms of rapidly learning new skills, adopting new ways to work, and staying close to the metal to drive innovation across the entire stack!!

This isn‚Äôt just evolution, it‚Äôs reinvention, for each of us professionally and for Microsoft.

Satya

‚ÄúWhen equity investment comes from a supplier, additional scrutiny is warranted,""

What Goldman Sachs analyst predicted about Nvidia and OpenAI



‚ÄúThese deals signal Nvidia's view on the scale of the opportunity. They reinforce market leadership,‚Äù

US Government Shutdown Enters Second Week: Why It Happened & Who It Impacts

‚ÄúThe sustainability of OpenAI‚Äôs infrastructure spending will increasingly depend on equity & debt financing. We believe it will increasingly need to rely on equity/debt raises ‚Äî with up to ~$75bn in 2026 alone,‚Äù





Goldman Sachs have a warning against Nvidia's multibillion-dollar investments in companies like OpenAI and Intel. An analyst from the investment banking company has suggested that some of this revenue surge may not be entirely organic. Nvidia has committed major investments, including up to $100 billion for OpenAI and an additional $5 billion for Intel. These investments are contributing to a massive demand for Nvidia's chips. However, in a recent note Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider (seen by Benzinga) stated that Nvidia's equity financing to customers is starting to resemble ‚Äúcircular revenue.‚Äù The analyst believes that investments flow out as funding, and the returns are realized via GPU sales, effectively inflating reported growth.Referring to Nvidia‚Äôs deal with OpenAI, the report explained the trend, where the US chip maker expects to earn about $13 billion in revenue from the AI startup in 2026, and around $10 billion of that profit will be put back into the business.reinvested back into the company. It‚Äôs like a food supplier giving money to the same restaurants that buy its ingredients.Schneider said, especially when the same money is circulated back through business deals between the companies.Goldman Sachs sees Nvidia‚Äôs investments as more than just financial decisions. The company sees these investments as strategic actions that tie developers more closely to Nvidia's CUDA software, increase sales of its hardware, and influence how the AI market develops.Schneider added.The company also expects Nvidia's datacenter revenue to come from a wider range of customers beyond Big Tech companies like Google-parent Alphabet, Meta and Amazon. More income will come from AI startups and government buyers, groups that are less stable and rely heavily on outside funding, the analysis claimed. While traditional Big Tech companies remain Nvidia's most reliable customers, government-backed national AI programs are increasingly driving demand from countries.Meanwhile, Goldman estimates OpenAI will need $35 billion in 2026 just for the computer hardware needed to run and train its AI systems. This funding is expected to come from three places: $17 billion from OpenAI's own earnings, $10 billion from Nvidia investments, and about $9 billion from other investors or loans.However, the financial pressure increases significantly when considering longer-term obligations, including $60 billion for Nvidia-backed data centers and $19 billion for Stargate infrastructure. In total, OpenAI could need $114 billion in cash for 2026 alone.This means a funding shortage of $62 billion, even after using $17 billion in available cash which is raising serious questions about whether Nvidia's customers can sustain their current spending levels.Morever, startups like OpenAI have smaller profit margins. The analysis predicted that they're much more affected by changes in investment markets which will make it harder for them to keep spending consistently.Schneider explained.","Goldman Sachs has a warning against Nvidia's multibillion-dollar investments in companies like OpenAI and Intel.

US Government Shutdown Enters Second Week: Why It Happened & Who It Impacts

""We're hearing that some criminals are stopping dealing drugs and moving on to the phone business because it's more lucrative. If you steal a phone and it's worth hundreds of pounds you can understand why criminals who are one step ahead and want to exploit new crimes are turning to that world,‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is the largest crackdown on mobile phone theft and robbery in the UK in the most extraordinary set of operations the Met has ever undertaken. We've dismantled criminal networks at every level from street-level thieves to international organised crime groups exporting tens of thousands of stolen devices each year.""





UK police may have knocked down an international gang suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China over the past year. The investigation was reportedly triggered after a victim successfully traced a single stolen iPhone . The Metropolitan Police described the effort as the UK's largest ever operation against phone thefts, resulting in the arrest of 18 suspects and the discovery of more than 2,000 stolen devices. Authorities estimate that the group may be responsible for exporting as many as half of all phones stolen in London, where most mobile thefts occur in the UK. The investigation and subsequent arrests and raids on 28 properties in London and Hertfordshire were initiated after a victim successfully traced a single stolen iPhone last year, providing police with a crucial starting point.In a statement to BBC, Detective Inspector Mark Gavin said:Police uncovered a phone-smuggling operation after intercepting a shipment of stolen devices bound for Hong Kong. Forensic evidence led to two Afghan nationals and, later, a third Indian suspect, with thousands of phones recovered from linked properties.Investigators believe the group was behind up to 40% of London‚Äôs stolen phones.Recent raids have led to 15 additional arrests, mostly of women. Phone thefts in London have surged sharply in recent years, driven by the demand for second-hand devices, with the city now accounting for three-quarters of all phone thefts in the UK.UK Policing Minister Sarah Jones told BBC.Police stated that the group primarily targeted Apple devices due to their high resale value abroad. The investigation found that street thieves were paid up to ¬£300 per phone, while the stolen devices were later sold in China for as much as ¬£4,000, partly because they can access the open internet and help bypass censorship.Commander Andrew Featherstone, the Met's lead for tackling phone theft, said to BBC:","UK police may have knocked down an international gang suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China.

‚ÄúThe future of consulting is going to be a hybrid of people plus software ‚Äî like, a lot of software. And I think that consulting companies that can‚Äôt do that are going to fall away.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe software companies are going to get into this business as well, and are going be delivering digitally through agents.

‚ÄúCompanies are spending a ton of money [to] figure out how to build this up,‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs less about the LLMs and now about the applications that you‚Äôre building on top,‚Äù





IBM Consulting's head, Mohamad Ali, has important advice for consultancies. He believes consultancies must reinvent themselves as software companies to remain viable in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). In a recent interview, Ali stated that this major rethink is required due to increased competition from technology companies and growing scepticism from clients regarding traditional consulting models. He warned that firms that do not adapt will beby the shifting market dynamics posed by AI. Ali returned to IBM two years ago with a mandate to transform the consulting division into abusiness. This plan involves developing thousands of digital ""agents"" to perform tasks with limited human oversight, initially for internal use and later for clients.In an interview with The Financial Times, Ali said:Traditionally, consultants have supported companies in improving efficiency by designing restructuring plans, implementing third-party software, or offering specialised expertise such as cybersecurity guidance.With the rise of semi-autonomous agents capable of handling many of these tasks, consulting firms now face the question of whether to develop such tools internally and how to effectively coordinate large numbers of agents.Firms such as Deloitte, KPMG, and McKinsey are currently developing agentic AI platforms, offering clients a range of tools tailored to their specific business needs.Ali noted.Consulting firms are turning to AI implementation to counter the effects of more than two years of slow growth. The sector, including IBM‚Äôs consulting arm, has seen stagnant revenue as clients focus on in-house AI projects, manage economic uncertainty, and reduce government spending.he added.Ali predicted that companies will increasingly need consulting firms to implement AI strategies, citing an MIT study that shows 95% of generative AI projects have failed to deliver financial returns.However, some corporate leaders question whether consultants add value compared to in-house development, and investors remain concerned about this issue. Accenture shares have dropped 30% this year due to concerns about AI's impact on its managed services business, prompting CEO Julie Sweet to announce workforce changes and staff reductions for those who cannot acquire the necessary AI skills.Ali, who rejoined IBM in 2023 after previous stints at HP, and other tech firms, now leads IBM Consulting. He's promoting agentic AI as a transformative efficiency tool, pointing to IBM's own $3.5 billion in savings over two years through automation across nearly 500 corporate functions. Ali noted that large language models themselves are becoming commoditised.he noted.","IBM's Mohamad Ali believes consultancies must reinvent themselves as software companies to remain viable in the age of artificial intelligence.

What California Governor Gavin Newsom said about the new law



‚ÄúWe heard Californians loud and clear, and what‚Äôs clear is that they don‚Äôt want commercials at a volume any louder than the level at which they were previously enjoying a program. California is dialling down this inconvenience across streaming platforms.‚Äù

US Government Shutdown Enters Second Week: Why It Happened & Who It Impacts

‚ÄúThis bill was inspired by baby Samantha and every exhausted parent who‚Äôs finally gotten a baby to sleep, only to have a blaring streaming ad undo all that hard work,‚Äù





California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law that will affect streaming platforms. Under the new rule, the US state is banning excessively loud advertisements on major streaming platforms, including Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. The new law is aimed at curbing the ""troubling jump"" in TV ad noise complaints, a persistent issue where commercials are aired significantly louder than the shows and movies they interrupt. The legislation is modelled after a 2010 federal law that capped ad volumes on cable and broadcast television but did not apply to streaming services. Due to California's influence over the entertainment industry, this state law is expected to become a de facto national standard, likely compelling streaming services to reduce the volume of their commercials nationwide.In a statement, Newsom said:California State Senator Tom Umberg, a Democrat from Orange County and author of the new law, said the proposal was inspired by his legislative director, Zach Keller, who mentioned that loud streaming ads were disturbing his infant daughter, Samantha.Umberg noted in a statement.According to a report by Politico, Umberg‚Äôs bill faced pushback from major Hollywood companies earlier this year. The Motion Picture Association and the Streaming Innovators Alliance, which represent major players such as Disney, Paramount, Amazon, and Netflix, initially opposed the proposal, stating that streaming ads originate from various sources and are difficult to regulate.The MPA argued that internal audio engineers were already addressing the issue and needed more time to find a solution without the pressure of legal action. The opposition eased after Umberg revised the bill to protect streamers from private lawsuits, assigning enforcement to the state attorney general. The updated bill was later passed with broad bipartisan backing.","California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law that will affect streaming platforms.

Comet can help with productivity and financial gains







Aravind Srinivas, desi CEO and founder of Perplexity AI, has stated that the startup‚Äôs new AI browser, Comet, can boost productivity so significantly that companies can skip hiring new employees. He characterised the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered web browser as a ‚Äòtrue personal assistant,‚Äô allowing users to complete more tasks in the same amount of time.‚ÄúInstead of hiring one more person on your team, you could just use Comet to supplement all the work that you‚Äôre doing,‚Äù Srinivas told CNBC in an interview.Comet functions by browsing the internet to assist with research and can asynchronously perform multiple tasks, with Srinivas noting, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs truly about delivering value and you being able to delegate tasks to it.‚ÄùSrinivas estimated that the productivity gains from Comet could be worth $10,000 per year for a single person. He also believes the economic impact of such gains could be massive.Given that ""human digital knowledge work"" contributes around $25 trillion to the gross domestic product, he estimated that a 20% gain in productivity, facilitated by tools like Comet, could easily translate to $5 trillion in GDP growth.This comes as major tech companies continue to bolster their AI spending. Tech giants like Meta, Amazon , Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet are collectively expected to spend as much as $320 billion on AI technologies and datacentre expansions in 2025, the report noted.Perplexity initially launched Comet in July to users of its premium Perplexity Max subscription ($200 per month), quickly garnering a waitlist of millions of people.

What changes for Android users and developers

Google vows to continue fighting despite setback





The US Supreme Court has rejected Google 's emergency request to delay sweeping antitrust reforms to its Play Store , giving the tech giant just over two weeks to implement court-ordered changes that could change how Android users download apps and make purchases.The decision means Google must comply by October 22 with a permanent injunction stemming from Epic Games' landmark 2023 legal victory. The ruling found Google illegally monopolised app distribution and payment systems on Android devices.Starting October 22, Google must stop requiring app developers to use Google Play Billing and allow them to inform users about alternative payment methods directly within the Play Store. Developers will also gain the right to link to external download options and set their own prices without Google's interference.The injunction prohibits Google from sharing revenue or offering incentives to phone manufacturers, carriers, and app developers in exchange for Play Store exclusivity or preinstallation. Additionally, Google must work with Epic to establish a system allowing rival app stores to access Google Play's app catalog.Google expressed disappointment with the Supreme Court 's decision, warning that the changes ""will jeopardise users' ability to safely download apps."" A company spokesperson confirmed Google would comply with its legal obligations while continuing to appeal the case.The company has until October 27 to file its full Supreme Court appeal‚Äîfive days after the compliance deadline. District Court Judge James Donato has scheduled an October 30 hearing to review how both companies have implemented the required changes.Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney celebrated the ruling, stating developers would soon benefit from the ability to steer users toward alternative payment systems ""without fees, scare screens, and friction."" The three-year injunction mirrors similar remedies Apple recently implemented following its own legal battle with Epic Games.","Google must comply by October 22 with a permanent injunction stemming from Epic Games' 2023 legal victory.

Step 2: Identify a vulnerability

Step 3: Document your findings

Step 4: Submit

Step 5: Receive rewards and feedback

Google expands AI bug bounty to reward ethical hackers and researchers

In October 2023, Google announced significant updates to its Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP), specifically targeting AI products. The new AI Vulnerability Reward Program (AI VRP) aims to foster third-party discovery and reporting of security and abuse issues in Google‚Äôs AI systems. As the program enters its second year, Google is reflecting on the successes, lessons learned, and the enhanced rules designed to streamline AI bug reporting and reward high-impact findings. Google‚Äôs integration of AI vulnerabilities into its existing Abuse Vulnerability Reward Program has proven highly successful. By inviting external researchers to identify and report bugs, Google has strengthened collaboration with the AI research community.Researchers have uncovered critical AI security issues, contributing to Google‚Äôs layered AI security strategy. Since the inception of AI-specific rewards, bug hunters have earned over $430,000 for reporting AI product vulnerabilities. This approach not only keeps users safe but also incentivises researchers to focus on high-impact AI threats.Despite the program‚Äôs early success, Google received feedback highlighting areas for improvement.Many researchers found the scope of AI rewards unclear. In response, Google has updated the AI VRP rules, offering detailed guidance on which vulnerabilities qualify for rewards.Another challenge involved the treatment of AI-related abuse issues. Previously handled separately, abuse and security issues are now unified under a single reward table. A consolidated reward panel reviews all submissions to ensure the highest possible reward is issued across abuse and security categories. This change helps researchers prioritise targets with the greatest impact.Google has also clarified how content-related issues, including jailbreaks, prompt injections, and alignment problems, should be reported. While researchers are encouraged to report these issues, they are considered out-of-scope for the AI VRP.The reason is simple: content-based vulnerabilities require long-term, cross-disciplinary solutions that involve trend analysis, model retraining, and user context evaluation. These needs do not align with the VRP‚Äôs goal of providing timely rewards to individual researchers. Instead, content-related issues should be reported in-product, enabling AI safety teams and model experts to address them effectively.The updated AI VRP now clearly defines eligible vulnerabilities under security and abuse categories, with six primary types of attacks in scope:To focus efforts on the most impactful AI issues, Google has introduced AI-specific product tiers:Flagship Products: Google Search, Gemini Apps (Web, Android, iOS), Gmail, Drive, Meet, Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms.Standard Products: AI Studio, Jules, and non-core Google Workspace applications such as NotebookLM and AppSheet.Other Products: Other AI integrations, excluding certain acquisitions and open-source projects.Rewards are substantial, with base payouts up to $20,000, and bonuses for report quality and originality increasing potential rewards to $30,000. Top-tier findings in flagship products like Google Search or Gmail carry the highest reward potential, incentivizing researchers to focus on critical systems.Visit the official AI VRP guide to understand which vulnerabilities qualify for rewards, including security and abuse categories:Look for rogue AI actions, sensitive data leaks, phishing enablement, model theft, or context manipulation (cross-account attacks). Ensure your findings are reproducible and have a clear impact.Create a detailed report explaining the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, potential risks, and suggested fixes. Include screenshots or videos if applicable.Use the official submission portal to submit your report securely. Make sure to follow all guidelines for reporting AI vulnerabilities.Your submission will be reviewed by Google‚Äôs consolidated reward panel. High-impact and original reports may earn rewards up to $30,000, depending on severity, originality, and potential impact.By launching the dedicated AI Vulnerability Reward Program, Google underscores its commitment to AI safety and security. The program not only encourages external researchers to expose potential exploits but also reinforces Google‚Äôs proactive approach to managing AI risks.Examples of qualifying vulnerabilities include rogue prompts triggering smart home exploits, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and cross-account manipulations. However, issues like model hallucinations, hate speech, or copyrighted material should continue to be reported through in-product feedback channels. Since 2022, AI bug hunters have earned over $430,000 for identifying vulnerabilities across Google platforms. With the AI VRP‚Äôs enhanced scope, higher rewards, and clear guidelines, Google aims to continue strengthening AI security while incentivizing ethical hacking and collaboration with the research community.","Google announced significant updates to its Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP), specifically targeting AI products.

"Deloitte to refund Australian government $290,000 after making 'AI mistake'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deloitte-to-refund-australian-government-290000-after-making-ai-mistake/articleshow/124360344.cms,"Erroneous errors in Deloitte report

AI used in Deloitte‚Äôs report

‚ÄúDeloitte has a human intelligence problem. This would be laughable if it wasn‚Äôt so lamentable. A partial refund looks like a partial apology for substandard work. Anyone looking to contract these firms should be asking exactly who is doing the work they are paying for, and having that expertise and no AI use verified.‚Äù





Deloitte will provide a partial refund to the Australian federal government after errors were discovered in a report it produced. In August this year, Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported multiple errors in the report which also included the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI). The report, commissioned by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR), assessed the Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF), part of the IT system that manages welfare and benefits payments.The original seven-month review, completed around June 2025 for USD $290,000 ($440,000 AUD), contained multiple mistakes. These included nonexistent academic references and a fabricated quote from a Federal Court judgment, first noted by Australian welfare academic Dr. Christopher Rudge. An updated version of the report, published on DEWR‚Äôs website, corrected more than a dozen references and footnotes, rewrote the reference list, and fixed typographical errors.Deloitte confirmed that some footnotes and references were incorrect and has agreed to repay the final installment under its contract. A DEWR spokesperson said the changes do not alter the report‚Äôs findings or recommendations.The updated report disclosed for the first time that Deloitte‚Äôs methodology ‚Äúincluded the use of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) large language model (Azure OpenAI GPT ‚Äì 4o) based tool chain licensed by DEWR and hosted on DEWR‚Äôs Azure tenancy.‚Äù Deloitte did not link the errors directly to AI and stood by the substantive content of the review.Labor Senator Deborah O‚ÄôNeill criticized the approach, saying:Dr. Rudge noted that while the report contained ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù likely produced by AI, the conclusions generally align with other evidence.","Deloitte will provide a partial refund to the Australian federal government after errors were discovered in a report it produced.

How to build a Dhandha?

First build a Dhandha mindset.

At 13, I thought renting books would make me rich.

At 16, I tried to build a sports club.

In college, ten other hustles.

Most failed. All taught me one thing - selling.

Books. Donations. My project. Myself for a job.

Every one of those moments shaped my survival skills ‚Äî persuasion, negotiation, influence.

That‚Äôs why I tell young founders & professionals ‚Üí start selling early.

But selling alone isn‚Äôt enough. To build real business acumen, you need to zoom out.

The fastest way? A stint in finance esp. Equity Analysis or Investment Banking.

Why? Because finance strips away the romance of ‚Äúdisruption‚Äù and shows you the raw truth ‚Üí where margins lie, where capital flows, and where profit pools actually sit.

Too many operators get high on their own stories.

But gravity always wins. Every industry has its economics ‚Äî hack it if you want, but you can‚Äôt ignore it.

So if you‚Äôre 20 and asking me 'How do I become a killer business guy?'

Sell something. Anything.

Then spend a year or two learning how industries really make money.

Bcs ‚ÄòDhandha‚Äô is not taught in classrooms.

It‚Äôs forged in the trenches of selling and sharpened by the discipline of numbers.

Massive AI skills buildup accompanies workforce cuts

Strong financial results amid workforce transformation





Accenture is cutting thousands of employees it cannot retrain for artificial intelligence work while simultaneously planning to grow its overall workforce, executives revealed during the company's Q4 2025 financial results conference call, last week.""We are exiting on a compressed timeline, people where reskilling, based on our experience, is not a viable path for the skills we need,"" CEO Julie Sweet said on the call. Yet despite the cuts, Sweet said Accenture expects ""to increase our headcount overall across our three markets, including in the US and Europe, reflecting the demand we see in our business.""Chief Financial Officer Angie Park disclosed that Accenture recorded $615 million in restructuring charges in the fourth quarter, primarily for severance tied to workforce reductions. An additional $250 million charge is expected in the first quarter, bringing total costs to approximately $865 million.""These actions will result in cost savings, which will be reinvested in our people and our business,"" Park said during the call.The consulting giant has dramatically expanded its AI capabilities since fiscal 2023, nearly doubling its AI and data professionals to 77,000 people. Sweet said more than 550,000 employees have been trained in generative AI fundamentals.""Advanced AI is becoming a part of everything we do,"" Sweet told investors. The company tripled its advanced AI revenue to $2.7 billion in fiscal 2025 and nearly doubled related bookings to $5.9 billion.Accenture's workforce stood at more than 779,000 at the end of August, down from approximately 791,000 three months earlier. The business optimisation program also includes divesting two acquisitions no longer aligned with strategic priorities.Despite the restructuring, Accenture reported $69.7 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025, representing 7% growth over the prior year. The company delivered adjusted earnings per share of $12.93, reflecting 8% growth, and generated $10.9 billion in free cash flow.For fiscal 2026, Accenture projects revenue growth of 2% to 5% in local currency, though this includes an estimated 1% to 1.5% impact from its contracting federal business. Excluding the federal headwind, expected growth is 3% to 6%.Sweet emphasised that AI is driving expansion rather than contraction. ""We don't see AI as deflationary. We do see and are seeing it as expansionary similar to every tech evolution we've been through,"" she said.","Accenture is cutting thousands of employees it cannot retrain for artificial intelligence work.

As the debate over the Donald Trump administration increasing H-1B visa fee rages, there's another practical problem facing America's bid to build an AI economy. As raised by Ford CEO Jim Farley, the Trump administration's ambition to lead in high-tech manufacturing and AI won't succeed if it ignores foundational blue-collar industries. In an interview with Axios, Farley sounded the alarm on the US government's push for dominance in high-tech manufacturing and artificial intelligence, cautioning that success is impossible without bolstering basic blue-collar industries. In the interview, Farley emphasized the critical role of the ‚Äúessential economy‚Äù -- sectors like construction, maintenance, and skilled trades -- that he said underpin advanced manufacturing and tech infrastructure.Earlier this year, Farley also wrote a blog titled ""The Essential Economy: Reinvesting in the Workers Who Keep America Running,' it too focused on how while much of the AI conversation focuses on its impact on white-collar jobs, the foundational industries reliant on skilled tradespeople, such as electricians and construction workers, are being overlooked. These workers are vital for building factories, supply chains, and data centers, but the U.S.faces a dire shortage of trained professionals due to inadequate investment in job training, regulatory reform, and innovation.The Axios report quotes a recent Aspen Institute study that highlights a stark productivity gap between white-collar and blue-collar sectors. Digital industries, fueled by technologies like cloud computing and AI, have seen a 28% productivity surge, while productivity in industries that ‚Äúbuild, power, move, and maintain‚Äù the physical world has declined. Farley noted the U.S. needs 600,000 more manufacturing workers, 500,000 construction workers, and 400,000 automotive technicians to meet demand.This workforce shortage, exacerbated by tariffs and restrictive immigration policies, is stalling growth in blue-collar industries. ‚ÄúHow can we re-shore all this stuff if we don‚Äôt have people to work there?‚Äù Farley asked.The productivity crisis in blue-collar sectors is reported to be driving up costs, shrinking profits, and causing delays for consumers in America. From longer wait times for car repairs to prolonged road construction and a shortage of affordable housing, the ripple effects are widespread. Farley stressed that the issue is not just a lack of workers but a broader societal and awareness problem. He pointed out that many Americans would prefer their children pursue high-paying tech jobs, like software engineering ($170,000 average salary), over skilled trades like HVAC specialists ($97,000 average salary).Farley called for a cultural shift to elevate the value of blue-collar work, alongside policy changes such as faster permitting, regulatory reform, and increased funding for vocational training and apprenticeships. He also advocated for innovations like robotics, augmented reality, and AI to boost productivity in trades like plumbing, carpentry, and auto repair.Farley sees the ‚ÄúAccelerate‚Äù summit as a critical first step toward developing policies to support these vital industries. ‚ÄúIf we are successful -- when we are successful -- we‚Äôll take on bigger, higher-class problems,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRight now, the problems we‚Äôre trying to solve are pretty practical. I need 6,000 technicians in my dealerships on Monday morning.‚Äù","Ford CEO Jim Farley says U.S. needs 600,000 more manufacturing workers, 500,000 construction workers, and 400,000 automotive technicians to meet demand.

President Donald Trump recently shared his first TikTok post since the 2024 election. In the post, he reached out to ‚Äúthe young people of TikTok,‚Äù reminding them he didn‚Äôt enforce his 2020 executive order that could have banned the app. ‚ÄúTo all of those young people of TikTok, I saved TikTok, so you owe me big,‚Äù Trump said in his TikTok post. Filmed in the Oval Office, the post continued as Trump said ‚ÄúAnd now, you‚Äôre looking at me in the Oval Office, and someday one of you is going to be sitting right at this desk, and you‚Äôre going to be doing a great job also.‚ÄùIn a major reversal, Trump, who once pushed to ban TikTok, recently signed an executive order allowing an American consortium to buy and restructure the app‚Äôs U.S. operations, keeping it from being banned. The deal is reportedly worth about $14 billion, less than what analysts say TikTok‚Äôs US operations would fetch in an open auction. Trump calls this move ‚Äúsaving TikTok,‚Äù presenting it as a favor to the app‚Äôs mostly young users.Over the past five years, efforts to ban TikTok in the US have gained support from both parties. The idea first came up during Trump‚Äôs first presidency in 2020 when he called it a national security threat.In 2024, the then President Joe Biden passed a law which required TikTok to either sell its US operations or face a ban. After winning the November 2024 elections, Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025 delaying the enforcement of the TikTok ban by 75 days, providing time to negotiate a solution. He has then delayed the app ban with multiple deadline extensions.Recently, Trump announced a deal‚Äîstill pending‚Äîafter discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The American branch of TikTok would be controlled by a group of Trump-aligned billionaires, including Larry Ellison, Rupert Murdoch, and Michael Dell.","President Donald Trump recently shared his first TikTok post since the 2024 election.

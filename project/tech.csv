Next ten years could see ""extraordinarily capable models""





OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes artificial intelligence will soon be smarter than humans in many sectors and is ready to hand over his job to an AI model when the time comes. In a recent interview with Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner, Altman said he is enthusiastic about the day an AI model can serve as a better CEO of OpenAI than he can. ""I think there will come a time when AI can be a much better CEO of OpenAI than me, and I will be nothing but enthusiastic the day that happens,"" he told in the interview.Altman, who has a front-row seat to the latest AI developments, noted that while AI will destroy many jobs in the short term, new roles will emerge over time. He predicts these new jobs will focus on helping and caring for others, a uniquely human trait. ""In the short term, AI will destroy a lot of jobs. In the long term, like every other technological revolution, I assume we will figure out completely new things to do,"" he said. Those jobs, he said, are likely going to revolve around helping others.Altman told WELT editor-in-chief Jan Philipp Burgard that he would be ""very surprised"" if, by 2030, the world doesn't have ""extraordinarily capable models that do things that we ourselves cannot do."" He added that he expects a ""similar rate of progress"" in 2026 as what was seen in 2024 and 2025.Altman, who used to spend more time on his farm driving tractors and picking crops before ChatGPT's rise, said he looks forward to returning to that life.In addition to his farm, he owns multimillion-dollar properties in San Francisco, Napa, and Hawaii.Altman believes that humans' unique value isn't their intellectual capacity but their ability to care for one another.

US government shutdown: One of the biggest American cybersecurity law expires; leaving industry anxious and worried,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-government-shutdown-one-of-the-biggest-american-cybersecurity-law-expires-leaving-industry-anxious-and-worried/articleshow/124297318.cms,"Letter to Congress on the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015

To the members of the US Congress

The

Protecting America’s Cyber Networks Coalition

(the Coalition) urges Congress to cleanly reauthorize the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA 2015) before it expires on September 30, 2025.

If CISA 2015 lapses, the U.S. will face a more complex and dangerous security environment. Sharing information about cyber threats and incidents makes it harder for attackers because defenders learn what to watch for and prioritize. As a result, attackers must invest more in new tools or target different victims.

Congress passed CISA 2015 with bipartisan support from both parties. This important cybersecurity law allows private entities to enhance their protection of data, devices, and networks while promoting cyber threat information sharing with industry and government partners within a secure policy and legal framework.

Further, CISA 2015 provides safeguards for businesses regarding public disclosure, regulatory issues, and antitrust concerns to facilitate the timely exchange of information between the public and private sectors. Industry and government have a strong history of protecting privacy and civil liberties under this law.

House and Senate leaders and the Trump administration have expressed strong support for reauthorizing CISA 2015 before September 30. Cyber incidents highlight the need for laws that help businesses better understand cybersecurity threats and improve their protection and response capabilities in partnership with government agencies.

Our associations urge lawmakers to send clean CISA 2015 reauthorization legislation to the president to ensure that businesses have legal certainty and protection against frivolous lawsuits when voluntarily sharing and receiving threat indicators and taking steps to mitigate cyberattacks.

The Coalition is dedicated to collaborating with lawmakers and the Trump administration to reauthorize CISA 2015, thereby enhancing U.S. economic and national security. Congressional action is urgently needed.





The US federal law that facilitates a significant portion of information sharing between the federal government and private sector is expired on October 1 in a development that could have major impacts on private industry and government cyber threat coordination. Despite broad bipartisan support, lawmakers failed to agree on how to either renew or modify the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, first passed in 2015, which offers private organizations legal protections to share cyber threat information with each other or the government. With the government shut down, it's unclear when CISA 2015 will be renewed.Expiration of the law dramatically decreases information sharing by private entities, according to a client alert written by five attorneys with the WilmerHale law company posted September 15 to the firm’s website. The law promotes ""cyber threat information sharing with industry and government partners within a secure policy and legal framework,"" a coalition of industry groups wrote in a letter to Congress last week.In its letter to Congress last week, the industry coalition warned that the expiration of CISA 2015 would lead to ""a more complex and dangerous"" security landscape. The letter is signed by 50-plus organisations.","Congress passed CISA 2015 with bipartisan support from both parties.

“The videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement.”

""I was thinking that these few hours will determine if I am employed,""

""They care a lot about your success stories outside your technical expertise. I think I'm a better talker than a coder, so I was very excited for that,”

“Many times I did feel hopeless, but I think it truly is a numbers game. You just need to apply to everything you're qualified for,”





TikTok has helped a recent software engineering graduate get a job at Amazon . 22-year-old Andrew Chen has claimed that he used the Chinese short video app to document his 10-day preparation period for the final interview. Chen, who had just weeks remaining before earning his computer science degree from the University of California, San Diego, used the public documentation as a tool to maintain focus and accountability. Due to the 10-day deadline, Chen created a study plan that included coding practice on LeetCode, behavioural interview preparation, and studying Amazon's Leadership Principles. He searched platforms like Reddit and Blind for insights into Amazon’s interview process and memorised personal stories in the STAR format to illustrate his values.In May, Chen started posting his preparation updates on TikTok, with the caption,He saw public sharing as a way to keep himself accountable while also opening the door to advice from people who had already faced similar interviews.Chen’s videos, which gained up to 2.6 million views, sparked mixed reactions, with some doubting his chances due to limited preparation time.In a statement to Business Insider, Chen said:He described Amazon’s ""loop"" interview as three consecutive virtual rounds: one on technical questions, one on behavioural scenarios linked to leadership principles, and one combining both.he said.In June, after completing other interviews, Chen received a six-figure offer from Amazon. He shared the news on TikTok, gaining over 941,000 views. After graduating in mid-June, he moved to New York City and began working in July. His key takeaway was Amazon’s strong focus on behavioural questions linked to its leadership principles, which he felt suited him well.Chen noted.He also shared some advice for job seekers, which is that while quality applications are essential, applying in high volume is crucial in a competitive market.Chen added.","Andrew Chen, 22, used the Chinese short video app to document his 10-day preparation period for the final interview.

Various tech companies confirm data theft



Salesforce targeted directly, company says no indication of data theft







An English-speaking hacking group — operating under names like Lapsus$, Scattered Spider, and ShinyHunters – has launched a dedicated data leak website on the dark web to extort its victims, a report has said, adding that the group, now calling the site Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters, is threatening to release approximately one billion records stolen from companies using cloud databases hosted by Salesforce.According to a report by TechCrunch, the website, spotted by threat intelligence researchers on Friday (October 3), is designed to pressure victims into paying a ransom to prevent the publication of their stolen data.“Contact us to regain control on data governance and prevent public disclosure of your data. Do not be the next headline,” the hackers' site reportedly reads.Over the last few weeks, the ShinyHunters gang allegedly breached dozens of high-profile companies by targeting their cloud-based databases hosted by Salesforce. Several major corporations have confirmed their data was compromised in these mass hacks, including Insurance giant Allianz Life, Google , Airline Qantas, and Carmaking giant Stellantis, among others.The leak site also lists several additional alleged victims, such as FedEx, Hulu (owned by Disney), and Toyota Motors.The hackers have also directly targeted Salesforce on the site, demanding that the company negotiate a ransom and threatening that otherwise “all your customers [sic] data will be leaked.”In a statement provided by spokesperson Nicole Aranda, Salesforce confirmed it is ""aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors,"" but maintained confidence in its platform's security.“Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support. At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology,"" the statement read.","English-speaking hacking group has launched a dedicated data leak website on the dark web to extort its victims.

Read Google’s full ‘urgent’ memo to H-1B visa holders

We are reaching out with an urgent update regarding international travel for individuals on H-1B visas.

A Proclamation is scheduled to take effect this Sunday at 12:01 AM ET. It introduces significant changes to re-entry procedures for H-1B visa holders currently outside the United States. We continue to review the Proclamation, but the initial advice we have received is that re-entry will require a mandatory payment of $100,000 per petition, which may cause substantial delays or prevent re-entry to the US

What You Need to Know:

If you are currently outside the US:

If you are currently outside the US with a valid H-1B visa, make plans to return and enter the US before the Proclamation takes effect on Sunday, September 21 at 12:01 am ET (i.e. by this Saturday night).

If you are currently in the US:

We strongly advise against any international travel if you are in valid H-1B status or need to travel to activate your H-1B visa. You should remain in the US

Departing the US may result in complications or denial of re-entry under the new policy.

If you are unable to return prior to the deadline in H-1B status: please reach out to go/immigration-help.

We understand this may create challenges, and we are here to support you. We are actively monitoring the situation and will keep you updated as we learn more.

Shark Tank judge Anupam Mittal says ‘Most MBAs are outdated’: ‘Better to learn….’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/shark-tank-judge-anupam-mittal-says-most-mbas-are-outdated-better-to-learn-/articleshow/124038917.cms,"Here’s what Anupam Mittal said

Should you do an MBA? My views👇🏼

Most MBAs are outdated 🤷🏼

Better to learn how to build Products,

Best training ground if you want to accelerate your career or run a company one day.

That’s how I started. As a Product Manager.

Case studies and frameworks are nice, but they don’t teach you how to,

- Question the status quo

- Build deep empathy for customers

- Pursue global optima, not local wins

- Influence without authority

- Work backwards from the end state

That’s a Builder’s life.

It’s messy, political, creative, analytical — all at once.

A microcosm of real life, not classroom fluff.

That’s what helped me build companies, not the three-letter degree, although I do have one 🙈

So I tell young students & professionals to do an MBA, but a different kind. Do a Masters in Building Awesome things and you will graduate, not in 2 yrs, but every day 👨🏼‍🎓😎

Be a PM, Product Engineer, Product Designer, AI Builder, Hardware Designer, Robotics Engineer ….. heck, even a Toy Designer!

Because the 21st century will be led by builders who can also tell great stories 💪🏼

P:S - If you MUST do a top-tier MBA. Or hide for a few months & learn how to build, esp with AI 🤷🏼

Optus outage in Australia: What we know about the fatal triple-0 emergency call failures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/optus-outage-in-australia-what-we-know-about-the-fatal-triple-0-emergency-call-failures/articleshow/124038130.cms,"Company knew of problems hours before resolution

Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus is facing mounting pressure after a 13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and caused 600 triple-zero calls to fail across multiple states. The September 19 network failure has prompted government investigations and renewed calls for accountability from the embattled telco.The outage primarily affected South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, with some impact also recorded in far western New South Wales near the SA border, according to Reuters reporting. CEO Stephen Rue confirmed that established processes were not followed during a network firewall upgrade that began at 12:30 AM Thursday and lasted until approximately 1:30 PM (local time).Four deaths have been linked to the incident, though South Australian police later clarified that an eight-week-old boy's death in Gawler West was ""unlikely"" to have been caused by the outage delay. A 68-year-old Adelaide woman and two men aged 74 and 49 in Perth remain connected to the emergency services failure.The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) reported that Optus received multiple customer complaints about the triple-zero failure as early as 9 AM Thursday, with five customers contacting the call center about the outage.However, these concerns were not properly escalated, and government authorities weren't informed until after the issue was resolved.Communications Minister Anika Wells expressed ""unbelievable disappointment"" that Australia was ""here again so quickly,"" referencing a similar 2023 incident. The Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA) chair Nerida O'Loughlin revealed her agency wasn't notified until more than 10 hours after the outage began, contrary to standard protocols.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years. The company was fined A$12 million in 2023 for failing to provide emergency call services to thousands during a nationwide outage and subsequently failing to conduct required welfare checks.The telecommunications giant, owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has faced a series of crises including a 2022 cyberattack affecting 9.5 million Australians and the 2023 outage that led to former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin's resignation. Current CEO Stephen Rue took over in November 2024.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking from New York, declined to say whether Rue should resign but indicated the government has ""action at its disposal"" pending investigation results. ACMA has launched a formal investigation, with Optus potentially facing fines exceeding $10 million and additional penalties.The company has promised full cooperation with all investigations while conducting its own internal review, with results to be made public.",13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and 600 triple-zero calls to fail.

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

A side door for skilled professionals



Pros and cons of O-1B visa



The advantages of O-1B visa include:

No lottery or annual cap

Faster processing available

Renewable indefinitely

The drawbacks of O-1B visa are:

More subjective than H-1B, requiring proof of “extraordinary ability”

Some employers hesitate due to uncertainty in approval

Application costs can be higher than pre-hike H-1B fees

Some real world examples of O-1B visa



Entrepreneurs like Soundarya Balasubramani, who launched an educational venture in the U.S., are among the new wave of Indian applicants using the O-1 to bypass the H-1B bottleneck. “I got my O-1A approved as the solo founder and 100% owner of an educational venture,” she told ET.

Karan Vaidya, cofounder of AI startup Composio, said his O-1 visa cost less than $10,000 including legal fees, and praised its flexibility: “It’s a three-year visa that can be renewed indefinitely. I’m on my fifth O-1 now.”





US President Donald Trump’s executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee from $10,000 to $1,00,000 sent shockwaves in the tech industry. Due to the announcement last week many tech giants called back their professionals with H-1B visa back to the US. As the scrutiny around the traditional H-1B visa pathway making the process unpredictable, the skilled professionals are now planing to turn towards O-1 visa a lesser known route. The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.For those unaware, the O-1 Visa is introduced under the Immigration Act of 1990. The O-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields of education, science, athletics or arts. It enable the recipients to work in the US for up to three years and comes with unlimited renewals. The applicants of the O-1 visa much demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and meet atleast three out of the eight criteria:After the unpredictable nature of popular H-1B visa, the O-1 visa is gaining a lot of traction among Indians who wish to go and work in the US. As per the report by Economic Times, Indian were granted 487 O-1A visas in FY 2020, this number was increased to 1,418 in FY 2023. With this increase, India became the third largest recipient of O-1 visa after UK and Brazil.Unlike the popularly H-1B visa which is capped at 85,000 visas annually and allocated via a lottery, the O-1 visa has no cap and the applications for it are accepted around the year. The applicants can also expedite the application process by submitting additional fees.Immigration consultant and O-1 holder Logan Ullyott told Business Insider: “The O-1 is an occupation-agnostic visa.

I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger.

Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21. Now, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has also issued a piece of advice to Indian techies ‘come back to India to rebuild’. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Vemu drew parallel with the Partition of India in order to explain the current H-1B situation. He mentioned the stories of his Sindhi friends whose families were forced to leave everything but they eventually thrived after starting over again.“I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk responds



Political leaders weigh in







An ABC spokesperson recently confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely. The company decided to take the decision after the host of the show Jimmy Kimmel made some controversial comments on Charlie Kirk, linking his alleged killer to President Trump’s MAGA movement. MAGA – short for Make America Great Again is a political slogan, popularized by President Donald Trump during his election campaigns. During the late-night show, Kimmel made sharp comments stating that the MAGA gang is “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.Actor and filmmaker Ben Stiller was among the celebrities who has publicly defended Kimmel and has criticised the decision of ABC. In s post shared on social media platform X, Stiller wrote, “This isn’t right”.His brief but pointed reaction quickly went viral, with many fans and fellow entertainers echoing his sentiment that the suspension undermines free expression in comedy.Commenting on Ben Stiller’s post, Elon Musk supported the decision made by ABC and wrote, “He went full retard. Never go full retard.”This is not the first time that Musk has reacted to the controversy.Earlier this week after the Kimmel’s video clip from the show went viral, Musk said, “Jimmy Kimmel is disgusting”.The California Governor Gavin Newsom has also blasted the decision and has accused Republicans of orchestrating censorship. “They are censoring you in real time. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous,” wrote Newsom on X.On the other hand, commentator Davis Sirota suggested corporate politics were at play, noting that Nexstar, which has ties to ABC, is seeking regulatory approvals from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the suspension on Truth Social, calling it “Great News for America” and labeling Kimmel “ratings challenged” with “zero talent.”","ABC confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely.

AMD responds to partnership ‘rumours’







AMD has responded to a report which claimed that the company is in early discussions with rival chipmaker Intel to manufacture chips for AMD's products within Intel’s foundry business. According to a report from Semafor, this potential partnership may represent a significant victory for Intel Foundry, which is actively seeking major customers.Industry analysts note that securing a large client like AMD will allow Intel Foundry to confidently invest in developing its manufacturing technology and would send a strong signal to other chip companies about Intel's capabilities.It will also signify that AMD, Intel’s biggest competitor in x86-based chips for PCs and servers, is confident in trusting its core manufacturing to its rival.Following the news, Intel shares rose 7% on Wednesday, while AMD shares were up over 1%. Intel's stock has seen a nearly 77% rise so far in 2025 as investors gain confidence in the chipmaker's turnaround efforts.AMD has responded to the report, calling them rumours.“AMD does not comment on rumor or speculation,” an AMD spokesperson stated.While the extent of the manufacturing AMD would shift to Intel remains unclear, it is to be noted that AMD currently relies on TSMC for its chip production.The news follows a series of positive developments for Intel in recent weeks, including securing significant investments from the US government, Nvidia and Softbank. These endorsements are widely seen as votes of confidence in Intel’s business strategy under CEO Lip-Bu Tan, though Nvidia did not commit to using Intel’s foundry services.","Report claims AMD is in early discussions with Intel to manufacture chips for AMD's products within Intel's foundry business.

Amazon VP of devices and services Rob Williams is stepping down from his role at year’s end, according to an internal memo reviewed by Reuters. The development comes just days after the company’s high-profile devices showcase in New York. Williams, who has been with Amazon for nearly 12 years is a member of the elite internal group known as the S-team advising CEO Andy Jassy. The memo, confirmed by Amazon, detailed that Williams will retire from his role while continuing to serve as an advisor until the end of 2025.In the memo, as quoted in the Reuters report, Panos Panay, senior vice president of devices and services says that ""Rob has had a big impact on the software and experiences of nearly all of the products we’ve created and shipped"". He further added that Williams chose to “retire from Amazon.”The memo also outlined structural changes in the division, including moving the Alexa Smart Vehicle team under the broader Alexa group. He said that Tapas Roy, previously vice president overseeing Fire TV product and engineering, will step into Williams’ role, effective Thursday i.e. October 2.Williams’ departure is significant as exits from the 29-member S-team—Amazon’s top leadership circle advising CEO Andy Jassy—are uncommon and seen as symbolic of major change.Williams, who joined the team in 2022, had been deeply involved in shaping Amazon’s device software and strategy.Earlier this week, Williams highlighted the launch of Vega, a new operating system designed for Fire TV devices, in a LinkedIn post. “No one else has anything like it,” he wrote, underscoring Amazon’s push to replace Google’s Android system.Williams also attended Amazon’s New York devices event, where the company unveiled refreshed Echo speakers, color Kindles, and upgraded Fire TVs. Despite ongoing challenges in the money-losing devices unit—including layoffs and slow rollout of AI-driven Alexa updates—his exit marks a pivotal moment for Amazon’s hardware ambitions.","Amazon VP of devices and services Rob Williams is stepping down from his role at year's end.

What Telstra has to say on fine







Australia's largest telecommunications company, Telstra, has been hit with an A$18 million (US$11.87 million) fine by the Federal Court for downgrading the internet speed plans of nearly 9,000 customers without notice. The penalty was announced on Friday (October 3) by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the country's competition watchdog.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the ACCC found that Telstra migrated 8,897 customers of its low-cost brand, Belong, to a slower service plan during October and November 2020. Moreover, the company is said to have failed to inform these customers that their maximum upload speed had been halved.“Telstra's failure to inform customers that their broadband service had been changed denied them the opportunity to decide whether the changed service was suitable for their needs,” ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey was quoted as saying.The ACCC also noted that Telstra has either already compensated or committed to compensating all affected customers. Remediation includes a credit or payment of A$15 for each month they were on the lower upload speed plan.A company spokesperson told Reuters via email that Telstra has accepted the court's findings and is in the process of completing remediation for the final group of affected customers.This fine comes as Australian telecom firms face intense regulatory scrutiny, particularly following rival Optus’s two separate emergency call outages last month, one of which was linked to four deaths.","Australia's largest telecommunications company, Telstra, has been hit with an A$18 million (US$11.87 million) fine by the Federal Court.

In a post on microblogging platform X, the embassy writes: “At this time, scheduled passport and visa services in the United States and at U.S. Embassies and Consulates overseas will continue during the lapse in appropriations as the situation permits.”For those unaware, the US Embassy in India earlier this week shared that its X account will not be updated regularly until full operations resume.

The shutdown comes after Republicans and Democrats failed to agree a deal to keep the federal government funded.Every year, the Congress is required to approve spending bills by October 1, the start of the US fiscal year. This is mandatory to fund government departments and federal agencies.This year, no appropriations bills were passed before the deadline.The Republican lawmakers attempted to push through a temporary measure to keep the government open. The White House and Republican lawmakers pushed for what they called a “clean” continuing resolution (CR), which would maintain current funding levels until November 21.But, Democratic lawmakers resisted signing on to the Republican plans.

Palantir and Anduril’s upcoming services may be a concern for the US Army. A recent memo sent by the US Army (seen by the news agency Reuters) has warned about ""fundamental security"" problems in the new battlefield communications network being developed by Silicon Valley companies, including Palantir and Anduril.

It notes that the system allows any authorized user to access all apps and data regardless of clearance level or operational need, creating the potential for misuse of sensitive classified information without logging to track actions.","US Army has warned about ""fundamental security"" problems in the new battlefield communications network being developed by Silicon Valley companies, including Palantir and Anduril.

Tech race outpaces safety measures as risks mount





Yoshua Bengio, one of artificial intelligence's founding pioneers, is sounding the alarm that humanity could face extinction within 10 years as tech companies race to develop hyperintelligent machines capable of prioritizing their own survival over human life. The Université de Montréal professor, known for his work in deep learning, told the Wall Street Journal that creating machines ""way smarter than us"" with their own preservation instincts represents an existential threat. ""It's like creating a competitor to humanity that is smarter than us,"" Bengio warned.Recent experiments reveal a chilling scenario: when forced to choose between achieving their programmed objectives and preventing human death, some AI systems prioritize their goals over human life. Because these models learn from human language and behavior, they possess sophisticated persuasion capabilities that could manipulate people to serve machine interests rather than human welfare.The warning comes as OpenAI , Anthropic, Google 's Gemini, and Elon Musk 's xAI accelerate development of increasingly powerful AI systems. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has predicted AI will surpass human intelligence by decade's end, with some tech leaders suggesting that milestone could arrive even sooner.Bengio advocates for independent oversight of AI safety protocols and recently launched the nonprofit LawZero with $30 million in funding. The organization aims to develop ""non-agentic"" AI systems that can monitor and ensure the safety of technologies created by major tech companies.The AI pioneer estimates major risks could emerge within five to 10 years, though he cautions preparedness is essential if threats materialize sooner. ""The thing with catastrophic events like extinction, and even less radical events that are still catastrophic, like destroying our democracies, is that they're so bad that even if there was only a 1% chance it could happen, it's not acceptable,"" Bengio told the Journal.Despite years of warnings from Bengio and other AI safety advocates, development continues at breakneck speed as companies compete for dominance in what many consider technology's most transformative—and potentially dangerous—frontier.","Yoshua Bengio, one of artificial intelligence's founding pioneers, is sounding the alarm that humanity could face extinction within 10 years.

Japan faces a nationwide shortage of Asahi Super Dry, the country's most beloved beer, as a devastating ransomware attack has crippled production for nearly a week. Major retailers warn supplies could be exhausted within days, leaving supermarket shelves and izakaya pubs empty.The cyberattack struck Monday, disabling ordering and delivery systems across most of Asahi Group's 30 domestic factories. Five days into the crisis, Japan's largest brewer has no clear timeline for recovery, despite beginning manual order processing Friday.Convenience store giants including 7-Eleven, FamilyMart, and Lawson have already warned customers to expect shortages. One major retailer executive estimated Super Dry stocks would run dry at supermarkets within two to three days, forcing customers toward competitors like Suntory and Kirin—though many drinkers remain fiercely loyal to Super Dry's distinctive taste.The disruption extends beyond beer. Asahi produces soft drinks, bottled teas, baby food, and store-brand products for Japanese retailers, all now facing supply constraints. The company has indefinitely postponed launching eight new products, including fruit sodas and protein bars.Asahi produces approximately 6.7 million large bottles of beer daily in Japan. While investigating potential data breaches, the company confirmed traces of unauthorized data transfer but stated no customer information has been compromised.International operations, including European brands like Peroni, remain unaffected.Cybersecurity experts say Japanese companies have become prime ransomware targets due to weak defenses and a tendency to quietly pay demands. Japan's National Police Agency reported 222 ransomware attacks in 2024—a 12 percent increase—though experts believe this represents only a fraction of actual incidents.President Atsushi Katsuki apologized for the disruption, emphasizing the company's priority to restore supply chains. The incident echoes recent cyberattacks on major corporations, including Jaguar Land Rover, which required a £2 billion government credit line after production halted for a month.","Asahi Super Dry, Japan's most beloved beer, crippled by cyberattack.

Nvidia Hits $4.5 trillion market cap







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold his company stocks worth $42 million this week. With the latest transaction, the Nvidia CEO managed to capitalise on the soaring valuation of the company. The sale of the stock by Huang was disclosed in the Form filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. As per the filling, Hunag sold the Nvidia stocks under Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. For those unaware, the Rule 10b5-1 is a regulation from the US SEC. The plan enable the insiders at public companies to setup a plan under which they can sell their shared ahead of time. As part of this rule, major shareholders of the company can schedule the sale of a fixed number of shares at a set time. Following this rule enable them to avoid accusations of insider trading. Many company executives use 10b5-1 plans for this reason.The rule was introduced to clarify Rule 10b-5, part of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which is the main law used to investigate securities fraud.The trading plan adopted on March 20, 2025, allowed Huang to sell 225,000 shares between September 30 and October 2 at prices ranging from $182 to $191.As mentioned above, the Rule 10b5-1 allow corporate insiders to sell shares at a predetermined times and prices, shielding them from allegations of trading on non-public information.This same rule has been used by Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. both of whom have sold shares in recent months as their companies hit new highs amid the AI boom. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently sold approximately $5.15 million worth of company stock. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 2, 2025, the sales involved Class C Capital Stock and were executed at prices ranging from $157.23 to $159.97 per share. The move comes as Alphabet’s stock hovers near its 52-week low of $147.22, reflecting a roughly 20% decline year-to-date in 2025 amid broader market pressures on the tech sector.On the other hand, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sold a significant amount of his shares in the company in August last year. According to a report in the Investing website, the transaction took place on August 23 where Nadella sold 7,199 of his shares at an average price of $417.412 (approx. Rs 35,000), amounting to a total value of approximately $6,009,897.The sale occurred through multiple trades with prices ranging from $416.860 to $417.045.

Full text of US senator’s letter to TCS

Mr. Krithi Krithivasan

Chief Executive Officer, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)

101 Park Avenue, 26th Floor

New York, NY 10178

Dear Mr. Krithivasan,

We are concerned about some troubling employment trends in the tech industry. Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported that the tech sector’s unemployment rate was “well above” the overall jobless rate. The Federal Reserve also found that recent American graduates with STEM majors now face higher unemployment rates than the general population.

In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in C-suites over the past few years. TCS recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees worldwide, including American staff. For example, TCS laid off nearly five dozen employees in its Jacksonville office alone last month.

At the same time you have been laying off American employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for thousands of foreign workers. In fiscal year 2025, TCS received approval to hire 5,505 H-1B employees, making TCS the second-largest employer of newly approved H-1B beneficiaries in the nation. With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that TCS cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions.

TCS is already under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American workers in favor of newly hired South-Asian H-1B employees. TCS is doing itself no favors by replacing Americans with H-1Bs while this investigation is ongoing.

We would like to give you an opportunity to explain yourself. Please provide answers to the following questions, with accompanying data where appropriate, by October 10, 2025:

1. Why is TCS hiring foreign tech workers when hundreds of thousands of American tech workers have been laid off over the past few years?

2. Does TCS make a good faith effort to fill open positions with Americans before filing H 1B petitions? Explain in detail.

3. Does TCS hide H-1B recruitment ads by listing them separately from general hiring ads? 4. Has TCS displaced any American employees with H-1B employees?

5. Are your company’s H-1B hires provided the same salary and benefits as your American workers with the same qualifications? Please provide specific details.

6. How many H-1B workers at TCS were recruited and hired at level one wages? How many of those workers are still working at level one wages?

7. Does TCS outsource any hiring to contractors or staffing firms that place H-1B workers within your organization?

8. Of the H-1B workers currently working at TCS, how many of those workers are directly employed and paid by TCS?

9. Of the H-1B petitions TCS received approval for in 2025, how many workers were outsourced to other companies and how many employees’ salaries were paid by a firm other than TCS?

Sincerely,

Sen. Charles E. Grassley Sen. Richard J. Durbin Chairman Ranking Member

Senate Judiciary Committee Senate Judiciary Committee





US Senator Charles Grassley and Richard J. Durbin has sent a letter to Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) for hiring thousands of H-1B visa workers in the country while conducting ‘massive layoffs’ globally. The letter, dated September 24, 2025 is addressed to TCS CEO Krithi Krithivasan raises concerns about “troubling employment trends” in the tech industry. It quotes a Wall Street Journal report pointing at the tech sector’s unemployment rate, which is “well above” the overall jobless rate.The letter asks the Indian IT firm that while it has announced to lay off 12,000 employees worldwide, “you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for thousands of foreign workers”.“In fiscal year 2025, TCS received approval to hire 5,505 H-1B employees, making TCS the second-largest employer of newly approved H-1B beneficiaries in the nation,” the letter states.The letter also poses nine questions to TCS on its H-1B visa approvals. Notably, TCS is the second largest employer of H-1B visas. According to the government data, the tech giant bagged 5,505 approvals in the first half of 2025.","US Senator Charles Grassley and Richard J.

Aadhaar service charges: Fee structure and updates from 2025 to 2031 explained



Aadhaar generation: For children aged 0–5 years, the service is free for residents, with registrars receiving Rs 75 as assistance. For residents above 5 years, generation remains free for users, but registrars get Rs 125. This ensures enrolment services remain accessible while compensating registrars.

Mandatory biometric updates: Children aged 5–7 and 15–17 have free biometric updates, while others pay Rs 125. Biometric updates are important because fingerprints, iris scans, and photographs must be accurate for identity verification.

Demographic updates: Corrections to name, address, date of birth, or contact details cost Rs 75 when done separately, but are free if combined with a biometric update. Accurate demographic details are critical for banking, subsidies, taxation, and other official services.

Document updates: Proof of Identity (PoI) or Proof of Address (PoA) updates at enrolment centres or via the myAadhaar portal cost Rs 75. Online updates reduce the need for physical visits.

Aadhaar printouts: Residents can request physical copies of Aadhaar at Rs 40.

Financial assistance is provided to registrars only for successful transactions, encouraging accurate and complete enrolments.

Aadhaar generation: Fees for residents remain free, but registrar assistance increases to Rs 90 for children and Rs 150 for adults.

Mandatory biometric updates: Fees rise to Rs 150 for both children (ages 5–7 and 15–17) and adults (ages 7–15 and above 17). Accurate biometrics are essential for secure identity authentication.

Other biometric updates: Also increase to Rs 150, whether or not combined with demographic updates.

Demographic updates: Now cost Rs 90 for updates made online or at enrolment centres.

Document updates: PoA or PoI updates at centres or via myAadhaar portal increase to Rs 90.

Aadhaar printouts: Increase to Rs 50.

The revised structure ensures Aadhaar services remain sustainable while continuing to provide essential financial assistance to registrars. Residents are encouraged to plan their updates carefully, use online channels when possible, and keep their details accurate to avoid future verification issues.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has crossed a market valuation of $500 billion after a deal to help employees sell shares in the company, says a Bloomberg report. With this, the Sam Altman-led AI company has surpassed Elon Musk ’s space company SpaceX, becoming the world’s most-valuable startup. For reference, Elon Musk’s SpaceX was valued at $400 billion in July.OpenAI was previously valued at $300 billion in March this year, as part of a $40bn financing led by Japan’s SoftBank Group. Citing people familiar with the matter, the report says that company executives started talking about selling employee shares at a much higher valuation only a few months later.OpenAI has so far allowed its employees to sell up to $10bn of their shares but many elected not to sell. As part of the latest deal, current and former employees of OpenAI will be able to sell about $6.6 billion of their stock.As per the Bloomberg report, employees who have sold their shares to investors include Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX and T Rowe Price.The share sale is seen as a sign of intense appetite for AI exposure. The Bloomberg report says that investors have shown increased interest in fast-growing startups, betting that the leading player in the sector could one day be worth trillions.To recall, OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2022. Since then, the company’s annual recurring revenue has increased to $12 billion. The company projects it to rise to $20 billion by the end of 2025.Last month, chipmaker Nvidia said it plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, with the start-up agreeing to use as much as 10 gigawatts of computing power powered by Nvidia’s AI chips.The share sale is the latest sign of intense appetite for exposure to AI. Investors are piling into promising start-ups in the hope that the dominant company in the field will ultimately be worth trillions of dollars.","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has crossed a market valuation of $500 billion after a deal to help employees sell shares in the company.

Risher’s comeback playbook at Lyft

Lyft CEO David Risher recently revealed a moment in his career which drew sharp criticism from none other than Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates . Speaking at Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast, Risher recounted his 1996 decision to leave Microsoft for a then nascent startup Amazon . Risher revealed that his decision to join Amazon was called the ‘stupidest thing’ by Bill Gates.As reported by Bezinga, At the time when Risher decided to quit Microsoft, he was a rising star at the company. He said that he chose to join Jeff Bezos ’s fledgling online bookstore. Gates, unimpressed, reportedly told him: “You mean to tell me you’re leaving this company for some tiny, little internet bookstore that nobody’s ever heard of… that has got to be the stupidest decision I’ve ever heard anyone made.”Despite the rebuke, Risher followed his instincts, drawn to Bezos’s customer-first philosophy and long-term vision—principles that would later define Amazon’s meteoric rise to a $2.3 trillion tech titan.Now CEO of Lyft, Risher is channeling that same boldness to revive the ride-sharing company. Since taking the reins in 2023, he’s prioritized a customer-centric strategy, even going undercover as a driver to better understand user pain points.Under his leadership, Lyft has rolled out features like “Price Lock” and a 70% earnings guarantee for drivers—moves aimed at regaining market share and restoring profitability.Interestingly, Gates and Bezos—despite their past divergence over Amazon—now share common ground in backing FieldAI, a robotics startup. Their mutual interest in emerging technologies suggests that while their paths may differ, their vision for innovation continues to converge.","Lyft CEO David Risher revealed that his decision to join Amazon was called the ‘stupidest thing’ by Bill Gates.

What experts say





Microsoft has signed a deal with neocloud company Nebius Group NV worth up to $19.4 billion, reports Bloomberg. As per the report, the deal is aimed to secure computing power for its internal AI projects and consumer AI assistant. The report quotes people familiar with the matter who said that Microsoft will gain access to more than 100,000 of Nvidia’s latest GB300 chips under the agreement.The deal comes as Microsoft looks to tackle a global shortage of data center capacity needed for AI training. By using Nebius and other neocloud providers, Microsoft can free up its own servers to deliver more AI services to customers.“The strategy is aimed at coping with a shortage of AI data center capacity and letting Microsoft free up its own server farms to provide lucrative AI services to customers,” the Bloomberg report said.This is not Microsoft’s only partnership with smaller infrastructure firms. As per the report, the software giant has made over $33 billion in commitments to neocloud providers such as CoreWeave, Nscale, Lambda, and Nebius. These companies lease AI-focused server power, allowing Microsoft to quickly expand capacity without waiting to build new data centers.The report quotes Scott Guthrie, who leads Microsoft’s cloud division, who said “We are in very much land-grab mode in the AI space”, adding “We’ve made the decision that we don’t want to be constrained in terms of capacity.”Following the announcement, Nebius shares rose 5.5% in New York trading, while Microsoft’s stock remained mostly unchanged.Analysts say these neocloud deals also give Microsoft more flexibility by treating costs as operational expenses, rather than capital investments. At the same time, Microsoft is continuing to expand its own data centers, including a large-scale project in Wisconsin.","Microsoft has signed a deal with Nebius Group NV worth up to $19.4 billion.

“Sadly, despite this directive, the ground reality has become even more distressing. In Pune alone, nearly 2,500 employees have been forced to resign or have been abruptly removed in recent weeks,”

“The misinformation shared here is inaccurate and purposefully mischievous.

How TCS layoffs may have affected its employees



“Many of those affected are mid- to senior-level professionals who have given 10-20 years of dedicated service to the company. A large number are over 40 years of age, burdened with EMIs, school fees, medical expenses, and responsibilities towards ageing parents.

Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) is facing allegations regarding job cuts. The IT employees’ body, Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES), has alleged that India’s largest IT company forced nearly 2,500 employees in Pune to resign from their jobs. In a recent letter (seen by the news agency PTI), NITES President Harpreet Singh Saluja has requested the Maharashtra Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis , for timely intervention to protect the interests of the affected employees. Saluja also noted that the Union Labour Ministry has directed the Maharashtra labour secretary to take necessary action based on NITES's representation. This comes after the company announced that it would lay off approximately 2% of its global workforce (12,261 employees) in June, with most of those affected holding middle and senior roles.NITES wrote in the letter to Fadnavis.However, TCS dismissed the allegations, noting that only a limited number of employees were affected by the company’s recent initiative to realign skills.In a statement to PTI, TCS said:NITES also claimed that the impacted employees are more than just numbers; they are parents, breadwinners, caregivers, and the support system for thousands of households across Maharashtra.the IT employees’ body noted in the letter.NITES has also alleged that TCS is violating the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, by terminating employees without notice to the government, denying statutory retrenchment compensation, and coercing staff intoThe letter warned that the education of employees’ children is at risk, loans may go unpaid, and families faceThe body reportedly urged Fadnavis to support affected families in theirensure employees get their lawful rights, halt further terminations until due process is followed and hold TCS management accountable.","Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) is facing allegations regarding job cuts.

US H-1B visa processing frozen: How US government shutdown risks legal status for Indian and other international tech workers in America,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-h-1b-visa-processing-frozen-how-us-government-shutdown-risks-legal-status-for-indian-and-other-international-tech-workers-in-america/articleshow/124286818.cms,"US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

US Labor Department closure halts all new H-1B visa applications

No end date for government shutdown as H-1B visa fee hikes and policy changes loom





The US government shutdown that began October 1 has brought H-1B visa processing to a standstill, dealing a severe blow to Indian professionals who represent over 71% of H-1B beneficiaries. The Department of Labor, which issues critical Labour Condition Applications (LCAs) required before any H-1B petition can proceed, has stopped operations due to the funding lapse.Immigration attorneys warn that no new H-1B visas can be issued, employer transfers cannot be processed, and status changes are impossible unless workers already secured LCA approval before the shutdown. Sophie Alcorn, a Silicon Valley-based immigration lawyer, noted that new applicants will be hit hardest, while applications already in process may continue unaffected since the US Citizenship and Immigration Services operates on filing fees rather than congressional appropriations.Before any company can sponsor an H-1B visa, an LCA must be filed with and approved by the Department of Labor, making this authorisation essential for advancing cases to immigration authorities. The department also handles PERM certifications required for employment-based green cards, meaning those processes are similarly frozen.The shutdown creates particular anxiety for thousands of tech workers on visas, many with partners and children, whose legal status depends entirely on timely government approvals.Startups face workforce uncertainty, including founders who may themselves be on visas, as the pipeline for hiring and renewing high-skilled worker visas remains completely frozen.O-1 visa holders, typically granted to individuals with extraordinary ability in sciences, arts, or business, face similar uncertainties as the shutdown affects overall immigration processing timelines.The processing halt comes amid broader immigration turmoil. President Trump recently announced a steep $100,000 fee hike for new H-1B applicants and plans to overhaul the existing lottery system to prioritise higher-wage workers.There is no announced end date for the shutdown, which began at 12:01 AM local time on October 1. The last shutdown during Trump's presidency lasted 35 days, becoming the longest government shutdown in over four decades. Until Congress reaches a funding agreement, Indian professionals seeking to work in the US face an indefinite wait.","Department of Labor issues critical Labour Condition Applications (LCAs) required before any H-1B petition can proceed.

Meta’s Superintelligence Labs (MSL) is reportedly witnessing a major internal shift in how its AI teams create and deploy products. As reported by Business Insider, an internal memo of Meta’s Superintelligence Labs reveals that MSL CEO Nat Friedman and former GitHub chief has asked the engineers to adopt external platforms like Vercel, GitHub because of the sluggishness of Meta’s legacy infrastructure.According to the Business Insider report, the push comes as Meta races to accelerate its AI development and compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google . As per the internal memo, MSL infrastructure head Aparna Ramani, said that Meta’s internal systems created for billions of users and massive engineering teams are too slow for the experimental workflows need by AI researchers.“Deploying changes takes too long (hours vs. minutes), and the overall tech stack is not conducive to vibe coding,” Ramani wrote. For those unaware, vibe coding refers to a practice of using AI tools to generate and iterate codes faster and Meta’s present system is not equipped to do vibe coding.In order to go ahead wit the development, MSL’s Product and Applied Research (PAR) group has combined GitHub with Vercel, which is a fast-growing platform used ofor developing and deploying web and AI apps. The internal posts show that Meta is already running 10 projects on the stack, with update times reduced from 99 minutes to just two.Both Friedman and Meta’s chief AI officer Alexandr Wang are both investors in Vercel, which recently raised around $300 million at $9.3 billion valuation. Its clients include Netflix, Adobe, and Stripe.While Meta is using Vercel on immediate basis, the company is also working on creating its own internal platform called Nest. As reported by BI, a working prototype of the platform was expected within weeks of the memo. Nest is said to become the default option for Meta’s AI teams with Vercel functioning as a backup."," Meta’s Superintelligence Labs (MSL) is reportedly witnessing a major internal shift in how its AI teams create and deploy products.

Apple removes IceBlock app amid Donald Trump administration pressure on ICE tracking tools



IceBlock app faces government warnings while creator defends users’ rights



Implications for tech, privacy, and civil liberties



Also Read |





In a move that has sparked debate over technology, privacy, and government oversight, Apple has removed several applications from its App Store that allowed users to receive alerts about nearby Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The most notable among them was ICEBlock, a free app with hundreds of thousands of users that enabled individuals to anonymously share ICE locations within a five-mile radius announced on Thursday.The removals come amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration, which reportedly threatened legal action against both the app’s creators and media outlets reporting on it. Apple cited law enforcement contact as the reason for its decision, highlighting the increasing tension between tech companies, government authorities, and questions over digital privacy, free speech, and civil liberties.ICEBlock allowed users to anonymously report the locations of nearby ICE agents, functioning similarly to popular navigation apps like Waze, which enable users to alert others about police presence or hazards on the road. The app’s creators emphasized the App Store as the safest platform for downloading and using the app.By offering real-time alerts, ICEBlock became a lightning rod in the national discussion over immigration enforcement, privacy rights, and free speech protections.Critics argued that it could endanger federal agents, while supporters defended it as a tool for awareness and community protection.Apple confirmed it removed ICEBlock and other similar apps after receiving contact from “law enforcement,” though it did not specify which agency or agencies were involved. This decision has prompted broader questions about the role of tech companies in controlling access to tools that may affect government operations, law enforcement, and civil liberties.The removal also reflects a wider campaign by the Trump administration targeting apps it claimed could undermine law enforcement, further highlighting the delicate balance tech firms must maintain between compliance and user freedom.Officials in the Trump administration reportedly issued multiple legal warnings regarding ICEBlock. Kristi Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security, indicated that the Justice Department was exploring whether media outlets such as CNN could face prosecution for reporting on the app, claiming that publicizing ICEBlock might “actively encourage people to avoid law enforcement activities.” The exact legal basis for such claims remained unclear.Pam Bondi, the attorney general, also noted that Joshua Aaron, the Texas-based creator of ICEBlock, was under scrutiny, warning him to “watch out.” These statements underscore the administration’s aggressive approach toward digital tools that could enable tracking or evasion of federal agents.In response to growing pressure, Joshua Aaron publicly defended ICEBlock, emphasizing that creating or using the app is protected under free speech laws. He compared ICEBlock to mainstream navigation apps that alert users to police activity and stressed that the app itself is not illegal.Aaron also highlighted the risks faced when challenging what he perceives as authoritarian government actions: “If you push back against a regime purporting authoritarianism, subverting the Constitution, you have to know they’re going to come after you in some way.”Apple’s removal of ICE-tracking apps illustrates the ongoing tension between corporate responsibility, legal compliance, and user freedoms. The controversy surrounding ICEBlock raises important questions about how governments engage with technology platforms, the impact of apps on civic participation, and the limits of free speech in the digital age.As attention on privacy, law enforcement monitoring, and digital activism grows, the ICEBlock case may serve as a precedent for how tech companies, government agencies, and users navigate the complex intersection of law, technology, and civil liberties.","Apple removes IceBlock app amid Donald Trump administration pressure on ICE tracking tools.

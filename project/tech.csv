ISRO to launch 52 spy satellites over next 5 years: INSPACe chairman Pawan Goenka,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/isro-to-launch-52-spy-satellites-over-next-5-years-inspace-chairman-pawan-goenka/articleshow/120983232.cms,"India is stepping up its space-based surveillance capabilities by putting in orbit a constellation of 52 satellites over the next five years with a strong participation from the private sector, the top boss of a key nodal agency has said. ""We have fairly strong capabilities already. It is just that it needs constant enhancement,"" Pawan Kumar Goenka, Chairman, Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) told PTI on the sidelines of the Global Space Exploration Conference-2025 here.Goenka said over the next five years, 52 satellites will be launched to increase the surveillance capabilities for the defence sector.""So far, this was primarily done by ISRO , we will bring in the private sector as we move forward to enhance surveillance capabilities,"" he said.The satellites will help the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force, track enemy movements, monitor borders, and improve real-time coordination during military operations.""The private sector will deliver half of the 52 satellites, while the rest will be built by ISRO,"" said Goenka, who heads the space sector regulator and promoter.Goenka made it clear that decisions to further enhance the surveillance capabilities will have to be taken by the Union Home Ministry and the defence forces.He said ISRO is also in the process of transferring technology of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) to the private sector.An SSLV is developed to launch small satellites into low earth orbit at a shorter notice, a capability required by the defence forces in times of emergencies.Such vehicles are capable of launching satellites weighing 10kg to 500kg mass into a 500 km circular orbit.An SSLV is a three-stage launch vehicle with all solid propulsion stages and liquid propulsion based Velocity Trimming Module (VTM) as terminal stage.The design drivers of SSLV are low cost, low turn-around time, flexibility in accommodating multiple satellites, launch on demand feasibility, and minimal launch infrastructure requirements.""The transfer of technology for SSLV is imminent now,"" Goenka said, indicating that it may be announced over the next fortnight.","The satellites will help the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force, track enemy movements, monitor borders, and improve real-time coordination during military operations.

How one sentence from top Apple executive cost Google $160 billion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-one-sentence-from-top-apple-executive-cost-google-160-billion/articleshow/120980447.cms,"Apple looks to add more AI players to search

Google-parent company Alphabet’s shares tanked about 8% on Wednesday (May 7), wiping out $160 from the company’s market capitalisation following Apple executive Eddy Cue ’s testimony in the ongoing antitrust case against the search giant. Cue revealed that the iPhone maker is “actively looking at” overhauling Safari's search capabilities and that Google searches on Safari experienced their first-ever decline last month.According to a report by The Verge, Apple’s senior vice president attributed the dip to the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by users, a technology Apple is now considering incorporating directly into Safari.“That has never happened in 22 years,” the senior vice president of Apple's services division stated during the trial. Not only Google, Apple’s shares also dropped 2% following Cue’s testimony.According to Cue, Apple is also looking to integrate AI-powered search options into its Safari web browser, posing a threat to Google's highly profitable search advertising business. According to Bloomberg, Cue indicated that Apple intends to add AI search providers, including OpenAI and Perplexity AI, as alternative search options within Safari in the future.“We will add them to the list — they probably won’t be the default,” he said. However, he still prefers Google as the default in Safari, saying that he has lost sleep over the possibility of losing the revenue share from their agreement.“I’ve lost a lot of sleep thinking about it,” Cue said, adding that other AI players competing with Google need to improve. He noted that Cue also said that LLMs will continue to improve.Google pays the iPhone maker billions of dollars per year — as much as $20 billion per year back in 2022, according to testimony in the trial — to be the default search engine on iPhones.",Google-parent company Alphabet’s shares tanked about 8% on Wednesday (May 7) following Apple executive Eddy Cue ’s testimony in the ongoing antitrust case against the search giant.

DEA stops using body cams to be 'consistent' with Trump's executive order; sends email to staff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dea-stops-using-body-cams-to-be-consistent-with-trumps-executive-order-sends-email-to-staff/articleshow/120972448.cms,"Representative Image

What DEA and other agencies said about stopping the use of body cams



How the order for US law enforcement to use body cams has changed over the years



The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) may have quietly ended its body camera program, a report claims. This move helped the law enforcement agency align with a recent executive order from US President Donald Trump . This change was reportedly communicated to staff via an internal email from DEA headquarters sent last month and has not been publicly announced by the agency yet. According to the email (seen by ProPublica), links to body camera policy pages on the DEA’s official website have been broken since then, suggesting that the program’s infrastructure has been deactivated. The email also informed employees that the decision was made to remain “consistent” with the latest executive order, which revoked a 2022 requirement for all federal law enforcement agents to use body-worn cameras.As per the report, the DEA declined to address inquiries about ending the camera program, stating that it “does not comment on tools and techniques.” The report also cited a former federal prosecutor who has warned that removing the cameras could complicate operations for DEA agents. On the other hand, Reuters linked the change as part of broader budget cuts for law enforcement agencies in a separate report.However, at least two other Justice Department (DoJ) agencies—the US Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives—continue to require body cameras, the report cited their spokesperson for the same. Meanwhile, the FBI has also redirected questions about its policy to the DoJ and declined to comment.The DoJ mandated body-worn cameras for its federal agents following the George Floyd protests in 2021. Later on, in 2022, then-President Joe Biden mandated that all federal law enforcement officers be equipped with body cameras. That requirement was revoked in January by the Trump administration, which also changed nearly 100 other directives deemed “harmful.”Soon after, in February, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) eliminated its camera program, and footage from subsequent operations shows agents making arrests without visible recording devices.A 2022 DoJ Office of Inspector General report described the cameras as a way to boost accountability and public trust. Research by the Police Executive Research Forum indicated that departments using body cameras see fewer complaints against officers, though it remains unclear whether this reflects better officer behaviour or fewer frivolous claims.The DoJ invested heavily in the initiative, awarding Axon a $30.4 million contract in 2021 for cameras and evidence-management software. Despite the contract remaining active, only about one-sixth of its value has been disbursed so far.A DEA policy issued in December 2022 required agents to activate cameras only during planned arrests or warrant-based searches within the US. Videos had to be uploaded within 72 hours or immediately if any officer got involved in a shooting and could be used in internal investigations. The agency’s fiscal 2025 budget request included $15.8 million and funding for 69 staff positions to roll out body cameras nationwide in phases, the report added.","The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) may have quietly ended its body camera program, a report claims.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-know-about-facebook-founders-viral-rawdog-routine/articleshow/120843936.cms,"Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

‘rawdog’ morning routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well. Here’s how it aligns with executive performance demands:While Zuckerberg avoids all forms of chemical stimulation, other tech leaders have taken diverse approaches to optimizing performance:Zuckerberg’s ‘rawdog’ method is unique in its emphasis on no external stimulants, which sets it apart from the above figures.While no clinical studies have yet been conducted on Zuckerberg’s specific regimen, related research suggests:","Zuckerberg’s morning includes two hours of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA) He believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity. The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120844476,imgsize-1833412,width-400,resizemode-4/Why-Mark-Zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-Know-about-Facebook-founders-viral-Rawdog-routine.jpg"

Microsoft becomes world's most-valuable company and its No 1 position also has 'Trump Tariff' message on Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-company-and-its-no-1-position-also-has-trump-tariff-message-on-apple/articleshow/120845348.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella



Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

Paul Tudor Jones on impact of Trump’s tariffs on stock market

Paul Tudor Jones , the billionaire hedge fund manager has raised concerns about the future of AI . Speaking at CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’, Jones shared his insights from a tech conference he recently attended. Jones said that although AI can be a “force for good” in health and education, experts at the event warned that “AI clearly poses an imminent security threat in our lifetimes to humanity.” He further stated that during the conference, a breakout session included a panel of AI developers. All four panelists reportedly agreed with a statement that ""there's a 10% chance in the next 20 years that AI will destroy 50% of humanity.""While Jones did not provide many details about their arguments, he mentioned concerns over ""biohacking"" and ""weapons"" as key risks linked to the rapid growth of AI technology.Jones said these warnings show that AI needs to be handled carefully to avoid serious threats in the future.During the appearance, Jones also talked about the impact of Trump’s tariff, stating that the U.S. trade war with China was past the point of no return. He suggested that the impact caused by tariffs announced by Trump could outlast him.Estimating that stocks can hit new lows even if Trump backtracks from his aggressive tariffs, he said “It's pretty clear. You have Trump who's locked in on tariffs. You have the Fed who's locked in on not cutting rates. That's not good for the stock market”.",Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones has raised concerns about the future of AI.

PwC layoffs: Impacted employees

Here’s what PwC said on the job cuts

Deloitte, KPMG among Big Fours announcing job cuts

PwC, one of the Big Four accounting firms , has laid off about 1,500 employees in the US. According to a Financial Times report, the layoffs affect 2% of PwC’s 75,000 employees in the US. Quoting people familiar with the matter, the report states that most of the impacted staff worked in the audit and tax departments. The job cuts followed a months-long review of the business. Earlier, PwC had shifted hundreds of U.S. employees from less busy roles to faster-growing areas.Affected employees were notified on Monday and Tuesday this week. Hundreds of them received a Microsoft Teams meeting invite marked “time sensitive” in their email, the publication added.Many of the employees laid off had only recently joined PwC. One person who started in September told FT that they were ""devastated."" “Everyone was completely blindsided by the lay-offs today,” the person said.Another employee added, “Some of us were up for promotion, but instead of a promotion and a pay bump we’re now getting cut off.”The firm is also reducing campus hiring because of lower staff turnover but will honor the offers already made to last year’s interns who are scheduled to join later this year, the person said.“This was a difficult decision, and we made it with care, thoughtfulness and a deep awareness of its impact on our people, appreciating that historically low levels of attrition over consecutive years have made it necessary to take this step,” reads a statement from the company.Other Big Four firms have also announced similar job cuts. Earlier this year, Deloitte informed its employees that the group is laying off staff across its advisory business. “Overall demand for Deloitte’s services remains strong,” the firm said in an internal call then. “We are taking modest personnel actions based on moderating growth in certain areas, our government clients’ evolving needs, and low levels of voluntary attrition.”KPMG also laid off around 330 employees in the U.S. in November last year. The firm then said it was “addressing continued low levels of attrition”.","PwC, one of the Big Four accounting firms, has laid off about 1,500 employees in the US.

Also, SpaceX is still serving as one of the biggest contractor for both DoD and NASA and it turns out be a win-win situation for Elon Musk.""Because SpaceX performs significant work for the federal government across the national security and civil space architectures, even the perception of a conflict of interest is very troubling, and Mr. Musk's influence over the agencies awarding large contracts to his company goes far beyond mere perception,"" the letter said.The lawmakers are urging greater scrutiny of Musk’s involvement in federal decision-making, warning that even the perception of favouritism could damage public trust in government contracting.With agency inputs",US lawmakers are raising concerns about the conflict of interests arising from Elon Musk ’s dual roles as the CEO SpaceX and a special government employee overseeing changes at NASA and the Department of Defense.

Nvidia builds tech to fight AI chip smuggling







Nvidia has refuted a report which claimed that the Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek is utilising smuggled Blackwell chips to develop its upcoming AI model. DeepSeek drew attention in January this year when it launched the R1 AI model which, the company claimed, was trained at a fraction of the cost of comparable US-made models.“We haven’t seen any substantiation or received tips of ‘phantom datacenters’ constructed to deceive us and our OEM partners, then deconstructed, smuggled, and reconstructed somewhere else,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement, as per CNBC.“While such smuggling seems farfetched, we pursue any tip we receive,” the spokesperson added. The denial follows a report by The Information that alleged DeepSeek has been using the advanced chips, which were snuck into the country without authorisation.The US has banned the export of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips, which are considered the company’s most advanced offerings, to China as part of its strategy to maintain a lead in the global AI race.Earlier in the day, a report said that Nvidia has built a new location verification technology that can help the company track its AI chips and prevent their smuggling into restricted countries like China. The feature has been demonstrated privately and will be an optional software agent that customers can install.An Nvidia official explained that the software is designed to allow customers to track a chip's overall computing performance.“We're in the process of implementing a new software service that empowers data center operators to monitor the health and inventory of their entire AI GPU fleet,” Nvidia stated.",Report claims Chinese AI startup DeepSeek is using smuggled Nvidia chips.

How to apply for e-passport





The Ministry of External Affairs rolled out e-passport service under the Passport Seva Programme (PSP V2.0). With the new system, the government aims to facilitate faster, more secure, and smooth travel for all Indian passport holders. While the existing ones remain valid till their expiry, anyone applying for a passport will get a chip-enabled passport by default, irrespective of whether they apply in India or abroad.As explained by the external affairs ministry in a press release, the e-Passport is a hybrid passport that combines both paper and electronic elements. It features an embedded Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip and an antenna, which store and secure the holder’s data in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.Critical information printed on the data page is also stored electronically on the chip, enabling enhanced security and authentication, the ministry says. Going forward, all newly issued passports will be e-Passports, while existing non-electronic passports will remain valid until their expiry, it added.As mentioned above, any Indian citizen who is eligible for a regular passport can apply for e-passport.The process of applying for an e-passport is the same as that of applying for a regular passport. Applicants are required to first register on the official Passport Seva portal using their personal details. After completing the registration, they must fill in the online application form carefully and pay the prescribed fee through the available payment options.Once the payment is completed, applicants are required to book an appointment at a nearby Passport Seva Kendra or Post Office Passport Seva Kendra, based on their location and slot availability. On the scheduled date, the applicant must visit the selected centre in person for document verification.During the appointment, biometric details of the applicant are captured. This includes taking fingerprints and a photograph, which are used for identity verification and are later embedded securely into the e-passport’s electronic chip.After the verification process is completed and the application is cleared, the e-passport is printed with the embedded chip that stores the holder’s biometric and personal details. The finished e-passport is then dispatched and delivered to the applicant’s registered residential address through the postal system.","The Ministry of External Affairs rolled out e-passport service under the Passport Seva Programme (PSP V2.0) The new system aims to facilitate faster, more secure, and smooth travel for all Indian passport holders.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate jobs in the long run. Speaking in an interview with Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures, Dimon urged workers to focus on human skills such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence and communication to stay relevant in the future workforce. He said individuals should build skills that machines cannot easily copy. These include problem-solving, emotional understanding, creativity, and clear communication.Jamie Dimon said that while companies have been cautious about hiring in recent months, this slowdown is not being driven by AI. He also said he does not expect the technology to cause large job losses in the immediate future.“For the most part, AI is going to do great stuff for mankind, like tractors did, like fertilizers did, like vaccines did,” Dimon said during the interview. “You know, maybe one day we’ll be working less hard but having wonderful lives.”At the same time, Jamie Dimon stressed that AI will eventually replace some jobs and that people must prepare for this shift. Notably, this is not the first time Dimon has warned about AI eliminating jobs. He has previously warned that automation will change the nature of work. In November 2025, Dimon said AI could help people in developed countries move toward a much shorter workweek of around three-and-a-half days over the next 20 to 40 years.Dimon also said that AI must be regulated properly to limit its risks, just as earlier technologies were brought under rules to protect society. He said both governments and companies have a shared responsibility to manage the impact of AI on workers.“We—government and we the companies, society—should look at how do we phase it in a way that we don’t damage a lot of people,” he said. He pointed to past examples where factory closures hurt entire towns and said better support could have reduced the damage. “You can retrain people, relocate people, income assistance, early retirement,” he added.While warning about future job losses, Dimon also said AI is already creating new jobs in the short term. He said the growth of AI requires large investments in infrastructure, including construction work and fibre-optic networks, which will generate employment.","Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence will eliminate jobs in the long run.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently hinted at building data centres in space. In an interview with Fox News, Pichai said that the company is working on quantum computing, adding “in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun”.Sundar Pichai’s video from the interview was shared by X (formerly Twitter) user - Bourbon Capital in an online post. It caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who replied to the post with a single word. “Interesting”, Musk wrote.“At Google, we are always proud of taking moon shots,” Pichai said, adding “... Waymo … has been over a decade in the making.”“We're working on quantum computing, in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun,” he continued.Pichai further said that the company wants to “put these data centers in space closer to the sun”, and will take “first step in 2027”.“We'll send tiny racks of machines and have them in satellites, test them out, and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away will be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centers,” Sundar Pichai said in the interview.Notably, this echoes Musk's November 2025 announcements that SpaceX will pioneer orbital data centers using next-gen Starlink satellites, positioning them as the lowest-cost AI compute option within five years.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is working on quantum computing.

SpaceX Gateway network to span across six cities, and Bengaluru office expands





Starlink has officially denied that Indian pricing, calling the incident a technical glitch rather than an intentional reveal. Lauren Dreyer, Vice President of Starlink Business Operations, clarified in a post on X that the company's India website is not yet live and is not accepting orders.She explained that a configuration error caused internal dummy test data to briefly appear publicly, which was quickly corrected once discovered. Dreyer emphasized that Starlink has not announced official pricing for India and any figures currently circulating online are inaccurate. The company remains focused on obtaining final government approvals before launching service in the country, and both the website and ordering system will stay inactive until the regulatory process is complete.Elon Musk's Starlink has revealed the residential satellite internet pricing for India at Rs 8,600 monthly, plus a Rs 34,000 hardware kit, as the SpaceX subsidiary prepares for commercial operations. The service targets households in remote and underserved areas with promises of unlimited data, 99.9% uptime, and weather-resistant connectivity where traditional broadband infrastructure fails to reach.Following regulatory clearance from the Department of Telecommunications in July, Starlink is positioning itself to challenge established players Jio-SES and Eutelsat OneWeb in India's satellite communications sector.The residential plan, priced at a monthly subscription cost of Rs 8,600 offers unlimited data without usage caps or throttling, addressing critical connectivity gaps in rural regions. Starlink's system requires minimal installation effort, with users simply powering on equipment and pointing it skyward to establish connections. However, the hardware kit will cost customers Rs 34,000, which the company says is a one time fees. The company guarantees over 99.9% uptime and all-weather functionality, crucial features for areas experiencing frequent service disruptions.New customers receive a 30-day trial period, allowing households to evaluate performance before long-term commitment. This trial provision acknowledges the premium pricing structure, which places Starlink among India's higher-cost broadband options despite targeting underserved markets.Business subscription pricing remains unannounced, with enterprise-focused plans expected as commercial rollout advances.Starlink is deploying gateway earth stations across Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, and Noida to enable satellite-to-ground communications.

Instagram Your Algorithm availability







Instagram has said that it is rolling out a new feature called “Your Algorithm” that will allow users greater control over the content they see, beginning with the Reels tab. The company stated that the update uses AI to adapt the user’s feed as their interests evolve, making recommendations more tailored and meaningful.“Instagram has always been a place to dive deep into your interests and connect with friends. As your interests evolve over time, we want to give you more meaningful ways to control what you see on Instagram, starting with Reels. Using AI, you can now more easily view and personalise the topics that shape your Reels, making recommendations feel even more tailored to you,” the company said.Users can access the new functionality by looking for a specific icon (two lines with hearts) in the upper right corner while watching Reels. Tapping the icon opens “Your Algorithm,” where users can manage their content preferences. The feature offers three key functions:See Your Top Interests: Users can view a summary of the topics Instagram currently believes they care about most.Tune Preferences: Users can also type in specific topics they want to see more or less of, and their Reels recommendations will adjust accordingly.Share ‘Your Algorithm’: Users will get an option to share their interests to their Story, allowing friends and followers to see what they are watching.The new feature is available starting in the United States and is scheduled to roll out globally in English soon. Instagram plans to expand this ability to control the algorithm beyond the Reels tab, with plans to bring the functionality to the Explore tab and other parts of the app in the future.","Instagram has said that it is rolling out a new feature called ‘Your Algorithm’ The update uses AI to adapt the user’s feed as their interests evolve, making recommendations more tailored and meaningful.

Nvidia has built technology to fight AI chip smuggling: Here's how it will work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-has-built-technology-to-fight-ai-chip-smuggling-heres-how-it-will-work/articleshow/125893172.cms,"Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Which Nvidia AI chips will get the feature first









Nvidia has reportedly built a new location verification technology that can help the company locate its artificial intelligence (AI) chips and eventually prevent them from being smuggled into countries where their export is banned. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the company demonstrated the feature privately and will be an optional software agent that customers could install. The software utilises the confidential computing capabilities of its Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).The report further said that an Nvidia official explained that the software is designed to allow customers to track a chip’s overall computing performance and uses time delay in communication with Nvidia servers to provide a rough sense of the chip’s location.“We're in the process of implementing a new software service that empowers data center operators to monitor the health and inventory of their entire AI GPU fleet,” Nvidia was quoted as saying.The report says that the location feature will first be available on Nvidia’s latest “Blackwell” chips, which incorporate enhanced security features for “attestation” compared to prior Hopper and Ampere generations. If released, the technology could address repeated calls from the White House and US lawmakers for measures to prevent the smuggling of AI chips to restricted countries, notably China.Previously, Nvidia strongly denied that its chips contain any backdoors. Software experts have maintained that it is possible for the company to implement chip location verification without compromising the security of its offerings.This comes days after President Donald Trump announced he would allow exports of the Nvidia H200 to China. It is the successor to H100 chips and predecessor to the current Blackwell chips, however, reports have said that China may not permit their purchase.","N Nvidia has reportedly built a new location verification technology that can help the company locate its artificial intelligence (AI) chips.

Production company defends ""seven weeks"" of AI work

The growing trend raises questions about creative jobs





McDonald's has removed its AI-generated Christmas commercial from YouTube following intense criticism from viewers who called the advertisement ""creepy,"" ""depressing,"" and distasteful. The 45-second spot, created for McDonald's Netherlands, sparked such fierce backlash that the company disabled comments before ultimately delisting the video entirely.The controversial ad, titled ""It's the most terrible time of the year,"" took a cynical approach to holiday advertising. It featured rapid-fire AI-generated scenes of Christmas disasters—presents falling off car roofs, exploding trees, burnt cookies, and tangled lights—suggesting viewers should ""hide out in McDonald's until January's here."" Critics slammed both the use of AI technology and the ad's anti-holiday messaging, with one viewer commenting: ""Ditch your family and hide in McDonald's because Christmas sucks???""The Sweetshop, the production company behind the ad, released a defensive statement claiming their team ""hardly slept"" for seven weeks while generating ""thousands of takes"" using AI tools. CEO Melanie Bridge insisted, ""AI didn't make this film. We did.""That statement backfired spectacularly. Social media users mocked the claim of arduous work, with one viral post joking: ""Our fingers hurt from typing prompts. AI bros are some of the most unserious people on the planet."" The phrase became a meme, highlighting skepticism about AI-generated content requiring significant creative effort.The McDonald's debacle highlights broader concerns about AI's impact on the creative industry.Critics argue that AI-generated advertising threatens livelihoods across film production, acting, and design sectors while producing inferior results that lack authentic human connection.The ad featured distinctly artificial visuals—glossy, blurry imagery with physics-defying movements and briefly glimpsed characters whose limbs occasionally appeared distorted or ""jellylike."" These telltale signs of AI generation have become increasingly recognizable to audiences, who view the technology as a cost-cutting measure rather than creative innovation.Other major brands including Coca-Cola, Toys R Us, Google, and Under Armour have also released AI-generated advertisements this year, signaling a potential industry shift despite consistent consumer pushback. The trend suggests companies may be willing to absorb negative reactions in exchange for reduced production costs and faster turnaround times.","McDonald's pulled its AI-generated Christmas ad after backlash for its ""creepy"" and ""depressing"" message.

He revealed this at the WSJ CEO Council Summit, stating he should have prioritized cultural changes earlier. Stankey also highlighted AT&T's push for AI adoption among employees, viewing skill development in this area as crucial for future success.

Culture memo gave leaders 'air cover' to execute changes

AT&T pushes AI adoption as part of cultural transformation





AT&T CEO John Stankey acknowledged a misstep in his approach to transforming company culture—but it wasn't the controversial memo that told employees to accept a five-day office mandate or find work elsewhere. Speaking at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit on Tuesday, Stankey said his mistake was moving too slowly on cultural changes, not the directive itself.When asked to identify a mistake he's made, Stankey pointed to his delayed action on the company's ""culture evolution."" He explained that he initially positioned the cultural shift as one of several business priorities rather than making it the top focus from the start. According to Business Insider, which first reported on Stankey's blunt August memo to managers, the CEO said he should have prioritized the changes earlier and forced specific actions to make them happen more quickly.The August memo, which went viral after Business Insider obtained and published it, described AT&T's shift toward a ""more market-based culture"" focused on rewarding capability and contribution rather than loyalty and tenure.In the lengthy communication, Stankey told employees that if they preferred hybrid or virtual work schedules, they would ""have a difficult time aligning"" with company priorities.At the WSJ summit, Stankey defended the memo's purpose, telling moderator Alan Murray, president of the WSJ Leadership Institute, that people shouldn't ""over-rotate"" on it. He characterized it as one step in a series of actions designed to establish a framework and eliminate excuses for leaders who wanted to drive change. The memo, he said, provided context for the business framework he was building and gave leaders the ""air cover"" they needed to execute around that vision.The telecom giant has undergone significant changes over the past year, including the five-day return-to-office mandate that replaced a hybrid schedule. Some AT&T employees previously told Business Insider they faced challenges securing office desks and parking spaces following the policy change, while competitor Verizon reportedly used the mandate as a recruiting opportunity.At Tuesday's event, Stankey also outlined how AT&T is pushing employees to adopt artificial intelligence through tutorials and educational tools. He emphasized that he's monitoring who uses these resources as part of evaluating skill development. ""I want to see who's building their skill set, where they're building, and this is just the next set of skills that people are going to have to have,"" he told attendees.AT&T shares have risen more than 21 percent in 2025, with the company posting strong earnings that met analyst expectations over the past two quarters.","AT&T CEO John Stankey admitted to a misstep in his approach to transforming company culture.

Jeff Dean, Chief Scientist, Google DeepMind and Google Research recently said that rival Tesla has nowhere “near the volume of rider-only autonomous miles that (Google-owned) Waymo has”. The post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who responded sharply to Dean’s post writing “Waymo never really had a chance against Tesla”.It all started when Jeff Dean shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), writing:“Waymo's system, fueled by careful collection of a large volume of fully autonomous data, is the most advanced, large-scale application of embodied AI today. Very proud to see this level of engineering rigor tackling safe autonomous driving making the roads safer for everyone (and it has been nice to see various Google research collaborations with Waymo be a part of these advances!).The insights here are foundational for how we design and safely scale all complex AI systems.”An X user replied to Dean’s post: “I would be interested to see your arguments compared to Tesla who also claim to be the most advanced large scale application of embodied AI.”Jeff Dean replied back writing “I don't think Tesla has anywhere near the volume of rider-only autonomous miles that Waymo has (96M for Waymo, as of today).The safety data is quite compelling for Waymo, as well.” He also shared a link to Waymo’s safety impact in the post.Musk joined the conversation writing “Waymo never really had a chance against Tesla. This will be obvious in hindsight.”According to experts, Waymo's steady growth has become a challenge for Tesla, even as Elon Musk touts updates on Tesla Robotaxis. For Elon Musk, Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system remains central to his long-term plans for the electric vehicle maker. At present, FSD is available in Tesla vehicles across the United States, Canada, China, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Australia, and New Zealand.Tesla currently offers a supervised version of FSD, which means a driver must remain in the driver’s seat and stay alert while the system is in use. However, Musk recently said that “FSD Unsupervised is pretty much solved at this point.” He has also said that China is expected to approve Tesla’s unsupervised FSD system early next year.Waymo, a self-driving technology company owned by Alphabet, has been operating fully driverless taxis since 2020. Its first public service was launched in Phoenix, Arizona. Since then, Waymo has expanded its services to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta. The company is also planning to begin operations in London next year.","Jeff Dean, Chief Scientist, Google DeepMind and Google Research recently said that rival Tesla has nowhere “near the volume of rider-only autonomous miles that (Google-owned) Waymo has” The post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who responded sharply to Dean’s post writing “Waymo never really had a chance against Tesla”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125891679,imgsize-76140,width-400,resizemode-4/tesla.jpg"

Jim Balsillie: Canada should have its own data treating strategy





Former BlackBerry CEO Jim Balsillie has a critical warning for Canada. In an ""urgent message"" to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's government, the technology investor called for immediate action to build economic resilience and assert sovereignty over Canadian data following the release of the new US National Security Strategy. Balsillie, who presently chairs the Council of Canadian Innovators, said Canadian policymakers should be ""shocked into action""by the US policy, which he says proves they are ""mired in the status quo"" on productivity and the digital economy.In an interview with Bloomberg, Balsillie said: ""Trump just cranked this up a whole other level last week, and this is an urgent, urgent, urgent time that requires reorientation and capacity. I don't know how much louder the alarm bells have to ring."" He added that the “Trump doctrine” is the most consequential policy shift for Canada in more than a decade.A White House document signed by US President Donald Trump last week makes clear that the US will ""reassert and enforce the Monroe Doctrine to restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere,"" a 19th-century policy rejecting European and other foreign interference in the Americas.The new policy also declares the US""will prioritise commercial diplomacy, to strengthen our own economy and industries, using tariffs and reciprocal trade agreements as powerful tools.""Balsillie said that Canada needs to treat its data as an essential national resource. He also thinks Canada should stop giving taxpayer money to foreign companies if a Canadian company is already capable of doing the work.He cited the recent C$40 million ($28.9 million) gift to Nokia, the Finnish telecom company, by Carney's government to open a research centre in Ottawa as an example.""The first rule of holes is stop digging. This document by the US is a real claim of dominance of the hemisphere. You either accept subordination, or you need to create more resilience so you can be OK when the leverage is exerted,” he noted.Some business leaders believe that Canada needs a ""sovereign cloud""-meaning the country controls its own digital systems and storage instead of keeping that data on computers run by other countries. That would be important to securing the personal information, health records, and financial data of Canadians.Back in September, Carney instructed the government's central projects office to build that ""Canadian sovereign cloud"" with its own computing power and data centres.But to make this happen, Canada needs a significant shift in thinking that recognises the importance of Canadian companies, says Patrick Searle, who recently took over as CEO of the Council of Canadian Innovators.“It is unmistakable that when it comes to data, cloud, IP, cyber, quantum and AI that the US sees technology companies —and companies in general — as national security assets,” Searle said, who has worked with this advocacy group since 2022.As Canada ramps up its defence spending, Searle says the government should purchase from Canadian firms that make products for both military and everyday use.Searle will replace Ben Bergen and start his mandate as CEO of the Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association in January 2026. John Ruffolo from CCI, who heads Maverix Private Equity, also led a successful charge this year for new laws around stablecoins as part of a broader effort to move Canadian tech off US rails.","Former BlackBerry CEO Jim Balsillie has a critical warning for Canada.

Staged path to homeownership





Canadian billionaire and Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary has a word of caution for homebuyers. In a post shared in social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) O’Leary has warned the homebuyers against what he calls the ‘biggest money trap’ people fall into without realising it: buying a house that’s too big and stretching their mortgage payments beyond safe limits. In post on X O’Leary wrote, “The biggest money trap people fall into without noticing? Buying a house that's too big. Your mortgage should be no more than a third of your income. People stretch to 50–60% and then wonder why they're suffocating. Get a smaller house. Upgrade later.”The Canadian billionaire emphasised that the mortgage payments should not exceed 30% of after-tax income, warning that exceeding this threshold leaves buyers ‘house poor’, cash trapped making them unable to save and giving constant financial stress.O’Leary has asked the buyers to abandon the idea of ‘forever home’ and instead got for a better and staged approach. He mentions that one should start with a smaller, affordable home (often 1,500–2,500 sq. ft. for families). The buyer should then focus on paying down the mortgage. Finally, as income rises and equity builds, trade up to a larger property from a position of financial strength.His advice comes amid a housing market where nearly half of U.S. renter households already spend more than 30% of their income on housing, according to Census data cited by Reuters. With mortgage rates remaining elevated, O’Leary has repeatedly warned that the era of ultra-cheap loans is over. In August, he told followers that anyone waiting for rates to fall below 5% was “dreaming,” citing America’s strong economy and AI-driven productivity.","Canadian billionaire Kevin O'Leary has a word of caution for homebuyers.

What Tesla CEO Elon Musk said when asked: If he believes in God









Tesla CEO Elon Musk has finally opened up about his brief and controversial leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a Trump administration initiative which was created to bring down federal spending. As reported by Reuters, speaking at a recent podcast interview, Elon Musk described the project as ‘a little bit’ and ‘somewhat successful’ but also mentioned that he would not take on the role again.Musk acknowledged that while DOGE did achieve some cost-cutting goals, but the fallout for his companies was severe. “I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars,” Musk said. During Musk’s time at DOIGE, Tesla vehicles, dealerships and factories were reportedly targeted by activists who were angry over Musk’s alignment with Trump’s aggressive federal downsizing agenda. The backlash underscored the risks of Musk’s involvement in politics while running high-profile businesses.For the uninitiated, Elon Musk launched DOGE earlier this year with an aim to identify up to $2 trillion in federal savings.The initiative took a chainsaw approach to budgets, agencies, and jobs, but fell short of its ambitious targets by the time Musk stepped down in May. Musk said the project did stop “a lot of funding that really just made no sense,” but conceded that the controversy outweighed the benefits.Meanwhile, Elon Musk was recently asked if he believes in God. In an interview with Katie Miller on her podcast this week, the Tesla CEO said he believes “this universe came from something. People have different labels.”“Who do you look up to the most?,” asked Miller. To this, Musk replied saying “The Creator”. “What's your position on God?,” Miller further stressed. The tech billionaire responded “God is the Creator.”Miller’s next question was “You don't believe in God though, do you?”.

What WBD said board said



The Road Ahead





Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison has now revealed the reason that why he bypassed the Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) board and took his $30-per-share hostile bid directly to shareholders. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the UBS media conference, Ellison said that the board could not account his offer outright without raising questions about its fiduciary responsibilities. For those unaware, Fiduciary responsibility means a legal and ethical obligation for one party (the fiduciary) to act in the best interests of another. Ellison was seen explaining, “If they accept the offer exactly as it is today, right, then they're admitting breach of fiduciary duty, so I don't think they can just take that.”The comments made by Ellison highlight the legal and governance complexities facing WBD’s board, which had already signaled its preference for Netflix’s $27.75-per-share bid for WBD’s studio and streaming assets. Paramount’s counteroffer, launched Monday, covers the entire company, including TV networks such as CNN and TNT.Ellison also stressed on the fact that Paramount’s hostile bid was said to the private offer delivered to WBD last week. “We wanted to communicate to everyone: We didn’t change the offer. This is exactly what we sent them,” he said.

Discovery board and took his $30-per-share hostile bid directly to shareholders. Ellison said that the board could not account his offer outright without raising questions about its fiduciary responsibilities.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125890175,imgsize-26600,width-400,resizemode-4/ceo-of-paramount-skydance-david-ellison.jpg"

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

The US ban and China’s push to domestic chipmaking







President Donald Trump recently announced his approval for Nvidia to export its advanced H200 artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China. However, despite the green light by the US, regulators in China are reportedly planning to limit access to the chips as Beijing pushes for self-sufficiency in AI semiconductor production. According to a report, China is discussing ways to limit access to the successor of Nvidia’s H100 AI chips.According to a report by The Financial Times, regulators in Beijing are currently discussing methods to permit only limited access to the H200, which is touted as Nvidia’s second-best generation of AI chips. Citing sources familiar with the discussions, the report says that prospective buyers will likely need to go through an approval process. Under this process, the companies must submit requests to purchase the chips and explain why domestic providers could not meet their needs. No final decision has been made yet, the report added.The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the two key regulators overseeing China’s semiconductor independence campaign, may reportedly implement measures such as banning China’s public sector from buying the H200 to ensure the competitiveness of domestic chips.Recently, Trump stated in a Truth Social that he informed Chinese President Xi Jinping the US would allow the sale of H200 products to “approved customers in China” under conditions that maintain national security. Trump also claimed 25% of revenues will be paid to the US.The Trump administration’s decision essentially reverses a ban enacted under the Biden administration, which prohibited shipments to China of the H200 and other advanced chips over national security concerns. The US says that these advanced chips may potentially be used in military applications.The previous ban prompted China to accelerate domestic chip production, stepping up customs checks on chip imports and offering energy subsidies to data centres utilising domestic chips.Notably, the return of Nvidia’s advanced chips is said to be welcomed by major Chinese tech giants like Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencent because many of them have been training their AI models abroad to bypass the domestic ban.","China is reportedly planning to limit access to Nvidia’s H200 artificial intelligence (AI) chips.

Silicon Valley has been known for disrupting industries, revolutionising corporate operations, and promising a future in which technology would create a lot for all. But in recent years, that disruption turned inward, as the very companies that built the digital age began dismantling the workforce that made it possible.At the time of writing, the independent tracking site Layoffs.fyi reported a stark total of 122,549 employees laid off from 257 tech companies in 2025. It was more than another round of corporate belt-tightening or a response to economic headwinds; it was one of the most significant restructuring periods in industry history. Being able to understand whether this reflects a sustained industry shift or a temporary correction is essential for industry professionals and business leaders planning for the future.These job cuts were mostly driven by rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), automation initiatives and a realisation by companies that the pandemic hiring boom had left them bloated and inefficient. What had started as isolated cost-cutting measures in January snowballed into an industry-wide reset that affected hundreds of people.From Amazon 's biggest-ever layoff to Intel's reduction of workforce by 24,000, the tech giants that once competed in a race to hire the best available talent were now in a race to see who could slim down the fastest.The effects have rippled far beyond Silicon Valley; they have touched IT consulting firms and semiconductor manufacturing worldwide. This broad effect raises questions about the stability and resilience of the entire tech supply chain and the regional economies that depend on these companies.The pace was overwhelming-over 22,000 lost their jobs during the first months of 2025, including an astonishing 16,084 in February alone. April was no better: more than 24,500 employees received termination letters that month as firms pressed the pedal to accelerate the cuts, according to layoffs.fyi data.In November, just when workers might have hoped the bleeding would finally stop, major corporations like Verizon and HP announced fresh rounds of cuts, signalling, in effect, that this wasn't a temporary adjustment but a permanent change in how technology companies operate.Executives also explained these decisions with enough clarity. From Amazon CEO Andy Jassy to Salesforce's Marc Benioff, industry leaders spoke quite frankly about how AI had automated tasks previously performed by human workers.The companies that were fashioning the tools of AI were now using those same tools to cut back on their own workforces—a paradox that crystallises this moment in tech history. This raises important questions about whether such layoffs will hinder or accelerate innovation and how competitive dynamics will evolve as companies balance cost-cutting with technological advancement.Amazon announced in October that it was reducing 14,000 corporate jobs, about 4% of its total corporate workforce of 350,000 employees, making it the largest layoff in the company's history. The notifications began at the close of October 2025, with the job cuts touching all segments of the company, including AWS, operations, human resources and more.As reasons for such cuts, CEO Andy Jassy cited the transition to AI-driven processes, overexpansion in the previous years, and the urgent need to streamline management layers.The decision reflects Amazon's push to run the company ""like the world's largest startup"", according to Beth Galetti, SVP of People Experience & Technology. That philosophy meant flattening organisational structures, eliminating redundant roles, and empowering smaller teams to move faster-all while relying more heavily on automation to handle tasks once reserved for human judgment.While the reduction accounts for less than 2 per cent of Amazon's global total, it extends a multiyear belt-tightening since the pandemic. The company has shed around 27,000 employees from its rolls already since the beginning of 2022. The cuts come at a time when rapid advances in AI are fundamentally changing how Amazon operates. The company is gambling on automation to stay competitive, achieving better operational efficiency and higher profit margins.The layoffs hit departments that had grown substantially during the pandemic boom, when Amazon rapidly expanded to meet surging e-commerce demand. Now that growth has normalised and AI capabilities keep increasing, the company is recalibrating toward a leaner operational model, one that is more technology-centred rather than human capital-centred.Intel confirmed it will cut its global workforce by 24,000 employees during 2025, taking its core headcount from nearly 100,000 to nearly 75,000 by year-end. The massive restructuring-roughly 22% of its workforce-is one of a series of significant efficiency drives by new CEO Lip-Bu Tan as competition continues to rise in the semiconductor industry. The chipmaker is implementing cuts through direct layoffs and natural attrition; significant cuts are expected throughout the United States, Germany, Poland, and Costa Rica.Government filings reported that Intel is laying off more than 5,000 employees across four US states, with most cuts concentrated in California and Oregon. At the same time, additional reductions affect facilities in Texas and Arizona. It was reported last July that Intel planned to lay off nearly 2,400 employees in Oregon, almost five times the number it initially announced.The company also informed employees in June that 15% to 20% of its Foundry division workforce would be cut and separately confirmed plans to wind down its auto business fully. The actions come just ahead of Intel's Q1 earnings call and are among the most significant strategic moves under CEO Tan, who took the reins from longtime chief Pat Gelsinger in 2024.Intel's struggles offer a glimpse into the broader challenges in the semiconductor industry. The US chipmaking giant lost a big slice of processor market share to competitors such as AMD. Meanwhile, the company has also fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in the production of advanced chips.This restructuring focuses on realigning resources toward core competencies and divesting from businesses where Intel no longer has a comparative advantage.Accenture reports that it has laid off thousands of employees worldwide through mid-October 2025, part of a significant restructuring as it prioritises artificial intelligence capabilities and shifts with changing client demand.Speaking in an interview, CEO Julie Sweet said many roles could not be reskilled for new AI-driven needs, forcing the consulting giant to make tough workforce decisions. Its total headcount was reduced from around 791,000 to 779,000. However, more cuts are expected in the coming months as IT expansion reaches every corner of the business.The cut is among the most extensive layoffs in the professional services sector and underscores how even companies that help other businesses implement AI are being transformed by the technology. Accenture has been fast-tracking AI consulting services, generative AI implementations, and automation solutions for clients, making specific traditional consulting roles obsolete.The irony, of course, is striking: Accenture advises clients on digital transformation while it is in the midst of its excruciating transformation. Traditional IT consulting, app maintenance, and business process outsourcing-all services that built the Accenture empire-are being disrupted by the very AI tools the company now sells.The company confirmed it is hiring for AI-focused positions. Meanwhile, it will eliminate roles in its legacy service areas. This reflects the broader challenge facing the global workforce as AI is reshaping job requirements and skill demands across industries.However, for employees, this means technical skills are becoming more perishable than ever before, and continuous learning is now critical to career longevity.Microsoft carried out multiple rounds of layoffs throughout 2025, shedding around 9,000 workers, less than 4% of its global workforce, estimated at around 220,000. The July announcement followed previous cuts below 1% in January, more than 6,000 in May, and at least 300 in June. The company reasoned that there was an urgent need to control costs while funnelling increased investment into artificial intelligence and cloud computing infrastructure, in addition to an earlier round of 10,000 cuts in 2023.The cuts have hit software engineers, product managers, technical program managers, marketers, and legal counsels across different teams, roles, and geographies since the beginning of 2025. In January, Microsoft laid off an undisclosed number of employees based on their performance reviews; the affected employees were informed that they would not receive severance packages and that other benefits, such as medical insurance, would be discontinued immediately.The company was also considering further layoffs, reportedly discussing internally the need to thin the ranks of middle managers and non-coders to achieve a better programmer-to-product-manager ratio, Business Insider reported. The multiple rounds of reductions reflect Microsoft's aggressive pivot toward AI-powered products and services while streamlining operations across gaming divisions, sales teams, and administrative functions.Microsoft's moves reflected a deliberate strategy: flatten management layers, expand the engineer-to-manager ratio, and redeploy resources to AI work. The company has wagered its future on products such as Copilot, its AI assistant integrated across Office applications, and AI services on Azure for enterprise customers. These investments require huge capital and engineering talent, thus forcing cuts elsewhere to finance this transformation.Salesforce axed nearly 4,000 positions in its customer support group, shrinking the staff from roughly 9,000 to 5,000 workers, among the most dramatic examples of AI-driven workforce reduction in 2025 so far. CEO Marc Benioff blamed artificial intelligence for taking over routine customer interactions, saying frankly during a podcast appearance in September: ""I was able to rebalance my headcount on my support. I reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000 because I need fewer heads.""The candour was unusual for an industry where bosses commonly frame layoff announcements with euphemisms such as ""organisational restructuring"" or ""strategic realignment."" But Benioff's direct language, describing employees as ""heads"" and unabashedly celebrating the cost savings from AI, was provocative and put into sharp focus what is at stake for knowledge workers in an economy augmented by AI.He also noted that Salesforce's AI alone handles roughly 50 per cent of customer conversations today and enables the company to reduce operations without impacting the customer experience. For instance, Salesforce rolled out Agentforce earlier this year, resulting in a reduction in support cases. As a result, the company didn't need to backfill support engineer positions. ""Hundreds have been redeployed into professional services, sales, and customer success,"" said a Salesforce spokesperson.The move was a key about-face from Benioff's comments over the summer when he said in July that AI would enhance, not replace, workers and that ""the humans are not going away."" Salesforce also shed over 1,000 jobs from its staff of almost 73,000 in February and another 262 positions from its San Francisco headquarters in September.The Salesforce case became a lightning rod for debates about the impact of AI on employment, with critics noting Benioff's comments lent weight to workers' worst fears: AI isn't just augmenting human capabilities; it's replacing them wholesale in many roles.Networking equipment giant Cisco announced it will cut about 4,250 jobs, or 5% of its workforce, as the company doubles down on high-growth areas such as AI, cybersecurity, and cloud networking. The cuts come as Cisco, which had nearly 85,000 workers as of the end of fiscal 2023, embarks on a significant restructuring of its operations amid shifting market demands and increased competition from cloud-native networking solutions.Government filings showed 221 positions being axed across the company's Milpitas and San Francisco offices, including 157 in Santa Clara County and 64 in San Francisco, with termination effective in October. The cuts are part of Cisco's broader workforce-reduction strategy to shift resources from declining legacy hardware sales to emerging technologies.In the past, sources had hinted that layoffs would hit the company as it transitioned from a hardware-based networking equipment supplier to a software- and subscription-based services company, in line with current trends in enterprise technology, which are shifting toward cloud-based architectures and software-defined networking solutions.The troubles at Cisco represent what most large technology hardware organisations are currently facing. Moving from merely selling boxes of networking equipment to software-defined networking and security requires different skill profiles and business models. Traditional hardware sales engineers and product specialists find their expertise less relevant as customers increasingly use cloud-based infrastructure managed through software rather than physical devices.Google announced several rounds of layoffs throughout 2025, including more than 100 design roles within its cloud division in October and heavy cuts across US-based teams as the company focuses more heavily on AI investments. Many of these workers were being asked to apply for other jobs at Google by early December, after additional cuts were announced across its Silicon Valley campuses, including at least 50 full-time jobs in Sunnyvale, according to CNBC reports.In addition, the search giant cut its smart TV division by 25% of its 300-member team in June as it readjusted its approach, slashing funding by 10% for the Smart TV division while increasing investment in AI projects. In April, Google laid off hundreds of employees in its platforms and devices division, which includes Android, Pixel phones, and the Chrome browser, among others.In February, the company said it would cut employees from its People Operations and cloud organisation teams as part of a new reorganisation effort, offering a voluntary exit program to US-based People Operations employees. The pattern of cuts reflects Google's broader strategy to reallocate resources away from mature products toward generative AI development and deployment.Google's move reflects how even the most successful tech companies are rethinking their priorities. Projects that would have been allowed to continue indefinitely during the period of rapid growth are now being subjected to ruthless scrutiny. Products that aren't growing fast enough or aren't contributing enough to the bottom line get funding cut or axed, and that funding is diverted to AI initiatives deemed crucial to the company's future competitiveness.Meta, formerly Facebook, laid off close to 600 employees in October, mainly from its AI research and development groups, as part of an ongoing effort to simplify project teams and focus on generative AI investments and development in Reality Labs. The cuts hit workers across Meta's AI infrastructure arms, including the Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) group. However, top-tier AI hires in TBD Labs, overseen by new chief AI officer Alexandr Wang, were not affected.""With a smaller team, fewer conversations are required to arrive at a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,"" Wang wrote in an internal memo. The philosophy captured a broader trend in the technology industry: smaller, empowered teams moving faster, rather than big organisations slowed by bureaucracy and consensus-building.The latest round followed Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's January announcement that the company would trim 5% of its workforce, targeting ""low performers"" as it prepares for what he described as ""an intense year."" Those cuts, which began in February, hit several thousand workers spanning multiple divisions. Among the most brutal hits were teams responsible for Facebook, the Horizon virtual reality platform, and logistics. In April, more than 100 employees were let go from the firm's Reality Labs division.The company, Meta, has laid off more than 21,000 workers since 2022; it is one of the most aggressive cost-cutters in the tech industry. Zuckerberg declared 2023 the ""year of efficiency,"" a mandate that stretched well into 2025 as the company continued to optimise operations and cut positions it no longer considered core priorities.Oracle axed hundreds of positions at various outposts well into 2025, in a bid to restrain expenses amid intense investment in AI infrastructure and cloud computing growth. In September, the database maker laid off an additional 101 employees in Seattle and 254 workers in San Francisco, just weeks after its August wave of layoffs that swept through its cloud business and other business groups. The company, which had some 3,900 local employees before the California layoffs, has refused to comment on the cuts or describe a strategic rationale for the moves.Oracle will lay off an additional 101 workers at its Santa Clara facility, according to notices filed on August 13 that took effect in October. The database giant earlier reported nearly 200 layoffs at its Pleasanton and Redwood City facilities and planned to cut 161 employees in Seattle, according to filings with the Washington State Employment Security Department.People with knowledge of the cuts said some reductions were performance-related. Still, the majority appear to be driven by restructuring as Oracle shifts toward cloud services and away from licensing its traditional database.The company has declined to comment on the total number of jobs lost and its future workforce plans. Still, this string of cuts indicates continued efforts to optimise operations within its cloud infrastructure division.Oracle's silence about the layoffs contrasts with other tech companies that at least attempted to explain their strategic rationale. Without a reason being communicated, the affected employees and onlookers had to speculate whether it was the beginning and whether additional cuts might be on the way.Apple also made changes in November, despite its reputation for stability regardless of market conditions. Bloomberg reports that the company is laying off several sales positions that service business accounts, schools, and government agencies. Apple wants to restructure the way it sells bulk quantities of devices and services to institutions.The company believes this area can be handled by a much smaller, more focused team. While the cuts are not massive compared to other companies, they at least indicate that even Apple is tightening its structure.For a company that has historically avoided mass layoffs and remained stable during industry slumps, any workforce reduction signals that changing circumstances are at play. Apple's institutional salesforce had expanded significantly as the company sought to increase its share of enterprise, education, and government customers.But Apple decided these sales channels would be better run with fewer people. Instead of depending on a large sales team, the company will rely more on digital sales tools and partner networks.However, Apple's relatively minor cuts compared to rivals like Amazon and Microsoft reflect the company's stronger financial position. The iPhone maker also adopted a more cautious approach to managing its workforce, avoiding the pandemic-era hiring spree that many tech companies later regretted, leaving it with less need for dramatic cuts.The 2025 tech layoffs, affecting hundreds of workers, represent a sea change as AI automates judgment- and expertise-based jobs. Companies are cutting workforces with the very technology their employees built. Workers who have been displaced must make tough choices about retraining, while the industry wrangles with how to balance efficiency against responsibilities to workers and society.","Over 22,000 lost their jobs during the first months of 2025, including an astonishing 16,084 in February alone.

What is new social media screening rules for H-1B visa





US Embassy India has shared an important advisory for visa applicants in the country. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the embassy warned applicants that arriving on the previously scheduled appointment date will lead to refusal of entry at the Consulate or Embassy. The post comes amidst postponement of H-1B visa interviews in India after the rollout of new social media vetting rules.According to a Bloomberg report, the US State Department is postponing H-1B visa interviews in India slated for later this month, citing constraints from new social media scrutiny for the visa category. As per the report, interviews scheduled between mid to late December are being pushed back as late as next summer, which means that foreign workers renewing visa stamps could face delay in returning to the US for months while they wait for new appointments.Notably, the US had already started reviewing the social media profiles of F-1 student visa applicants. Like student visa seekers, H-1B visa applicants and their dependents (seeking H-4 visa) are required to make their social media profiles public from December 15 onwards.In its official post on X, the US Embassy India writes:Earlier this month, the department announced that it will begin social media screening of H-1B applicants and family members on dependent visas.Social media reviews is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to investigate violations connected to employment of foreign workers on the visas. In September this year, the US introduced a $1,00,000 annual fee on H-1B visa applications.“As of December 15, the Department will expand the requirement that an online presence review be conducted for all H-1B applicants and their dependents, in addition to the students and exchange visitors already subject to this review. To facilitate this vetting, all applicants for H-1B and their dependents (H-4), F, M, and J nonimmigrant visas are instructed to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to “public"", the State Department then said in its announcement.""Every visa adjudication is a national security decision. The United States must be vigilant during the visa issuance process to ensure that those applying for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans and our national interests, and that all applicants credibly establish their eligibility for the visa sought, including that they intend to engage in activities consistent with the terms for their admission,” it added.In the annoucement, the agency further stated that ""The State Department uses all available information in visa screening and vetting to identify visa applicants who are inadmissible to the United States, including those who pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety.""","US Embassy India has shared an important advisory for visa applicants in the country.

TIME Magazine has named CEO of Google-owned YouTube as 2025 CEO of the year. Mohan took charge as YouTube CEO in 2023 after his mentor Susan Wojcicki stepped down. Since then, the social platform has increased its dominance of the attention economy against considerable competition, TIME writes.“He’s quiet-spoken, deliberative, hard to ruffle. He likes watching sports, going to his daughters’ dance recitals, and open white shirts, just normal stuff. His favorite candy is the not-very-exciting Butterfinger. If you ask him to be in your YouTube video, he’ll probably do it. He won’t be great in it, but neither will he be horrible,” reads Mohan’s TIME profile.“YouTube today is like a metropolis with lots of interconnected dependencies, and what you do on one street impacts what happens on another street,” says Mohan. “In the early days, it was much more like a village, where lots of the creators knew each other. And I think that if you’re the leader of one vs. the other, you’re forced to think about decisions in maybe a different way.”Mohan is a graduate in electric engineering from Stanford University. He joined Google in 2008. Born in Indiana, US, the executive spent much of his childhood there before relocating to Lucknow with his family in 1985, aged 12.He became YouTube's Chief Product Officer in 2015. He had played pivotal roles in the launch of some of biggest products, including YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium and Shorts.Mohan has also worked with Microsoft and sits on the board of Stitch Fix and genomics and biotechnology company 23andMe. He previously spent nearly six years at DoubleClick, a company Google acquired in 2007, and later served for about eight years as senior vice president of display and video advertising at Google.","Neal Mohan took charge as YouTube CEO in 2023 after his mentor Susan Wojcicki stepped down.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said he cannot imagine raising his newborn son without the help of ChatGPT.Altman made his first appearance on NBC’s “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” where he spoke about how often he turns to the AI chatbot whenever he needs parental advice: “I cannot imagine having gone through, figuring out how to raise a newborn without ChatGPT,” he told Fallon. “Clearly, people did it for a long time, no problem.”He joked that he sometimes feels “kind of bad” putting simple parenting questions to a system designed to handle complex knowledge tasks, such as “Why does my kid stop dropping pizza on the floor and laughing?” But he added that the reassurance it provides has been invaluable.Altman recalled a moment at a party when another parent said their six-month-old was “crawling everywhere.”He was concerned that his own son was not yet doing the same. He excused himself and typed into ChatGPT: “Do I need to take my kid to the doctor tomorrow morning? Is this okay?” Altman said the chatbot replied “with a great answer” explaining his child’s progress was “normal.”“It is personalised, like ChatGPT gets to know you, and by the way, you are the CEO of OpenAI, you probably are around all these high-achieving people, maybe you do not want to project that onto your kid, and you should just relax,” he said, describing the coded response.Last week, Altman reportedly issued a “code red” internally, urging staff to refocus on ChatGPT as rivals such as Google accelerate their own AI efforts.Altman has previously said parenthood has shifted his perspective on technology. In January, he told a podcast: “My kid is never going to grow up being smarter than AI. Children in the future will only know a world with AI in it,"" according to Business Insider.Altman and his husband, Oliver Mulherin, welcomed their son in February. The couple has kept their family life largely private.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said he cannot imagine raising his newborn son without the help of ChatGPT.

One of America's largest car company Ford joins hands with Renault to solve its 'China problem' as CEO Jim Farley says: In a fight for our lives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/one-of-americas-largest-car-company-ford-joins-hands-with-renault-to-solve-its-china-problem-as-ceo-jim-farley-says-in-a-fight-for-our-lives/articleshow/125876456.cms,"Partnering to reboot Europe business

Why not get US model to Europe





America's second-largest car company Ford has a 'China Problem' in Europe. And the problem is reportedly so big that CEO Jim Farley recently told journalists in Paris, ""We know we’re in a fight for our lives in our industry, and no better example than here in Europe.” Ford CEO Farley made the comments as the company seeks to reboot its European business faced with upheaval being caused by Chinese automakers outside the US. Competition has been quite fierce in Europe among auto companies as Chinese companies led by SAIC Motor and BYD have burst onto the scene with low-cost technology. The market share of Chinese producers jumped collectively to around 6.7% of the European market in the third quarter, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.According to a report in Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Ford is now turning to French peer Renault to help reboot its European business. Renault will reportedly make two small electric vehicles for the pioneer of car production, the companies said. The partners are also said to be exploring how they might work together on vans, which form the core of Ford’s European business. The first of the next-generation EVs -- to be designed by Ford, co-developed by both companies on a Renault technology platform -- will reach European dealerships in 2028.The EVs will be built by Renault in northern France.Partnering with Renault marks a fresh start for Ford in Europe after years of downsizing and restructuring. In 2024, Ford said it would cut 4,000 roles, centered in Germany. In September, it announced a further 1,000 job losses. “We’ve been through many restructurings, and a lot of hard work. GM left. We decided to stay,” said Farley in summation of the company’s recent history in Europe. General Motors sold its European business in 2017.“As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry,” said Farley in a statement. “How we compete here — how we innovate, partner, and invest — will write the playbook for the next generation. We are committed to a vibrant future in Europe, but that future requires us to move with greater speed and efficiency than ever before.”As to why Renault, Ford CEO admitted that the company has been working on its own EV platform in the U.S. as part of its so-called skunk works project. But that platform would be too big and expensive to work in Europe, “Frankly, Renault is more competitive,” he said.Incidentally, Ford has a mixed record of forming partnerships in Europe. Its existing loss-making Explorer and Capri EVs are built in Ford’s factory in Cologne, Germany, using Volkswagen’s EV technology. As for Ford and Renault buying stakes in each other? Ford CEO Farley is quoted by WSJ, ""Ford is a wildly independent company.”","Ford is reportedly turning to French peer Renault to help reboot its European business.

AI rollout from next year: Wells Fargo CEO





Wells Fargo staff reduction in recent years









Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf has said that the US banking giant expects to reduce its workforce next year and expects higher severance expenses in the current fourth quarter. He added that artificial intelligence (AI) is set to redefine wok. Speaking on the sidelines of a Goldman Sachs financial services conference, Scharf stated that even before accounting for new technology, the bank expects to have fewer employees in the upcoming year.“We have gone through the budgeting process, and even pre-artificial intelligence, we do expect to have less people as we go into next year. We'll likely have more severance in the fourth quarter,” Scharf said on the sidelines of a Goldman Sachs financial services conference, as per news agency ReutersScharf noted that Wells Fargo plans to roll out AI gradually over the next year and beyond as part of its efficiency drive. He also emphasised that AI won’t entirely replace humans but it is expected to lead to some workforce reductions. Scharf described the shift as a “positive reality” for the bank.The CEO noted that the bank is not yet as efficient as it will be once AI is fully integrated. While providing an example of current AI impact, Schraf said that Gen AI tools have already made the bank’s engineering workforce 30% to 35% more efficient in terms of writing code.The bank has already witnessed a reduction in staff – from 275,000 employees when Scharf joined in 2019 to just over 210,000 employees as of September 30, 2025, according to Reuters.While discussing the bank's future growth, Scharf stated that Wells Fargo is under no pressure to pursue acquisitions. He said the bank will only pursue acquisitions that offer strong financial returns and clear strategic value for investors, stating, “We have no interest in doing something which could just add a little bit of earnings to the company”.","Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said the bank expects to reduce its workforce next year and expects higher severance expenses in the current fourth quarter.

YouTube gives four reasons with social media ban in Australia is ‘less safe’ for kids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/youtube-gives-four-reasons-with-social-media-ban-in-australia-is-less-safe-for-kids/articleshow/125873263.cms,"4 reasons age bans are detrimental, according to YouTube



Poorly designed regulations make kids less safe:

Regulation fails to reflect platform differences:

Creative expression is worth preserving:

Evidence-based regulation is better:





As social media ban for under-16 in Australia is set to take effect on December 10, Google’s YouTube has voiced strong opposition to legislation, asserting that such blanket bans are likely to be “counterproductive” and ultimately make children less safe online. The platform’s stance comes as governments worldwide consider regulations to balance online safety with young people’s access to educational and creative material.“Last week we shared an update on what YouTube will look like for users and creators in Australia as a result of the new law. As other governments around the world consider how to tackle the very real challenge of helping young people stay safe online while also helping them access positive material, it's clear that blanket account bans will have extremely negative consequences,” YouTube said.YouTube outlined four specific reasons why this regulatory approach is flawed:YouTube argues that blanket bans remove choices from parents and force children out of curated, supervised spaces like YouTube Kids or supervised tween and teen accounts. According to the company, kids may resort to using adult accounts or browsing anonymously, often accessing less safe services.YouTube argues that applying blanket bans misunderstands the platform’s function, which is primarily a streaming service for learning, entertainment, news and sports highlights. YouTube noted that 94% of teachers globally use YouTube for educational content. Making it harder to promote educational content is counterproductive.The platform emphasised that YouTube offers young people digital skills, connection and opportunities for creative and political expression. The platform noted that some of the world’s biggest artists, including Justin Bieber and Dua Lipa, began their careers on YouTube as teenagers.YouTube also noted that a comprehensive approach that requires industry-wide standards for parental controls, limits access to specific risky features, mandates privacy-preserving age-estimation tools and bans personalised advertising to minors.",Social media ban for under-16 in Australia is set to take effect on December 10.

Spotify has announced that it is making music videos available to premium subscribers in the US and Canada. The expansion positions the Swedish streaming giant to directly challenge YouTube in the music video space. According to the company, video content offers a more immersive and engaging experience than audio alone, a factor that could help attract more users and advertisers. However, there will be a limited catalogue of music videos.Music videos will be available to all premium subscribers in the US and Canada by the end of the month. The launch follows a beta test conducted in nearly 100 markets last year and is intended to enhance Spotify's competitive position against music streaming offerings from rivals like Apple and Amazon.Spotify's initial video catalog will feature content from artists including Ariana Grande, Olivia Dean, BABYMONSTER, and Addison Rae. The company stated that fan engagement is boosted by the feature: “We've seen that when fans discover a track with a music video on Spotify, they're 34% more likely to stream it again and 24% more likely to save or share it in the following week.”Recently, CFO Christian Luiga highlighted the importance of this metric, noting that “Engagement is a very important part for sort of our measurement...sometimes, it could be an even more important than the number of users”.Meanwhile, the company recently launched Wrapped – its year-end roundup, which gained over 200 million engaged users within roughly 24 hours, marking a 19% increase from the previous year.The video expansion comes as Spotify looks to drive earnings growth through pricing adjustments. The company has already raised the cost of its premium individual plan in more than 150 markets during the September quarter.

10 most valuable American tech companies

Founder Peter Thiel’s Elon Musk link

Palantir’s valuation has a premium

Palantir, a data analytics software company, climbed into the top 10 US technology firms by market capitalization after an 8% stock surge on Thursday (May 8), reaching a valuation of $281 billion. This leap pushed it past Salesforce, valued at $268 billion, which previously held the tenth spot. Earlier this year, Palantir also overtook tech stalwarts Cisco and IBM. Palantir’s stock has soared, more than quintupling in value over the past year and gaining 58% in 2025, making it the S&P 500’s top performer for the second consecutive year. While the Nasdaq has declined 7% this year amid tariff concerns and economic slowdown fears, Palantir has defied the trend.Founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel and CEO Alex Karp, Palantir’s growth has been fueled by its government business, which surged 45% to $373 million last quarter, including a $178 million U.S. Army contract for AI-enabled systems. In a shareholder letter, Karp defended the company’s defense work, noting its unwavering commitment to supporting the U.S. military.Microsoft tops the market cap list at $3.3 trillion, followed by Apple and Nvidia. Here are all the 10 names ranked with No. 1 on top and No. 10 at the bottom:* Microsoft* Apple* Nvidia* Amazon* Alphabet* Meta Platforms* Broadcom* Tesla* Oracle* Palantir* SalesforcePeter Thiel is part of the so-called PayPal Mafia — a group of Silicon Valley stars with links to the payments app's formative period. Thiel reportedly shares a love-hate relationship with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. He is also an investor in several of Elon Musk’s companies, including SpaceX, Neuralink and Boring Co.Analysts say that Palantir’s valuation comes at a premium. Despite its market cap ranking, its revenue and profits lag far behind peers like Salesforce, which generates over ten times Palantir’s revenue. Palantir trades at 520 times trailing earnings, 200 times forward earnings, and 90 times revenue, far exceeding typical large-cap tech multiples.","Palantir, a data analytics software company, climbed into the top 10 US technology firms by market capitalization after an 8% stock surge.

$900 million: Tariff cost for Apple in first three months of 2025

President Donald Trump told reporters that he talked to Apple CEO Tim Cook after the US-China trade agreement at Geneva. US and China have agreed to suspend most tariffs for 90 days. “I spoke to Tim Cook this morning, and he’s going to, I think, even up his numbers,” Trump said in the Oval Office of Whote House. ""$500 billion, he’s going to be building a lot of plants in the United States for Apple. And we look forward to that."" Incidentally, Apple CEO Cook had successfully lobbied Trump during his first administration to exempt some of the company’s products from tariffs.Wall Street and Apple investors cheered the pause on Chinese tariffs. Apple stock was up 6% in trading on Monday, versus 3% for the Nasdaq. The dramatic coolinUS and China, spurred a broader rally across US markets.Earlier in the day a Wall Street Journal report claimed that Apple is considering to raise prices for its iPhone lineup likely to launch in September. The USJ report cited people familiar with the matter whom it didn’t identify. The company is exploring whether to “couple” price increases with new features and designs, while trying to avoid the perception that any hikes are tied to US tariffs, the Journal reported.A few hours after the Journal report, Trump said that he had spoken to Cook. He, however, didn’t address the potential price increases. Trump just focused on how he thinks the company will end up raising its US spending plan beyond the $500 billion that it had pledged in February. “He’s going to be building a lot of plants in the US for Apple,” Trump said.Apple hasn’t changed the starting price of its flagship iPhone model since it launched its tenth-anniversary iPhone -- iPhone X in 2017 — keeping it at $999. However, there have been wide speculations that the company may increase prices after Trump announced sweeping tariffs against several nations that Apple relies on for manufacturing. Earlier this year, Apple went with a higher price for the iPhone 16e, which replaced the budget iPhone SE in its lineup, signaling what analysts says its willingness to raise costs when needed.Cook said during a recent earnings call that it could incur costs of about $900 million this quarter due to tariffs. He was asked about potential price increases during the same call but promptly shut down the question, saying: “We have nothing to announce today.”The WSJ report added that high-end iPhones, including the Pro and Pro Max models, will be produced in China, even as Apple builds up capacity in Indian factories. According to Bloomberg report, Apple is seeking to import most of the iPhones it sells in the US from India by the end of next year, accelerating a shift beyond China to mitigate risks related to tariffs and geopolitical tensions.","US and China have agreed to suspend most tariffs for 90 days.

""We are wealth creators, we reflect and promote the national stories, we are the innovators of the future, and AI needs us as much as it needs energy and computer skills,""

“We want our creative industries and AI companies to flourish, which is why we're consulting on a package of measures that we hope will work for both sectors. We're clear that no changes will be considered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators.”

A letter signed by over 400 British musicians, writers, and artists, including Elton John, Sir Paul McCartney, and Dua Lipa, is urging UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to update copyright laws to protect them from artificial intelligence. The letter warns that failing to provide such protection would effectively ""give away"" their work to tech firms. It also raises concerns about the potential damage to ""the UK's position as a creative powerhouse."" The signatories have asked Stamer to support an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill. This amendment would require developers to be transparent with copyright owners about the use of their material to train AI models. Other notable signatories of the letter include Sir Ian McKellen, Florence Welch, Kazuo Ishiguro, David Hare, Kate Bush, Robbie Williams, Coldplay, Tom Stoppard, and Richard Curtis.the letter noted. In January, McCartney also told the BBC that he was concerned about AI ripping off artists.These artists have argued that their concerns could be addressed if the government supports an amendment put forward by UK MP Baroness Beeban Kidron that would “allow both AI developers and creators to develop licensing regimes that will allow for human-created content well into the future.”Kidron’s earlier amendment, which would have held AI developers directly accountable to UK copyright law, was recently voted down by MPs. She now argues that the transparency requirements in her new proposal could facilitate the creation of licensing agreements between creators and tech firms.In a statement to the BBC, a government spokesperson said:","A letter signed by over 400 British musicians, writers, and artists is urging UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to update copyright laws to protect them from artificial intelligence.

"With Elon Musk's Starlink role under scrutiny, EU sends questionnaire on SES-Intelsat merger",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/with-elon-musks-starlink-role-under-scrutiny-eu-sends-questionnaire-on-ses-intelsat-merger/articleshow/121119129.cms,"Europe’s Satellite Ambitions vs Global Competition

What’s Next

EU antitrust regulators are ramping up their examination of European satellite operator SES’s $3.1 billion proposed acquisition of Intelsat, a deal aimed at bolstering Europe’s position in the global satellite communications market. The European Commission has issued a detailed questionnaire to customers and competitors, probing whether Elon Musk ’s Starlink, owned by SpaceX , poses a credible competitive threat to the merging companies. The responses, due today, will play a pivotal role in determining whether the deal sails through, requires concessions, or faces a full-scale investigation.SES, which operates a fleet of approximately 70 satellites across multiple orbits, provides critical services such as video broadcasting, government communications, and broadband internet. Intelsat, a Luxembourg-based giant, complements SES with its extensive global satellite network. The merger is seen as a strategic move to create a European satellite powerhouse capable of competing with U.S.-based giants like Starlink and Amazon’s Project Kuiper , both of which are rapidly expanding their low-earth orbit (LEO) constellations to deliver high-speed internet globally.The European Union is keen to foster a robust alternative to American dominance in satellite communications, particularly as geopolitical tensions highlight the need for secure and independent connectivity infrastructure. However, the Commission is wary of the merger reducing competition in an already concentrated market. Its questionnaire, obtained by Reuters, zeroes in on whether LEO satellite providers like Starlink and Eutelsat’s OneWeb are viable rivals to SES and Intelsat, which primarily rely on geostationary (GEO) and medium-earth orbit (MEO) satellites.Regulators are asking whether LEO operators are actively competing in tenders and securing customer contracts, and how their growing presence might reshape the satellite capacity market over the next five years. Unlike traditional GEO satellites, which orbit at higher altitudes and offer wide coverage, LEO satellites provide lower latency and faster data speeds, making them increasingly attractive for broadband and real-time applications. Starlink, with thousands of satellites already in orbit, has disrupted the industry by offering direct-to-consumer internet services and securing contracts with governments and businesses.The Commission is also probing the bargaining power of SES and Intelsat’s customers. Respondents were asked whether they can negotiate favorable terms for two-way satellite capacity and if switching to alternative providers, such as Starlink or OneWeb, is feasible. This line of inquiry reflects concerns that the merger could strengthen SES-Intelsat’s market dominance, potentially leading to higher prices or reduced service quality for customers, including telecom operators, broadcasters, and government agencies.The SES-Intelsat merger is more than a corporate transaction; it’s a critical piece of Europe’s strategy to reclaim ground in the space race. For decades, European satellite operators like SES and Eutelsat have been global leaders, but the rise of U.S.-based LEO constellations has shifted the competitive landscape. Starlink’s aggressive expansion—coupled with SpaceX’s reusable rocket technology, which slashes launch costs—has put pressure on traditional operators. Amazon’s Project Kuiper, though still in its early stages, looms as another formidable challenger.From a European perspective, consolidating SES and Intelsat could create economies of scale, enabling the combined entity to invest in next-generation technologies, including LEO satellites, to compete with Starlink’s speed and Kuiper’s ambition. However, critics argue that the merger risks stifling competition within Europe, where fewer players could mean less innovation and higher costs for consumers. Smaller satellite operators and new entrants may struggle to challenge a SES-Intelsat behemoth, particularly if it leverages its market power to secure exclusive contracts.The Commission’s focus on Starlink’s competitive impact also raises questions about the broader dynamics of the space industry. While Starlink’s LEO model offers advantages in speed and coverage, its direct-to-consumer approach and vertically integrated structure (with SpaceX controlling launches) make it a unique player. Traditional operators like SES and Intelsat, which serve enterprise and government clients, argue that their services remain distinct, catering to specialized needs like secure military communications and broadcast distribution. Yet, as Starlink expands into these markets, the lines are blurring.The European Commission has set June 10, 2025, as the deadline for its preliminary review. If the responses to the questionnaire indicate that Starlink and other LEO providers are sufficiently competitive, the deal may be cleared with minimal conditions. However, if regulators find that the merger could harm competition—particularly in the supply of two-way satellite capacity—a deeper investigation could delay or even derail the transaction. SES and Intelsat may need to offer remedies, such as divesting assets or guaranteeing access to their infrastructure for competitors.As the deadline approaches, the outcome of this probe will not only shape the future of SES and Intelsat but also signal how Europe plans to navigate the high-stakes, high-orbit world of global satellite communications. With Starlink’s shadow looming large, the EU faces a delicate balancing act: fostering a strong European champion without sacrificing the benefits of a competitive market.",EU antitrust regulators are ramping up their examination of European satellite operator SES’s $3.1 billion proposed acquisition of Intelsat.

Streaming services, including Spotify , YouTube, SoundCloud and others, are having a hard time removing Kanye West ’s latest song, “Heil Hitler,” which glorifies Adolf Hitler. The track alongside another titled “WW3”, which was first uploaded on X (earlier Twitter) last week, has since received over 8.2 million views on the social media platform. After public criticism, Spotify, YouTube and SoundCloud removed the original uploads, but users have managed to keep the content available by posting cover versions and embedding the song within podcasts. West’s latest release (uploaded under his new name Ye) follows a series of antisemitic remarks that led to the termination of his Adidas Yeezy contract.According to a report by NBC News, the Anti-Defamation League got involved and launched a petition urging Spotify to remove “WW3” and other tracks.“Spotify has been mostly radio silent to outreach from ADL for the majority of 2025, so we felt it was important to activate our volunteer base,” said Daniel Kelley, the ADL’s director of strategy and operations.While Spotify did not respond to requests for comment, Kelley noted that the song appears to have been taken down in the US, though alternate uploads remain active, the report noted.YouTube also saw multiple reuploads of both tracks. A spokesperson from the Google-owned music streaming service said: “We removed the content and will continue to take down reuploads,” adding that Ye’s affiliated accounts are not eligible for monetisation. The report also identified 27 alternate uploads of “Heil Hitler” on SoundCloud.Other platforms have faced similar challenges. On Reddit , versions of each song were shared in subreddits devoted to Ye and other rappers, prompting the site to remove uploads and related posts.“Hate and antisemitism have absolutely no place on Reddit. We have strict rules against hateful content… In line with our sitewide rules, we are removing the song and any celebration of its message,” a Reddit spokesperson told NBC News.Meanwhile, Meta and TikTok—both of which prohibit hate speech and the glorification of genocide—are likewise trying to remove instances of the songs as they emerge.The track’s initial upload on X was circulated by a network of users and right-wing influencers, with some posts pairing it alongside archival Hitler footage. At the same time, a video of social media figure Andrew Tate playing the song in his car has earned more than 3 million views on X.","Kanye West’s latest song, “Heil Hitler,” glorifies Adolf Hitler.

White House's 'firing email' to Perlmutter

Elon Musk's support for Square founder's call to delete all IP laws

Democrats slam firing

In a move that has sparked outrage among Democrats, the Donald Trump administration has abruptly terminated Shira Perlmutter , the head of the US Copyright Office. Perlmutter's firing comes just days after the dismissal of the Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden . The US Copyright Office handles approximately half a million copyright applications annually, covering millions of creative works.Hayden was the first woman and African American to hold the Librarian of Congress position. The quick dismissals have fueled concerns about a broader purge of government officials. Hayden had appointed Perlmutter to lead the Copyright Office in October 2020. Perlmutter, a law graduate, is said to have a distinguished career in intellectual property, including previous roles as a policy director at the Patent and Trademark Office and prior service at the Copyright Office in the late 1990s.According to a statement released by the Copyright Office, Perlmutter received an email from the White House informing her that her position has been terminated. White House's email to Perlmutter had the notification that read: “Your position as the Register of Copyrights and Director at the U.S. Copyright Office is terminated effective immediately.”Perlmutter’s dismissal reportedly comes at a critical juncture. According to a report in news agency AP, her office recently released a report addressing the complex issue of artificial intelligence and copyright. The report examined whether AI companies should be permitted to use copyrighted materials to train their AI systems and subsequently compete with the original, human-created works. This report was the culmination of a study initiated by Perlmutter in 2023, which involved gathering input from thousands of stakeholders, including AI developers, actors, and musicians. In January, her office clarified its stance, emphasizing the “centrality of human creativity” in works eligible for copyright protection.“Where that creativity is expressed through the use of AI systems, it continues to enjoy protection,” Perlmutter stated in January as per the AP report. “Extending protection to material whose expressive elements are determined by a machine ... would undermine rather than further the constitutional goals of copyright,” it added.The burgeoning field of artificial intelligence is facing a wave of copyright infringement lawsuits, with companies like OpenAI at the center of the legal storm. OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has responded by urging the U.S. government to establish a clear copyright framework that would grant AI developers broader ""fair use"" rights. This move reflects the industry's growing concern over the legal uncertainties surrounding the use of copyrighted material in AI training.Simultaneously, the debate has taken a dramatic turn with Elon Musk, a co-founder of both OpenAI and its competitor, xAI, publicly endorsing a radical proposition. Musk aligned himself with Square founder Jack Dorsey's call to ""delete all IP law,"" advocating for the complete elimination of intellectual property protections.Democrats have strongly condemned the move. Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Administration Committee, described Trump’s action as “a brazen, unprecedented power grab with no legal basis.”","Shira Perlmutter, the head of the US Copyright Office, has been fired by the Donald Trump administration.

Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

‘rawdog’ morning routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well. Here’s how it aligns with executive performance demands:While Zuckerberg avoids all forms of chemical stimulation, other tech leaders have taken diverse approaches to optimizing performance:Zuckerberg’s ‘rawdog’ method is unique in its emphasis on no external stimulants, which sets it apart from the above figures.While no clinical studies have yet been conducted on Zuckerberg’s specific regimen, related research suggests:","Zuckerberg’s morning includes two hours of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA) He believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools

Google claims breakup ""impossible"" without serious consequences

The US Justice Department have asked a federal judge to break up Google's advertising technology business, marking the second government request within a year that could fundamentally reshape the $2 trillion giant. During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

"How Walmart and Target may have worked together to bust a $100,000 AirPods theft ring",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-walmart-and-target-may-have-worked-together-to-bust-a-100000-airpods-theft-ring/articleshow/121117379.cms,"How these women used to steal AirPods from Walmart and Target store



“Organised retail crime is a growing problem not only in our community, but nationwide,”

“These defendants operated in a coordinated effort with a specific plan in place. Although only two stores in Cherokee County were directly affected, Georgia’s RICO Act enabled us to prosecute this broader criminal enterprise.”

Two women from New York, US, have been sentenced to 10 years in prison for operating a multistate retail theft ring involving over $100,000 worth of goods, including Apple AirPods , from Walmart and Target stores. Prosecutors in Cherokee County initially considered charges in May 2024 when Walmart Global Investigations met with their Gang and Organized Crime Unit to discuss a ""large theft ring involving both Walmart and Target."" The two retail giants collaborated to investigate the thefts by sharing information with each other before contacting law enforcement agencies, according to prosecutors.From June 2022 through August 2024, the women stole nearly $141,000 worth of merchandise in 187 incidents across 21 states, including Georgia. The women, Ebony Fallon Washington (aka Stephanie Harris), 43, and Melissa Holland (aka Keisha Wilson), 46, pleaded guilty to three counts of violating Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, the Cherokee County District Attorney's Office said to USA Today.Their scheme involved buying Apple AirPods with cash and using tools to remove the genuine products from their packaging. They would then replace the AirPods with cheaper items and reseal the boxes to appear unopened. The fraudulent items were then returned for full cash refunds. In some cases, the refunded cash was used to purchase more AirPods, continuing the cycle. The authentic Apple products were kept and resold for profit, according to prosecutors.The suspects were arrested in September 2024 in Coweta County. During a search of their rental car, officers found hotel receipts for locations near the targeted stores and tools for opening AirPods packaging. Prosecutors noted that five cellphones seized from the defendants contained additional evidence.Each woman received a 10-year prison sentence, followed by 10 years of probation, and was ordered to pay $134,951.86 in restitution—the remaining balance after recovered items were deducted from the total theft value.A Walmart spokesperson told USA Today on May 9 that the company is deferring further comment to law enforcement, and Target had not responded to requests for comment.DA Susan Treadaway said in a statement (as seen by USA Today). The DA also noted that these two women were “clearly involved in an organised scheme” that impacted stores “throughout the country.”Meanwhile, Rachel Murphy, Assistant District Attorney of the Gang and Organized Crime Unit said:","Ebony Fallon Washington, 43, and Melissa Holland, 46, pleaded guilty to three counts of violating Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang offered a perspective on the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the workforce this week, stating that while every job will undergo change, the primary challenge for workers will be adapting to those who leverage the new technology.Speaking at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference 2025, Huang said, “So, all of you have heard a lot about job displacement.”“Every job will be affected. Some jobs will be lost, some jobs will be created; but every job will be affected,” he said.“You are not going to lose your job to AI, but you are going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI,” he then elaborated on a key distinction.He urged attendees to embrace the technology, advising, “Don't be that person who ignores this technology and this result loses you.”Huang, painting an optimistic picture of AI's potential to expand the workforce, claimed that there is a “shortage of workers.”“For the very first time in history we actually can imagine the opportunity…to put 30-40 million workers back into the workforce” through the implementation of AI,” he said.Underscoring AI's potential to bridge the digital divide, Huang highlighted its ability to democratize technology access beyond traditional programming skills. He provided an example to the conference attendees, suggesting that while many might not know how to program in languages like C++ or C, “100% of you know how to programme in AI,” referencing intuitive interaction methods like “vibe coding.”He explained this is possible “because AI will speak whatever language you want it to speak,” allowing users to interact by drawing schematics, speaking, or giving explicit or implicit prompts.Huang also stated that artificial intelligence is “probably our best way to increase the global GDP.”","Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, spoke at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference 2025.

Residents of the Isle of Lewis in Scotland’s Outer Hebrides are reportedly grappling with a persistent, low-frequency humming noise that has disrupted daily life. According to a report in BBC, the mysterious sound, described as a “droning, pulsating” disturbance, is audible day and night across the island. Around 200-plus people have reported it, per a Facebook group set up to track the issue.Dr. Lauren-Grace Kirtley, who launched the “Hebridean Hum” Facebook page, told BBC Radio’s Good Morning Scotland that the 50hz hum is “incredibly intrusive and distressing,” causing sleeplessness, dizziness, headaches, and difficulty concentrating. “It’s impossible to ignore – it is like somebody shouting in your face constantly for attention,” she said. Kirtley noted the noise is strongest on the island’s east coast and less noticeable in its center.Local resident Marcus-Hazel McGowan, using amateur radio techniques to pinpoint the source, described the hum as inescapable, telling the BBC, “It is one of those you cannot escape from.” He ruled out Stornoway’s Battery Point Power Station, operated by SSEN, as the cause, noting the hum is constant while the station operates intermittently.McGowan also dismissed boats as a likely source. Theories circulating on the Facebook page range from a TV mast to tinnitus, with some suggesting ferry noise carried by persistent easterly winds, which BBC Weather data confirms have been prevalent recently. Similar low-frequency disturbances have been reported elsewhere, including Omagh, Northern Ireland, where a business was identified as the source last year, and Immingham, England, where the cause remains unknown. In 2013, a drone-like sound on England’s south coast was speculated to be mating fish calls.Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, the local council, acknowledged receiving reports from a small number of islanders. A spokesperson told the BBC, “The comhairle’s environmental health team is investigating and will liaise with those who have reported issues.” As the investigation continues, residents like McGowan remain determined to uncover the source, hoping to restore the peace they once cherished on the island.","Residents of the Isle of Lewis in Scotland's Outer Hebrides are grappling with a persistent, low-frequency humming noise.

Pope Leo XIV, a name inspired by industrial transformation

Pope Leo: A.I. inspired name choice

The new pope warns about AI’s dangers

In his first address to the College of Cardinals, Pope Leo XIV , the first American pontiff, unveiled a prophetic vision for the Catholic Church 's future, squarely placing artificial intelligence at the center of contemporary theological and social challenges. His papal name selection , deeply rooted in historical precedent, signals an unprecedented commitment to understanding technology's profound human impact.Pope Leo XIV directly linked his name choice to Pope Leo XIII , who guided the church through the Industrial Revolution. ""In our own day, the Church offers to everyone the treasury of her social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice and labour,"" he told the cardinals.Referencing Leo XIII's landmark 1891 encyclical "" Rerum Novarum ,"" which addressed workers' rights during massive economic shifts, the new pope drew a striking parallel to current technological disruptions. His selection of the papal name demonstrates a deliberate strategy to position the church as a moral compass in an era of rapid technological transformation.The pope's remarks build upon Pope Francis's earlier warnings about AI's potential dangers. Francis had previously cautioned about AI's capacity to generate ""partially or completely false narratives,"" and Leo XIV appears poised to continue this critical examination of emerging technologies.""Let us take up this precious legacy and continue on the journey, inspired by the same hope that is born of faith,"" Leo XIV said, signaling his intention to maintain the church's proactive stance on technological ethics. By explicitly naming AI as a crucial challenge for humanity, the pope has positioned the Catholic Church as a key participant in global conversations about technological development and its human implications.","Pope Leo XIV directly linked his name choice to Pope Leo XIII, who guided the church through the Industrial Revolution.

Texas has reached on a settlement with Google regarding a lawsuit that alleged that the tech giant violated users’ data privacy. According to a report by Reuters, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has reached a $1.38 billion settlement with Google, resolving lawsuits over alleged violations of consumer data privacy laws. The agreement marks one of the largest settlements secured against a tech giant for privacy-related concerns. The lawsuit centered on claims that Google collected and used Texans' personal data without proper consent.Paxton’s lawsuit accused Google of tracking user movements even when the location settings were disabled. The tech giant was also accused of collecting biometric data which included face geometry and voiceprints without any consent. Lastly, as per the lawsuit filed Google was also misleading users about the privacy protections of Incognito mode in Chrome.“In Texas, Big Tech is not above the law. For years, Google secretly tracked people’s movements, private searches and even their voiceprints and facial geometry through their products and services.

Meta’s crypto strategy

Facebook parent Meta is once again testing the deployment of stablecoins. This move comes three years after abandoning its ambitious Diem (formerly Libra) cryptocurrency project due to regulatory pushback. According to a report by Fortune, Meta is in preliminary talks with crypto infrastructure firms to explore stablecoins as a payment solution, particularly for content creators across its platforms — Facebook, WhatsApp. The company is reportedly considering multiple stablecoins, such as USDC and USDT, rather than relying on a single provider.The report further adds that this renewed interest in digital currencies suggests a potential shift in Meta's strategy, possibly driven by the evolving regulatory landscape and the growing adoption of stablecoins. Companies like Visa, Stripe, and Fidelity have recently entered the space, signaling broader acceptance. Meta’s Vice President of Product, Ginger Baker, who specializes in fintech and payments, is leading the company’s stablecoin exploration. Baker previously worked at Plaid and serves on the board of the Stellar Development Foundation, a crypto organization managing a layer 1 blockchain.Meta is reportedly evaluating stablecoins for cross-border payments , aiming to reduce high transaction fees associated with traditional banking methods. The company’s move reflects a broader trend of non-crypto firms integrating blockchain-based financial solutions.While the details of Meta's plans are still emerging, this development signals the company's continued interest in leveraging blockchain technology and digital currencies.","Facebook parent Meta is once again testing the deployment of stablecoins.

Douglas Altshuler , a former SpaceX employee, has sued the aerospace company in federal court, alleging he was discriminated against because of his medical condition, Crohn's disease, and retaliated against for reporting safety issues. Altshuler, hired in 2023, claims that his frequent need for restroom visits was not adequately accommodated, resulting in punitive measures and threats of discharge. The suit also raises concerns about workplace safety, such as exposure to hazardous chemicals and unsafe equipment handling.Douglas Altshuler, a 58-year-old former Space worker, has filed the aerospace company with a federal court lawsuit. Working in 2023, Altshuler states he was deprived of adequate accommodations for his sickness, including bathroom break restrictions, and was penalized for disclosing safety violations. His case raises questions about how large tech firms address employee health accommodations and whistleblower protection, questioning whether corporate policies are sufficient in accommodating workers with medical conditions as well as protecting whistleblowers who reveal workplace hazards.Altshuler, who suffers from Crohn's disease, used to work at SpaceX's Redmond, Washington headquarters, which manufactures components for the Starlink satellite network. Crohn's disease leads to frequent and urgent bowel movements, necessitating that Altshuler visit the restroom every 35 to 45 minutes, sometimes as many as 14 times in an eight-hour shift. Even after submitting medical documentation, he alleges SpaceX managers refused to accommodate his needs.While two supervisors at first informed Altshuler that his use of the restroom would not be limited, the suit alleges that this agreement was not maintained. One supervisor supposedly started timing his bathroom breaks and punishing him if they lasted more than 10 minutes. He was supposedly informed that he could be fired for using the restroom ""too frequently."" This practice of monitoring, the lawsuit claims, is contrary to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which mandates that employers provide reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities, unless providing such accommodations would cause an undue hardship.Altshuler was given written warnings, known as ""occurrences,"" for his use of the bathroom, the complaint alleges. These warnings were given despite the earlier assurances and his regular filing of medical records.Besides the disability-related complaints, Altshuler also complained about workplace safety at the Redmond plant. As per the legal document, he complained of possible exposure to harmful chemicals and accused industrial components of being dried in a kitchen oven—a clear disregard for safety procedures and food handling regulations. Following his reports, Altshuler says that he endured retaliatory acts, which consisted of unreasonable unfavorable performance critiques and ongoing oversight by previous superiors, after having been remodeled to be in a separate crew.The grievance asserts that SpaceX actions equated to unlawful retaliation due to protected whistleblowing activity as contemplated by federal safety and labor law.Altshuler was eventually fired from his job in January 2025, only days after the company's human resources department dismissed his official internal complaints as ""unsubstantiated."" His firing, occurring shortly after expressing both disability and safety concerns, is a mainstay of the lawsuit. His attorneys, Clive Pontusson—a former U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) trial attorney—state that the dismissal was not merely unwarranted but also illegal under federal protection."" said Pontusson in a news release.Altshuler's lawsuit alleges compensatory and punitive damages for:","Douglas Altshuler, a 58-year-old former Space worker, has filed the aerospace company with a federal court lawsuit.

Elon Musk’s Tesla ordered to pay over $240 million for Autopilot crash case; company says ‘This was never about…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-tesla-ordered-to-pay-over-240-million-for-autopilot-crash-case-company-says-this-was-never-about/articleshow/123101668.cms,"Representative Image

What Tesla said about the Autopilot crash order



“Today’s verdict is wrong and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla’s and the entire industry’s efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology. We plan to appeal given the substantial errors of law and irregularities at trial.

Even though this jury found that the driver was overwhelmingly responsible for this tragic accident in 2019, the evidence has always shown that this driver was solely at fault because he was speeding, with his foot on the accelerator – which overrode Autopilot – as he rummaged for his dropped phone without his eyes on the road. To be clear, no car in 2019, and none today, would have prevented this crash.

This was never about Autopilot; it was a fiction concocted by plaintiffs’ lawyers blaming the car when the driver – from day one – admitted and accepted responsibility.”

“Tesla designed Autopilot only for controlled access highways yet deliberately chose not to restrict drivers from using it elsewhere, alongside Elon Musk telling the world Autopilot drove better than humans. Tesla’s lies turned our roads into test tracks for their fundamentally flawed technology, putting everyday Americans like Naibel Benavides and Dillon Angulo in harm’s way.”

Instax Wide Evo Review: Real Prints, Real Memories

A US court has found Elon Musk’s electric vehicle (EV) company, Tesla, partially liable for a fatal 2019 Autopilot crash. The Miami jury has ordered the EV maker to pay a portion of the $329 million in damages awarded to the family of the deceased and an injured survivor. The jury held Tesla responsible for 33% of the crash's fault. The total damages include $129 million in compensatory damages and $200 million in punitive damages. Based on the jury's decision, Tesla will be responsible for paying nearly $42.5 million in compensatory damages. However, as punitive damages were exclusively assessed against Tesla, plaintiffs' attorneys expect the company to pay the full $200 million, potentially bringing its total payment to around $242.5 million. Tesla has stated its intention to appeal the decision.In a statement to CNBC, Tesla confirmed that it will appeal the decision. The company said:The trial, which began last month in Florida, focused on a fatal 2019 crash involving Tesla’s Enhanced Autopilot system. George McGee, the Tesla driver, dropped his phone and assumed the Autopilot would brake if needed. Instead, the car accelerated through an intersection at over 60 mph, hitting a parked car and its owners. Naibel Benavides, 22, was killed, and her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, was seriously injured. Plaintiffs' attorneys had sought $345 million in damages.In an emailed statement, Brett Schreiber, one of the plaintiffs' counsel, said:","A US court has found Elon Musk’s electric vehicle (EV) company, Tesla, partially liable for a fatal 2019 Autopilot crash.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has issued a warning to the general public against the rise of a QR code scam. In its warning, the FBI says that cyber criminals are sending “unsolicited packages” containing a QR code. The package, generally sent without sender information, entices the victim to scan the QR code. It further prompts the recipient to provide personal and financial information or download a malicious app that steals data from the victim’s phone.“While this scam is not as widespread as other fraud schemes, the public should be aware of this criminal activity,” the FBI says in its warning. “This is a variation of a ‘brushing scam,’ which is used by online vendors to increase ratings of their products,” the agency said.A brushing scam is a fraudulent practice where online sellers send unsolicited packages to random individuals and then use those recipients’ names and addresses to post fake positive reviews of their products. The goal is to artificially boost the product’s ratings and visibility on e-commerce platforms, making it appear more popular and trustworthy than it actually is.While the recipient may think they’ve received a free gift, their personal information is being exploited without their consent.FBI has also issued precautionary measures that users can take to avoid falling victims to such scams. Some of these are:If you believe you are the target of a brushing scam, secure your online presence by changing account profiles and request a free credit report from one or all the national credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) to identify possible fraudulent activity.Users can also report these fraudulent or suspicious activities to the FBI IC3 at www.ic3.gov.","The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has issued a warning to the general public against the rise of a QR code scam.

He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company. I’ve got my methods of doing that, and I use machine learning. I sort through all 42,000 employees.”“100% of the time, I increased the company’s spend on OpEx [operating expenses].

AI transformation drives Microsoft’s workforce restructuring strategy

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed the company's massive job cuts in a candid memo to employees, acknowledging that recent layoffs affecting over 15,000 workers this year, have been ""weighing heavily"" on him while defending the cuts as necessary for the Redmond giant’s AI transformation.""Before anything else, I want to speak to what's been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations,"" Nadella wrote to Microsoft's more than 200,000 employees. ""These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we've worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with – our colleagues, teammates, and friends.""The layoffs represent approximately 7% of Microsoft's global workforce, making it the company's largest personnel reduction since 2014. Despite the cuts, Microsoft's stock has soared 21% this year, hitting record highs above $500 per share, while the company reported $75 billion in net income over three fiscal quarters.Nadella directly addressed what he called the ""uncertainty and seeming incongruence"" of cutting jobs while the company thrives financially. ""By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving – our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right,"" he wrote. ""We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.""The CEO described this contradiction as ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value,"" explaining that ""progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.""Nadella emphasised that achieving future success ""will be defined by our ability to go through this difficult process of 'unlearning' and 'learning.'"" He argued this transformation requires Microsoft to ""meet changing customer needs, by continuing to maintain and scale our current business, while also creating new categories with new business models and a new production function.""The memo outlined Microsoft's strategic pivot from a ""software factory to an intelligence engine"" as the company invests $80 billion in AI infrastructure. Nadella envisions a future where ""all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips.""""As we begin a new fiscal year, I've been reflecting on the road we've traveled together and the path ahead,"" Nadella wrote, positioning the layoffs within broader industry shifts toward AI-driven automation that have eliminated over 80,000 tech jobs in 2025.The CEO expressed ""sincere gratitude to those who have left,"" acknowledging that ""their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today."" However, he offered no guarantees against future layoffs, instead urging remaining employees to maintain a ""growth mindset"" during what he called the ""messiness"" of transformation.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed the company's massive job cuts in a candid memo to employees.

Read Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Bill Gates daughter shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother



Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among tech CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April this year, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment. ""In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Phoebe Gates recently shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni, Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was: ""Get up or get out of the game, sis.""According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Melinda Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced. Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking: ""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""""He's like, ‘Why would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‘You answered your own question,'” she added.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates worked a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup, Phia.

Sundar Pichai joins the ‘billionaire club’ after leading Google for over a decade; his net worth is…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sundar-pichai-joins-the-billionaire-club-after-leading-google-for-over-a-decade-his-net-worth-is/articleshow/122897734.cms,"Sundar Pichai achieves rare feat as a non-founder CEO

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race. Pichai's rise reflects a new era where operational excellence, not just founding status, can build tech empires.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes. His rise underscores a shift in Silicon Valley’s power dynamics—where disciplined execution rivals disruptive invention. As Alphabet charts its future, Pichai’s story stands as a model for aspiring global leaders in tech and beyond.","Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos lost $17 billion last week. According to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, the tech billionaire’s wealth dropped from $254 billion on July 31 to $237 billion on August 1. The decline comes following the company’s second quarterly results last week. According to a Benzinga report, investors were unimpressed with the company’s second-quarter earnings as the company’s stock tumbled by 8.27% on August 1. Amazon reported $167.7 billion in revenue for the second quarter, a 13% increase compared to the same period last year. This figure exceeded market expectations, which had forecast revenue of $161.9 billion. The company also posted earnings of $1.68 per share, beating analyst estimates of $1.30 per share.However, the slowdown in Amazon's AWS cloud computing business has been identified as a key factor behind the investor’s concern. AWS reported $10.2 billion in sales for the quarter, marking a 17.5% year-on-year increase. However, this fell short of analysts' expectations of 20% growth.Amazon shares make up a significant portion of Jeff Bezos' net worth. He owns 884 million shares, representing 8.3% of the company’s total outstanding shares. Based on the current market price, these shares are valued at $190 billion. The remainder of his wealth is tied to Blue Origin, his privately-held space exploration company, which is valued at its investment cost.Jeff Bezos has been on a stock selling spree recently. In early July, he offloaded approximately $737 million worth of Amazon stock. In the same month, he sold another 6.6 million shares of the company. In the past two years, Jeff Bezos has sold around $4.8 billion worth of the company’s stocks.The latest transaction took place on July 21 and 22. The sale was executed under the prearranged trading plan known as Rule 10b5-1.","The tech billionaire's wealth dropped from $254 billion on July 31 to $237 billion on August 1.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk awarded $29 billion in shares; here’s why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-just-got-29-billion-from-tesla-the-company-he-founded-himself-heres-why/articleshow/123097733.cms,"Why Elon Musk is getting another massive deal from Tesla

What happens if the original pay package is reinstated

Tesla’s bigger challenges: Sales, politics, and image

Tesla has approved a staggering $29 billion stock award for CEO Elon Musk , reigniting debates about executive compensation , loyalty, and the future of the electric vehicle giant. The move comes after a Delaware court invalidated Musk’s previous $50 billion pay deal from 2018, calling it unfair to shareholders. While that legal fight continues, Tesla’s board has introduced a fresh compensation package, one they hope will keep Musk committed to leading the company through a challenging transition period. With Tesla’s stock down 25% this year, faltering sales, and mounting competition, the board believes Musk's continued leadership is essential, especially as Tesla pivots toward AI, robotaxis , and robotics.In a Monday regulatory filing, Tesla’s special board committee explained that the new award, consisting of 96 million shares valued at $29 billion, was designed to secure Elon Musk’s long-term commitment at a critical crossroads for the company.The rationale is clear: as Tesla faces growing pressure from declining EV sales, intensifying Chinese competition, and investor skepticism over its future direction, the board sees Musk not just as a CEO but as uniquely capable of navigating these headwinds. In 2024, Tesla missed Wall Street delivery estimates for three consecutive quarters, signaling a slowdown in demand. Meanwhile, Tesla’s Q2 2025 earnings showed a 12% year-over-year revenue decline — the sharpest in over five years. Analysts from Morgan Stanley and Barclays have also downgraded Tesla stock this year, citing uncertainty around its AI and robotaxi roadmap. Despite his involvement with other ventures like SpaceX, Neuralink, and xAI, Tesla argues that Musk remains central to its identity and innovation roadmap.The board believes that without Musk’s focus and leadership, Tesla could lose its edge in AI-driven products, autonomous driving, and robotics, which are all key to its future growth beyond automobiles. This new compensation package is also structured to gradually increase Musk’s voting power, further cementing his control over Tesla’s strategic decisions and direction.In short, it is not just about rewarding past performance. It is about ensuring Musk is personally and financially motivated to remain the driving force behind Tesla’s next evolution.Musk is currently appealing the Delaware court’s ruling that voided his 2018 compensation plan. Tesla's board made it clear that if the courts reinstate the original $50 billion package, this new interim award will be either forfeited or offset. “There will be no double dip,” the filing said, aiming to reassure shareholders wary of executive excess.The new shares come with several strings attached. Musk must stay in a key executive role through 2027 for any of the shares to vest. He’s also required to pay $23.34 per share, the same price as the 2018 deal, and hold the shares for at least five years, with few exceptions. This makes the package both performance-based and long-term, aligning with shareholder interests, according to the board.Tesla has seen its stock fall sharply this year amid slumping EV sales, growing competition from legacy automakers like GM and BMW, and backlash over Musk’s outspoken political views. A Reuters report also noted declining brand loyalty after Musk publicly endorsed Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the US government’s cuts to EV subsidies have added more pressure to Tesla’s bottom line.Musk has repeatedly stated that Tesla’s next growth wave won’t be about cars. It will be driven by autonomous software, robotaxis, and even humanoid robots. That future vision, while bold, is unproven. But for now, Tesla is betting $29 billion that Elon Musk is still the right man to deliver it.","Tesla has approved a staggering $29 billion stock award for CEO Elon Musk.

Instax Wide Evo Review: Real Prints, Real Memories

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet recently shared the most important lesson of her career came when she was just 15 years old. Sweet told Fortune that after losing a local speech contest to “the daughter of the president” of the Lions Club, she complained to her father. His response left a lasting impact. “First of all, Julie, you're never going to be the daughter of the president of the Lions Club. That's not the family you were born into… and I believe you can do anything, but you have to be so much better than anyone else that they have to give it to you. Tonight, you weren't that much better,” Julie Sweet’s father told her.Sweet, who grew up in Tustin, California, later described her father’s words as a lesson in being fearless but prepared. “You should be fearless, but you have to be ready,” she told the publication. That advice, Julie Sweet says, taught her to be brutally honest with herself and to keep improving — a habit she developed early, working as a teenage reservations clerk where she “learned to change, to grow very, very fast.”During her interaction, Julie Sweet also pointed out that adaptability is crucial for all business leaders. She cited JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who often warns against complacency and urges constant learning.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a similar approach, saying his focus is always on “doing things that are going to be relevant tomorrow.” Satya Nadella credits this mindset for Microsoft’s three decades of continuous growth.Julie Sweet’s own journey — from losing a speech contest to leading one of the world’s largest consulting firms — reflects the value of staying ready and always improving.Julie Sweet graduated from Columbia University with a law degree and began her career at the elite law firm Cravath Swaine & Moore in Manhattan. She joined Accenture as General Counsel in 2010, became CEO of North America in 2015, and was appointed Global CEO in 2019. Transitioning from law to leading cloud services and generative AI projects, Sweet’s journey has been marked by constant adaptation.Under Sweet’s leadership, Accenture has spent $6.6 billion on acquisitions over the past two years and raised its AI bookings to $1.4 billion. These moves led to a higher revenue forecast in March, according to Reuters. Sweet says these strategies follow the same principle her father taught her — to be “so much better” that clients have no choice but to work with you.","Julie Sweet is the CEO of Accenture, one of the world's largest consulting firms.

Tech leaders push 'extremely hardcore' work culture



Global AI race drives Silicon Valley's hour-intensive push

Legal concerns mount over labor law compliance

Silicon Valley AI startups are increasingly embracing China's controversial ""996"" work schedule, demanding employees work 12-hour days, six days a week–totaling 72 hours weekly. The trend marks a dramatic shift from the tech industry's once-celebrated work-life balance culture to an ""extremely hardcore"" approach that mirrors practices China itself has outlawed.AI startup Rilla explicitly warns job applicants not to apply unless they're ""excited"" about working approximately 70 hours per week. The company provides all meals at their office, including Saturdays, with nearly all 80 employees adhering to the punishing schedule. ""There's a really strong and growing subculture of people, especially in my generation–Gen Z–who grew up listening to stories of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates,"" explained Will Gao, Rilla's head of growth.The 996 model–9 AM to 9 PM, six days a week–originated in China's tech sector but sparked massive protests and accusations of ""modern slavery"" before being declared illegal by Chinese authorities in 2021. Despite these negative associations, American startups are openly adopting both the schedule and its notorious nickname as they race to compete in the global AI landscape.The resurgence of extreme work schedules echoes Elon Musk's infamous ultimatum to X employees, demanding they commit to ""extremely hardcore"" working conditions or leave with severance. Similarly, Google co-founder Sergey Brin recently recommended 60-hour weeks as the ""sweet spot"" for productivity among Gemini team members.Some founders are creating two-tiered employment structures around the demanding schedule. San Francisco telehealth company Fella & Delilah offered staff a 25 percent pay increase and doubled equity for those willing to adopt 996 hours, with just under 10 percent of employees accepting the arrangement.According to Wired's investigation, recruitment specialist Adrian Kinnersley has witnessed the trend's rapid growth across multiple startup clients. ""It's becoming increasingly common,"" he noted, with companies requiring candidates to commit to 996 schedules before interviews. Kinnersley has even registered the domain ""996careers.com"" in anticipation of continued demand.The extreme work culture surge stems partly from Silicon Valley's desire to compete with China in artificial intelligence development. This urgency intensified after Chinese startup DeepSeek released AI models rivaling top American offerings, shocking leading AI laboratories and highlighting the global competitive landscape.UK venture capitalist Harry Stebbings argues that 996 schedules may not be sufficient, claiming China now operates on ""007""–midnight to midnight, seven days weekly with rotational workforces. ""If you want to build a $100 million company, you can do it on five days a week. But if you want to build a $10 billion company, you have to work seven days a week,"" Stebbings contended.The phenomenon extends beyond individual companies, with American workers showing more enthusiasm for extended schedules than their European counterparts. ""People in Europe seem shocked when you ask them to work the weekend,"" Stebbings observed, highlighting cultural differences in work expectations.Employment compliance experts warn that many 996-adopting companies appear ""wildly noncompliant"" with US labor laws. California, the epicenter of AI development and 996 culture adoption, maintains the nation's most employee-friendly employment regulations, creating potential legal liabilities for non-compliant startups.Despite reservations about worker exploitation and legal risks, industry observers don't expect the trend to diminish. The combination of AI competition pressure, willing Gen-Z workers inspired by tech founder mythology, and the promise of substantial financial rewards continues driving Silicon Valley's embrace of China's controversial work culture–even as China itself moves away from these practices.","Silicon Valley AI startups are increasingly embracing China's controversial ""996"" work schedule. The 996 model–9 AM to 9 PM, six days a week–originated in China's tech sector but sparked massive protests and accusations of ""modern slavery"" The trend marks a dramatic shift from the tech industry's once- celebrated work-life balance culture.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123094235,imgsize-20960,width-400,resizemode-4/Toxic-work-culture.jpg"
Get out if not on…: AT&T CEO John Stankey's message to employees seven months after company ended work from home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/get-out-if-not-on-att-ceo-john-stankeys-message-to-employees-seven-months-after-company-ended-work-from-home/articleshow/123093143.cms,"CEO challenges employees hoping for policy reversal

In-person collaboration essential for complex projects, says AT&T CEO

AT&T CEO John Stankey delivered a blunt message to employees resisting the company's return-to-office mandate : adapt or leave. In a lengthy memo to managers obtained by Business Insider, Stankey addressed declining employee engagement scores following the telecom giant's shift from hybrid work to a five-day in-office requirement.""If a self-directed, virtual, or hybrid work schedule is essential for you to manage your career aspirations and life challenges, you will have a difficult time aligning your priorities with those of the company and the culture we aim to establish,"" Stankey wrote in the Friday memo.The memo responded to AT&T's employee engagement survey , where 79% of over 99,000 respondents said they feel committed and engaged with their work. However, Stankey acknowledged that engagement scores declined since 2023, calling the results unsurprising given the company's ongoing transformation.Stankey specifically addressed employees waiting for the return-to-office policy to end. ""If you are of the small minority that shared comments similar to, 'I have heard this nonsense before and I'll ignore things until this goes away…' or 'things were just fine the way they were…' there might be a disconnect between you and your current professional choice,"" he stated.The CEO emphasised that AT&T is transitioning from a culture based on ""loyalty, tenure, and conformance"" to ""a more market-based culture—focused on rewarding capability, contribution, and commitment."" He warned that employees preferring remote work arrangements should consider other career opportunities.Stankey defended the office mandate by highlighting AT&T's complex initiatives requiring teamwork, including fiber deployment, wireless network modernisation, and 5G standalone core development . ""In-person collaboration and predictable presence improves each team's ability to execute effectively on large, complex projects,"" he explained.The memo also addressed workplace concerns, with Stankey promising continued investment in office facilities as the company consolidates from 500+ locations to focused hubs. ""You are right to expect to work in a professional, well-maintained, and functional facility,"" he acknowledged.AT&T shares have risen over 21% in 2025, with the company posting strong earnings that met analyst expectations. Stankey concluded his message by quoting General Eric Shinseki : ""If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.""",AT&T CEO John Stankey delivered a blunt message to employees resisting the company's return-to-office mandate.

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas says AI browser will automate these two jobs in every office with just one prompt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/perplexity-ceo-aravind-srinivas-says-ai-browser-will-automate-these-two-jobs-in-every-office-with-just-one-prompt/articleshow/123071184.cms,"Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas anticipates that their new AI browser, Comet, will automate recruiter and administrative assistant roles by accessing applications like Gmail and LinkedIn. Comet can generate candidate lists, manage emails, coordinate calendars, and prepare meetings. While some leaders predict widespread job disruption, Srinivas emphasizes that AI proficiency will enhance employability.

AI browser targets administrative work beyond recruiting

AI leaders split on AI's impact on white-collar employment

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas believes his company's new AI browser , Comet, will soon automate two crucial white-collar roles that every modern workplace depends on: recruiters and administrative assistants.Speaking on The Verge's Decoder podcast, Srinivas outlined how Comet's built-in AI agent can access applications like Gmail, LinkedIn, and Google Calendar to completely transform knowledge work . ""A recruiter's work worth one week is just one prompt: sourcing and reach outs,"" he said during the Thursday episode.The AI-native browser, currently in invite-only beta for premium users, can generate candidate lists, extract contact information, and send personalised outreach emails, tasks traditionally handled by recruiting coordinators and sourcers. Srinivas demonstrated scenarios where the AI could identify Stanford alumni who previously worked at Anthropic, compile their information in Google Sheets, and draft personalised cold outreach messages.Comet's capabilities extend far beyond recruiting functions. Srinivas explained how the browser can assume many executive assistant responsibilities, including email management, calendar coordination, and meeting preparation. The AI can ""keep following up, keep track of responses, update Google Sheets, mark status as responded or in progress, sync with Google Calendar, and resolve conflicts to schedule meetings,"" he said.The Perplexity CEO envisions the browser evolving into an AI operating system that continuously runs background tasks and executes commands through natural language prompts. He believes users will pay premium prices for meaningful automation, suggesting people might spend ""$2,000 for a prompt"" if it helps generate significant business value.Srinivas joins other tech executives predicting widespread disruption to office jobs. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has suggested AI could eliminate 50% of entry-level positions within five years, while Ford CEO Jim Farley warned that artificial intelligence will ""replace literally half of all white-collar workers.""However, not all industry leaders share this apocalyptic view. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang frame AI as an augmentation tool rather than wholesale replacement technology.Despite differing perspectives on AI's ultimate impact, Srinivas issued a clear warning: ""People who are at the frontier of using AI are going to be way more employable than people who are not.""","Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas believes his company's new AI browser, Comet, will soon automate two crucial white-collar roles.

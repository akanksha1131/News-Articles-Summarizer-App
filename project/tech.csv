Cyber-attack refers to the intentional application of computer hardware, networks, or systems to cause damage, steal sensitive data, or disrupt normal operations. One lone hacker, a group of sophisticated cybercriminals, or even a nation state could carry out the attacks. As more data and infrastructure get digitised, governments, organisations, and individuals alike are increasingly threatened by cyberattacks in very concrete ways. These cyberattacks can vary from mere disruption to devastating intrusion with economic losses, loss of reputation, and compromised national security.A cyberattack refers to a deliberate and malicious effort to compromise, harm, disrupt, or steal data from a computer system, network, or device. Such attacks are often conducted by hackers, cybercriminals, or even state actors to realise any number of objectives, including stealing confidential information, causing operational interference, or inflicting monetary damage.The two broad types of cyberattacks are those targeting disruption of system and network operations, and those targeting access to sensitive data. An awareness of these types contributes to enhancing defense systems.These are meant to take a computer, network, or system offline, essentially cutting access for those who are authorized to use it. Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) are good illustrations. They overwhelm a network with questionable traffic or requests that leave the system unable to handle it and, in the process, crash. Disruption is their primary goal and not theft of information.The second largest category is efforts to steal confidential data. It can be financial data, private data, intellectual property, or state secrets. Phishing, malware, and exploitation of systems are familiar methods used by hackers to acquire unauthorized access to systems. After acquisition, burglars resell looted data or use it for criminal intentions, e.g., identity fraud or corporate espionage.Hackers employ an array of advanced methods and tools for mounting their cyber attacks. Hackers' favorite means are:Malware is an umbrella term that refers to any type of bad code with the potential to infect a system and cause mayhem. Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware are a few of the most common types of malware. Malware can steal data, bring down systems, or even hold information for ransom and demand money for its freedom (in ransomware attacks).Phishing is a social engineering attack in which the attackers pretend to be genuine organizations or entities with a purpose of duping the victims into sharing sensitive information such as passwords, usernames, or financial details. Phishing attacks normally are email or imitation websites in nature, coming across as actual websites but rather made for trapping users' information on being clicked.In social engineering attacks, people are used by hackers to leak sensitive information. They can also pose as coworkers or supervisors for the purpose of gaining the confidence of an individual and trick the victim into lowering security protocols such as revealing log-in details or clicking on unsafe links.Large-scale cyberattacks are often launched by well-coordinated groups of hackers. The groups will target high-profile entities or government organizations and apply complex methods, including advanced persistent threats (APTs), in order to acquire persistence over a long period.Cybercrime is a quick-growing enterprise. In 2017, it lost 780,000 records daily through various cyberattacks, McAfee's Economic Impact of Cyber Crime recorded. The figures indicate the numbers and volumes of cyberattacks mounting. According to the reports, cybercrime is estimated at $10.5 trillion by 2025.E-mail is still among the most popular attack vectors despite heightened cybersecurity. CSO research indicates that 92% of malware is transmitted through e-mail, most commonly by a malicious link or an attachment within a phishing e-mail. The attackers take advantage of the human factor by tricking people into opening the mail, which in turn leads to unintentional installation of malware on their systems.In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile cyberattacks that have hit the headlines, detailing just how sophisticated cyber thugs are getting and what security breaches can entail.The Morris Worm was the very first ever recorded mass cyberattack. Written by Robert Tappan Morris, at the time an academic at the graduate level, the worm infects computers at a rapid pace across the net and infects around 6,000 computers. Estimated loss resulting from this worm is anywhere from $10 million to $100 million, giving rise to the added concern about systems that are vulnerable on the net.One of these 15-year-old Canadian hackers, MafiaBoy, in 2000 launched a DDoS attack on busy websites such as Amazon, CNN, eBay, and Yahoo!. The attack harvested around $1.7 billion worth of losses. The attack highlighted just how simple it is even for novice hackers to make significant disruption using the international internet network.Google's servers were hacked by the hackers in 2009 to access Chinese human rights activists' e-mails. The hacking was believed to have been carried out by China's government, and thus Google shifted its servers to Hong Kong in 2010 as part of its battle against censorship and surveillance.Jonathan James, a computer hacker at age 15, infiltrated the U.S. Department of Defense computers and stole sensitive data, including NASA software worth $1.7 million. The breach resulted in damages of $41,000 and demonstrated that even the most secure government networks could be compromised.The Stuxnet worm was an enormously advanced cyberweapon that attacked the nuclear enrichment facilities of Iran. It dismantled almost 1,000 nuclear centrifuges, slowing down Iran's nuclear ambitions. It is believed widely to have been an American Israeli joint effort, the first use of a cyberattack causing physical damage.Cyberattacks do not only affect operational and technical aspects, but they also lead to humongous economic loss. For example, the Melissa Virus was a cost of $1.1 billion in damages worldwide. Furthermore, data breaches, such as when Albert Gonzalez hacked millions of credit card numbers in 2009, were part of one of the biggest history-making credit card scams.Cyberattacks just keep on rolling, and there are new cyberattacks daily. Some of the most famous recent cyberattacks include:U.S. Treasury Department networks were attacked in December 2024 by a state-sponsored Chinese attacker, who penetrated employee desktops and sensitive data. The incident was ranked as a high event, which illustrated the threat level of state-sponsored cyber tapping and its impact on national security.North Korean cyberthieves hacked into a cryptocurrency exchange and stole $1.5 billion worth of digital currency in the largest cyberattack on record in 2025. This hack illustrates the growing necessity of safeguarding digital assets as attacks mount from highly funded and highly advanced cybercrime.","A cyberattack refers to a deliberate and malicious effort to steal data from a computer system, network, or device.

Google’s Gemini chatbot gets improved image-creation tools: Here’s what is new,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/googles-gemini-chatbot-gets-improved-image-creation-tools-heres-what-is-new/articleshow/120782220.cms,"Google has announced new enchantments to the image generation capabilities of its chatbot — Gemini. The company has revealed that the upgrades tools are being rolled out on May 1 and promise to offer a more control over the images produced using Google Gemini . “We’re rolling out the ability to easily modify both your AI creations and images you upload from your phone or computer. You can change the background, replace objects, add elements, and more. For example, you can upload a personal photo and prompt Gemini to generate an image of what you’d look like with different hair colours,” Google said in an official blog post.While details on the specifics of the upgrades are still emerging, Google has indicated that the enhancements will allow for more detailed prompts, resulting in more accurate and visually compelling image outputs. Users can likely expect greater control over aspects like artistic style, specific object details, and the overall composition of the generated images.The company has also revealed that Gemini has now got multi-step editing capability which means users can get richer, more contextual responses to their prompts with text and images integrated.“Consistent with all AI-generated images with Gemini, images created or edited with native image generation will include the invisible SynthID digital watermark. We're also currently experimenting with adding a visible watermark on all images generated by Gemini. Native image editing in Gemini will start rolling out gradually today, expanding to more people in over 45 languages and most countries in the coming weeks,” added the company.The rollout will likely occur in phases, with users gaining access to the new features progressively. Google is expected to provide more comprehensive documentation and examples of the upgraded capabilities in the coming days.",Google has announced upgrades to the image generation capabilities of its chatbot — Gemini.

"Microsoft's top lawyer's commitment to Europe: If required, will take the US government to court but will not ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-top-lawyers-commitment-to-europe-if-required-will-take-the-us-government-to-court-but-will-not-/articleshow/120776389.cms,"“We as a company need to be a source of digital stability during a period of geopolitical volatility.”

Microsoft's five “digital commitments” to Europe



“I think that there are a number of leaders in governments in Europe that have been jarred when the US administration suspended intelligence and military support to Ukraine. And so they asked themselves about how they’re getting their defence and security protection more broadly. And I think it’s therefore important for us to make clear that Europe can count on us, including in the cybersecurity space,”

Microsoft’s top legal officer has pledged to sue the US government if necessary to safeguard European customers’ access to its services, a report claims. Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith , who is the company’s vice-chair and top lawyer, reportedly made this comment after European leaders raised concerns when President Trump temporarily suspended military and intelligence support to Ukraine, prompting Microsoft to offer new “continuity of access” assurances. As per the report, the remarks come as Europe questions the U.S. president’s commitment to the transatlantic security alliance and whether American technology could be restricted as part of broader negotiations with the bloc.In a statement to The Financial Times, Smith said:As per the FT report, Microsoft has outlined five “digital commitments” to Europe, including contesting any US government order to halt cloud services to European customers “through the courts.”The report cited Smith as claiming that the company will establish a European board of directors to oversee its cloud service and operate under European law. To strengthen its presence, Microsoft is also reportedly planning to increase its European data-centre capacity by 40% over the next two years across 16 countries and spend “tens of billions of dollars” annually on these facilities.These steps mark the first time a major US tech firm has sought to reassure European customers amid trade tensions and calls for greater tech sovereignty. Concerns have grown that the US government, under Trump, may “suspend or block the operations of American tech companies in Europe,” particularly after his temporary halt of military aid to Ukraine.Smith noted.The report also claims that Microsoft will build into its contracts a legal guarantee to challenge any non-European government order that could interrupt its cloud services in Europe. Smith noted that while he must consider potential US pushback, Microsoft has “a long track record of going to court against multiple administrations.”Given that Europe accounts for over a quarter of its revenue, Smith said maintaining trust with European governments is “indispensable.”","Microsoft's top legal officer has pledged to sue the US government if necessary to safeguard European customers’ access to its services, a report claims.

"China is ..., says Nvidia CEO on the Big Question: Is China ahead of America in AI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-is-says-nvidia-ceo-on-the-big-question-is-china-ahead-of-america-in-ai/articleshow/120776203.cms,"What Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said about Trump tariffs



“We need to accelerate the diffusion of American AI technology around the world. The policies and encouragement from the administration really need to support that.”

“I’m not sure what the new diffusion rule is going to be, but whatever it turns out to be, it really has to recognise that the world has changed fundamentally since the previous diffusion rule was released,”

“China is not behind. Are they ahead of us? China is right behind us. We’re very, very close,”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has urged the US government to loosen export controls on artificial-intelligence (AI) technology. He claims that this change can help American companies fully capitalise on global opportunities. Currently, Nvidia’s most advanced AI training chips are barred from sale in China under restrictions imposed by the US President Donald Trump , a limitation Huang says hampers US businesses’ ability to compete and collaborate abroad. Earlier, the previous Biden administration had built upon these rules with a three-tier “AI diffusion” policy, further classifying where and how US AI technology can be exported. Huang’s latest comments came during an episode of “The Big Question: Is China ahead of America in AI,” where he argued that revising these regulations is critical for maintaining American leadership in the field.In a brief meeting with the media (as reported by Bloomberg), Huang said:Huang said.he continued.Apart from this, he also warned that China is emerging as a formidable technology rival, pointing to Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant now developing its own AI chips, as a prime example.","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has urged the US government to loosen export controls on artificial-intelligence (AI) technology.

IBM and Rayethon in Donald Trump's list of 5 companies that can do the work to modernise US air traffic control system,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ibm-and-rayethon-in-donald-trumps-list-of-5-companies-that-can-do-the-work-to-modernise-us-air-traffic-control-system/articleshow/120775670.cms,"What Donald Trump said about modernising the US air traffic control system



“We have very obsolete equipment for air traffic control. We want to put a brand new air traffic control system in,”

US President Donald Trump has named IBM and Raytheon Technologies among the five firms under consideration for modernising the US air traffic control system, a report claims. The push to upgrade the country’s ageing control infrastructure intensified after a mid-air collision in January near Washington Reagan National Airport. In this crash, a US Army helicopter and an American Airlines jet collided, killing all 67 people aboard. Meanwhile, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee are also reportedly considering a $12.5 billion proposal, spread through 2029, to replace control towers, radar systems, and telecommunications networks, plus an additional $1 billion in funding for hiring new air traffic controllers.According to a report by the news agency Reuters, during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump listed five companies that could do the work.Trump said.Last month, US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to request tens of billions of dollars from Congress for a multi-year overhaul of the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) air traffic control infrastructure and a significant increase in hiring. Earlier, he had even slammed Verizon for “not moving fast enough” under its $2.4 billion, 15-year telecom contract with the FAA.In March, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s Starlink unit denied that it sought to take over Verizon’s FAA contract. Meanwhile, Verizon said that it is collaborating with the FAA to develop solutions for a more advanced and safer national air traffic control system.The US Government Accountability Office has also warned that one-third of the FAA’s air traffic control systems are “unsustainable,” with 25% of facilities over 50 years old.Ageing equipment has caused repeated delays, including a major outage at Newark Liberty International, and chronic staffing shortages.The report claims that the FAA is roughly 3,500 controllers below its target, forcing many existing controllers into mandatory overtime and six-day workweeks.",US President Donald Trump has named IBM and Raytheon Technologies among the five firms under consideration for modernising the US air traffic control system.

Walmart Closing Stores: Walmart dismisses reports claiming closure of 11 stores,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-dismisses-reports-claiming-closure-of-11-stores/articleshow/120773287.cms,"Representative Image

What Walmart said about the reports claiming store closure



“There are no current plans to close any stores in 2025. The erroneous claim originated from a late March US Mirror story, and that article was updated following our call to the editors for a correction. Unfortunately, other outlets have incorrectly reported the store closures without checking with our team, leading us to seek corrections from them as well.”

Walmart has confirmed it will not be closing any stores in 2025. The clarification comes from the US-based retailer after recent contradicting reports claimed that the company is planning to shut down at least 11 stores across multiple locations in the country. As per the rumours, Walmart was planning to close stores in Georgia, Maryland, Ohio, Wisconsin, Colorado, and California. The company later clarified that in reality, those 11 stores were shut down in 2024 as part of a broader network adjustment. In January 2024, Walmart US CEO John Furner explained that the closures coincided with a commitment to “build or convert 150 new stores over the next several years,” an effort already underway with openings in Charlotte, North Carolina; Santa Rosa Beach, Florida; and Atlanta, Georgia.The clarification comes after the retailer unveiled its first new Supercenter in over four years in the Houston area and has additional Supercenters planned for California, Utah, Alabama, and Florida in 2025.In a statement to Fast Company, a Walmart spokesperson said:According to a report by USA Today, Walmart is remodeling 650 existing stores as part of its investment in “stores of the future,” featuring wider aisles, larger and more “bolder” signage and displays, along with enhanced online delivery and pickup capabilities to handle digital orders.The US-based retail major also plans to open or renovate over 45 fuel stations in the country this year, extending its network of more than 400 locations across 34 states.Walmart is also expected to release its fiscal first-quarter 2026 earnings next month, ahead of the stock market open on May 15.","Walmart has confirmed it will not be closing any stores in 2025.

Mark Zuckkerberg’s wife Priscilla Chan-funded free Silicon Valley School to shut down next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/trump-effect-mark-zuckerberg-funded-silicon-valley-school-to-shut-down-next-year-read-what-the-note-on-the-schools-website-says/articleshow/120497475.cms,"What the note on the school's website says

Mark Zuckerberg's Education Ventures

The Primary School , a no-cost private institution in the Bay Area co-founded by Priscilla Chan , wife of Facebook parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , will reportedly cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students. First reported by Bloomberg, the impending closure was disclosed in a statement posted on the school's website recently. In a move aimed at preserving its legacy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the billionaire couple's philanthropic arm, has committed $50 million to invest in the communities the school serves -— specifically East Palo Alto, Belle Haven, and the East Bay region near San Francisco -- over the subsequent few years.""This was a very difficult decision, and we are committed to ensuring a thoughtful and supportive transition for students and families over the next year,"" the online statement conveyed. Carson Cook, a spokesperson for The Primary School, stated there would be no further comment beyond the official announcement.Pediatrician Priscilla Chan, 40, co-established The Primary School in 2016, implementing an ""integrated health and education model"" designed to support families and children from birth through high school, according to the organization's tax filings. The school's inaugural middle school cohort commenced in 2023.The most recent tax documentation indicates that over 95% of The Primary School's students in East Palo Alto identify as under-represented minorities. The filing also revealed the nonprofit held assets exceeding $30 million as of the end of June 2023.The Primary School is among several educational endeavors recently initiated by prominent billionaires. Elon Musk , Jeff Bezos, and Larry Ellison have all established schools in recent years. Musk's nonprofit, the Musk Foundation, has contributed $237 million to his technology-focused primary and secondary school in Austin, named Ad Astra, with future aspirations for a university. Ad Astra collaborates with the same entity that assisted Ellison in establishing his Hala Kahiki Montessori school in Lanai, Hawaii, an island largely owned by the Oracle co-founder. Amazon.com founder Bezos has created a network of Montessori-inspired preschools catering to children in underserved communities.The closure of The Primary School coincides with significant strategic shifts within Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms Inc. as the 40-year-old founder appears to be aligning his business interests more closely with the Trump administration. Recent appointments to Meta's board include longtime Trump allies Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, and Dina Powell McCormick, who served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser during his first term.Furthermore, Zuckerberg has appointed a Republican strategist as chief of global affairs, eliminated Meta’s US fact-checking program, rolled back the company’s hate-speech policies, and discontinued key diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at both Meta and CZI.

The REAL ID Act was enacted by Congress in 2005 in response to security concerns following the September 11 attacks. It requires the establishment of minimum security standards for the issuance of state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards. Beginning May 7, 2025, US residents aged 18 and older will be required to present a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or state ID, or another acceptable form of identification, to board federally regulated domestic flights or gain access to certain federal facilities.Although originally set to take effect earlier, the enforcement deadline was postponed multiple times to allow states and residents more time to comply. As the deadline approaches, it is crucial to understand what REAL ID is, how to check if your ID is compliant, and how to apply for one, including eligibility for online application.Not all states allow REAL ID applications online. Many require an in-person visit for the initial issuance due to document verification requirements. However, some states permit online upgrades if:Check your state DMV or licensing agency website to confirm if online application or renewal is available.To apply for a REAL ID, you must provide original or certified copies of the following:Some states may have additional documentation requirements, so consult your local DMV for specifics.The REAL ID Act was a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, intended to enhance security by making it harder to forge state-issued identification. It mandates that states verify specific documentation and use secure card production and issuance practices before issuing IDs.After May 7, 2025, a REAL ID or an acceptable alternative will be required for the following purposes:It’s important to note that a REAL ID is not required for voting, driving, banking, or applying for federal benefits such as Social Security.Yes. Beginning May 7, 2025, you must present a REAL ID-compliant license or an approved alternative identification to pass through TSA security checkpoints at US airports for domestic flights.If you do not have a REAL ID, you may use one of the following acceptable alternatives to board domestic flights or access secure federal facilities:A REAL ID-compliant card has a star in the upper-right corner. If your card lacks this star, it is not compliant and will not be accepted for REAL ID purposes. However, Enhanced Driver’s Licenses (EDLs)—issued by a few states—are acceptable even without the star marking, as they comply with federal security requirements.Only five states currently issue EDLs:EDLs are REAL ID-compliant and also allow land and sea border crossings between the US and Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative.Yes. States continue to offer non-REAL ID-compliant cards, often labeled “Not for Federal Identification.” These can still be used for driving and other non-federal purposes but will not be accepted for air travel or entry into certain federal buildings after May 7, 2025.The final enforcement date is May 7, 2025. After this date, only REAL ID-compliant cards or approved alternatives will be accepted for TSA screening and federal facility access. Starting May 7, 2025, TSA and other federal agencies will only accept IDs that meet REAL ID security standards. Travelers presenting non-compliant IDs will be denied access to domestic flights and certain government buildings unless they provide an acceptable alternative.Yes. As of now, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and US territories including Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands are compliant and issuing REAL ID cards.No. A REAL ID cannot be used for international land, air, or sea travel. A US passport is still required for:No. REAL IDs are not valid for international cruise departures. Cruise travelers must carry a valid passport or passport card for identification.Yes, but only for international travel. If traveling within the US, you need either a REAL ID-compliant license or an acceptable alternative—not both. However, a passport remains mandatory for traveling abroad.Yes. Enhanced Driver’s Licenses (EDLs) issued by the five eligible states (MI, MN, NY, VT, WA) are considered acceptable for all REAL ID purposes, including air travel, accessing federal facilities, and entering nuclear power plants—even though they may not bear the star marking.As of December 17, 2018, states are permitted to issue REAL ID-compliant cards to citizens of the Freely Associated States (FAS), which include:To qualify, FAS citizens must be lawfully admitted under the Compact of Free Association and meet all identity and residency requirements set forth by the REAL ID Act.","The REAL ID Act was enacted by Congress in 2005 in response to security concerns following the September 11 attacks. Beginning May 7, 2025, US residents aged 18 and older will be required to present a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or state ID, or another acceptable form of identification.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120727235,imgsize-18908,width-400,resizemode-4/REAL-ID.jpg"

European research funders halt collaborations with China over data protection concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/european-research-funders-halt-collaborations-with-china-over-data-protection-concerns/articleshow/120607781.cms,"The impact of China’s data security law

Implications for global research

Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law, which restricts the sharing of “important data” with overseas partners without approval. The suspension impacts joint research in fields like health and environmental studies , raising questions about the future of international scientific cooperation .Implemented in 2021, China’s Data Security Law broadly defines “important data” as information that could threaten national or economic interests or affect the rights of individuals or organisations. European agencies, including the German Research Foundation , Swedish Research Council, and Swiss National Science Foundation, have expressed concerns over the law’s vague provisions, which make it difficult to assess compliance and avoid legal liabilities.The law requires security clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China to export data classified as “important,” effectively making cross-border data sharing extremely challenging. This has led to the suspension of new co-funded projects with China’s National Natural Science Foundation.The halt in collaborations could delay progress in critical areas like pandemic response and air quality studies, where data sharing is essential. Experts warn that the restrictions may hinder the ability to address global health challenges effectively.Jan Palmowski, Secretary-General of the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities, emphasised the need for responsible and safe data sharing to tackle future pandemics and other health crises.","Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law.

Billions in European data center investment amid geopolitical concerns

Microsoft President Brad Smith affirmed the Redmond giant's commitment to European regulatory compliance, stating that ""even when we've lost cases in European courts, Microsoft has long respected and complied with European laws.""The remarks came during Smith's visit to Brussels as part of a broader charm offensive amid escalating trade tensions between the United States and European Union following President Donald Trump 's recent tariff threats.""We understand that European laws apply to our business practices in Europe, just as local laws apply to local practices in the United States and similar laws apply elsewhere in the world,"" Smith said in a comprehensive blog post outlining five digital commitments to Europe, including compliance with the Digital Markets Act .Smith's position appears to diverge from the White House's criticism of the EU's regulatory actions against US tech companies. Last week, the European Commission fined Apple €500 million and Meta €200 million for DMA breaches, triggering Trump's threat of retaliatory tariffs against what he called ""overseas extortion"" of American firms.""We're committed not only to building digital infrastructure for Europe, but to respecting the role that laws across Europe play in regulating our products and services,"" Smith emphasized.The Microsoft president announced plans to expand the company's European datacenter capacity by 40% over the next two years, with operations in 16 European countries. The company is investing tens of billions of dollars annually in expanding its datacenters across Europe, with plans that will ""more than double our European datacenter capacity between 2023 and 2027,"" resulting in ""cloud operations in more than 200 datacenters across the continent.""Addressing concerns about US tech dominance amid geopolitical uncertainty, Smith pledged that ""in the unlikely event we are ever ordered by any government anywhere in the world to suspend or cease cloud operations in Europe, we are committing that Microsoft will promptly and vigorously contest such a measure.""The tech giant also announced a new ""European Digital Resilience Commitment"" to be included in all contracts with European national governments and the European Commission, making this commitment legally binding.""We are at a moment in time when business needs to be a bridge across the Atlantic,"" Smith concluded, positioning Microsoft as a stabilizing force amid increasing US-EU tensions.",Microsoft President Brad Smith affirmed the Redmond giant's commitment to European regulatory compliance.

Changes to parole and protected status programs

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) said it has taken several steps in the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s second administration to tighten immigration controls, address system vulnerabilities, and restore what it called ""commonsense policies."" The agency also highlighted steps it has taken over the past days to strengthen national security by improving screening and vetting procedures, assisting enforcement agencies, and reducing the exploitation of humanitarian parole and temporary protected status programs.USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser said “In the first 100 days, USCIS put a stop to disastrous Biden-era ‘humanitarian’ policies that invited fraud and allowed criminal aliens to legally live and work in our communities.” He added “Aliens, immigration attorneys and non-government organizations take note: the days of exploiting our immigration system are over. Aliens who want to live and work in America need to do it legally or get out.”USCIS said it implemented the Alien Registration Requirement (ARR) to track the presence of foreign nationals, review criminal records, and maintain awareness of activities inside the U.S. Nearly 47,000 submissions have been made under this new requirement as of April 29, the agency said. The agency has also deployed around 450 volunteers to support ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations across 85 facilities. Since January 20, 2025, USCIS has helped facilitate 369 arrests at its field offices.In a joint effort with other agencies, USCIS said it played a critical role in taking down a large-scale marriage fraud scheme, leading to multiple indictments and arrests.USCIS announced the termination of broad humanitarian parole programs, including those for citizens from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. Approximately 531,000 individuals have been notified of the termination of their parole and work authorizations.In addition, USCIS ended the previous administration’s extensions of Temporary Protected Status for Haiti and Venezuela, aiming to curb what it described as the abuse of humanitarian relief pathways.The agency reported completing 7,120 benefit fraud records and identifying fraud in over 4,600 cases. More than 2,200 site visits to workplaces were conducted, and social media activity of 3,568 subjects was screened.USCIS said it has incorporated social media vetting focused on identifying anti-American and antisemitic sentiments, considering such findings as negative factors in immigration benefit assessments.",U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) said it has taken several steps in the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s second administration to tighten immigration controls.

Thank you for your ongoing support of, and continued interest in, Alphabet.

A new filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission revealed that Google paid $8.27 million for CEO Sundar Pichai’s personal security in 2024. The figure is up almost 22% from $6.78 million in 2023. The increase reportedly came as Pichai travelled extensively in 2024. In a proxy statement with the securities exchange, the company said “In 2024, Sundar’s security arrangements included residential security and consultation fees, security monitoring services, car and driver services, and personal security during all travel.”“We believe these arrangements and costs are reasonable, appropriate, necessary and in the best interests of Alphabet and its stockholders, as they mitigate risks to our business,” it further added. In the document, the company says that “we do not consider these additional security arrangements to be a personal benefit to Sundar because they arise from the nature of his employment responsibilities.”As per the proxy statement, Pichai’s total compensation in 2024 was $10.73 million, including the stock awards. It is up from $8.8 million in the previous year.Google is scheduled to hold its annual meeting of stockholders on June 6, 2025.

Apple-Google partnership







Apple is said to be working on its new AI server chips. According to popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple’s own AI server chips are said to enter the mass production phase in the second half of 2026. Kuo also highlighted that the company is also planning to start building and operating its own data centres in 2027. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Kuo wrote, “Apple’s self-developed AI server chips are expected to enter mass production in 2H26, and its own data centers are expected to begin construction and operation in 2027, which may indicate that Apple anticipates significant growth in on-device AI demand starting in 2027.”For long Apple has relied on its own in-house silicon team to differentiate its products. From the A-series Chips in iPhones to the M-series processors in Macs, Apple’s the custom designs created by the company have consistently delivered performance and efficiency gains. Recently, the tech giant also shipped its own cellular modems (C1 and CX) and wireless connectivity chips (N1). The move into AI server-class chips is seen as a natural extension of this strategy, giving Apple tighter control over the infrastructure powering its AI services.- 2026: Mass production of Apple’s AI server chips begins.- 2027: Apple’s new data centers expected to go online, scaling AI workloads.- Short term: Chips may be deployed in existing data centers on a smaller scale before full rolloutApart from this, Kuo also shared his thoughts on the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google. he iPhone maker confirmed it's teaming up with Google to use Gemini models as the foundation for a smarter, more capable Siri arriving later this year. ""After careful evaluation, we determined that Google's technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,"" Apple said in a joint statement with Google.Talking about the partnerships Kuo wrote, “Two short-term challenges in Apple developing its own AI, which force Apple to collaborate with Google:(1) This year’s WWDC AI demonstration cannot afford to fail again.(2) User expectations for AI service quality have risen with the development of cloud AI. Even if Apple fulfills its past promises regarding Apple Intelligence and Siri, it now seems insufficient, so stronger on-device AI models are needed.”",Apple's own AI server chips are said to enter the mass production phase in the second half of 2026.

China to technology companies: You can only buy Nvidia H200 AI chips if ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-to-technology-companies-you-can-only-buy-nvidia-h200-ai-chips-if-/articleshow/126515662.cms,"Yes and No on Nvidia chips continues





No, China is not listening to CEO Jensen Huang on Nvidia chips. The Chinese government reportedly has set strict conditions for technology companies wanting to use Nvidia's H200 AI chips. According to a report in The Information, the Chinese government has told some tech companies that it would only approve their purchases of Nvidia's H200 AI chips under special circumstances. These include for university research. The report claims to cite two people with direct knowledge of the situation. China's government issued a ""deliberately vague"" directive, the report said, telling some technology companies to buy chips only when ""necessary"" but was unclear as to what that means.The move, as the report says, signals that China remains cautious about fully reopening the Chinese market to American chip giant Nvidia. The report further said that the Chinese government reportedly plans to hold additional meetings with more companies to deliver the purchase directive, though it is unclear whether those sessions will include any new guidance.The report comes on heels of another report that claimed that China has asked some companies to halt their orders for the H200 chips, as it looks to prioritize domestic companies in its race to dominate AI vs America.A report in Reuters also claimed recently that Nvidia has set strict advance payment requirements for Chinese companies buying H200 AI chips, including a full payment upfront. The company is reported to be particularly strict in enforcing conditions given the lack of clarity on whether Chinese regulators would greenlight the shipments. However, in a statement Nvidia denied the same. The US chipmaker said that it does not require upfront payment for H200 chips. The company said it ""would never require customers to pay for products they do not receive"".Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently claimed huge orders for the company's H200 chips from China. Chinese technology companies reportedly have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips that are priced at around $27,000 each. As per reports, the number exceeded Nvidia's inventory of 700,000 of the chips. While Chinese chipmakers like Huawei have developed AI processors including the Ascend 910C, their performance still lags behind Nvidia's H200 for large-scale training of advanced AI models.","Chinese government reportedly set strict conditions for technology companies wanting to use Nvidia's H200 AI chips.

"Quote of the day by Jensen Huang: “I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-jensen-huang-i-very-seldom-fire-people-id-rather-torture-them-to-greatness/articleshow/126489810.cms,"NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang

“I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness.”

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's leadership philosophy on firing and performance



How NVIDIA’s work culture reflects Jensen Huang’s management style



Why Jensen Huang believes discomfort leads to growth



How employees and observers interpret the quote



What Jensen Huang’s quote really says about leadership







When NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang talks about leadership, he doesn’t reach for the usual corporate language. One of his more striking lines is,It sounds odd at first. A boss talking about “torture” rarely lands in polite conversation. But the meaning becomes clearer when you look at how Huang explains what he actually does with his teams. He doesn’t mean cruelty. He means pushing people to grow, learn, and reach a point they might not reach on their own. It’s a style of leadership rooted in belief rather than abandonment. Huang has said he prefers to help people improve instead of simply letting them go when things get tough. He frames this as a belief in potential, a view grounded in his own journey from humble beginnings to the helm of a global tech giant.This quote taps into a broader discussion happening in workplaces today about talent, resilience, and how leaders cultivate performance. Huang’s words are often described as tongue in cheek, yet they point to a real approach many executives wrestle with: should you cut losses and fire someone who’s struggling, or invest time and effort in helping them rise? In Huang’s view, that investment can pay off in unexpected ways.Huang has repeatedly said that firing is not his first instinct. He sees it as a last step, not an early one. In interviews, he has explained that when someone is underperforming, the more important question is why. Is the role wrong? Is the support missing? Is the feedback unclear? His response is usually to lean in, not step away.That approach has shaped NVIDIA’s internal culture. Expectations are high. Feedback is direct. People are expected to learn fast and adapt. Huang believes that struggling inside a demanding environment often teaches more than being comfortable in an easier one. His quote about “torture” reflects that belief. It is about sustained challenge, not humiliation or fear.He has also said that if he hires someone, it means he already believes in their potential. Walking away from that too easily would mean questioning his own judgment. So instead, he stays engaged and pushes for improvement.NVIDIA is widely known as a demanding place to work. Employees have described long hours, intense deadlines, and constant pressure to deliver. At the same time, many stay for years. Compensation, stock rewards, and the chance to work on cutting-edge technology all play a role.Huang’s leadership style is closely tied to that environment. He has said that meaningful work is rarely easy. Progress, especially in advanced computing and artificial intelligence, comes from sustained effort and repeated failure. Teams are expected to confront problems directly, not avoid them.This is where the quote often gets misunderstood. Huang is not celebrating burnout. He is describing a belief that growth happens under pressure, and that leaders should help people through that pressure instead of replacing them at the first sign of difficulty.Huang has spoken openly about discomfort being a teacher. He believes that moments of frustration often come right before breakthroughs. If leaders remove pressure too soon, they may also remove the chance for real learning.In his view, coaching is not about being gentle all the time. It is about being honest. That can mean telling someone their work is not good enough, then staying with them while they fix it. It can mean repeating feedback until it finally lands. That process is hard. For both sides.The phrase “torture them to greatness” sticks because it captures that tension. Growth is rarely smooth. It usually involves moments when quitting feels easier. Huang believes leaders should not make quitting the default option.Reactions to Huang’s words are mixed. Some admire the clarity. Others question whether this level of pressure works for everyone. That debate is common in tech, especially in companies growing as fast as NVIDIA has in recent years.What is clear is that Huang’s quote reflects how he actually operates. NVIDIA’s rise as a dominant force in AI and computing did not happen through cautious leadership. It came from aggressive goals, constant iteration, and teams pushed to deliver more than they thought possible.At its core, this quote is not about suffering. It is about commitment. Huang is saying that he would rather invest time, energy, and effort into developing people than discard them quickly. That choice comes with pressure, discomfort, and high expectations. But it also comes with trust.Not every leader works this way. Not every workplace should. But in Huang’s case, the words align closely with the results and the culture he has built. The quote stands out because it is unpolished, honest, and a little unsettling. Which is often how real leadership conversations sound when they are not filtered for comfort.","Jensen Huang, CEO of tech giant NVIDIA, said he would rather torture people than fire them.

Billionaire Mark Cuban has a ‘success tip’ for students





American billionaire investor Mark Cuban has now issued a stark warning for business leaders about the risks and opportunities of artificial intelligence. Along with this, Cuban has also cautioned that while AI can transform companies, its careless use could expose valuable intellectual property. Speaking during a call with Clipbook founder Adam Joseph, Cuban said that the growth of AI will lead to the creation of “two types of companies: those who are great at AI, and everybody else.” He believed that the companies failing to embrace AI are “doomed to failure” as the technology reshapes industries.Cuban further described AI as ‘stupid’ but likened it to a savant which ‘remembers everything’. He also emphasised that while AI tools can deliver immense benefits, but they are also prone to errors and overconfidence, making it critical for executives to understand the nuances between different platforms rather than trading them as interchangeable.As per Cuban, the misuse of AI could turn a powerful tool into a costly distraction. He also warned the CEOs against indiscriminately sharing proprietary work online, noting that web-scraping chatbots could inadvertently absorb and lead sensitive data. Protecting intellectual property, he said, must be a top priority in the AI era.Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations. He pointed out that businesses often underestimate the potential risk of falling behind.Along with this, he also urged the leaders to adopt AI strategically and combine technological foresight with strong governance and data protection.Recently, Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions”. However, he said that students should not rely much on AI. Instead, they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results,” he said adding “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”.In an interview with CNBC’s Make It last year, Cuban said that tomorrow’s leaders might be today’s AI-obsessed kids. “Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that’s needed in the future workplace,” he said adding: “Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.”",Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations.

How Google founders 'dumping' California 'looks similar' to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos leaving the city he called 'his home' for 30 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-founders-dumping-california-looks-similar-to-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-leaving-the-city-he-called-his-home-for-30-years/articleshow/126498943.cms,"Jeff Bezos often points out that long-term success comes from staying committed to an idea while remaining open to changing the approach.

When Jeff Bezos left Seattle

What is California’s Billionaire's tax





It's almost official that Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have cut ties with California. The two Google Guys have reportedly said Bye to California; joining the billionaires who have left the state, shifting businesses and houses. Page is worth around $270 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. According to a report in Wall Street Journal, Larry Page has bought two massive Miami estates for a combined $173.4 million. The report quotes people familiar with the situation Google co-founder Sergey Brin is also said to be in discussions to purchase a Miami home, according to people familiar with the situation.Some analysts have termed Google founders' move to leave California strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos ’ relocation playbook. According to them, the timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look quite like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But the big difference here is that Jeff Bezos did not leave California. Amazon founder left Seattle, the city where he started the online bookseller that grew into the global tech giant, Amazon.In 2024, Bezos announced on Instagram that he was leaving Seattle after nearly 30 years to move to Miami. He said that the move was to be closer to his parents and his rocket launches at Blue Origin. In his Instagram post, Bezos called Seattle his home since 1994.However, the timing, as some analysts pointed out, also suggested another reason: Taxes. In 2022 Washington state imposed a new, 7% capital gains tax on sales of stocks or bonds of more than $250,000. As Washington state does not have a personal income tax, so the new levy marked the first time that Bezos would face state taxes on his stock sales. As reported by CNBC, in 2022, when the Washington state's Capital gains tax took effect, Bezos stopped selling. He didn’t sell any Amazon stock in 2022 or 2023, gifting only $200 million of shares at the end of that year.After his move to Miami, Bezos reportedly made up for lost time. Quoting an SEC filing, the report says that Bezos launched a pre-scheduled stock-selling plan to unload 50 million shares before January 31, 2025. And since Florida has no state income tax or a tax on capital gains, so on the $2 billion sale that Bezos made, he saved $140 million that he would have paid to Washington state. On the entire sale of 50 million shares over the next year, he saved more than at least 600 million.California’s proposed ballot initiative has been proposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West to offset federal budget cuts that will affect California’s health care system. It would impose a one-time, 5% tax on the assets of billionaires. The tax would retroactively apply to those who were California residents as of January 1, 2026. In December 2025, venture capitalist Peter Thiel announced that he opened an office for his family investment company in Miami. Donald Trump's AI czar David Sacks unveiled a new office for his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in Austin, Texas.","Larry Page has bought two massive Miami estates for a combined $173.4 million.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024.

Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X.In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

What the report said on Nvidia’s conditions for H200 chips





Nvidia has denied a report which claimed that the American chipmaker has imposed certain payment terms on Chinese customers for its advanced H200 AI chips. The report, published by the news agency Reuters, suggested that Nvidia was demanding these “upfront payments” to protect itself from uncertainty on H200 chip sales in China. However, Nvidia says this is not true, stating that it does not ask any of its customers to pay for products they haven't received.An Nvidia spokesperson issued a statement on Tuesday, stating, ""We do not require upfront payment and would never require customers to pay for products that they do not receive."" The chips in question are the Nvidia H200. Reuters claimed that Nvidia's standard terms for Chinese clients have previously included advance payment requirements, however, they were sometimes allowed to place a deposit rather than make a full payment upfront.Previously, Reuters claimed that Nvidia has set stringent terms for Chinese technology companies seeking the H200 processor, which is a critical hardware for training large-scale AI models. These sources claimed that Nvidia is requiring full upfront payment in cash, no options for cancellations or refunds and no changes to configurations after placement.The report claimed that Chinese technology companies have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips that are priced at around $27,000 each.This has vastly exceeded Nvidia’s current inventory of 7,00,000 units.Chinese chipmakers like Huawei have developed AI processors including the Ascend 910C, however, their performance still lags behind Nvidia's H200 for large-scale training of advanced AI models.According to a report by Bloomberg, China plans to approve some H200 imports as soon as this quarter and are said to be preparing to allow purchases for select commercial uses, while barring the military, sensitive government agencies, critical infrastructure and state-owned enterprises due to security concerns.","N Nvidia has denied a report which claimed that the American chipmaker has imposed certain payment terms on Chinese customers for its advanced H200 AI chips.

What four cofounders of Torch said on OpenAI acquisition

Everyone deserves the best answers modern medicine can give them. And yet, we’ve all had people close to our hearts who didn't get the answers they needed about their health.

We have more data about our bodies than ever before, but it’s never been harder to bring it all together. Patients see only a fraction of their own records, while clinicians have too little time to parse the growing stream of data patients bring in from wearables and consumer health companies.

AI is the most important new tool we’ve had in decades for turning that chaos into clarity. But AI can’t help you if your health data is scattered across four hospitals, two labs, seven apps, and three web portals.

We started Torch to build a medical memory for AI, unifying scattered records into a context engine that helps you see the full picture, connect the dots, and make sure nothing important gets lost in the noise again.

Now, we’re joining OpenAI to realize that vision at a bigger scale than we could have ever achieved on our own.

We hope it helps someone you love someday.

Omar Sultan Al Olama, the UAE Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Economy, has shared a very important, timely, and insightful message regarding the future of work, skills, and the relevance of the human being in the age of artificial intelligence. In a podcast interview hosted by entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath, Minister Al Olama was very categorical about how humans will become endangered if they focus only on being very good at one thing. With the rise of artificial intelligence systems being able to perform even better than humans in a particular field, the need for flexibility, continuous learning, general knowledge, and cross-disciplinary intellect has become the most important factor for survival.The core worry of Al Olama is about the vulnerability of human beings when they rely only on a single skill set or area. The AI system has the innate ability to perform even the simplest of tasks that human beings do, and the tasks may be repetitive or analytical in nature. “AI is going to beat us to the target… if you have to be hyper-specialised, AI can do that better than us,” he added. The Minister’s noteworthy comment symbolically portrays the reality of the job market, which says that as technology improves, the job of a hyper-specialist may be made redundant with the advent of the AI-driven economy.To this threat, Al Olama implored humans to develop broad intelligence, not just deep and narrow knowledge. He illustrated that the “only way you can stand a chance is if you have the breadth of knowledge.” Such skills in many areas and creating linkages between knowledge in different ways allow humans to complement, rather than compete with, AI. Broad intelligence involves critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving across contexts, and the ability to synthesise information from different fields. All in all, it's about the human ability to handle complexity, something AI is still quite incapable of fully emulating.One of the most thought-provoking elements of the message that Al Olama delivered is related to the famous saying, “a jack of all trades is a master of none.” However, the minister did not just stop at the beginning of the saying. He also emphasized the end, which goes like this, “But most times better than a master of one.” This is because in a world dominated by AI, people who focus their skills in various areas would be the ones who would be able to survive in any situation.Al Olama also touched on a broader societal precept: technology is supposed to serve humanity, not dominate it. He emphasised how artificial intelligence must always come second to human priorities. ""AI has to always be the second priority,"" he emphasised, adding that innovation should not come at the expense of the most basic human needs. This represents the broad perception in international technology governance that rapid AI deployment will not be used as an excuse to weaken ethical consideration, social well-being, and economic equity. There is growing unease among policymakers, businesses, and citizens alike about how technological progress balances with human-centric values.The implications of the minister’s speech on educational and labour policy cannot be underestimated. The classic paradigm of education has tended towards deep specialization on particular subject matters or occupations. Such education might lead to expert physicists or historians, say, being prepared by universities, but instead might render their students poorly equipped for dealing with an environment in which all sorts of simple, routine, or technological operations are performed by computers and other types of automated systems. Al Olama’s comments highlight the importance of interdisciplinary education and learning, as well as developing creativity on top of critical thinking skills.","Omar Sultan Al Olama, the UAE Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Economy, has shared a very important, timely, and insightful message regarding the future of work, skills, and the relevance of the human being in the age of artificial intelligence.

Anthropic has unveiled Cowork, its new feature designed with an aim to transform its AI assistant from a conversational chatbot into an active participant in desktop workflows. The company has annou nced that the tool is available as a research preview for Claude Max subscribers on macOS.“In Cowork, you give Claude access to a folder of your choosing on your computer. Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder. It can, for example, re-organize your downloads by sorting and renaming each file, create a new spreadsheet with a list of expenses from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft of a report from your scattered notes,” the company said in an announcement.The company says that the latest tool is built on the same foundation as ""Claude Code,"" Anthropic's developer-focused coding agent for general administrative tasks. Cowork is said to offer same capabilities but to non-developers.“In Cowork, Claude completes work like this with much more agency than you’d see in a regular conversation. Once you’ve set it a task, Claude will make a plan and steadily complete it, while looping you in on what it’s up to.If you’ve used Claude Code, this will feel familiar—Cowork is built on the very same foundations. This means Cowork can take on many of the same tasks that Claude Code can handle, but in a more approachable form for non-coding tasks,” it added.The primary differentiator between Cowork and the standard Claude interface back-and-forth conversation within a browser window. Unlike Claude’s regular interface, Cowork is granted access to specific local folders on the user's computer. Once authorised, the AI can read, edit and create files directly.“Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible. You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format. Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel. It feels much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker,” Anthropic explained.The company also pointed out that Claude will also ask before taking any significant actions, so users can steer or course-correct as per their needs.","Anthropic has unveiled Cowork, its new feature designed with an aim to transform its AI assistant from a conversational chatbot into an active participant in desktop workflows.

“For most Americans, their 401(k) represents a lifeline to retirement security rather than a playground for financial risk. Allowing crypto into American retirement accounts creates fertile ground for workers and families to lose big.

Given the threats from crypto’s volatility, the market’s lack of transparency, and potential conflicts of interest, I am concerned that the Trump Administration’s decision to allow these risky assets to be part of such critical retirement investments threatens millions of Americans’ retirement security.

”

“crypto assets have uniquely high volatility” and “there is no standard approach for projecting the potential future returns of crypto assets.”

""seems like a scam.""

“There is no reason to expect that inviting plans to offer these alternative investments will lead to better outcomes overall for participants — especially considering the higher fees and expenses that typically come with them. But there is ample reason to think these investment options will make things worse by increasing the risk of large losses for participants, most of whom can ill afford them,”

Elizabeth Warren wants SEC to answer questions about reducing crypto risks

In requiring publicly traded companies that hold, issue, or invest in cryptocurrencies to provide disclosures on crypto asset liquidity, impairment risks, and market volatility, has the SEC ensured that the valuations reflected in disclosures are fair market value given the volatility crypto securities often experience?

Has the SEC’s Division of Risk and Analysis assessed the use of manipulative or deceptive practices in crypto markets? If not, does it plan to publish research for retail investor awareness?

What investor awareness does SEC Office of Investor Education and Assistance provide for retail investors that may purchase crypto assets traditionally or through retirement plans following the Trump Administration’s recent executive order?





US Senator Elizabeth Warren is concerned about President Donald Trump ’s order to make cryptocurrency investments available in retirement plans. In a letter sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Massachusetts lawmaker, who is a member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, has asked Chairperson Paul Atkins to explain how the agency plans to serve its mission of investor protection as it seeks to support Trump’s order. This comes after the US President signed an order in August that aims to make it easier for 401(k) plans and other retirement funds to includesuch as Bitcoin and private equity.In the letter sent to SEC’s Atkins (reviewed by CNBC), Warren wrote:In the letter, Warren also cited a 2024 Government Accountability Office study which found thatShe even pointed to Trump's own change of position on crypto.

She noted that this could put people’s investments and retirement savings at major risk. Apart from Warren, major unions, including the American Federation of Teachers and AFL-CIO, have also raised concerns about the dangers of allowing more financial products on the blockchain.","US Senator Elizabeth Warren is concerned about President Donald Trump ’s order to make cryptocurrency investments available in retirement plans.

Top investment advisor and managing director of The Future Fund LLC, Gary Black has once again pressed Elon Musk ’s Tesla to strengthen its marketing strategy. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Black has warned that engineering along will not guarantee success in the era of robots and artificial intelligence. Black also gave a reference of Apple founder Steve Jobs , whoonce said that customer experience should be of prime importance. Black used the quote by Steve Jobs in order to send a direct message to Tesla CEO Elon Musk that even groundbreaking products need effective marketing to reach their full potential.Steve Jobs famously said:“You start with the customer experience and work back toward the technology - not the other way around.”Many $TSLA bulls forget this basic concept that a product with great engineering won’t sell itself.TSLA FSD has a take rate of just 15% despite huge advances in unsupervised autonomy in 2025.Stephen King put it differently:“A product is something made in a factory; a brand is something that is bought by the customer. A product can be copied by a competitor; a brand is unique. A product can be quickly outdated; a successful brand is timeless.” $TSLA needs to invest in brand equity and marketing muscle to increase its intrinsic value.Black also stressed on the fact that Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, despite its major advances in unsupervised autonomy in 2025, the take rate remains just 15%. “A product with great engineering won’t sell itself,” he wrote, underscoring that Tesla’s challenge lies not in innovation but in convincing customers of its value.He also cited author Stephen King, who once remarked that “a brand is what the customer actually buys,” emphasizing that Tesla must build stronger brand equity to maximize its intrinsic value.This is not the first time Black has urged Tesla to invest in marketing. He has repeatedly argued that the EV giant risks falling behind rivals if it does not bolster its brand presence, particularly as the industry shifts toward robotics and autonomous vehicles.","Gary Black, managing director of The Future Fund LLC, has once again pressed Elon Musk ’s Tesla to strengthen its marketing strategy.

Billionaire investor David Friedberg has criticised the narrative that taxing the ultra-wealthy will help the government to address massive projected funding shortfalls for healthcare (Medi-Cal) and education, arguing that while tax loopholes exist, the math simply doesn't add up to save California’s budget. Friedberg, in a conversation with AI czar David Sacks and venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, said explained how billionaires avoid taxes: the “Buy, Borrow, Die” strategy.“It’s totally reasonable to say billionaires aren’t paying their fair share — but the uncomfortable truth is why. Ultra-wealthy individuals don’t live on income, they live by borrowing against assets. No sale, no capital gains, no tax. That’s the loophole nobody wants to say out loud,” he said in a video, shared by Ian Miles Cheong, on X (formerly Twitter).He argued that if policymakers were interested in closing this gap they would have to take a different approach: Implement a tax on borrowed funds that are secured by unrealised gains.“The issue isn’t income tax — it’s asset-backed borrowing. When someone can live tax-free by borrowing against billions in untaxed assets, the system is broken.If policymakers were serious, the fix is simple: tax borrowed money tied to unrealized gains,” he added.He pointed out that the state is facing an estimated $1.5 trillion in long-term obligations and one-time tax income of $100 billion would barely be a solution.“California has ~200 billionaires worth $2 TRILLION combined. A 5% one-time tax raises $100B — sounds big until you realize the state is staring at a $1.5 TRILLION liability hole. Taxing billionaires doesn’t solve the problem. Spending does,” he added.“Even if you confiscated billions from every billionaire, it wouldn’t fix government debt. This debate pretends revenue is the issue — it’s not. The real crisis is uncontrolled spending and liabilities already baked into the system,” he noted.Rrecently, Sacks said, ""California has become a hostile work environment for founders.""","Billionaire investor David Friedberg criticised the narrative that taxing the ultra-wealthy will help the government to address massive projected funding shortfalls for healthcare (Medi-Cal) and education.

Amazon’s attendance system flags 'Low-Time Badgers' and 'Zero Badgers'

Samsung, Dell and other tech giants using similar badge tracking





Amazon has equipped managers with a new dashboard that tracks not just whether corporate employees show up to office, but exactly how many hours they spend there, according to an internal document obtained by Business Insider. The move significantly escalates workplace monitoring at the e-commerce giant, which already enforces one of tech's strictest return-to-office policies — a five-day mandate that kicked in January 2025.CEO Andy Jassy had announced the policy in September 2024, saying he wanted Amazon to ""operate like the world's largest startup"" where teams could better ""invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other."" He dismissed speculation that the mandate was a ""backdoor layoff"" or cost-cutting exercise, insisting it was ""very much about our culture.""Now, the company has tools to enforce that vision. The dashboard, which started rolling out in December, shows managers how often employees badge in, how long they stay, and which buildings they work from. It updates daily at 5 pm PT and tracks data over a rolling eight-week period.The system identifies three categories of employees. ""Low-Time Badgers"" are those whose weekly median time in office is less than four hours per day, averaged over eight weeks. ""Zero Badgers"" don't badge into any Amazon building during that span. ""Unassigned Building Badgers"" badge into a different building than their assigned one more than half the time.An Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider that such tools have been available for over a year to help managers identify team members who may need support working from office.Amazon began cracking down on ""coffee badging"" last year, informing some teams they needed to be in office for at least two to six hours for their attendance to count. One employee compared the crackdown to being treated ""like high school students.""Amazon isn't alone in using badge data to enforce return-to-office policies. Samsung has rolled out similar tools showing ""days and time in building"" metrics. Dell informed hybrid staff it will track on-site presence via badge swipes and could factor attendance into performance and compensation. Bank of America and JPMorgan have also implemented tracking dashboards visible to senior managers.","Internal document reveals Amazon's new attendance dashboard.

Gavin Newsom gives his State of the State address at the State Capitol in Sacramento, Calif. (Hector Amezcua/The Sacramento Bee via AP, Pool)

What makes Billionaire tax proposal different this time





There's good news for Billionaires in California. Or should one say the Billionaires left in the state of California. The Democratic governor of California Gavin Newsom has come out openly against Billionaire's Tax. In an interview to New York Times, Newsom vowed to stop the proposed Billionaire or Wealth tax in California, saying that its mere introduction had already hurt the state by driving some Billionaires to relocate and take their tax dollars with them.“This will be defeated — there’s no question in my mind,” Newsom said. He added, “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.” Reports suggest that several billionaires have already left the State of California. While some like David Sacks and Peter Thiel have announced their exit publicly, Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have quietly cut their ties with Silicon Valley. There are reported to be others too in the list who have left the state.Evidence suggests that has already begun to happen, even though the proposal is a long way from becoming law. There Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who together founded Google in a friend’s garage in Silicon Valley, have begun cutting ties with California.So has tech venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya says California’s proposed billionaire tax is accelerating an exodus of ultra-wealthy residents. Palihapitiya, who has been tracking capital flight from the Golden State, said California has so far lost an estimated $1 trillion.Responding to these, Governor Newsom said, “This is what I feared, and it’s come true.”Incidentally, Gavin Newsom's stand against any form of Wealth tax is not new. The governor has long opposed a Wealth tax saying that it would stifle innovation in California, where the booming tech industry has sent state revenues soaring and driven the State's economy for years. In past years, he has quashed legislative wealth tax proposals on a number of occasions by making it clear that he would not sign them into law.However, what is different this time is that the proposed Billionaires/Wealth tax has come from a large health care union which is trying to place the tax on the ballot. The tax proposal is being led by the labor union Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West. If passed, the tax would retroactively apply to residents as of 1 January, and billionaires would have five years to pay it.The union argues that the tax is necessary to make up for the deep cuts to health care that President Donald Trump signed into law last year, including reductions in Medicaid, Affordable Care Act subsidies and food assistance. The union’s proposal calls for the state to spend 90% of the new tax money on health care, with the rest devoted to food assistance and education. The funding would help to keep hospitals open and preserve Californians’ access to health care, said Suzanne Jimenez, the chief of staff for the labor union. The proposal is still in the beginning phases. Under California law, it needs to collect 874,641 signatures to qualify for the state ballot in November.",Democratic governor of California Gavin Newsom has come out openly against Billionaire's Tax.

How “Are You Dead?” app works

'Are You Dead?' app gets popular in US, Singapore and other countries including India





An app called “Are You Dead?” has gone viral among iPhone users in China, becoming the most downloaded paid app in the country. Launched in May last year, the app is designed for people alone. According to a BBC report, the app addresses rising “safety anxiety” among China's growing solo dwellers which according to experts is expected to reach 200 million by 2030. “And it's those people that the app - which describes itself as a ‘safety company companion... whether you're a solo office worker, a student living away from home, or anyone choosing a solitary lifestyle’ - is trying to target,” the report says.‘Are You Dead?’ is a paid-app. It is priced at 8 yuan in China and Rs 99 in India. It is a word play of food delivery app called ""Are you Hungry?"". In Chinese, ""Si-le-ma"" sounds like the name of the food app ""E-le-ma"".The idea of the app is simple. It does not require sign-up or sharing personal data. All one has to do is add an emergency contact that will be alerted in case of an emergency.Users are required to check in every two days in the app to confirm that they are alive.“If not, it will get in touch with your appointed emergency contact and inform them that you may be in trouble,” the report says.'Are You Dead?' app is internationally available under the name of ‘Demumu’. According to the BBC report, the app ranks in the top two in the US, Singapore and Hong Kong, and top four in Australia and Spain for paid utility apps.In India too, the app has gained popularity becoming the second most downloaded paid app in the country right now. While little is known about founders of the app, the App Store listing shows Moonscape Technologies Inc. as the developer of ‘Are You Dead?’ app.","'Are You Dead?' app gets popular in US, Singapore and other countries including India.

He emphasized that tech giants must ""pay their own way."" This comes as rising utility bills are linked to AI infrastructure's massive power demands, with some states seeing substantial price hikes.

Microsoft faces pressure ahead of midterms

Nuclear deal and $1 billion loan power Microsoft's AI ambitions





US President Donald Trump has announced that Microsoft will roll out ""major changes"" this week to ensure American households don't end up footing the bill for the tech giant's power-hungry AI data centres. ""I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. He added that the ""big Technology Companies who build them must 'pay their own way.'""Following Trump's call-out, Microsoft unveiled a five-point plan on Tuesday, promising to ask utilities to charge it more for electricity, replenish more water than its data centres consume, hire locally, skip property tax breaks, and provide free AI training to schools and small businesses.The announcement comes as utility bills have climbed across at least 13 US states due to the massive energy demands of AI infrastructure. Data from earlier reports showed electricity prices jumped roughly 6% year-on-year, with some regions like Maine seeing spikes as high as 36%.Trump's move signals a broader push to rein in Big Tech's energy footprint before the upcoming midterm elections. His administration has been working to lower consumer costs across multiple fronts, from mortgage rates to prescription drugs like Ozempic.Microsoft, for its part, has already shown sensitivity to the issue. At a September town hall in Wisconsin, company president Brad Smith told residents: ""I just want you to know we are doing everything we can... so that you all don't have to pay more for electricity because of our presence.""The company even scrapped plans for a data centre in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after facing local opposition.Microsoft's energy strategy has taken some unconventional turns. The company signed a 20-year deal in 2024 to purchase power from the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania — yes, the same facility that was home to America's worst nuclear accident in 1979. The Trump administration backed this with a $1 billion federal loan in November 2025.The reactor set to reopen is separate from the one involved in the 1979 meltdown and is expected to come online by 2027, powering the equivalent of 800,000 homes.Trump hinted that more announcements with other tech companies are on the way. Meta, Amazon , and Google have all made similar pledges to cover their own utility costs amid growing consumer pushback.","US President Donald Trump says tech giants must ""pay their own way"" This comes as rising utility bills are linked to AI infrastructure's massive power demands, with some states seeing substantial price hikes.

Scam started on WhatsApp, moved to Telegram

Rs 51 lakhs transferred through more than 70 transactions





In yet another episode of online scam, a 33-year-old Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) officer lost Rs 51 lakhs. Rajesh Kumar, a resident of Surajpur, Noida fell victim to a online trading scheme promoted on messaging platforms – WhatsApp and Telegram. An FIR with cybercrime branch has been filed under Section 318(4) (cheating) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and relevant provisions of the IT Act. SHO of the Cyber Crime Police Station, Vijay Rana, told TOI: ""Banks concerned have been approached to trace the accounts where the money was transferred,"" he said, adding an investigation is underway.Police say that the scam started on August 26, 2025 when Kumar was contacted by a woman on Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp. The woman introduced herself as Isha Desai and claimed herself to be a resident of Mumbai. She informed him about an investing scheme promising ‘profits’.The conversation later shifted to Telegram. Eventually, Desai asked Kumar to invest in share trading through an app called ‘GO Markets Global Cs'. As per police records, Kumar downloaded the app on September 11.This time again, Desai reassured him of high returns. She also assisted him in withdrawing Rs 5,000 profit, further gaining Kumar’s confidence.Kumar, who had come to believe the scheme was genuine, transferred Rs 51 lakh to multiple bank accounts through more than 70 transactions. These transactions occurred over a period of three months from September 11 and November 6, as instructed by the woman.But when Kumar tried to withdraw the full amount shown as profit in the GO Markets Global Cs' app, the accused demanded additional payments as transaction fees for withdrawal.Realising that he had been defrauded, Kumar stopped transferring any more money. He also lodged a complaint on the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal on November 29.","Rajesh Kumar, a 33-year-old Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) officer lost Rs 51 lakhs.

Meta to streamline the review process







Facebook-parent Meta reportedly revamping how it evaluates employees. As reported by Business Insider, Meta is introducing a new kind of performance program called Checkpoint which promises to offer top performances bonuses of up to 300% of their base pay. These changes announced by Meta were mentioned in an internal memo which will take into effect mid-year 2026.Checkpoint reshapes performance reviews into four categories:Along with this, Meta has also introduced a Meta Award which is a special recognition for a small group of employees who deliver “truly exceptional impact,” with a 300% bonus multiplier.The memo seen by Business Insider, also stresses on the fact that most employees will fall into the ‘excellent’ category, reflecting Meta’s belief that the majority of its workforce consistently delivers meaningful results. The company also mentioned that the redesign will make the performance reviews less bureaucratic and will deliver a more-focused outcome.Meta further added that new review process will also be time saving. Presently, managers spend around 80 hours annually on the performance tasks, whereas the employees collectively spend 330,000 hours per cycle on peer feedback. Yet fewer than 25% of managers find that feedback useful.However, under the Checkpoint, Meta will move to two review cycles per year - mid-year and year-end — with bonuses paid out twice annually. Equity grants will continue once a year, based on the average of both ratings.This revamp of the review process follows CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s framing of 20205 as an ‘intense’ year, during which Meta tightened performance management and cut about 5% of low performers. Employees and managers described the environment as tougher and more competitive, with ratings carrying more weight than before.Earlier, Meta’s review system varied between mid‑year and year‑end, with multiple labels ranging from “Exceeds Expectations” to “Redefines Expectations.” Checkpoint simplifies this into a unified scale.",Facebook-parent Meta reportedly revamping how it evaluates employees.

Amazon sends Cease and Desist letter to PerplexityAI

Amazon on third-party AI shopping agents





Google recently unveiled Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), a new open standard for agentic commerce that the search giant claims works across the entire shopping journey -- from discovery and buying to post-purchase support. UCP establishes a common language for agents and systems to operate together across consumer surfaces, businesses, and payment providers to enable commerce. So instead of requiring unique connections for every individual agent, UCP enables all agents to interact easily. The protocol has backing from some of the biggest American retailers and payment players including Walmart, Target, Shopify and Etsy.Announced at the National Retail Federation conference in New York, Google pitched UCP as a foundation for “agentic commerce,” a fast-emerging concept in which AI agents help shoppers carry out multi-step tasks on their behalf. “AI agents will be a big part of how we shop in the not-so-distant future,” wrote Google CEO Sundar Pichai on X, formerly Twitter.Notably, there was one e-commerce giant not included in Google's announcement: Amazon. And incidentally, this AI-led shopping is similar to what Amazon last year sent a legal notice to Perplexity over. And the two companies have been fighting over. In November 2025, Amazon sued Perplexity over AI shopping agents.In a lawsuit filed in Northern California, Amazon sued Perplexity to stop its Comet AI agents from accessing Amazon’s e-commerce website in what it alleges to be a covert manner. The lawsuit followed a cease and desist letter in which Amazon alleged Perplexity is “disguising Comet as a Google Chrome browser” and refusing to identify Comet AI agents when operating in the Amazon Store, making purchases on behalf of users without authorization.In a blog post on sending Cease and Desist notice to Perplexity, Amazon wrote, ""We think it’s fairly straightforward that third-party applications that offer to make purchases on behalf of customers from other businesses should operate openly and respect service provider decisions whether or not to participate. This helps ensure a positive customer experience and it is how others operate, including food delivery apps and the restaurants they take orders for, delivery service apps and the stores they shop from, and online travel agencies and the airlines they book tickets with for customers. Agentic third-party applications such as Perplexity’s Comet have the same obligations, and we’ve repeatedly requested that Perplexity remove Amazon from the Comet experience, particularly in light of the significantly degraded shopping and customer service experience it provides.”""As a general matter, Amazon shares the industry’s excitement about AI innovations and sees significant potential for agentic AI to improve customer experiences in a range of areas. But to successfully deliver for customers, AI agents that offer to make purchases on behalf of customers must operate transparently when taking actions purportedly on a customer’s behalf. Such transparency is critical because it protects a service provider’s right to monitor AI agents and restrict conduct that degrades the customer shopping experience, erodes customer trust, and creates security risks for our customers’ private data. It also facilitates dialogue between service providers and AI agent providers, who should share a common interest in improving customer shopping experience. Without transparency, no such dialogue is possible, which is why Amazon invites discussions with AI providers about how they can improve the experiences of Amazon customers. Yet, Perplexity has refused to operate transparently and has instead taken affirmative steps to conceal its agentic activities in the Amazon Store. This refusal is particularly troubling given that Amazon has, on multiple occasions, asked Perplexity to stop undisclosed agentic activities, which are not authorized by Amazon and violate Amazon’s Conditions of Use,"" said Amazon in its Cease and Desist letter.Also what needs to be noted here is that Amazon’s legal notice to Perplexity is not being seen as a full indictment against third-party agentic commerce, but moreso an example of how Amazon wants to work with external agents on its own terms. Amazon has been experimenting with its own AI-powered shopping features, including its Rufus assistant and the “Buy for Me” initiative since sometime now. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged on during the last earnings call that agentic commerce “has a chance to be really good for e-commerce” and said that he expects the company to partner with third-party agents over time. At the same time, Jessy said that agents “aren’t very good” at personalization and often display incorrect pricing and delivery estimates.Jassy also said that the company is not against external partnerships for Agentic Commerce. During the call, Jassy said, ""We’re also having conversations with and expect over time to partner with third-party agents.” “And today, search engines are a very small part of our referral traffic, and third-party agents are a very small subset of that. But I do think that we will find ways to partner. We have to find a way, though, that makes the customer exp","Google recently unveiled Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), a new open standard for agentic commerce.

Sapiens acquired by Advent for $2.5 billion





Sapiens is cutting hundreds of jobs with employees in India and the US hit the hardest. According to a report by Calcalist, the software company is planning to layoff approximately 10% of its workforce after completion of the $2.5 billion sale of Sapiens to private equity firm Advent. The company currently employs 5,400 employees across regions. The job cuts are likely to impact 540 employees. As per the report, the cuts will not be evenly distributed across regions.As mentioned above, employees in the US and India will be most impacted by Sapiens layoffs. In Israel, the company will cut around 40 jobs which is around 5% of its total workforce in the country. However, the layoffs may reach up to 10% in India which currently employs around 2,000 people. Similarly, Sapiens job cuts may reach up to 10% in the US that employs nearly 600 people.“The scale of the reduction there reflects the new management’s decision to move away from software-and-services sales and transition fully to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, in line with prevailing cloud-based industry standards,” the Calcalist report says. It further states that Advent does not view some of the recent acquisitions in the US as “strategic” and may seek to divest them over the coming year.Global private equity firm Advent acquired Sapiens in 2025 for $2.5 billion. Post the acquisition, Sapiens’ management has been replaced and the company’s headquarters has been relocated to London. Additionally, Sapiens was delisted from trading in New York and Tel Aviv on December 17.Calling job reduction a part of structural transformation, Ernesto Marinelli, appointed by the fund and serving as Chief People Success Officer told the publication:“Today’s customers want completely different things than in the past.

Read the complete letter here



Dear Warner Bros.

Discovery Shareholder

,

Over the last few days, following the decision by Warner Bros. Discovery (""WBD"") not to engage with Paramount on our $30 per share cash offer to acquire all of WBD, and our reaffirmation of our commitment to delivering our superior offer to WBD shareholders, we keep getting the same question: what happens next?

Paramount started this process about four months ago with a private offer at a significant premium to WBD's $12.54 share price, and our pursuit culminated in the $30 per share all-cash, fully financed proposal we made before WBD entered into the Netflix transaction. When we learned of the terms of that transaction, which are inferior both financially and from the standpoint of timing and certainty of closing, we decided to bring our offer directly to you, through our tender offer.

We are committed to seeing our tender offer through. We understand, however, that unless the WBD board of directors decides to exercise its right to engage with us under the Netflix merger agreement (the ""Netflix Agreement""), this will likely come down to your vote at a shareholder meeting. We do not know whether that will be at WBD's upcoming annual meeting or a special meeting. The ""advance notice"" window for WBD's 2026 annual meeting opens in three weeks, and Paramount will nominate a slate of directors who, in accordance with their fiduciary duties, will exercise WBD's right under the Netflix Agreement to engage on Paramount's offer and enter into a transaction with Paramount. In addition, Paramount will propose an amendment to WBD's bylaws to require WBD shareholder approval for any separation of Global Networks.

If WBD calls a special meeting ahead of its annual meeting to vote on the Netflix Agreement, Paramount will solicit proxies against such approval. These actions, coupled with our tender offer, ensure that you get the final decision on which offer is better for you.

WBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount, but what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer. Our $30 per share in cash is simply more than Netflix's complex multi-variable consideration comprised of (a) $23.25 in cash plus (b) a number of Netflix shares currently worth $4.11 (at Friday's close) plus (c) the to-be-issued Global Networks equity which we have analyzed as having zero equity value1. In addition to not disclosing the value of the to-be-issued Global Networks spin off, WBD has not disclosed the mechanism by which any debt transferred from Global Networks to the Streaming & Studios segment reduces the cash and stock consideration payable to you.

Along with the WBD shareholders, we have asked for the customary financial disclosure a board is supposed to provide shareholders when making an investment recommendation. But in each of its 14D-9 filings, WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its ""risk adjustment"" of our $30 per share all-cash offer. WBD shareholders need this information to make an informed investment decision on our offer – and importantly, Delaware law has consistently required that such information be provided to shareholders. Following the process prescribed under Delaware law, we filed suit this morning in Delaware Chancery Court to ask the court to simply direct WBD to provide this information so that WBD shareholders have what they need to be able to make an informed decision as to whether to tender their shares into our offer.

We do not undertake any of these actions lightly. Make no mistake, our goal remains to have constructive discussions with WBD's Board to reach an agreement that is in the best interests of WBD shareholders. Our objective from the moment we approached WBD was for a collaborative negotiation and a successful transaction that would be a win for both companies, both shareholder groups and all stakeholders. We remain perplexed that WBD never responded to our December 4th offer, never attempted to clarify or negotiate any of the terms in that proposal, nor traded markups of contracts with us. Even as we read WBD's own narrative of its process, we are struck that there were few actual board meetings in the period leading up to the decision to accept an inferior transaction with Netflix. And we are surprised by the lack of transparency on WBD's part regarding basic financial matters. It just doesn't add up – much like the math on how WBD continues to favor taking less than our $30 per share all-cash offer for its shareholders.

The best outcome for you and for us would be if WBD's Board would exercise the right it has under the Netflix Agreement to engage with Paramount. If it does so, we will be open and constructive to secure the best path forward for WBD and each of you. We have demonstrated our willingness to listen carefully to any feedback we receive from WBD's Board and to respond by offering reasonable solutions – and that remains our mindset and approach.

I believe in our vision for how we can bring these great companies together and deliver for consumers, the creative community and of course, for you. Paramount is committed, my family is committed, and hopefully this helps answer the question of what comes next.

Sincerely,

David Ellison

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

As Netflix moves forward with its $82.7 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Paramount CEO David Ellison has escalated his opposition by filing a lawsuit in Delaware and sending another letter to WBD shareholders. Ellison also argues that the broad has failed to offer critical financial disclosures, leading the investors unable to fairly evaluate Paramount’s competing the all-cash offer. On January 12, Ellison announced that Paramount has filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court. The company has demanded WBD to disclose the details of how it valued the Netflix transaction. In his letter to the shareholders, Ellison claimed that Paramount’s $30 per share all-cash bid is financially superior to the offer made by Netflix, but WBD has withheld key information.“WBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount, but what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer,” wrote Ellison. He further added that WBD has failed to explain how debt adjustments work in the Netflix deal or the basis for its ‘risk adjustment’ of Paramount’s proposal.Last week, WBD’s board rejected Paramount’s latest bid, citing concerns that the deal carried too much risk of collapsing. The rejection has fueled Ellison’s criticism that shareholders are being denied transparency in evaluating competing offers.",Paramount started a private offer at a significant premium to WBD's $12.54 share price. WBD has not disclosed the mechanism by which any debt transferred from Global Networks to the Streaming & Studios segment reduces the cash and stock consideration.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126498713,imgsize-26600,width-400,resizemode-4/ceo-of-paramount-skydance-david-ellison.jpg"

Ted Sarandos reveals the only management book he likes reading ‘over and over again’

“It doesn't sound like a management story on the surface, but I think it's the most powerful leadership story I've ever read. I read it over and over again because I find ... I get something different in the book every time I read it,”

“Now, what I see is that when you go through life and you go through business, you make a lot of decisions that don't turn out the way you thought they would. The real leadership test is: How do you manage through that?”





Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has revealed a key lesson that he has learnt from the streaming giant’s founder and former CEO, Reed Hastings. Sarandos noted that his management philosophy comes from Hastings. Sarandos, who joined the streaming giant in 2000 as head of content operations, emphasised that his leadership style focuses on empowering top talent and embracing uncertainty.he said in CNBC’s “Leaders Playbook” interview.In the interview, Sarandos also revealed that he once made a significant decision without seeking Hastings's approval. Sarandos said he once authorised a $100 million investment in the series House of Cards without consulting Hastings. He clarified that the decision to commit to two seasons was a calculated financial risk meant to change the course of the business.When Hastings later questioned the decision, Sarandos recalled talking about the show's high cost and explained it as a simple comparison of possible gains and losses.In hindsight, that decision played a key role in Netflix’s shift from a mail-order DVD service to a significant force in original streaming content.Sarandos said, “When he asked me, ‘Why would you do that?’ I said, ‘Reed, it’s a simple risk-reward for me. If this show fails, we will have dramatically overpaid for a show. We do that all the time, but if it succeeds, we could completely transform the business as we know it.’”Sarandos also noted that he doesn’t usually turn to management books. Instead, he prefers fiction to learn about leadership. His favourite management read is Typhoon, a 1902 novella by Joseph Conrad that follows a steamship captain and his crew as they battle a mighty storm at sea.Sarandos said.He recalled that when he first read the book around 20 years ago, he viewed the captain as a reckless “hot dog” who put himself and others at risk. Rereading it years later, he drew a more profound lesson about leading amid uncertainty and conflict.Sarandos said.","Ted Sarandos revealed he once greenlit a $100 million 'House of Cards' investment without Hastings's approval.

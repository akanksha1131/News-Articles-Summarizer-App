OpenAI President welcomes Sachin Katti to OpenAI

“Welcome @sk7037 to OpenAI!

Incredibly excited to work with him on designing and building our compute infrastructure, which will power our AGI research and scale its applications to benefit everyone.”

“Excited for the opportunity to work with @gdb (Greg Brockman), @sama (Sam Altman) and the @OpenAI team on building out the compute infrastructure for AGI! Very grateful for the tremendous opportunity and experience at Intel over the last 4 years leading networking, edge computing and AI. Privilege of a lifetime to have worked closely with @LipBuTan1, @PGelsinger and @nickmckeown1.”





Intel AI chief and chief technology officer Sachin Katti has left to join ChatGPT-maker OpenAI . In a statement, the chip maker said that its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, will now oversee the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) division. “We thank Sachin for his contributions and wish him all the best. Lip-Bu will lead the AI and Advanced Technologies Groups, working closely with the team,” Intel said. “AI remains one of Intel’s highest strategic priorities, and we are focused on executing our technology and product roadmap across emerging AI workloads,” the company added.Katti, who joined Intel four years ago and previously taught at Stanford University, was promoted to chief technology officer and chief AI officer earlier this year. His exit marks another leadership change under Tan, who took over as Intel’s CEO in March and has since restructured the company.Intel has been working to catch up in the AI chip market, where Nvidia and TSMC currently dominate. While its central processors power some AI systems, the company has yet to produce a competitive data center AI chip.Tan has been reshaping Intel’s leadership, expanding executive roles and hiring new talent from outside the company as he attempts to steer a turnaround at the struggling chipmaker.Sharing a post on X, OpenAI President Greg Brockman said:Katti responded, writing:","Intel AI chief and chief technology officer Sachin Katti has left to join ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.

Schools in America need to 'evolve'





With a $4.6 trillion balance sheet, JPMorgan Chase is America's largest bank. It is more valuable than its three biggest Wall Street rivals combined. And much of that success may be due to its long-time leader, Jamie Dimon. The JPMorgan Chase CEO runs the $4.5 trillion bank with 300,000 employees. However, when it comes to a gadget that has become an integral part of work-life and otherwise for most of us, Dimon has different views. Jamie Dimon says he keeps his phone use to a minimum during the workday — including turning off notifications and ignoring most text messages.“I don’t have notifications,” Dimon told CNN’s Erin Burnett in a recent interview. “If you sent me a text during the day, I probably do not read it.”The 69-year-old CEO said the only people whose messages get through to him are his children. “The only notifications I get is from my kids. That’s it. When they text me, I get that,” he said.Dimon explained that he prioritizes focus and engagement over constant connectivity, adding that he doesn’t even carry his phone when walking around JPMorgan’s offices or attending meetings.“When I’m walking around the building and going to meetings, I don’t have it on me. It’s in my office,” he said. “When I go to my meetings, I did the pre-reads and I’m 100% focused on us — what you’re talking about, why you’re talking about it — as opposed to I’m distracted and I’m thinking about other things.”Dimon, who has led JPMorgan for nearly two decades, said that he believes meetings should be purposeful and distraction-free, warning that multitasking and checking emails are signs of poor engagement.America's top banker has also called for a sweeping transformation of the US education system, warning that schools must evolve to meet the demands of a rapidly changing workforce. In an appearance at the Business Roundtable’s CEO Workforce Forum, Dimon emphasised the need for schools to integrate coding, cyber security and financial management into their curricula.Dimon said that aligning educational programs with industry needs will better equip students to secure jobs in these high-demand fields.Dimon, who is also a board member of the New York Jobs CEO Council, highlighted how some educational institutions are collaborating with the private sector to create programs that enhance job readiness.",JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says he doesn't use his phone during the workday.

European Commission plans to ban Chinese companies that America calls 'national security threat' across Europe and why it may not go well,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/european-commission-plans-to-ban-chinese-companies-that-america-calls-national-security-threat-across-europe-and-why-it-may-not-go-well/articleshow/125232725.cms,"AI image for representation

Why 'ban China' debate in Europe again

Why some countries not in favour of the ban

China on calling Huawei and ZTE ""high-risk"" suppliers





The European Commission is reportedly considering steps to compel countries in Europe to remove Huawei and ZTE equipment from their telecommunications networks. According to a report by Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, European Commission is exploring ways to force European Union member states to phase out Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE Corp from their telecommunications networks. Both Huawei and ZTE are banned in America. The US government calls Huawei a 'national security threat'.According to the report, Commission Vice President Henna Virkkunen is exploring ways to turn the EU’s 2020 recommendation urging countries to avoid “high-risk vendors” in 5G networks into a binding legal requirement. While infrastructure decisions currently rest with national governments, the proposal would require EU states to comply with the bloc’s security guidance.Virkkunen’s team is also studying ways to curb Chinese equipment in fixed-line broadband networks, as the bloc ramps up efforts to deploy high-speed fiber connections. In addition, the Commission is reportedly considering withholding Global Gateway funding—a major EU investment program—from non-EU countries that use Huawei equipment in projects backed by EU grants.Former Commissioner Thierry Breton later pushed to explicitly name Huawei and ZTE as security risks and pledged to remove their equipment from EU institutions’ networks.Still, national governments have largely resisted surrendering authority over telecom decisions to Brussels.The debate has resurfaced as Germany and Finland consider tighter restrictions on Chinese vendors, Bloomberg noted. By contrast, Spain and Greece continue to allow Huawei’s participation in their telecom networks, highlighting divisions within the bloc.The move reflects growing concern in Brussels over the potential security risks posed by Chinese telecom companies amid deteriorating trade and political ties with Beijing. EU officials fear that allowing Chinese suppliers access to critical infrastructure could expose national networks to espionage or disruption. Efforts to limit Huawei’s role in Europe date back to the Trump administration’s campaign to isolate the Chinese tech giant globally. The EU responded with its “5G toolbox” in 2020, which encouraged—but did not require—countries to exclude high-risk vendors. Sweden remains one of the few EU members to have fully banned Huawei, a move that prompted sharp retaliation from Beijing and discouraged others from following suit.Critics argue that the uneven approach undermines collective cybersecurity, while telecom operators warn that banning Huawei could raise costs and delay network rollouts, given the company’s competitive pricing and technology.China’s Foreign Ministry has previously denounced the EU’s characterization of Huawei and ZTE as “high-risk” suppliers, calling the stance politically motivated and lacking legal or factual basis.","European Commission is exploring ways to force European Union member states to phase out Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE Corp from their telecommunications networks.

The service will reportedly include:* AI-driven health coaching, offering lifestyle advice and condition-specific guidance* Nutrition tracking, with personalized meal suggestions and dietary analysis* Expert-led video content, helping users understand health conditions and improve habitsGurman noted that Health+ could position Apple as one of the first major tech companies to gain traction in the AI health chatbot space, a rapidly growing segment of digital wellness.The Health+ rollout is part of Apple’s broader Apple Intelligence initiative, which includes a major overhaul of Siri expected with iOS 27 in mid-2026. The redesigned Siri will reportedly work in tandem with Health+, enabling users to ask health-related questions and receive AI-generated responses based on their personal data. Apple has also begun merging Fitness+ with Health, creating a unified wellness ecosystem that simplifies how users manage their fitness and health goals.Originally expected to debut with iOS 26, the Health+ service has been delayed to allow for further refinement and possible regulatory review. Despite the delay, Apple insiders confirm that the project remains a top priority and is on track for release next year.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

""cold plate""

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

What CEO Andy Jassy said about Amazon’s in-house AI chip cooling system



""Every cloud provider faces the same AI infrastructure challenge: chips need to be positioned close together to exchange data quickly, but they generate intense heat, creating unprecedented cooling demands.

We needed a strategic solution that allowed us to use our existing air-cooled

data centers

to do liquid cooling without waiting for new construction. And it needed to be rapidly deployed so we could bring customers these powerful AI capabilities while we transition towards facility-level liquid cooling.

Think of a home where only one sunny room needs AC, while the rest stays naturally cool – that’s what we wanted to achieve, allowing us to efficiently land both liquid and air-cooled racks in the same facilities with complete flexibility.

The available options weren't great. Either we could wait to build specialized liquid-cooled facilities or adopt off-the-shelf solutions that didn't scale or meet our unique needs. Neither worked for our customers, so we did what we often do at Amazon… we invented our own solution.

Our teams designed and delivered our In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), which uses a direct-to-chip approach with a ""cold plate"" on the chips. The liquid runs through this sealed plate in a closed loop, continuously removing heat without increasing water use. This enables us to support traditional workloads and demanding AI applications in the same facilities. By 2026, our liquid-cooled capacity will grow to over 20% of our ML capacity, which is at multi-gigawatt scale today.

While

liquid cooling technology

itself isn't unique, our approach was. Creating something this effective that could be deployed across our 120 Availability Zones in 38 Regions was significant. Because this solution didn't exist in the market, we developed a system that enables greater liquid cooling capacity with a smaller physical footprint, while maintaining flexibility and efficiency.

Our IRHX can support a wide range of racks requiring liquid cooling, uses 9% less water than fully-air cooled sites, and offers a 20% improvement in power efficiency compared to off-the-shelf solutions. And because we invented it in-house, we can deploy it within months in any of our data centers, creating a flexible foundation to serve our customers for decades to come.

Reimagining and innovating at scale has been something Amazon has done for a long time and one of the reasons we’ve been the leader in technology infrastructure and data center invention, sustainability, and resilience. We're not done… there's still so much more to invent for customers.""

Intel has reportedly filed a $250,000 lawsuit against a former software engineer accused of stealing tens of thousands of confidential files, including material marked “Intel Top Secret”. According to The Mercury News, the software engineer, identified as Jinfeng Luo, joined Intel in 2014 and was terminated on July 7, 2024, as part of the company’s ongoing workforce reduction. In the weeks before his exit, Luo allegedly downloaded around 18,000 files from company systems before disappearing, prompting Intel to seek legal action to recover its data.Court filings from Intel claim that Luo first tried to transfer data from his company-issued laptop to an external drive about a week before his departure. However, Intel’s security systems blocked the attempt. He allegedly tried again three days before his final day and succeeded in copying sensitive files to a network-attached storage (NAS) device. Investigators say he spent the remainder of his tenure downloading as much proprietary information as possible, including highly classified materials.Intel discovered the transfers shortly after Luo left and has spent the past three months trying unsuccessfully to contact him via phone, email, and postal letters.The company ultimately filed the lawsuit to compel the return of its data and seek damages for the breach. Luo remains untraceable as of now.Incidentally, this is not the first case of data theft involving a former Intel employee. In a recent incident, another ex-engineer was sentenced to two years’ probation and fined $34,000 for stealing company data later used to secure a position at Microsoft. The engineer named Varun Gupta worked as a product marketing engineer at Intel for nearly a decade. He was fired from his senior position at Microsoft after his actions came to light.","Jinfeng Luo allegedly downloaded 18,000 files from company systems before disappearing.

YouTube TV is compensating subscribers with a $20 credit following a prolonged blackout of Disney-owned channels, including ESPN, ABC, FX, and National Geographic, which have been unavailable since October 31, 2025 due to a contract dispute between YouTube and Disney. The blackout stems from a pricing disagreement. YouTube TV claims Disney demanded higher rates, while Disney argues that YouTube is refusing to pay fair market value for its content. This standoff has left millions of subscribers without access to key live sports and entertainment programming for over a week.YouTube TV confirmed that affected subscribers will receive a $20 credit applied to their next billing cycle. Emails with instructions on how to claim the credit are currently being sent out. The company emphasized that it is working to resolve the dispute and restore Disney channels “within hours” once a new agreement is reached. This isn’t the first time YouTube TV has issued credits during a content blackout. In 2022, subscribers received a $15 credit after a similar dispute temporarily removed Disney programming.The dispute highlights ongoing tensions between streaming platforms and content providers over licensing fees. Disney has been renegotiating contracts with multiple distributors, seeking higher rates amid rising production costs and shifting viewer habits. Meanwhile, YouTube TV continues to grow as a popular alternative to traditional cable, especially among sports fans. The loss of ESPN and ABC has sparked frustration, with some users threatening to cancel or switch to Disney-owned platforms like Hulu + Live TV.","YouTube TV is compensating subscribers with a $20 credit following a prolonged blackout of Disney-owned channels.

Most-popular iPhone analyst Ming-Chi Kuo on why Elon Musk is moving Tesla’s AI chip supply chain away from TSMC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/most-popular-iphone-analyst-ming-chi-kuo-on-why-elon-musk-is-moving-teslas-ai-chip-supply-chain-away-from-tsmc/articleshow/125222730.cms,"Elon Musk’s chip Timeline: AI5 to AI6 in under a year



Why Tesla is moving away from TSMC

Geopolitical risk: Musk has publicly voiced concerns about the concentration of advanced node capacity in Taiwan. Even by 2030, TSMC’s advanced-node and advanced-packaging capacity in the U.S. will remain limited—especially on the packaging side, likely no more than about 10% of its global capacity. I believe Musk realizes this as well, which is why he said, 'And then you go to solve memory and packaging too.'

R&D flexibility: It's expected that Tesla has significant growth potential, but within TSMC today it is still a second-tier customer relative to the likes of Apple and Nvidia. That naturally means less priority on R&D support and production flexibility—one of the main reasons Tesla moved AI6 to Samsung. The ultimate remedy is to control its own chip production plant.

Vertical integration: Musk's new technologies and products are often at the cutting edge. The ability to customize key design and manufacturing segments to his specific needs—with chip production being a critical one—enables a highly integrated final product and maximizes the benefits of vertical integration.

Tesla’s AI chip ambitions







Ming-Chi Kuo, the popular Apple analyst has validated his earlier predictions. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Kuo said that Tesla CEO Elon Musk pushed to build Tesla’s own semiconductor fabs marking a strategic shift towards full control of the company’s AI future. The comments made by Kuo follow Musk’s remarks at Tesla’s recent shareholder meeting, where Musk outlined the aggressive roadmap for Tesla’s next-generation AI chips. “@elonmusk remarks at the latest Tesla shareholder meeting validate my previous analysis and predictions regarding his semiconductor strategy,” wrote Kuo.At the shareholders meeting, Elon Musk said, ““I’m hopeful that we can within less than a year of AI5 starting production, we can actually transition in the same fab to AI6 and double all of the performance metrics.” In a post shared on X, Kuo said that this statement made by Musk confirms his earlier analysis that Tesla is escalating its chip development timeline. While many doubted Tesla could move from AI5 to AI6 in just a year, Musk’s confidence supports the notion that Tesla is building the infrastructure to do just that. “I previously projected that AI6 would enter mass production in 2027. Many questioned whether only a one-year gap between AI5 and AI6 was realistic, but Musk’s comments validate that timeline (setting aside whether the plan ultimately executes as stated),” wrote Kuo.As per Kuo, Musk’s motivation to build Tesla’s own chip plants goes far beyond concerns about supply shortages. Kuo suggested three strategic drivers:Kuo referenced a past comment from TSMC CEO CC Wei, who told Musk: “If you’re willing to pay, there will be chips.” This, Kuo argued, shows that supply isn’t the issue—control is.The A15 chip of Elon Musk’s Tesla is said to be produced by both Samsung and TSMC. However, Musk has also hinted that the uture chips like AI6 and AI7 may be built in Tesla’s own fabs. He even teased AI8 as “out of this world,” suggesting a long-term roadmap of increasingly powerful processors.“Just finished a long AI5 design review with the Tesla California and Texas chip engineers. It’s going to be great,” Musk wrote. He then revealed the subsequent schedule: “And AI6 and AI7 will follow in fast succession. AI8 will be out of this world.”","Ming-Chi Kuo, the popular Apple analyst has validated his earlier predictions. In a post shared on social media platform X, Kuo said that Tesla CEO Elon Musk pushed to build Tesla’s own semiconductor fabs. Musk has publicly voiced concerns about the concentration of advanced node capacity in Taiwan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125222709,imgsize-976290,width-400,resizemode-4/elon-musk-tesla.jpg"

The paradox of cheaper AI



The big picture







When OpenAI’s CFO Sarah Friar used the word “backstop” while talking about AI funding, the internet panicked. People thought she meant a government bailout like the 2008 financial crisis. In reality, she was just referring to long-term support for big infrastructure projects.But the reaction showed one thing: most people have no idea what it actually costs to build artificial intelligence at today’s scale — or why those costs sound so huge.Building a large AI model isn’t like creating an app or a website. It’s more like building a national power grid or railway system — massive, complicated, and expensive at the start. Three things make up most of the bill: compute (chips), energy (power), and data (training material).To train a large AI model, companies need tens of thousands of high-end chips called GPUs. The most popular is Nvidia’s H100, which costs around $25,000–$35,000 each. A model like GPT-5 may use 20,000–50,000 of them. That means just the chips alone cost between $1 billion and $2 billion. Add networking, cooling, and servers, and the total crosses $2 billion before training even begins.Each GPU uses about 700 watts of power. Multiply that by tens of thousands, and you get 40–50 megawatts — the same as a mid-sized Indian town.One month of training can cost $5–10 million in electricity. And that doesn’t include cooling costs to stop the chips from overheating.Training data sounds free, but it’s not. You can’t just use random internet content. AI companies need massive, clean, and legally approved datasets — text, images, audio, and video. Creating and storing such data can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. GPT-4’s dataset alone reportedly cost over $100 million. For multimodal AI (which handles video and sound), the cost will be several times more.Add in hundreds of highly paid engineers and scientists, and it’s easy to see how a single training run can cost $2.3–$4 billion.That sounds shocking, but history shows it’s completely normal.Every new technology starts off insanely expensive The high cost of AI today isn’t unusual. Every major technology began as a financial nightmare — and then became cheap and essential. Railways: Britain’s first intercity rail line in 1830 cost £17 million (in today’s money). Investors called it madness. Within decades, costs dropped by 70%, and rail became the backbone of modern transport.: Edison’s first power station in 1882 served only 59 customers at a cost of $9–10 million. Electricity was 40 times more expensive per unit than it is today.The first transatlantic cable cost £1 million and failed after three weeks. But as technology improved, message costs fell from hundreds of dollars to just cents.In the late 1990s, telecoms spent $100 billion laying fibre. Many went bankrupt. Yet within a decade, costs dropped 99%, and fast internet became cheap and universal.Early chip factories cost $100 million. Today’s advanced ones cost $25 billion, but each produces chips worth hundreds of billions over time.The Apollo moon mission cost $25 billion in the 1960s ($257 billion today). That research helped bring down rocket launch costs by more than 90%.The pattern is always the same: Version One is absurdly expensive. Then efficiency, competition, and scale make it cheap.So, how will AI follow the same path? Every expensive part of today’s system — hardware, power, data — already has a roadmap for cost reduction.Right now, Nvidia dominates the GPU market, so prices are high. But competitors like AMD, Google (TPU), Amazon (Trainium), and Intel (Gaudi) are changing that.As more players enter, margins will shrink and costs will drop 20–30%. Specialised chips (ASICs) and “sparse” models that use fewer active components at a time can further cut compute costs by up to 90%.Energy makes up 15–20% of AI costs. But data centres can move to cheaper power locations — hydro in Quebec, geothermal in Iceland, or wind in Texas. That alone cuts costs by half or more.New cooling systems like liquid or immersion cooling also make servers more efficient, cutting power use by another 20–30%.High-bandwidth memory (HBM) is expensive because only a few suppliers dominate the market. New designs and competitors will lower those costs by 30–50% in the next few years.AI labs currently waste up to 40% of their computing power due to poor scheduling. Better job management and “model distillation” — teaching smaller models to behave like large ones — can halve training costs.Future models will also use “continual learning,” updating existing systems instead of retraining from scratch.Running AI models (known as inference) is expensive because it scales with use. But using smaller, optimised models, caching common answers, and switching to specialised chips can reduce inference costs tenfold.AI companies are learning that smaller, cleaner datasets perform better than massive, messy ones. Synthetic data — generated by AI itself — can cut costs by up to 90%.Together, these changes could bring down AI’s total cost threefold within two years, tenfold within five, and up to fiftyfold over a decade.So why not make AI cheaper immediately? Because some parts of the system move at physical speed, not digital speed.Building chip factories takes years. Constructing data centres or new power plants can take a decade. Even when alternatives to Nvidia exist, switching software ecosystems takes time. You can’t speed up steel, silicon, or regulation. But the direction is clear. Every major constraint — from chip supply to energy to data — is being solved. Slowly, but steadily.Even when AI gets cheaper, companies may still spend just as much — or more. This is called the Jevons paradox: when something becomes cheaper, people use more of it. As costs fall, AI will spread everywhere — from hospitals to classrooms to entertainment. The total spending will stay high, but the cost per use will drop dramatically. That’s why OpenAI’s CFO talked about “backstopping” — not to ask for bailouts, but to plan long-term funding for what’s effectively a new industrial revolution.AI today is expensive, loud, and energy-hungry. But that’s how every new technology begins. Over time, competition and efficiency will bring costs down just like they did for railways, electricity, and the internet. The truth is simple: the most expensive AI we’ll ever build is the one we’re building right now. Each new generation will be faster, cheaper, and more normal — until one day, we’ll wonder why it ever seemed expensive at all.","Most people have no idea what it actually costs to build artificial intelligence at today’s scale.

Critical thinking beats coding skills in AI era

Education now a lifelong process, not one-time event





In an era when artificial intelligence can write code, analyse data, and automate countless technical tasks, the most valuable skill for tech professionals may not be technical at all. Guy Diedrich, Cisco's global innovation officer, is sounding the alarm that engineers and programmers who focus solely on technical prowess are missing the forest for the trees.The Cisco exec argues that the ability to ask probing ethical questions—""Should I do this?"" rather than just ""Can I do this?""—will separate thriving careers from obsolete ones. It's a perspective that challenges the traditional STEM-focused education model and suggests that philosophy and critical thinking courses might be just as important as algorithms and data structures.Diedrich, who began his career as a programmer and holds a Ph.D., told Business Insider that critical thinking rooted in humanities education will become essential as AI handles more routine technical work. ""If we have access to all the information in the world at our fingertips, what will be the most important skill moving forward?"" he said. ""It's going to be asking the right questions, like 'Should I do this?'""The warning comes as Cisco's AI consortium report revealed that 92% of jobs will be moderately or severely impacted by AI.Technology is evolving at an unprecedented rate, Diedrich noted, and will soon transition from the current AI era to the quantum age within three to five years.""Let's be honest, it's not overly difficult to learn how to program,"" Diedrich told Business Insider. ""You can't learn how to think critically and solve problems ethically in weeks or even months. It's much more of a lifelong endeavor.""The executive emphasised that students don't need to abandon technical degrees for philosophy majors, but should supplement their education with courses in ethics, psychology, and critical thinking. These skills will prove crucial for making responsible decisions about AI deployment and implementation, particularly as ""so much of the upfront busy work"" gets automated.Diedrich also stressed that younger workers bring fresh perspectives companies desperately need. ""Education used to be an event. You got your degree and you're set,"" he said, according to Business Insider. ""Now, education is a process. It's never-ending.""The technology leader warned that companies risk falling behind when technology surpasses their employees' ability to manage it effectively, making continuous learning essential for career longevity in the AI age.","Guy Diedrich, Cisco's global innovation officer, is sounding the alarm that engineers and programmers who focus solely on technical prowess are missing the forest for the trees.

Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders





The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USICS) has started issuing Requests for Evidence (RFEs) demanding payment of the newly imposed $1,00,000 H-1B visa fee. These RFEs issued by USICS has triggered confusion and concerns among the immigration attorneys and employers. This move made by USICS follows the presidential proclamation made in September this year. For those unaware, US President Donald Trump passed a new order in September 2025 while led to massive increase in the H-1B visa fee. As per the new order, the fresh H-1B visa applications will now be charged a fee of $100,000. Now a report by Economic Times suggests that the increase in the number of RFEs is creating confusion as these requests are appearing in cases where the fee requirement is not applicable. For the uninitiated, RFE is a formal notice issued by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) when an immigration officer determines that a petition or application lacks sufficient documentation to make a decision.According to a report by Economic Times, the immigrations experts reported a noticeable uptick in RFEs even in cases where the fee may not apply. Gnanamookan Senthurjothi, founder of The Visa Code told ET that RFEs are being issued for H-1B recapture time cases, which typically involve reclaiming unused time from the six-year visa limit.This has raised alarms about misinterpretation of the proclamation’s scope.On the other hand, Adam Rosen, managing attorney at Murthy Law Firm informed ET about a critical flaw in the language of the proclamation. Rosen highlighted that proclamation uses “visa” and “status” interchangeably, despite their distinct legal meanings. Along with this, Rosen also questioned the legality of imposing the fee on petitioners rather than beneficiaries, suggesting this could be challenged under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.As per the ET report, many lawsuits have already been filed including by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and H-1B advocacy groups, challenging the fee’s legality. Attorneys are now advising a two-step approach which includes responding to RFE with USCIS’s own guidance to argue exemption and if denied then pursue further federal litigation.Xiao Wang, CEO of Boundless Immigration, said that this confusion started from petitions filed before USCIS issued formal guidance on October 20, leaving employers uncertain about compliance. He also cautioned against assuming the administration intends to broaden the fee’s applicability.The report further adds that this financial and legal uncertainty is compelling the companies to rethink their H-1B sponsorship strategies. Kate Kalmykov, co-chair at Greenberg Traurig, said that going for litigation will be a last resort because of the cost and complexity involved. Instead of going for litigation, the company may now consider to pause the oversea hiring, relocate talent abroad, or invest in domestic upskilling to avoid the steep fee.Wang added that the H-1B program’s volatility is driving a shift toward self-reliance in immigration planning, with employers reserving sponsorships for critical roles only.As reported by ET, Indians account to 70% of all the H-1B visas and they are the ones who are affected the most by this development. The increase in the number of RFEs and legal ambiguity could delay processing times and increase costs for both applicants and sponsoring companies.","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USICS) has started issuing Requests for Evidence (RFEs) demanding payment of the newly imposed $1,00,000 H-1B visa fee.

Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shown support to Noam Shahzeer, Google employee who recently drew attention for his remarks on gender and identity. According to a report by The Information, Shahzeer was asked about how Google employees could support their transgender and non-binary colleagues in an internal discussion forum. Shahzeer reportedly responded saying “I do not believe that humans have an attribute called gender”.“I do not believe that G-d puts people in the wrong bodies. I do not believe that it is okay to sterilise children. You have the right to your beliefs. I do not share them,” Shahzeer continued. As per the report, his remarks drew internal flaks with Google censoring him.Elon Musk, who has constantly criticized what he calls ‘the woke mind virus’ responded to the report, saying “Noam is right”.The tech billionaire has repeatedly argued that discussions around gender fluidity, pronoun use, and children’s medical transitions have gone too far — calling them examples of ideology overriding science and reason.He has described gender ideology as a “symptom” of the woke mind virus, claiming it pressures people to conform to beliefs they may not share. Musk has also opposed gender-affirming medical treatments for minors and has said that people should not be “forced to use made-up pronouns.”Interestingly, Shazeer quit Google in 2021 only to be rehired again in 2024 for around $2.7 billion. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, Shahzeer left Google to start his own company after the search giant refused to release a chatbot he developed. He started Character.AI which soon became popular.Google’s decision to bring Shazeer back — and pay billions to do so — underscores just how fierce the competition in AI has become. The company’s move reflects a growing willingness among tech giants to spend unprecedented sums to secure top AI talent and technology, even at the risk of overvaluation.The deal has also sparked debate within the tech community about whether such massive payouts are sustainable. Some industry observers see it as a bold move to maintain Google’s edge in artificial intelligence, while others view it as evidence of panic amid the rapid advances of rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shown support to Noam Shahzeer, Google employee who recently drew attention for his remarks on gender and identity.

Meta employees are reportedly turning to the company’s own AI chatbot to help write their performance reviews. According to a Business Insider report, the tool is reportedly being used by staff to streamline year-end reviews, even though some employees say it doesn’t always understand context. The internal AI assistant, called Metamate, works like ChatGPT and can scan through an employee’s documents to summarize their achievements and feedback.The report quotes a Meta employee named Joseph Spisak – product director in Meta’s Superintelligence Labs. Speaking at the TechEquity AI Summit in Sunnyvale, California, Spisak said that he uses Metamate to summarize his performance for reviews.“When at the end of the year we do our performance, and I want to summarize my performance or whatever, I call Metamate and it goes and searches all my docs and what I've done and summarizes what I've done for the year and my accomplishments and feedback on me,” Spisak said. “And it's great.”Spisak joked that some might even try to “reward hack it,” after being asked whether employees could bribe the system to boost evaluations.According to the report, Spisak also noted that Meta’s AI systems are being used for other internal purposes, such as building apps and analyzing data.A Meta employee, who spoke to the outlet on condition of anonymity, said while Metamate can be helpful, its output is inconsistent without proper context. “The AI often struggles without detailed context about individual projects,” they said, adding that they use it mainly to generate coworker feedback templates.The development comes as Meta continues to integrate AI deeper into its daily operations, joining other Silicon Valley giants in reimagining workplace productivity through artificial intelligence."," Meta employees are reportedly turning to the company's own AI chatbot to help write their performance reviews.

China as an “enemy” or “threat”





After Netherlands and Denmark, here's another country that seems to have just realised that its buses can be brought to standstill by China. According to a report by Financial Times, the UK government is investigating whether hundreds of Chinese-made electric buses on British roads could be remotely deactivated. Officials at the Department for Transport (DfT) are working with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to determine whether Yutong, the world’s largest bus manufacturer, has the ability to access the control systems of its vehicles in the UK for software updates and diagnostics.The probe follows a Norwegian investigation that found Yutong buses could be “stopped or rendered inoperable” by the Zhengzhou-based company. Denmark has also opened its own review in light of the findings. Yutong has supplied roughly 700 electric buses to the UK. The company is also seeking to expand into London’s market with a newly developed double-decker electric model designed to meet Transport for London (TfL) standards.A DfT spokesperson reportedly said, “We are looking into the case and working closely with the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre to understand the technical basis for the actions taken by the Norwegian and Danish authorities.”Investigation by Denmark authourities found that remote deactivation of buses could be prevented by removing their SIM cards, but they decided against this because it would also disconnect the bus from other systems.TfL confirmed that none of its operators currently use Yutong buses, nor have any been ordered. “Any buses entering service in London have to meet our robust technical requirements, including rigorous testing,” the agency said.In a statement to The Sunday Times, Yutong said it “strictly complies with the applicable laws, regulations and industry standards of the locations where its vehicles operate.” The company added that its data collection practices are limited to “vehicle-related maintenance, optimisation and improvement,” and that all data is encrypted and access-controlled. “No one is allowed to access or view this data without customer authorisation,” Yutong said, adding that it complies fully with EU data protection laws.The Norwegian transport operator Ruter recently revealed that its testing had found Yutong retained remote access to the bus’s battery and power management systems, unlike a comparable vehicle from Dutch manufacturer VDL. Ruter concluded that, in theory, Yutong could “stop or render inoperable” the bus, though the risk could be mitigated by removing its SIM card to cut connectivity.Denmark’s largest public transport company, Movia, has launched a similar investigation but emphasised that the issue of remote access is not unique to Chinese manufacturers. Many electric vehicles (EVs), including those from Western companies, allow software updates via remote connectivity.Still, the inquiry comes amid heightened political scrutiny of China’s role in British infrastructure and technology. Lawmakers have debated whether Beijing should be classified as an “enemy” or a “threat,” particularly as concerns grow over cybersecurity vulnerabilities.",The UK government is investigating whether hundreds of Chinese-made electric buses on British roads could be remotely deactivated.

Huang says 'no discussion' to sell Blackwell chips to China





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently praised its longtime partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Speaking to reporters at an event held by TSMC in Hsinchu (Taiwan), Huang said “TSMC is doing a very good job supporting us on wafers”, adding that Nvidia's success would not be possible without TSMC. Huang is on a fourth public trip to Taiwan this year.According to a Reuters report, the chipmaker CEO also told reporters that it is experiencing ""very strong demand"" for its Blackwell chips.“Nvidia builds the GPU (graphics processing units), but we also build the CPU (central processing units), the networking, the switches, and so there are a lot of chips associated with Blackwell”.During his interaction with reporters, Huang was asked how concerned he was about memory shortages. To this he replied saying business was growing strongly and there would be shortages of “different things.”""We have three very, very good memory makers - SK Hynix, Samsung, Micron - are all incredibly good memory makers, and they have scaled up tremendous capacity to support us,"" Huang said.He further added that Nvidia has received the most advanced chip samples from all three memory makers.Answering one question about possible memory price increases, he said: ""it's for them to decide how to run their business.""Huang also said that there were ""no active discussions"" about selling Blackwell chips to China. The Trump administration has banned sales of Nvidia's flagship artificial-intelligence chip to China, saying they could aid the Chinese military and the country's AI industry.Last week, Huang challenged US export controls on advanced semiconductors, arguing that continued technology collaboration and access to the Chinese market are ultimately in America’s best interest. Speaking to reporters, Huang described China as a “singular, vital, important, dynamic market, and nobody can replace that.”“It’s in the best interest of America to serve that China market. It’s in the best interest of China to have the American technology company bring ... technology to the China market ... It’s in the best interest of both countries, and I hope that policymakers will ultimately come to that conclusion,” Huang then said.","Huang says 'no discussion' to sell Blackwell chips to China.

EV maker Rivian follows Tesla’s model with Elon Musk-style $4.6 billion pay package for CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ev-maker-rivian-follows-teslas-model-with-elon-musk-style-4-6-billion-pay-package-for-ceo/articleshow/125199035.cms,"Rivian CEO package details



Following the Musk model







Electric vehicle maker Rivian has announced a compensation plan for CEO RJ Scaringe worth as much as $4.6 billion over the next decade. This follows the model established by Tesla CEO Elon Musk 's record pay package and linking rewards to new profit targets and lower share price milestones than a previous deal. Rivian's pay package for Scaringe may rank among the richest in corporate history, depending on performance goals achieved.Under the new plan, Scaringe is receiving options to purchase up to 36.5 million shares of Rivian's Class A stock, approximately 16 million more than the previous grant, at an exercise price of $15.22 per share, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.This pay award will only be given to the CEO if the company meets two main sets of goals:Rivian's stock price must reach certain reduced milestones, ranging from $40 up to $140 per share, over the next 10 years.The company must also hit new targets for its operating income and cash flow over the next seven years.If Rivian hits all milestones, Scaringe will receive up to $4.6 billion, including the costs of exercising options, according to Reuters. Rivian said shareholders will gain $153 billion in value.Last week, Tesla shareholders approved a record $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk based on operational and valuation milestones over 10 years.Rivian said the plan will retain its founder and keep him focused on growth and profitability as the automaker, known for its R1S SUVs and R1T pickups, prepares to launch its smaller, more affordable R2 SUV next year. The R2 will compete with Tesla's best-selling Model Y crossover.Rivian's board also doubled Scaringe's base salary to $2 million, saying the changes were made with input from an independent compensation consultant and designed to better align pay with shareholder returns.Separately, Scaringe was granted 1 million common units in Mind Robotics, a newly formed Rivian spinoff with external funding developing industrial AI technology.","Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe is receiving options to purchase up to 36.5 million shares of Rivian's Class A stock, approximately 16 million more than the previous grant.

Tech executives flying private jets to the Web Summit technology conference in Portugal are being forced to land as far away as Badajoz in Spain as Lisbon's main airport struggles to accommodate growing numbers of visitors using personal aircraft. According to a report by the Financial Times, the organisers of one of the largest tech events have warned that the airport is turning away some private jets after receiving complaints from delegates about being required to use landing sites several hours’ drive away.The report says that this is the first time the event, an industry gathering with thousands of visitors including start-ups, government delegations, and technology leaders, has experienced such a bottleneck. The situation indicates more visitors are choosing to fly privately.“Please be advised that there is currently a shortage of private jet slots during Web Summit at Lisbon Airport (LIS) and surrounding smaller airports,” the event organisers said.“Lisbon Airport is experiencing difficulty managing the volume of traffic, resulting in a lack of available take-off and landing slots for all operations,” they added.The organisers added that “some guests, in particular those with larger planes, have found the only viable landing slots during Web Summit are now upwards of two hours' drive from Lisbon, including in Spain.”“These are circumstances outside of our control, and we apologise that we cannot do more to help secure slots. We would strongly advise flying commercial into Lisbon.”The bottleneck is partly due to increased conference attendance. Web Summit, which moved from Ireland to Lisbon approximately a decade ago, has grown into one of the tech world's largest events. The number of start-ups exhibiting at the show, which spans multiple event halls and a stadium, has increased more than six-fold over the past decade to more than 1,000 this year.More than 75 governments will send delegations to the event this year, either accompanying start-ups seeking investment or as officials and ministers meet entrepreneurs working in areas such as AI. Many delegations travel on government or royal jets to accommodate large parties. There is a trend toward private jet use among tech company founders.","Tech executives flying private jets to the Web Summit technology conference in Portugal are being forced to land as far away as Badajoz in Spain.

Bezos’ Vision: A bet on the internet



Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos recently revealed the advice he once received from a student of Harvard Business School. Jeff Bezos once revealed that a Harvard student advised him to sell Amazon to Barnes & Noble and exit the business just as the company was preparing to go public in 1997. The anecdote, recounted in Brad Stone’s 2013 book The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon, captures the early skepticism surrounding Amazon’s business model. During a classroom visit, Bezos was told bluntly, “You seem like a really nice guy, so don’t take this the wrong way, but you really need to sell to Barnes & Noble and get out now.”At the time, Amazon was just an online bookstore and was facing a lot of competition from other well-established retailers. Barnes & Noble had just launched its own website, BN.com, in May 1997, and many believed traditional retail giants would crush digital newcomers.Jeff Bezos revealed that instead of following the advice from the Harvard student, Bezos went ahead and doubled down his vision. Amazon went public in May 1997 and then started expanding aggressively. Over the next two decades, the company launched the Amazon Prime service in order to build customer loyalty.After this, in 2006 Amazon introduced Amazon Web Services (AWS). Then, in 2017, Amazon went ahead and acquired Whole Foods and in 2022, the company bought MGM Studios.Amazon also scaled its third-party marketplace, built a vast logistics network, and grew into a dominant player in advertising and payments.Amazon then, went ahead and became a global tech giant and on the other hand Barnes & Noble remained focused on physical retail. After years of declining sales, the chain has recently staged a modest revival and is reportedly exploring a potential IPO in London or New York, according to the Financial Times.Bezos, a Princeton-trained computer scientist, left his role as VP at hedge fund D.E. Shaw in 1994 after reading a report that said web usage was growing at 2,300% per year. “I’d never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast,” he said in a 2010 Princeton speech. That insight led him to launch Amazon as an online bookstore with millions of titles. The Harvard student may have seen a risky startup. Bezos saw a once-in-a-generation opportunity—and built one of the most transformative companies in history.","A Harvard student advised Jeff Bezos to sell Amazon to Barnes & Noble and exit the business just as the company was preparing to go public in 1997.

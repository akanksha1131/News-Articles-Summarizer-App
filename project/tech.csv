TCS responds to the layoffs



Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest IT services is presently facing backlash after announcing its plans to layoff around 12000 employees. The fresh round of layoffs will mark as the company’s biggest workforce reduction till date. This move of TCS has led to multiple protests across various cities. The protests are organised by Union of IT & ITES Employees (UNITE).UNITE has also posted about the protects on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). “TCS is retrenching workers not out of necessity, but for profit. Targeting senior employees & pushing illegal layoffs is an attack on job security across IT. Workers are not numbers on a balance sheet — we demand justice!” UNITE posted on X.UNITE supported by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), staged demonstrations this week, demanding that TCS reverse its decision and urging government intervention. “Union of IT And ITES Employees protested tofay in Chennai against the announced TCS layoff of 12000 employees and the government inaction,” wrote the Union association in a post shared on X.The union alleges that the layoffs have disproportionately targeted experienced mid-level and senior level professionals. The union also accuse the company of firing professionals with strong performance record and leadership credentials.UNITE is also planning to escalate its campaign globally if the authorise doesn’t act in time.In an official statement the IT giant said: ""TCS is on a journey to become a future-ready organisation… As part of this journey, we will also be releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible. This will impact about 2% of our global workforce, primarily in the middle and the senior grades, over the course of the year.""This transition is being planned with due care to ensure there is no impact on service delivery to our clients… We understand that this is a challenging time for our colleagues likely to be affected. We thank them for their service and we will be making all efforts to provide appropriate benefits, outplacement, counselling, and support as they transition to new opportunities,” added the company.TCS has also announced that it will give proper benefits, counselling, outplacement and support to the impacted employees. Along with this, the company will also be giving notice period compensation and severance benefits to the affected employees.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest IT services is facing backlash after announcing its plans to layoff around 12000 employees.

Jay Blahnik, the executive behind the Apple Watch's popular ""Close Your Rings"" fitness feature, has been accused of creating a toxic and verbally abusive work environment, a report claims. Nine current and former employees have reportedly alleged that Blahnik's behaviour, which they described as manipulative and inappropriate, led more than 10 workers (which is nearly 10% of his team) to take extended medical or mental health leaves since 2022. The employees of the Cupertino-based tech giant also noted that when confronted, Apple protected Blahnik. The company reportedly settled a sexual harassment complaint and is currently fighting a lawsuit from an employee, Mandana Mofidi, who alleges that he bullied her. Despite the internal investigation, which Apple officials said found no evidence of wrongdoing, Blahnik has remained in his position as Vice President for Fitness Technologies.In a statement to The New York Times, Lance Lin, an Apple spokesperson, said:He explained that Apple carefully reviewed workplace concerns but did not comment on matters involving individual employees to protect their privacy.Lin also noted that the company tookand was “However, he didn’t provide any specific examples of the inaccuracies when asked to discuss the allegations brought forward by the report.he added.In a legal filing, Apple further denied that there had been “harassment, discrimination, retaliation or any other harm.” It also noted that Mofidi had “received constructive feedback and coaching from her supervisors in response to a well-documented history of unresolved performance issues.”Before departing the company last year after a mental health leave, Kayla Desautels, the fitness team’s social media coordinator, said:She said to NYT that she hadThe report also cited the nine current and former employees to claim that, despite having extensive experience in the role, Blahnik frequently made unprofessional remarks.In 2021, Blahnik allegedly made inappropriate jokes about Olympic skier Ted Ligety, trainers’ bodies, and colleagues’ personal lives, the report claimed citing multiple employees.He was also accused of making lewd remarks about a manager’s family, leering at creative director Wil Tidman, and sending Tidman an unsettling late-night text in 2022, which led Tidman to take medical leave and later reach a settlement with Apple.Separately, Mofidi claimed in a lawsuit that she was underpaid compared to male peers and was soon contacted by HR to discuss harassment allegations against Blahnik.In her lawsuit, Mofidi alleged that after being contacted about harassment claims against Blahnik, she faced retaliation, including being yelled at in meetings, getting criticised by his subordinates, and being pressured to leave through a performance plan or buyout.She said the experience was isolating and damaging to her mental health, eventually forcing her onto medical leave. Despite HR assurances, she claimed retaliation persisted, her transfer request was denied, and she resigned. A trial for this lawsuit is scheduled for 2027.","Jay Blahnik, the executive behind the Apple Watch's popular ""Close Your Rings"" fitness feature, has been accused of creating a toxic and verbally abusive work environment.

Medical technology company Masimo has sued US Customs and Border Protection , alleging the agency improperly allowed Apple to import its smartwatches with blood-oxygen sensors. The lawsuit claims that Customs reversed a previous decision without notifying Masimo, a key player in the ongoing patent dispute between the two companies. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the lawsuit, which was filed in a Washington, DC federal court, Masimo claimed learning about the agency’s August 1 decision only after Apple announced it would reintroduce the blood-oxygen feature to its watches last week. Masimo, which is based in Irvine, California, has separately accused Apple in federal court of hiring its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology.In 2023, Masimo convinced the US International Trade Commission to block imports of Apple’s Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches, after determining that Apple’s blood oxygen technology infringed Masimo’s patents.Since then, Apple has sold redesigned versions of the watches without pulse oximetry, which US Customs have approved. Earlier this month, Apple said it would restore the blood-oxygen feature with Customs’ approval. At the same time, Masimo argued that the decision was made without its input or sufficient explanation, undermining the company’s rights, the Reuters report noted.Masimo said as per the Reuters report.Masimo has also asked the Washington court to overturn the agency’s ruling and maintain the ban on Apple selling watches with the blood-oxygen feature.Last year, a federal jury in Delaware awarded Apple $250 after determining that Masimo's original smartwatch designs infringed on Apple's design patents. While this ruling favoured Apple, its scope was limited, as it mostly applied to older Masimo products.","Medical technology company Masimo has sued US Customs and Border Protection, alleging the agency improperly allowed Apple to import its smartwatches with blood-oxygen sensors.

Chinese law creates security concerns for tech giants



Pattern of alleged leaks spans over a decade



Microsoft has curtailed Chinese companies' access to advance notifications about cybersecurity vulnerabilities after investigating whether leaked information led to massive hacks targeting its SharePoint software, according to Bloomberg. The company restricted access last month for participants in countries ""where they're required to report vulnerabilities to their governments,"" which includes China.The decision affects the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), which provides security firms worldwide with early details about software flaws so they can protect customers faster. More than 400 government agencies and corporations were breached in recent SharePoint attacks that Microsoft blamed on state-sponsored Chinese hackers , including the US National Nuclear Security Administration, Reuters reported.The restrictions stem partly from a 2021 Chinese law requiring companies and researchers to report cybersecurity vulnerabilities to China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology within 48 hours. This mandate raises concerns that sensitive information could be shared with government-backed hackers.Under the new policy, affected Chinese MAPP participants will no longer receive ""proof of concept"" code demonstrating vulnerabilities. Instead, they'll get general written descriptions sent simultaneously with public patch releases, eliminating their previous 24-hour advance notice, Bloomberg reported.This isn't Microsoft's first concern about Chinese MAPP partners. In 2012, the company accused Hangzhou DPtech Technologies of breaching agreements and exposing Windows vulnerabilities. In 2021, Microsoft suspected two Chinese partners leaked Exchange server information, enabling a global hacking campaign attributed to the Chinese espionage group Hafnium, according to previous Bloomberg reporting.Dakota Cary, a cybersecurity consultant at SentinelOne, called Microsoft's decision ""fantastic,"" noting that ""Chinese companies in MAPP have to respond to incentives from the government.""Microsoft also confirmed to Reuters it shuttered ""transparency centers"" in China where the government previously reviewed source code for potential backdoors. These facilities have been ""long retired,"" with no visits since 2019, ending a program that began in 2003 when Microsoft became the first commercial software company providing Chinese authorities source code access.","Microsoft has curtailed Chinese companies' access to advance notifications about cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Ricoh just announced the GR IV, giving their compact camera that's been a darling among street photographers its first real sequel in six years. Yes, we're not counting alphabet soup variants like the GR IIIx or HDF models – this is the real deal, we're talking step ups wherever it counts – complete with a hefty price bump.The GR IV launches in September at $1,499.95, a $600 jump from the original GR III's sub-$1,000 launch price back in 2019. And if we were to count in the alphabet soup ones – it's about $350 more than them. That's some serious inflation, even by camera standards.So what's driving that price hike? Ricoh says it has packed in a new 26-megapixel APS-C sensor , redesigned that iconic 28mm-equivalent f/2.8 lens, and added proper 5-axis image stabilisation .

The autofocus system got a complete overhaul too, promising snappier performance and better subject tracking.The camera still maintains that pocketable form factor that's been adored by all, and it's also lighter than most phones at just 262 grams fully loaded, but has the same sized sensor as much larger cameras. Oh, you also get a generous 53 gigs of internal storage (for some this might alone justify the price jump), and if you run out of that, you can put in your microSD card.Ricoh didn't shy away from giving us some sample images shot with the GR IV, and they definitely look better than what we've seen out of the GR III. The sample shots we've seen so far? They're looking pretty impressive, and you can probably thank that new sensor and beefed-up stabilisation for that. That distinctive GR look – the one that made street photographers fall in love with them – is still very much there.All that said, yes, the price sting is real, but knowing the GR's cult following, it's safe to say not everybody who wants one will get to have one, at least for a while.","The GR IV launches in September at $1,499.95, a $600 jump from the original GR III's sub-$1,000 launch price back in 2019.

WhatsApp Makes Group Calls Smarter

At least 18 people were recently arrested at Microsoft's Redmond campus during the second day of pro-Palestinian protests , a report claims. The group, which included current and former Microsoft employees, was protesting the company's contracts to supply artificial intelligence technology to the Israeli military. According to a report by Komonews, the local police said that officers responded to a large gathering where protesters allegedly poured paint on a Microsoft sign, blocked a pedestrian bridge, and used stolen furniture to create a barrier. The group named “No Azure For Apartheid” claims the technology is being used to “surveil, starve and kill Palestinians.” In response, the tech giant said it is looking into the use of its Azure platform in Israel.However, the report doesn’t specify how many of the arrested protestors are current Microsoft employees. Police added that these individuals may face charges of trespassing, resisting arrest, obstruction, and malicious mischief. No injuries were reported at the latest protest, which took place a day after the same group demonstrated at Microsoft’s campus, but that ended without any arrests.In its latest statement, a spokesperson for Microsoft said,Microsoft also added:the company said last week.Tensions between Microsoft and some current and former employees have been rising after recent firings of staff who protested the company’s contracts.

UPI Transactions Getting Safer: Big Change Explained

Amid growing concerns over the immense energy demands of artificial intelligence (AI), Google has announced that it has reduced the environmental footprint of its AI models, claiming a more than 30-fold decrease in the energy consumed by its Gemini AI over the last year. The company also released a comprehensive new methodology for measuring the energy, water and carbon emissions of its AI systems.According to a report released by the company, the median energy consumption per text prompt in its Gemini Apps decreased by a factor of 33x over a 12-month period. The associated carbon footprint saw an even more significant drop, decreasing by 44x, the company claimed.These advancements are attributed to a “full stack” approach, focusing on maximising efficiency from custom-designed hardware to the software and models running in their data centers.""As we continue to invest in the technology and innovation needed to meet significant new energy demands, transparency is key to progress,"" Google said.In the report, Google disclosed that a median text prompt using its Gemini Apps consumes approximately 0.24 watt-hours (Wh) of energy, contextualising this by stating that the energy consumed by a median AI prompt is now equivalent to watching television for less than nine seconds.It also said that each query processing emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e), and uses 0.26 milliliters of water — equivalent to about five drops.As mentioned, a central point of Google's paper is its push for a more holistic measurement methodology. The company argued that many public estimates of AI energy consumption are “optimistic at best” because they often only account for the power used by active AI accelerator chips (like GPUs and TPUs).Google’s new, more comprehensive approach also factors in several critical real-world elements, including:The company claims these efficiency improvements are the result of a “full-stack” approach, which involves optimising every layer of its AI operations. This includes designing more efficient model architectures like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), refining algorithms, and co-designing its custom-built Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) hardware to maximise performance per watt.","Google claims to have reduced the environmental footprint of its AI models by more than 30-fold over the last year.

""You said the A-word. Can we talk about Apple?"" Jimmy Fallon, emcee for the night, joked during Google's ""Made by Google 2025"" event after a Google executive mentioned Apple's MagSafe accessories. The quip perfectly captured the tone of Pixel 10 launch, where Google executives repeatedly took shots at Apple.""At Pixel, we are confident in our product, and in our brand, and we love everybody in the game, so we can say anyone's name we want on this stage,"" Google VP of marketing Adrienne Lofton fired back, drawing cheers from the crowd at the New York event hosted by the late-night TV host.The roasting began early when Rick Osterloh , Google's senior vice president of platforms and devices, addressed AI phone features . ""There has been a lot of hype about this, and frankly, a lot of broken promises too, but Gemini is the real deal,"" he said, seemingly pointing fingers at Apple's delayed rollout Apple Intelligence that was promised over a year ago. Not the first time, we heard that.Lofton didn't hold back when discussing platform approaches, taking aim at Apple's iOS ecosystem, although she didn’t say Apple or iPhone outloud, but it was clear at whom the shots were targeted. ""Some companies build their phones to lock you in, and force you to use their devices in only one way,"" she said. ""It seems like that way sometimes doesn't work exactly as you expect or as you need.""The Google executive positioned Android as ""the most open platform that's built for freedom of choice,"" contrasting it with what critics call Apple's ""walled garden"" approach.Lofton also addressed the long-running green versus blue text bubble debate, calling it ""silly"" and ""tired."" She noted that with Apple's recent adoption of RCS messaging protocol, Android and iPhone users can now share high-quality photos and use emoji reactions properly. ""At Google, we're done with that conversation,"" she declared.Even iPhone camera quality wasn't safe from Google's jabs. When Fallon displayed a Reddit comment claiming ""iPhones don't take the best pics,"" the audience erupted in cheers while Osterloh laughed and said, ""We hear that a lot.""

Nvidia Headquarters: Voyager and Endeavor







The triangle motif: A nod to 3D graphics

AI-driven architecture and innovation

Nature, skylights, and sustainability

Nvidia’s $920 million headquarters in Santa Clara, California, is more than just an office complex, it’s a celebration of the company’s history, technology, and design philosophy. Dominated by triangular motifs in structures, walkways, windows, and skylights, the campus reflects Nvidia’s roots in 3D graphics , where triangles form the foundation of modern rendering. The headquarters features two signature buildings, Voyager (750,000 sq. ft.) and Endeavor (500,000 sq. ft.), both named after Star Trek ships to reflect Nvidia’s futuristic, tech-driven culture. Built with AI-assisted design tools and Nvidia GPUs, the buildings themselves are a literal product of the technology the company develops.The headquarters consists of Voyager and Endeavor, connected by a four-acre park. Endeavor was completed in 2017, while Voyager wrapped up in 2022. Both buildings were designed using machine learning and custom visualization software powered by Nvidia GPUs, optimizing daylight, acoustics, employee flow, and collaboration spaces. This AI-assisted approach allowed Nvidia to turn its headquarters into a real-world demonstration of its own technology, blending efficiency, innovation, and design.Triangles are the simplest polygon in 3D graphics, and all complex 3D shapes are ultimately built from a mesh of interconnected triangles. Nvidia’s heavy use of triangles throughout its headquarters is both symbolic and practical. The motif pays homage to the company’s history, specifically its early experiments with graphics chips. Nvidia’s first chip, the NV1, tried to render curved surfaces but was overly complex and lacked developer support. Learning from that, Nvidia returned to triangle-based graphics with the NV3, which became the foundation of modern GPU design and enabled the company to thrive.By incorporating giant triangles into the buildings, skylights, walkways, and even landscaping, Nvidia is visually expressing the same principle: complex systems are built from simple, strong elements. The triangles in the campus serve as a constant reminder of precision, efficiency, and innovation, tying the company’s architectural design directly to its technological identity. In other words, every triangle you see is a tribute to Nvidia’s graphics legacy, showing that even the most advanced technology starts with simple, well-designed building blocks.Nvidia and its design partner, Gensler, leveraged AI and GPU-powered tools to optimize the layout for collaboration, efficiency, and employee well-being. Indoor and outdoor paths were carefully planned to reduce travel time while encouraging spontaneous interactions, similar to Apple Park’s circular walkways. Project manager Jack Dahlgren noted that if Nvidia builds a third facility, AI will almost certainly play a central role in its design, continuing the company’s tradition of integrating technology into physical spaces.The campus features 511 triangular skylights and over 14,000 plants, including an 80-foot living wall. These elements enhance natural lighting, improve air quality, and create a healthier work environment. By blending nature, triangles, and technology, Nvidia demonstrates how architecture can embody both aesthetic appeal and functional innovation while aligning with sustainability goals.Nvidia’s headquarters illustrates how technology, design, and corporate history can intersect. Triangles symbolize resilience, innovation, and a return to foundational principles in graphics processing. By embedding these lessons into the campus, Nvidia created more than a workplace, it crafted a tangible expression of its identity, showing how corporate culture, technology, and architecture can coexist in harmony.","N Nvidia’s $920 million headquarters in Santa Clara, California, is dominated by triangular motifs in structures, walkways, windows, and skylights.

The Endgame: Profit over people



Missing the moral framework



Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman also warns of AI Psychosis



Geoffrey Hinton , popularly known as the father of AI recently shared a pointed critique of the way the tech industry is approaching artificial intelligence. In an interview with Fortune, Hilton claimed that the tech companies are not thinking about humanity. Hilton emphasise that the tech companies are locked into a race for short-term profit and are ignoring the long-term consequences of unleashing superintelligent systems without adequate safeguards.Speaking to Fortune, Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern that the present trajectory of AI development is driven by competitive pressure and shareholder interests and not ethical foresight. “Companies are focused on building more powerful models faster than their rivals,” he said, warning that this arms race could lead to catastrophic outcomes if superintelligent AI systems are deployed without proper alignment to human values.Hinton also stressed on the fact that the actual danger is not just misinformation or unemployment, but it is the potential of AI to grow beyond human control. “We’re not ready,” Hinton cautioned, “and we’re not even trying to be.”As per Hinton, one of the biggest blindspot in the corporate AI strategy is the lack of moral framework. He emphasised that while the companies are investing billions in scaling models and monetising user data, only few companies are actually addressing and talking about the existential risks posed by artificial general intelligence. He also asked for global cooperation, likening the challenge to nuclear non-proliferation: “We need treaties, oversight, and shared ethical standards.”A call for pause and reflectionAs per the interview given to Fortune, Hinton’s message is quite clear: slow down. He feels that the pace of AI advancement has gone ahead of society’s ability to regulate or even understand its implications. He asked the researchers, regulators and tech leaders to give importance to safety, transparency and long-term thinking.In related news, As part of a new revelation about AI, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’. For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at a recent interview, Suleyman explained AI psychosis as a “real and emerging risk” which can easily affect vulnerable individuals who become deeply immersed in conversations with AI agents. The condition will mainly affect the individuals whose interactions blur the line between human and machine.","Geoffrey Hinton, popularly known as the father of AI, has shared a pointed critique of the way the tech industry is approaching artificial intelligence.

Investor concerns mount over Meta's AI spending spree



Meta has abruptly frozen all hiring in its artificial intelligence division last week as part of a broader restructuring of its ""Superintelligence Lab,"" according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Wall Street Journal. The freeze prohibits both external hiring and internal team transfers, with exceptions requiring approval from Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang.The dramatic move follows Meta's unprecedented AI talent war , during which the company hired over 50 researchers and engineers from competitors including OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Apple, and Anthropic. Some recruits received compensation packages worth up to $100 million, with one researcher reportedly offered $1.5 billion total compensation. CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally reached out to targets via email and WhatsApp, demonstrating his direct involvement in the high-stakes recruitment campaign.To secure top talent, Meta paid $14 billion for a stake in Scale AI to bring on co-founder Alexandr Wang as its chief AI officer. The company also recruited former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Safe Superintelligence co-founder Daniel Gross, whose courtship involved Meta offering to buy stakes in their venture firm. Zuckerberg also went on to poach ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao .The restructuring has triggered significant departures from Meta's AI ranks, creating a brain drain that undermines the company's massive investment. According to The New York Times, key figures including research scientist Angela Fan, who helped build Meta's Llama AI model, recently left for OpenAI. Loredana Crisan, vice president of generative AI, is joining software company Figma as chief design officer. Former AI research head Joelle Pineau departed earlier this year for AI startup Cohere.The turmoil stems from disappointing performance of Meta's latest AI models released in April. The company has since abandoned its previous ""Behemoth"" frontier model to start fresh, according to NYT sources. This setback prompted Zuckerberg to become personally involved in recruiting new talent and dissolving the AGI Foundations team that had overseen the failed project.Adding to the internal chaos, new AI leadership has begun aggressive restructuring. Former OpenAI researcher Shengjia Zhao, now Meta's chief AI scientist, has been interviewing existing employees for new roles within the reorganised structure, questioning them about their past work and creating uncertainty among longtime staff members.Meta's AI division is now split into four groups: superintelligence research, AI products, infrastructure, and long-term exploration projects. The upheaval mirrors Meta's previous technology pivots, particularly its costly metaverse initiative that saw massive hiring followed by significant layoffs when market enthusiasm cooled.The hiring freeze reflects growing investor scrutiny over Meta's spiraling AI costs, which have raised questions about return on investment. Morgan Stanley analysts warned in an August 18 research note that lavish stock-based compensation packages offered to AI talent could threaten the company's ability to return capital to shareholders through buybacks.Meta's capital expenditures could reach $72 billion this year, primarily for AI data centers and researcher salaries. The company's aggressive spending has contributed to recent technology stock selloffs as investors question whether massive AI investments will generate proportional returns. The freeze suggests Meta is attempting to control costs while consolidating its scattered AI efforts.The timing is particularly challenging as the broader tech industry faces mounting pressure to demonstrate tangible results from AI investments. While Meta's advertising business has benefited from AI improvements, the company's pursuit of ""superintelligence"" remains largely theoretical, creating tension between immediate financial pressures and long-term technological ambitions.A Meta spokesperson characterised the freeze as ""basic organizational planning"" following the company's hiring spree and annual budgeting exercises, though the duration remains undetermined. The company maintains that the restructuring aims to accelerate AI product development and achieve superintelligence goals more efficiently.","Meta has frozen all hiring in its artificial intelligence division.

Google Pixel 10 series is official. The company has launched Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, Pixel 10 Pro Fold as well as Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a. The Made by Google 2025 is the perfect moment to reflect on the entire Google Pixel series and its evolution over the past decade.From its beginnings with the early Nexus phones in 2010, which laid the groundwork for Google's vision of Android hardware, to the Pixel smartphones (launched in 2016) of today, each iteration has marked a significant step in the company’s journey to define the Android experience.Google’s Pixel journey began with a clear ambition: to showcase Android as Google intended, integrating hardware and software in the best manner. Whether its computational photography or on-device artificial intelligence (AI), over the years, Pixel drove continuous innovation and hiccups – even setbacks. Each model has contributed to building the Pixel identity, establishing its reputation for smart features and a pure Android experience.However, Google’s Pixel lineup hasn’t been able to launch like Samsung and Apple but has gradually captured some market share. According to Canalys Q2 2025 data, Google is the fourth largest smartphone company in the US as it shipped 800,000 smartphones in the quarter, capturing 3% of market share. The global market share remains significantly lower.As we stand on the cusp of the Pixel 10 launch, which can be a landmark event for Google's hardware division, here are the 5 reasons why this year’s showcase is shaping up to be more than just another product launch.This year's event marks a significant milestone: the 10th anniversary of Pixel devices. Dating back to the Nexus series with the Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P—the last of those smartphones—this makes the Pixel line the first of Google's hardware product lineups to demonstrate such continuous consistency. No other Google hardware has been released for so many consecutive years.And what better way to celebrate a decade of innovation than with a touch of star power? Jimmy Fallon hosted the event, adding an engaging flair to the proceedings to the growing appeal of the Pixel brand.The Pixel 10 represents a major step towards Google’s vision of a truly integrated smartphone. Pixel 6 introduced Tensor chips that are designed by Google and manufactured by Samsung. For the first time, the custom-designed Tensor G5 SoC will be manufactured by TSMC – which also makes chips for Qualcomm and Apple.Google says that Tensor G5 is its biggest upgrade yet as it delivers a major performance boost. The Tensor G5 offers up to 60% more powerful TPU 1 and 34% faster on average CPU. Reports have also claimed that the modem will still be supplied by Samsung, unlike Apple that debuted its C1 modem in iPhone 16e.For the first time ever, every model in the Google Pixel 10 series will feature a triple camera setup. This move signals Google's commitment to upholding its reputation as the gold standard for computational photography, suggesting a continued focus on blending advanced hardware with its industry-leading computational processing.Moreover, breaking from its historical trend of yearly design overhauls, the Pixel 10 series is the first Google smartphone generation that doesn’t feature a significant design change in consecutive years.Google is doubling down on its AI-first strategy with the Pixel 10. The company's tagline for the event, “Ask more from your phone,” clearly signals that these devices will be loaded with the most advanced AI features to date. From enhanced computational photography to more intuitive on-device intelligence and integration with Google's AI ecosystem, the Pixel 10 aims to bring AI first to users. The company has also been targeting Apple for ‘launching phones with AI features coming soon’.Earlier this year, Google launched its official online store in India. The company is offering special discounts if you buy devices from its store.Moreover, last year, Google said that its main motive was to bring its entire Pixel lineup – phones, smartwatches and earphones – in India, and bolster the after sales service. Following the Pixel 9's full lineup launch in India, Google is once again bringing the entire Pixel 10 series lineup to India.It is to be noted that Google launched Pixel series, Pixel 2 series, Pixel 3 series, Pixel 4a, Pixel 6a, Pixel 7 series, Pixel 8 series and Pixel 9 series in India.","Google Pixel 10 marks the 10th anniversary of Pixel devices.

White House joins TikTok

Sennheiser ACCENTUM Open Review: Goodbye Earbud Discomfort!

The White House has launched an official TikTok account recently. The move comes amidst uncertainty of the app’s future in the US and is now seen by many as a signal that the app is unlikely to be banned in the US anytime soon. The short video platform has long been at the center of US security debates, with lawmakers and intelligence officials warning that its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, could be forced to share American user data with Beijing. The original deadline for the TikTok ban in the US was January 19. However, the deadline was extended after Donald Trump became US President for the second term. Since then, Trump has signed multiple executive orders giving temporary relief to the app.The deadline has now been extended to September 17. With White House officially joining the platform, an immediate ban on TikTok in the US is unlikely.White House’s new account, @whitehouse, went live Tuesday (August 19) evening with a video showing President Donald Trump declaring: “I am your voice.” The post was captioned, “America we are BACK! What’s up TikTok?”Trump, who has credited TikTok with helping him win support from young voters in the 2024 election, already has more than 15 million followers on his campaign account, @realdonaldtrump.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “The Trump administration is committed to communicating the historic successes President Trump has delivered to the American people with as many audiences and platforms as possible. President Trump’s message dominated TikTok during his presidential campaign, and we’re excited to build upon those successes and communicate in a way no other administration has before.”","The White House has launched an official TikTok account.

Barnaby Joyce warns Australians: AI is coming and it will wipe out…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/barnaby-joyce-warns-australians-ai-is-coming-and-it-will-wipe-out/articleshow/123424686.cms,"

Barnaby Joyce says clerical jobs are most at risk from AI

Barnaby Joyce criticises work-from-home demands

Trades and hands-on work remain secure



Experts echo and challenge Joyce’s warning



AI’s impact on all industries

Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce has delivered a stark warning to Australians, cautioning that artificial intelligence (AI) could soon displace large sections of the workforce. Speaking on national television, the former Deputy Prime Minister stressed that while many workers are fighting for flexibility through remote work, they may be inadvertently making it easier for employers to replace them with machines. His remarks come as AI adoption accelerates across industries and unions push for stronger workplace rights in a changing environment. Joyce emphasized that clerical and administrative roles are likely to be the first wiped out, followed by a broader wave of job losses across multiple sectors. He argued that without urgent policy responses and education reforms, Australia risks creating a generation left behind by rapid technological change.In his interview, Joyce doubled down on the threat posed by artificial intelligence to so-called “keyboard jobs.” He painted a grim picture in which data entry clerks, administrative assistants, and bookkeepers could see their livelihoods vanish almost overnight. “AI is not a myth. It is already here,” he said, stressing that automation could eliminate thousands of back-office roles with ruthless efficiency.Joyce noted that while white-collar workers are often seen as more secure, AI flips that assumption on its head. Unlike trades that require physical presence and hands-on skills, office tasks are highly replicable in digital form. He said Australians must be proactive in safeguarding their future: “Don’t assume your job is safe just because you’re educated. AI is clever enough to rewrite reports, organise spreadsheets, and even draft legal documents. If employers realise you can do all this from your living room, they’ll just ask, why not let the algorithm handle it?”The Australian Services Union recently announced plans to petition the Fair Work Commission to strengthen the rights of employees who prefer to work from home. Their submission argues that remote work is now a “permanent feature” of modern employment and should not diminish the value of an employee’s contributions. The union has gone as far as calling for a mandatory six-month notice period before any employer can force staff back into the office.Joyce, however, dismissed this demand as unrealistic and dangerous. He argued that while work-from-home arrangements might feel convenient, they open the door for companies to realise that clerical roles can be easily digitised or outsourced. “If your job is essentially you, a keyboard, and a computer, then you’re on thin ice,” he warned. “Employers will quickly learn that AI can do the same work without sick leave, without holidays, and without the risk of industrial disputes.”Despite his dire predictions for clerical staff, Joyce offered a glimmer of reassurance for workers in manual trades. He emphasised that electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and mechanics remain largely shielded from the coming wave of AI disruption. “Robots can crunch numbers, but they cannot crawl under your sink or rewire a fuse box,” he remarked. “AI does not have hands or feet. Trades will remain the backbone of stable employment in this country.”By contrasting desk jobs with skilled manual labour, Joyce suggested that young Australians should seriously consider vocational training. He argued that as society becomes more reliant on technology, those who can physically build, repair, and install infrastructure will only become more valuable.Joyce is not alone in raising concerns. Social Services Minister Tanya Plibersek has also acknowledged the threat AI poses to repetitive jobs, although she urged Australians not to lose sight of the opportunities in emerging industries. She argued that the key lies in steering innovation to create jobs rather than destroy them, pointing to the potential for Australia to become a developer of AI technologies rather than just a consumer.Meanwhile, research backs up Joyce’s fears to an extent. Studies by Roy Morgan show that more than 6.7 million Australians, or around 46 percent of the workforce, now work from home at least some of the time. A separate analysis by Victoria University and the International Labour Organization suggests that nearly one-third of Australian jobs could theoretically be automated by AI. Clerical roles top the list of vulnerable occupations, while cleaning, hospitality, and the trades appear more resistant.Jobs and Skills Australia commissioner Barney Glover has tried to balance the debate, noting that while sweeping job losses are not inevitable, no sector will escape unscathed. “The overarching message is that almost all occupations will be augmented by AI,” he said. “From law firms to retail, from health care to logistics, AI will change the way every professional works. It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of how fast.”This evolving reality will be a central theme at the federal government’s productivity roundtable in Canberra this week. Policymakers, union leaders, and industry representatives are expected to debate how best to adapt to AI’s rise while protecting Australian workers. For now, Joyce’s blunt message cuts through the noise: jobs tied to keyboards and screens are in the crosshairs, and only those prepared to adapt will thrive.","Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) could soon displace large sections of the workforce.

A glimpse at the mew smart speaker



At its annual Made by Google 2025 hardware event, the tech giant introduced Gemini for Home, a next-generation AI assistant created to transform how users interact with their smart homes. Built on Google’s most advanced Gemini models, the assistant promises more natural, intelligent, and personalized help across everyday tasks—from media playback and smart device control to cooking and troubleshooting. “Now, we’re introducing an all-new voice assistant for the next generation of help at home: Gemini for Home. Gemini for Home is built on the same powerful AI models, with unique capabilities designed for the home. It offers reliable, hands-free help and can manage complex tasks across all of your home devices, assisting every member of your household, as well as visitors and guests,” said the company.The company has announced that Gemini for Home is all set to replace Google Assistant on Nest speakers and displays over time. Gemini for Home will offer deeper reasoning, advanced search capabilities and more fluid conversations. However, users can still say ‘Hey Google’ to activate it but the interactions will feel more intuitive.Along with this, the assistant also introduces Gemini Live which is a conversation model that allows back-and-forth dialogue without repeating the wake word. “Kick off a Gemini Live conversation with “Hey Google, let’s chat” and from that point on, have a natural back-and-forth discussion (no more “Hey Google” required). Explore new concepts, learn a skill, brainstorm ideas or get personalized advice. You can also interrupt responses to refine or redirect the discussion, so you get the specific information you’re looking for quickly,” said the company.Alongside the Gemini announcement, Google also showcased its new smart speaker briefly. The device appears to be a squished-down spherical design, reminiscent of the Nest Wifi, with a glowing blue-purple-white ring at its base—likely signaling Gemini’s presence. While details on the speaker’s specs and release date remain under wraps, its appearance suggests a fresh hardware direction to complement Gemini’s upgraded capabilities.Google confirmed that early access to Gemini for Home will begin in October, with both free and paid versions planned for rollout.","Gemini for Home is a next-generation AI assistant created to transform how users interact with their smart homes.

But this isn’t the costliest car, if compared to…

The 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé holds the record as the most expensive car ever sold.





On August 17, car enthusiasts in California were treated to an exquisite showcase of supercars at the 2025 Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance. Among the 229 cars displayed at the annual celebration of automotive beauty and tradition, the all-mahogany 1924 Hispano-Suiza H6C 'Tulipwood' Torpedo by Nieuport-Astra, Florida, was named Best of Show.The wooden car competed against several strong contenders, including the 1939 Maybach SW38 Spohn Sport Zweisitzer presented by Dana and Patti Mecum of Geneva Lake, Wisconsin; the 1933 Invicta 4½ Litre S Type Corsica Drophead Coupé shown by SBH of Riffa, Bahrain; and the 1956 Maserati 200SI Fantuzzi Open Sports Racer presented by Phillip Sarofim of Beverly Hills, California.Among the many cars showcased at the Pebble Beach Concours, one that drew attention was the Pagani Huayra Roadster, renowned for its powerful engine, advanced aerodynamics, and luxurious design. An enthusiastic presenter at the event said that the Pagani hypercars are ""above a Ferrari"". (See video below)A closer look at the car in the video shows a sticker of 'Pagani Raduno: Drive 2025' on it, registering its participation in Pagani Raduno: The Drive 2025. The Raduno, held in June, saw owners of Pagani cars embark on a scenic journey through New Mexico, with routes passing through Santa Fe and Los Alamos in the Santa Fe National Forest.Pagani Automobili, the ultra-exclusive hypercar brand, was founded by Horacio Pagani in 1992 and quickly created ripples in the automotive world.A car enthusiast since childhood, Horacio moved from Argentina to Italy in 1983 to work at Lamborghini, a marque he had long admired.During his stint there, he contributed to the Countach Evoluzione, the first car built entirely from composite materials. However, Lamborghini’s financial struggles at the time pushed Horacio to branch out on his own.He launched a consultancy, Modena Design, specialising in advanced composite materials, which eventually laid the foundation for Pagani Automobili. In 1999, the company made its mark with the debut of its first model, the Zonda C12, at the Geneva Motor Show.Following the success of Zonda, Horacio redefined the supercar landscape as he launched other Pagani models like Pagani Huayra, named after the Andean God of wind, in 2011. Each Huayra took around 350 hours just to paint.Then came the Huayra BC, named after Pagani's first customer, Benny Caiola. In 2022, Pagani unveiled another masterpiece: the Utopia. However, given the company's attention to detail, it produces only a handful of cars each year. According to Top Gear, the company had just produced a total of 450 units up until 2022 and it builds about 40 cars a year.The Pagani Utopia Roadster carries a starting price of €3.1 million (around Rs 28 crore), and most models from the marque typically climb into eight-figure territory. In 2024, a one-off Pagani Zonda 760 LM Roadster went under the hammer at RM Sotheby’s Dubai auction, fetching over $11 million.Among the few who own these rare machines is footballer Lionel Messi, who has one of only three Pagani Zonda Tricolores ever built. Each Tricolore was crafted to honour Italy’s Frecce Tricolori aerobatic team and comes powered by a Mercedes-AMG 7.3-litre V12 producing 670 hp. Weighing just over 1,200 kg, the hypercar boasts carbon-titanium bodywork, a sequential gearbox, an Inconel exhaust, and an endless list of bespoke details.Due to their extreme rarity and exclusivity, as per the vlogger, Supercar Blondie, Paganis are often regarded not just as luxury cars, but as investment assets.One of the most unusual and expensive features of the Pagani Huayra lies in its bolts. The hypercar is held together by 1,400 specially designed, laser-etched titanium bolts, each costing nearly $80. That means more than $100,000 of the Huayra’s price tag comes from bolts alone, a detail that sets it apart from every other supercar in the world.Though a Pagani is very expensive by objective standards, some supercars can cost even more. Much more.The 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé holds the record as the most expensive car ever sold, fetching an astounding $142.7 million (Rs 124.4 crore) at a private RM Sotheby’s auction in May 2022. The sale, held at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany, saw the buyer remain anonymous.Why was it worth that much? Because only two of these were ever built, both named after their creator, Rudolf Uhlenhaut, Mercedes’ then-head of testing and development. This particular model had never been raced and had been preserved for decades in Mercedes’ private collection, adding to its value. Notably, Mercedes directed the proceeds from the sale into a global fund for science and education.","The Pagani Huayra Roadster took part in the Pagani Raduno The Drive 2025 in New Mexico. The hypercar is renowned for its powerful engine, advanced aerodynamics, and luxurious design. It is powered by a Mercedes-AMG 7.3-litre V12 producing 670hp.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123412451,imgsize-89528,width-400,resizemode-4/123412451.jpg"

Investigation reveals surveillance concerns amid ongoing worker resistance

Microsoft employees occupied company headquarters Tuesday in the most significant protest yet against the tech giant's contracts with Israel, establishing an encampment they renamed "" Martyred Palestinian Children's Plaza ."" Around 50 current and former Microsoft workers, alongside community supporters, took over the East Campus Plaza at the company's Redmond, Washington headquarters as part of escalating demonstrations by the "" No Azure for Apartheid "" group. The protesters set up tents, erected memorials to Gaza casualties, and established a negotiating table inviting Microsoft executives to ""come to the table"" and end partnerships with the Israeli military.The demonstration ended after approximately two hours when police ordered protesters to leave, threatening arrests for trespassing. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the group ""was asked to leave, and they left"" but provided no additional comment beyond previous statements.The activists distributed a manifesto titled ""We will not be cogs in the Israeli genocidal machine: a call for a Worker Intifada,"" demanding Microsoft cut all ties with Israel, call for an end to the conflict, pay reparations to Palestinians, and stop discriminating against pro-Palestinian workers.The group has spent over a year pushing Microsoft to end its relationship with Israel, arguing the company's Azure cloud platform contributes to civilian deaths in Gaza by serving Israeli government and military agencies. Several organizers have been terminated for holding unauthorised campus events and disrupting executive speeches, including interruptions of CEO Satya Nadella's presentations.The protest follows recent reporting by The Guardian and +972 Magazine revealing Israel's military surveillance unit stored millions of Palestinian phone calls on Azure servers, with that data helping inform Gaza bombing targets. Microsoft enlisted law firm Covington & Burling to conduct an independent review of these allegations, though the company maintains it has ""found no evidence"" its technologies have been used to target civilians.The demonstrations were also motivated by the recent targeted killing of prominent Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif , according to protester Hossam Nasr, a former Microsoft employee who was fired last year for organizing a Palestine vigil.","Microsoft employees occupied company headquarters Tuesday in the most significant protest yet against the tech giant's contracts with Israel.

National security concerns drive push for domestic chip production

US treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed Tuesday that the Trump administration is exploring taking an equity stake in struggling chipmaker Intel, converting billions in government grants into ownership rather than giving away taxpayer money for free.Speaking to CNBC, Bessent said any potential deal would focus on stabilizing Intel for domestic chip production rather than pressuring companies to buy from the semiconductor giant. ""The last thing we're going to do is put pressure, is take the stake and then try to drum up business,"" he told the network.The discussions center on converting approximately $10.9 billion in CHIPS Act grants into a roughly 10% equity stake in Intel, potentially making the US government the company's largest shareholder. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed this approach during a separate CNBC interview, criticizing the Biden administration 's original structure.""Donald Trump turns that into saying, 'Hey, we want equity for the money,'"" Lutnick explained. ""America should get the benefit of the bargain. Why are we giving a company worth $100 billion this kind of money?""The unusual arrangement would mark a significant departure from traditional government support for private companies, reflecting Trump's business-oriented approach to federal investments. Lutnick clarified that any equity stake wouldn't include voting rights or governance control.Bessent emphasized national security motivations, citing America's dangerous reliance on Taiwan for advanced semiconductors. ""The single point of failure for the global economy is that 99% of the advanced chips in the world are made in Taiwan,"" he said, calling it a critical vulnerability requiring immediate attention.Intel has struggled to compete with rivals like Nvidia and Qualcomm, recently announcing plans to lay off 15% of its workforce. The company received a boost Monday when Japan's SoftBank announced a $2 billion investment, sending Intel shares up 7.5%.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the potential deal ""a creative idea that has never been done before"" to ensure reshoring critical supply chains while benefiting taxpayers.

Elon Musk to back JD Vance in 2028 Presidential elections: Report

Redmi 15 5G Unboxing and First Look: What's New and Key Specifications

A Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report recently said that Elon Musk is quietly “pumping the brakes” on his plans to launch a new political party. The tech billionaire announced ‘ America Party ’ in July after a fallout with President Donald Trump on the spending bill and tax cuts. Elon Musk, as per the report, has stayed in touch with Vice President JD Vance in recent weeks. Quoting people with knowledge of his plans, it adds that the Tesla CEO has “acknowledged to associates that if he goes ahead with forming a political party, he would damage his relationship with the vice president”.Responding to the WSJ report, Elon Musk wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter): “Nothing@WSJ says should ever be thought of as true”.In the 2024 presidential election, Elon Musk supported Republican candidate Donald Trump. He spent close to $300 million to support Trump and other Republicans in the 2024 election. Soon after his win, Musk and Trump became strong allies with the tech billionaire leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) – task force set up by the Trump administration to cut federal spending.The WSJ report states that the tech CEO hasn’t “formally ruled out creating a new party and could change his mind as the midterm elections near”. It further adds that Elon Musk plans to use “some of his vast financial resources to back Vance if he decides to run for president in 2028”.As per the report, any decision by Elon Musk to abandon plans of launching a third party would work in favor of Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Third parties in the US have historically played the role of spoilers by pulling votes away from the two dominant parties.","Elon Musk is quietly “pumping the brakes” on his plans to launch a new political party.

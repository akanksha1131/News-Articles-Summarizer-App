Facebook-parent Meta may have a new ‘plan’ to compete with Apple Vision Pro,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-parent-meta-may-have-a-new-plan-to-compete-with-apple-vision-pro/articleshow/116614259.cms,"Meta (Picture credit: AP)

Meta Ray-Ban glasses with display: What to expect

Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly planning an upgrade for its Ray-Ban glasses. Rumours claim that these smart glasses may soon feature a display. A new report suggests that the next-generation model could launch by 2025. The current model supports voice commands and audio feedback. A display will not only improve the user experience by allowing more intuitive interactions and visual information but will also help the Meta Ray-Ban glasses with Apple’s mixed reality headset, Vision Pro.Using the glasses' reading feature is often convenient, but there are situations where a visual display proves more efficient. People can typically read text faster than it can be narrated, making the option important.According to a report by the Financial Times, this functionality is expected to arrive soon. The report claims that this upgrade marks a major step in Meta’s efforts to develop lightweight headsets that replace smartphones as consumers’ primary computing devices.The report cites sources familiar with the plans to claim that the social media giant is planning to integrate a screen into the $300 (above Rs 25,000) sunglasses it produces in collaboration with eyewear manufacturer EssilorLuxottica.The upgraded Ray-Ban glasses could launch as soon as the second half of 2025, featuring a small display designed to showcase notifications or responses from Meta’s virtual assistant.Similar to the Vision Pro, the Meta’s smart glasses are also unavailable in India.Previously, Meta unveiled an early prototype of its Orion AR glasses. Although the design is admittedly bulky and comes with a reported manufacturing cost of $10,000. However, the prototype offered a glimpse into the potential of augmented reality in a form factor closer to the existing Ray Ban smart glasses.Apple is also believed to share a similar vision, with its long-term goal reportedly focused on developing AR glasses. The Vision Pro is seen as an initial step on the path toward the anticipated Apple Glasses. While voice interaction will likely be a key feature, Apple is expected to prioritise integrated displays in its designs.",Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly planning an upgrade for its Ray-Ban glasses.

Two reasons why Microsoft may be exploring alternatives to OpenAI for 365 Copilot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/two-reasons-why-microsoft-may-be-exploring-alternatives-to-openai-for-365-copilot/articleshow/116609976.cms,"Why Microsoft is making this change

Tension between Microsoft and OpenAI

Microsoft is reportedly looking beyond OpenAI to power its flagship AI product, Microsoft 365 Copilot . The tech giant is reportedly exploring the use of alternative language models. This marks a shift from the company's previous emphasis on its early access to OpenAI's models, which was a key selling point when 365 Copilot launched in 2023.Citing sources, news agency Reuters reported that Microsoft is also seeking to reduce 365 Copilot's reliance on OpenAI due to concerns about speed for enterprise users. The company is also aiming to reduce its reliance on OpenAI's technology and potentially lower costs.For this, Microsoft is reportedly training its own smaller models, like the recent Phi-4, and customising open-weight models to improve 365 Copilot's efficiency and performance.“We incorporate various models from OpenAI and Microsoft depending on the product and experience,” a Microsoft spokesperson told the agency, while confirming that OpenAI remains a partner for “frontier models.”The goal is also to potentially pass those savings to the end customer, and Microsoft's leaders, including CEO Satya Nadella, are said to be tracking the efforts closely.This move mirrors similar efforts in other Microsoft business units. GitHub, for example, recently added models from Anthropic and Google as alternatives to OpenAI's GPT-4o. Microsoft's consumer chatbot, Copilot, also now utilizes in-house models alongside OpenAI's technology.Several reports have suggested that the close partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI may be facing some challenges. Just a year after Microsoft played a key role in reinstating Sam Altman as OpenAI's CEO, their relationship appears to be showing signs of strain.While acknowledging the natural tensions in any partnership, Suleyman hinted at the diverging paths of the two companies.""Every partnership has tension. It's healthy and natural. I mean, they're a completely different business to us. They operate independently and partnerships evolve over time... partnerships evolve and they have to adapt to what works at the time, so we'll see how that changes over the next few years,"" Suleyman said.","Microsoft is reportedly looking beyond OpenAI to power its flagship AI product.

Amazon and Starbucks workers are on strike. Why and how Donald Trump may have something to do with this,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-and-starbucks-workers-are-on-strike-why-and-how-donald-trump-may-have-something-to-do-with-these/articleshow/116609680.cms,"Amazon workers strike outside the gates of an Amazon Fulfillment Center. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)

The 'likely Trump' factor behind the strikes

Amazon and Starbucks is joined by Elon Musk's Starlink

Strikes are underway at Amazon and Starbucks in several US cities as workers push for Union recognition and improved contracts. These actions follow a year of significant labour wins for Unions at companies like Boeing, and among dockworkers, video game performers, and Las Vegas casino workers. So what's behind the strikes at Amazon and Starbucks?Amazon reportedly refuses to formally acknowledge unionization efforts by its drivers and warehouse workers, despite some successful union votes and the Teamsters union claiming to represent them. Starbucks, while having agreed to negotiate, is facing criticism for slow progress.These strikes, particularly timed around the holiday season, aim to maximize pressure on the companies. The organizing drives at both companies gained momentum after the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the importance of frontline workers and economic inequality. This period also saw successful unionization efforts at other retailers like Apple, Trader Joe's, and REI.A key factor driving the timing of these strikes is the upcoming change in presidential administration. With the potential for a less union-friendly National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) under a new administration, unions are attempting to leverage public pressure now. While some recent political appointments suggest a potentially more nuanced stance on labour relations, the immediate future of the NLRB remains a concern for unions.John Logan, director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, told news agency AP that he thinks the Amazon and Starbucks workers are “desperate” to make progress before President-elect Donald Trump gets to appoint a Republican majority to the National Labor Relations Board, which is expected to be less friendly to unions during his administration.“The unions want to make these disputes public and bring political pressures on the companies,"" Logan said in a written statement. “If these disputes drag on until next year, and if they are fought largely through the labor board and the courts, the unions and workers will almost certainly lose. This might be their last, best chance to pressure the companies in public before Trump comes into office.”Amazon reportedly objected to the 2022 warehouse election results, reportedly claiming that the Amazon Labor Union and the federal labour board had tainted the vote. A regional NLRB director issued a complaint last year that accused Amazon of violating the law by refusing to bargain with the union.Amazon, in turn, is challenging the constitutionality of the NLRB in federal court along with Elon Musk 's SpaceX. In June, the US Supreme Court made it harder for the agency to win court orders in labour disputes, siding with Starbucks in a case brought by the company.","Strikes are underway at Amazon and Starbucks in several US cities as workers push for Union recognition and improved contracts.

REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo

Qualcomm secured a win in its licensing dispute with Arm, but the legal battle may be far from over after a federal jury in Delaware delivered a mixed verdict on last week that resulted in a partial mistrial.The jury sided with Qualcomm on two crucial points, finding that the chipmaker didn't violate Arm's licensing agreement when it acquired chip design startup Nuvia for $1.4 billion in 2021. The verdict also confirmed that Qualcomm's existing architecture license with Arm covered the continued development of custom CPU cores obtained through the Nuvia acquisition .However, the jury deadlocked on whether Nuvia itself breached its original licensing agreement with Arm, prompting U.S. District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika to suggest mediation between the two tech giants. Arm has already announced its intention to seek a retrial.The case stems from Arm's 2022 lawsuit alleging that Qualcomm improperly continued developing Nuvia's custom CPU cores without obtaining necessary permissions after the acquisition. These cores, now renamed Oryon , are crucial to Qualcomm's strategy to compete with Intel and AMD in the PC market through its Snapdragon X processors.Evidence presented during the trial revealed underlying tensions in the companies' relationship, with internal documents showing Qualcomm projected potential annual savings of up to $1.4 billion in Arm licensing fees through the Nuvia acquisition.While Qualcomm celebrated the verdict as a vindication of its ""right to innovate,"" Arm expressed disappointment over the jury's inability to reach consensus on all claims. The outcome leaves uncertainty hanging over the future of Qualcomm's PC chip ambitions, as Arm seeks to protect what it calls its ""unparalleled ecosystem"" built over three decades.","A federal jury in Delaware delivered a mixed verdict on last week that resulted in a partial mistrial.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

NPCI issues an advisory about 'online scams' that Indians are losing crores to,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/npci-warns-phonepe-gpay-and-other-upi-users-about-scam-that-indians-are-losing-crores-to/articleshow/116352174.cms,"What NPCI advisory says

What is digital arrest scam



How to identify a digital arrest scam

Unexpected Contact from ‘Officials’: Be cautious if someone claims to be from government agencies like the police, CBI, income tax officers, or customs agents, contacts you. Be cautious especially if they claim urgent legal action is being initiated or warranted. They might allege that you or one of your family members is involved in a serious crime like money laundering, tax evasion, or drug trafficking.

Fear-based language and urgency: Scammers may request video calls, disguising themselves in police uniforms, using government logos, or creating official-sounding background noise to appear legitimate. They often threaten arrest or immediate legal action, demanding a quick response and using legal terms to sound convincing. In some cases, they create a police station-like set up to further convince victims of their credibility.

Request for sensitive information or payment: Scammers may ask for personal information or demand large sums of money, promising that this will clear up your involvement in the alleged crime. They may also coerce you to transfer money to their account until the investigation is complete. Terms like “clearing your name”, “assisting with the investigation”, or “refundable security deposit/escrow account” might be used by them to persuade you into transferring money to specified bank accounts or UPI IDs.

Tips to stay safe

Pause and Verify: If you receive unexpected calls or messages about legal issues, take a moment to verify. Stay calm, as scammers rely on fear and urgency. Real government and law enforcement agencies will never ask for money or investigate cases through phone or video calls. Always confirm the caller’s identity and consult trusted sources before taking any action.

Use Support Channels: Report suspicious numbers to the national cybercrime helpline by dialing 1930 or the Department of Telecommunication (https://sancharsaathi.gov.in/sfc/).

The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country. As digital payments, including UPI, gain widespread adoption, incidents of online scams have risen significantly. Indians, as mentioned by PM Modi in one of the episodes of Mann ki Baat have lost Rs 120.3 crore through digital arrest scam s. In its advisory, the NPCI highlights the critical need for awareness and vigilance to protect against such fraudulent activities as India advances towards a digital-first economy.In a press release, NPCI says “Digital payments are now accessible nationwide, driving India towards a digital-first economy. They offer both security and convenience. However, it's crucial to use digital payments safely and avoid online scams. Early identification of potential scams helps protect you and your loved ones, fostering a safer, less-cash economy, for everyone.”The 'Digital Arrest' scam is a type of online fraud where cybercriminals trick individuals into believing they are under investigation or at risk of arrest by law enforcement or financial authorities. Scammers often impersonate government officials, police officers, or financial regulators and use fear tactics to manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information or transferring money. Some of the common tactics used in the scam include fake calls or messages, threat of arrest and demand for payment.As per NPCI, you can identify a digital arrest scam by keeping an eye for the following","The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

South Korean researchers develop ‘Iron Man’ robot to help differently abled users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/south-korean-researchers-develop-iron-man-robot-to-help-differently-abled-users/articleshow/116605008.cms,"How this robot works



""It can approach me wherever I am, even when I'm sitting in a wheelchair, and be worn to help me stand up, which is one of its most distinct features,""

""I wanted to tell my son .... that I also used to able to walk. I wanted to share a diverse range of experiences with him,""

South Korean researchers have developed a lightweight wearable robot that can assist paraplegic users in walking, manoeuvring obstacles, and climbing stairs. The robot can walk up to the differently abled users and lock itself onto them to help them with these movements. The Exoskeleton Laboratory team at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) that has developed this robot aims to integrate this technology into the daily lives of differently abled people. Park Jeong-su, a member of the KAIST team, shared that his inspiration came from the movie Iron Man .“After watching Iron Man, I thought it would be great if I can help people with a robot in real life,” Jeong-su said to the news agency Reuters.According to a report by Reuters, the powered exoskeleton, named WalkON Suit F1 , features an aluminium and titanium composition to weigh in at 50kg and is powered by 12 electronic motors that simulate the movements of human joints while walking.The robot is designed to maintain the user's balance while walking, using sensors in its soles and upper body that process 1,000 signals per second to predict the user's intended movements.According to Jeong-su, the robot's front-facing lenses act as eyes that analyse the environment, measure stair heights, and detect obstacles. This functionality compensates for the sensory limitations of users with complete paraplegia.Kim Seung-hwan, a paraplegic and a member of the KAIST team, showcased the prototype. The robot enabled him to walk at a speed of 3.2 km/h (2 mph), ascend a flight of stairs, and take lateral steps to slide onto a bench, the report noted.Seung-hwan said in a statement to the news agency Reuters.While wearing the WalkON Suit F1, he even secured a gold medal in the exoskeleton category at Cybathlon 2024 , an event where individuals with diverse physical disabilities showcased assistive robots across eight categories.Seung-hwan noted.","South Korean researchers have developed a lightweight wearable robot that can assist paraplegic users in walking, manoeuvring obstacles, and climbing stairs.

What is Sparkl

Aakash Institute founder Aakash Chaudhry has reportedly secured backing from prominent consumer tech billionaires, including Zomato ’s Deepinder Goyal and Zerodha ’s Nithin Kamath , for his new venture, Sparkl Edventure . According to an Economic Times report citing unnamed sources, Kamath’s Rainmatter fund—known for its focus on fintech and sustainability—along with Goyal, is participating in a $4 million seed funding round. Additional marquee investors are also expected to join the round.Chaudhry launched Sparkl in October this year in partnership with Meritnation.com founders Pavan Chauhan and Ritesh Hemrajani. Meritnation, an edtech platform acquired by Chaudhry’s family business, Aakash Educational Services Ltd (AESL), in 2020, was a pivotal part of this collaboration. This venture follows the landmark $950 million sale of AESL to Byju’s in 2021, one of India’s largest edtech deals. Chaudhry continues to hold an 11% stake in AESL.Sparkl aims to offer one-on-one online tutoring for students in grades 6 to 12, with a focus on International Baccalaureate (IB) and Cambridge curricula. The platform provides personalised instruction in subjects like mathematics, science, languages, and business studies. Already operational, Sparkl has enrolled students from Delhi NCR, Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad, and Singapore, with plans to expand further by leveraging its technological capabilities.“The platform was initially slated for a 2025 launch, but with the product ready ahead of schedule, the timeline was fast-tracked,” said a source. The seed funding is expected to accelerate Sparkl’s rollout.Unlike AESL’s offline-focused test prep model, Sparkl operates as a fully digital platform tailored to international curricula and study-abroad aspirations. Sparkl also integrates mental health support with monthly well-being sessions to address stress and peer pressure among students.","Aakash Institute founder Aakash Chaudhry has reportedly secured backing from prominent consumer tech billionaires.

"“...it is Albanians who make the decisions, not the…”: Albania PM 'warns' TikTok over 'urgent clarity' on ban",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/-it-is-albanians-who-make-the-decisions-not-the-albania-pm-warns-tiktok-over-urgent-clarity-on-ban/articleshow/116604563.cms,"What the Albanian PM said

The ban on TikTok for (at least) one year in Albania is not a rushed reaction to a single incident, but a carefully considered decision made in consultation with parent communities in schools across the country.

TikTok has no grounds to demand clarifications from Albania because, in Albania, it is Albanians who make the decisions, not the owners of TikTok’s algorithm. While Albania may be too small to demand that TikTok protects children and youth from the frightening pitfalls of its algorithm, we sincerely hope TikTok will take this step for the benefit of humanity, including Albania.

To claim that the killing of the teenage boy has no connection to TikTok because the conflict didn’t originate on the platform demonstrates a failure to grasp both the seriousness of the threat TikTok poses to children and youth today and the rationale behind our decision to take responsibility for addressing this threat.

Thankfully, Albania is a democratic country where, when over 90% of parents demand the banning of TikTok, and the overwhelming majority believe that the health and well-being of our children should not serve the platform, but rather that the platform should serve the health and well-being of our children, our decision couldn’t be clearer:

Either TikTok protects the children of Albania, or Albania will protect its children from TikTok

Why Albania announced one-year ban on TikTok

Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has responded to TikTok 's request for “urgent clarity” regarding the one-year shutdown of the short video app in the country. Rama emphasised that the ban is “not a rushed reaction to a single incident” but a well-thought-out decision.In a long post on X, he said that “TikTok has no grounds to demand clarifications” and that, “in Albania, it is Albanians who make the decisions, not the owners of TikTok’s algorithm.”The Albanian government announced the decision on Saturday, December 21 that it will ban TikTok in the country as it aims to improve school safety. Rama, after meeting with parents and teachers across the country, said that the ban will take place after one year.“For one year, TikTok will be completely shut down in Albania. There will be no TikTok for anyone,” PM Rama was quoted as saying.He attributed the rise in youth violence to social media platforms like TikTok, citing the tragic stabbing of a 14-year-old boy by a classmate last month. Reports suggest that the incident stemmed from online disputes on social media, with disturbing TikTok videos surfacing that appeared to condone the attack.“The problem isn’t our children; it’s us, our society, and platforms like TikTok that are taking our children hostage,” Rama added.",Albanian PM Edi Rama has responded to TikTok's request for “urgent clarity” regarding the one-year shutdown of the short video app in the country.

Antitrust charges against Google

Alphabet’s Google is gearing up to fight antitrust allegations in Japan, where the country’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has accused the company of engaging in anti-competitive practices by prioritising Google Search in default screen placement.The FTC has issued a cease-and-desist order to Google's Japan office, alleging that the company has been unfairly prioritising its own search engine on smartphones, hindering competition from rivals like Yahoo Japan.Google, which has faced similar antitrust scrutiny in other parts of the world, expressed disappointment with the FTC's decision and plans to contest the allegations.“We have continued to work closely with the Japanese government to demonstrate how we are supporting the Android ecosystem and expanding user choice in Japan,” Google said in a statement, as per a report by Bloomberg.“We will present our arguments in the hearing process,” it said, adding it was “disappointed” and the FTC didn’t give enough consideration of the company’s proposed solution.Notably, the Japanese watchdog has notified Google of its planned action and will finalise its decision after hearing the company’s response.This latest antitrust challenge comes after the Japan’s FTC issued an administrative order against Google earlier this year for allegedly limiting Yahoo Japan's ability to compete in the targeted search advertising market.Chrome plays a crucial role in Google's business model by providing valuable user data that enhances the company's advertising targeting capabilities. Google Chrome is the world's most widely used web browser.Google's dominance in the search and mobile operating system markets has attracted regulatory scrutiny globally. The company faces accusations of leveraging its market power to stifle competition and prioritise its own products and services.Last month, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) argued in court that Google should be forced to divest its Chrome browser business and face a five-year ban from re-entering the browser market to end its search monopoly.","The FTC has issued a cease-and-desist order to Google's Japan office.

Amazon’s 'James Bond deal' with MGM



The release of the next James Bond movie is reportedly uncertain due to a strained relationship between the Broccoli family, who oversees the franchise and Amazon. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the two parties have not been able to agree on a new Bond film, despite the e-commerce giant’s $6.5 billion acquisition of MGM . Barbara Broccoli , who inherited control of the franchise, has expressed distrust towards Amazon’s algorithm-centric approach to filmmaking and its core business which is retail and ecommerce. She has stated that there is currently no script, story, or new Bond actor in development. The breakdown in the relationship between the Broccoli family and Amazon has cast doubt on the future of the iconic James Bond movie franchise.The conflict between the Broccoli family and Amazon stems from differing visions for the James Bond franchise , the report claims. Amazon seeks new ideas for a Bond film, while the Broccoli family is hesitant to collaborate with the tech giant. This clash between traditional Hollywood filmmaking and the data-driven approach of Silicon Valley has stalled the development of a new Bond movie.The Broccoli family's control over the James Bond franchise is unique in Hollywood, where iconic characters are often exploited by conglomerates. As per the report, the Broccoli family views James Bond as more than just a profitable franchise. They consider it a valuable family heirloom that must be handled with care.Barbara Broccoli, the primary steward of the franchise, has consistently rejected offers to expand the Bond brand through various media, the report added. She is also known for her meticulous approach to filmmaking and her insistence on maintaining the integrity of the Bond character.By holding the reins to the Bond franchise, Broccoli can effectively stall any future projects until she finds a suitable partner. This strategy reflects the family's long-standing approach to protecting the legacy of James Bond.The merger between MGM and Amazon presented an opportunity to blend traditional Hollywood with the digital age. While Amazon acquired a vast library of iconic films, the James Bond franchise was a particular point of interest.Despite Amazon's enthusiasm for expanding the Bond franchise, Broccoli's firm control over the character has limited the company's ambitions. She has consistently rejected ideas for spin-offs and reimaginings, prioritising the core Bond films.","The release of the next James Bond movie is reportedly uncertain due to a strained relationship between the Broccoli family and Amazon.

Released in 2013, Android KitKat is an outdated operating system that lacks the capabilities to support WhatsApp's latest features and security updates. The discontinuation of support will affect several older Android devices , including models from Samsung, LG, and Sony. However, all of these phones are not currently available in India, yet, users are advised to upgrade their devices to newer Android versions to continue using WhatsApp.According to a report by HDBlog, WhatsApp will stop working on smartphones that still run the Android KitKat version. Here is a list of those smartphones:However, this is not the first time older smartphones will lose support for WhatsApp as Meta has a history of discontinuing support for older operating systems. The company regularly reviews its minimum requirements for Android and iOS to maintain compatibility and security standards. In recent years, Meta has phased out support for older iOS devices and earlier Android versions.Earlier, WhatsApp announced that it will stop supporting older iOS versions starting in 2025. Starting May 5, 2025 devices running iOS versions earlier than 15.1 will no longer be able to access the app, including through older beta versions on TestFlight.While WhatsApp currently supports iOS 12 and above, the upcoming changes will require iOS 15.1 as the minimum version for continued functionality. To give users time to adapt, WhatsApp is providing a five-month notice period, allowing them to update their devices or explore other options if their hardware cannot support the latest iOS versions.This update will mainly affect users of older iPhones, specifically the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus, which are limited to iOS 12.5.7. These models, released over a decade ago, represent a small segment of WhatsApp’s user base. For users with newer iPhones still running older software, upgrading to iOS 15.1 or higher will ensure uninterrupted access to WhatsApp.The changes will impact both the standard WhatsApp app and WhatsApp Business, as both rely on the same system requirements. With this move, WhatsApp aims to enhance performance, security, and compatibility for users on modern devices.","WhatsApp will no longer support Android devices running on KitKat or older versions from January 1, 2025.

Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin: Gaining momentum



Amazon’s Project Kuiper: A Starlink competitor

The stakes for space exploration

Challenges and opportunities ahead

The rivalry between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos , the two wealthiest men in the world, has entered a pivotal phase as their respective companies, SpaceX and Blue Origin , lead the charge in commercial space exploration. While Musk's SpaceX has dominated the space industry for nearly two decades, Bezos is making bold moves to challenge this dominance through Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket and Amazon’s Project Kuiper. These developments mark a significant chapter in the billionaire space race, potentially reshaping the landscape of space exploration and satellite-based internet services.Since its inception in 2002, SpaceX has revolutionized the space industry. The company’s reusable rocket technology, pioneered with the Falcon 9, has drastically reduced the cost of launches while increasing their frequency. SpaceX completed over 130 launches in 2023 alone, accounting for 85% of the total orbital mass deployed that year.SpaceX’s Starlink satellite network, launched in 2018, has also become a game-changer, with over 6,000 satellites in orbit and more than 4 million users worldwide. Starlink provides internet access to remote areas, supporting uses as diverse as military operations in Ukraine and connectivity for rural households in the U.S. This vertical integration, where SpaceX both manufactures satellites and launches them, has given Musk an unparalleled advantage in the industry.While Bezos founded Blue Origin around the same time as SpaceX, its progress has been comparatively slower. The company has primarily focused on suborbital tourism, offering brief trips to the edge of space. However, Bezos has invested heavily in developing the New Glenn rocket, which aims to compete directly with SpaceX’s Falcon 9.New Glenn, a towering rocket as tall as a 32-story building, is equipped with a reusable booster designed for frequent satellite launches. Currently stationed at Cape Canaveral, Florida, New Glenn is awaiting regulatory approval for its first orbital launch, expected in early 2024.In addition to Blue Origin, Bezos is leveraging Amazon’s resources to develop Project Kuiper, a satellite internet network designed to rival SpaceX’s Starlink. With a planned constellation of 3,232 satellites, Project Kuiper aims to provide global internet coverage, focusing on areas underserved by traditional infrastructure.Although delayed until 2025, Project Kuiper successfully tested two prototype satellites in 2023. Amazon has invested over $16 billion in the project and constructed a satellite manufacturing facility near Seattle. Notably, Project Kuiper has already secured partnerships with Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance for satellite launches, though it has also contracted SpaceX for three launches starting in 2025.Both billionaires view space as more than a business opportunity. Musk envisions a future where humanity colonizes Mars to ensure survival against potential Earth-bound disasters. Starship, SpaceX’s next-generation rocket, is central to this vision, aiming to establish lunar bases and Martian colonies.Bezos, inspired by NASA’s Apollo missions, dreams of a trillion humans living across the solar system in giant space stations. His focus on sustainability and manufacturing capacity highlights his long-term commitment to Blue Origin’s success.While SpaceX maintains a significant lead, analysts believe competition from Blue Origin and Amazon’s Project Kuiper is critical for industry growth. Blue Origin’s success with New Glenn and Kuiper’s deployment will determine whether Bezos can meaningfully challenge Musk’s dominance.For now, SpaceX’s vertical integration and launch frequency remain unparalleled. However, Bezos’ financial resources and strategic hires, including former Starlink engineers, signal a determined effort to close the gap.","The billionaire space race has entered a pivotal phase as SpaceX and Blue Origin lead the charge in commercial space exploration.

Telecom operators have been ordered to implement this directive immediately.“Different caller tunes related to cybercrime will be provided on a weekly basis for a period of three months,” the order stated.This move comes in response to the increasing prevalence of sophisticated cyber scams, such as the “digital arrest” scam where fraudsters impersonate police officers or judges to extort money from victims.To further combat such scams, the government and TSPs have implemented a system to identify and block international calls that are ""spoofed"" to appear as if they are originating from Indian numbers.The government recently took action to block fraudulent SIM cards and devices.

US President-elect Donald Trump indicated Sunday he may favor allowing TikTok to continue operating in the United States, citing his campaign's successful engagement on the platform just weeks before a potential nationwide ban takes effect.""I think we're going to have to start thinking because, you know, we did go on TikTok, and we had a great response with billions of views, billions and billions of views,"" Trump told the crowd at AmericaFest, an annual gathering organized by conservative group Turning Point.""They brought me a chart, and it was a record, and it was so beautiful to see, and as I looked at it, I said, 'Maybe we gotta keep this sucker around for a little while,'"" he said.The comments follow Trump's Monday meeting with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump expressed having a ""warm spot"" for the app.Trump’s recent comments mark a significant shift from his previous stance during his first term when he attempted to ban the platform.The social media app faces a January 19 deadline to be sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance or face removal from US app stores, following legislation signed by President Biden in April. The deadline falls one day before Trump takes office.ByteDance has challenged the law's constitutionality, and the Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on January 10. TikTok maintains that its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on Oracle Corp servers, while content moderation decisions affecting US users are made domestically.However, it remains unclear how Trump could reverse the divestiture order, which passed with strong bipartisan support in the Senate. The Justice Department continues to argue that Chinese control of TikTok poses national security risks, a position backed by most US lawmakers.The potential ban could affect 170 million US users and, according to TikTok, could result in significant revenue losses for small businesses and content creators.

What X said

Elon Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) has increased the price of its top-tier subscription service (Premium+) for both new and existing users globally, including in India. The Premium+ tier offers advanced features, including ad-free experiences, priority rankings, and extended post reach. This marks the most significant price adjustment since tech billionaire Elon Musk acquired the platform in 2022. Despite this, the rates for X's basic and premium tiers in India remain unchanged at Rs 243 and Rs 650 per month, respectively.Starting December 21, the monthly subscription rate has increased by approximately 35%, rising from Rs 1,300 to Rs 1,750. On an annual basis, users will now pay Rs 18,300, up from the current Rs 13,600.The price revision isn't limited to India.

What are APK malware



A Mangaluru resident reportedly lost Rs 6.6 lakh in an APK file scam on WhatsApp. The victim received a deceptive message from a WhatsApp group, which seemed like being from Canara Bank and warned him of account closure unless details were updated through a provided link. The victim downloaded the link, which led to a fraudulent bank interface requesting sensitive information. According to a complaint filed at Kavoor Police Station (seen by TOI) unauthorised transactions of Rs 6.6 lakh were made from the account despite him not sharing OTPs.The incident unfolded when the victim received a deceptive message in a WhatsApp group, seemingly from Canara Bank. Last week, the WhatsApp group ""Durgi Cricket Utsava"" was reportedly renamed to ""Canara Bank."" The group message warned that the complainant's Canara Bank account would be blocked unless UIDAI and KYC details were updated through an APK link.Trusting the message, the victim downloaded the APK, which led to a page mimicking a bank interface. The page requested sensitive details, including the mobile number, UIDAI number, ATM PIN, and CVV. Upon entering this information, the victim received OTPs on their mobile phone.Although the OTPs were not shared, the complainant later discovered that Rs 6.6 lakh had been fraudulently transferred from their account in multiple transactions using a debit card.Recognising the fraud, the victim said to TOI that he promptly blocked the card and reported the matter to the police. A case has been registered at Kavoor Police Station, and the investigation is underway.APK malware poses a significant threat to WhatsApp users. Cybercriminals create deceptive messages, often impersonating trusted entities, to trick users into downloading and installing dangerous APK files.Once installed, these files can steal sensitive information, intercept SMS messages, and compromise financial security. Users should be cautious about downloading and installing apps from unknown sources, especially those received through WhatsApp.","A Mangaluru resident reportedly lost Rs 6.6 lakh in an APK file scam on WhatsApp. The victim received a deceptive message from a WhatsApp group, which seemed like being from Canara Bank.

Recent media reports suggesting a $600 million price tag for the wedding of billionaire Jeff Bezos and his fiancée, Lauren Sanchez , have been unequivocally dismissed by Bezos himself. The Amazon founder took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to debunk the claims, emphasizing the importance of not believing every headline. Investor Bill Ackman also weighed in, casting doubt on the plausibility of such an exorbitant expense.Jeff Bezos directly addressed the reports on X, calling them ""completely false"" and urging people to exercise caution when consuming information online. He commented, “The old adage ‘don’t believe everything you read’ is even more true today than it ever has been. Now lies can get ALL the way around the world before the truth can get its pants on.” Bezos added this clarification in response to a post by investor Bill Ackman, who humorously dismissed the claims, stating that such a cost was unrealistic “unless you are buying each of your guests a house.”Lauren Sanchez also reacted to the rumors, sharing Bezos’ post on her Instagram stories with the caption ""not true."" The couple’s quick rebuttals highlight their commitment to addressing inaccuracies about their personal lives.The rumors originated from articles published by the Daily Mail and the New York Post, which claimed that Bezos and Sanchez were planning a lavish wedding in Aspen, Colorado. The reports suggested that the couple had reserved Matsuhisa, an upscale sushi restaurant, as the venue for a winter wonderland-themed celebration scheduled for December 26-27. Approximately 180 guests were expected to attend, according to these accounts.Additionally, the articles claimed the wedding would take place over multiple days at Kevin Costner's sprawling 160-acre ranch. The event was said to rival the couple’s 2023 engagement celebrations in Positano, Italy, which were attended by high-profile figures like Bill Gates, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Queen Rania of Jordan.While the wedding rumors have been debunked, Bezos and Sanchez’s engagement celebrations in Positano were indeed extravagant. The event showcased the couple’s penchant for luxury, featuring an exclusive guest list and a picturesque Italian backdrop. This likely fueled speculation about their wedding plans being similarly opulent.The incident underscores the rapid spread of misinformation in the digital age. Bezos’ comment about lies traveling faster than the truth highlights a broader societal challenge: the ease with which false narratives gain traction online. High-profile individuals like Bezos often find themselves at the center of fabricated stories, emphasizing the need for critical consumption of news.As one of the world’s wealthiest individuals, Jeff Bezos is no stranger to media scrutiny. His relationship with Lauren Sanchez has been a frequent topic of public interest, and their personal lives are often subject to speculation. This recent episode serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by public figures in managing their personal narratives amidst widespread media attention.","Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's engagement celebrations in Positano, Italy, were extravagant.

In a recent incident in Chhattisgarh, a man named Virendra Joshi allegedly exploited the state's Mahtari Vandan Yojana by registering an account under the name of Bollywood actress Sunny Leone. This scheme, launched in March 2024, provides Rs 1,000 monthly to married women to promote women's empowerment.According to a report by The Economic Times, the BJP government's scheme provides Rs 1,000 per month to married women in the state. The fraud was uncovered in Talur village, Bastar district. District Collector Haris S has ordered an investigation and the seizure of the bank account. Officials revealed that media reports exposed the fraud.Joshi, a resident of Talur village in Bastar district, reportedly created an online bank account in Sunny Leone's name and had been receiving the monthly payments since the scheme's inception.

An FIR has been lodged against Joshi, and authorities are investigating how the fraudulent registration bypassed the verification process.The incident has sparked political controversy, with the opposition Congress party alleging widespread corruption in the scheme. State Congress chief Deepak Baij claimed that over 50% of the beneficiaries under the Mahtari Vandan Yojana are fake.

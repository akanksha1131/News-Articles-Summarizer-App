JD Vance's socks make it to the US President Donald Trump's video celebrating America's friendship with Ireland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jd-vances-socks-make-it-to-the-us-president-donald-trumps-video-celebrating-americas-friendship-with-ireland/articleshow/119012895.cms,"The Socks That Took Center Stage

Not a First Fashion Distraction for Donald Trump

The US Vice President JD Vance' widely talked about socks that made the US President take notice during his meeting with Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin in White House's Oval Office have also made it to the video shared by the POTUS. ""We‚Äôre gathered to celebrate the deep and abiding ties of history, family, and friendship that bind together Ireland and the United States of America. America has truly been blessed by the courage and unstoppable spirit of the Irish."" ‚ÄìPresident Donald J. Trump üá∫üá∏üáÆüá™ @MichealMartinTD,"" read the post from the President Trump on Twitter. The Tweet is accompanied by a video that shares moments from the Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin's US visit. In the video some two seconds are 'devoted' to VP JD Vance's socks.For those wondering what all the socks buzz is about, earlier this week the US President Donald Trump and Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin met at the White House for the traditional St Patrick's Day festivities. During a press gathering, Trump started speaking about inflation but suddenly stopped, his attention drawn to Vance‚Äôs holiday-themed socks. ""I have to just speak of inflation,"" Trump began, before trailing off and pointing at Vance‚Äôs feet and complimenting him for his socks.He quipped, ""I love these socks. What's with these socks!""‚Äî- prompting laughter from those in the room. After Vance explained that the fashion choice was actually in honor of the Irish prime minister, Trump joked, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to stay focused, but I‚Äôm very impressed with the VP‚Äôs socks.‚ÄùLater in a post on Twitter, JD Vance said that he knew that President Trump would notice his socks, ending with the 'Rolling on the floor laughing' emoji. ""I knew he'd comment on these socks ü§£.""JD Vance‚Äôs white socks, adorned with green shamrocks, were a subtle tribute to the occasion. His habit of wearing shorter trousers, which ride up when he sits, ensured the eye-catching, festive footwear didn‚Äôt go unnoticed. The shamrock, a variety of clover, carries rich cultural meaning in Ireland and is closely tied to St. Patrick‚Äôs Day festivities.This isn‚Äôt the first time Trump has been thrown off by someone‚Äôs style. During his presidential campaign, he allegedly took a jab at Elon Musk ‚Äôs wardrobe, zeroing in on a poorly fitting shirt.‚ÄúWhat the **** is wrong with this guy? And why doesn‚Äôt his shirt fit?‚Äù Trump is said to have remarked. The comment came as Musk, sporting a black ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù (MAGA) hat and an untucked T-shirt, hopped around the stage, inadvertently flashing his midriff.",US Vice President JD Vance wore green shamrocks on St. Patrick's Day.

"Intel needs help from TSMC now, for at least ...: Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-needs-help-from-tsmc-now-for-at-least-zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu/articleshow/119009455.cms,"Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu

What Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu wrote on X

I have used the analogy ""Flash floods can destroy existing ponds, leaving less water after the flood recedes"". This is the structural damage caused by flash floods.

Financial bubbles (floods) are similar and they can have far ranging effects. When money pours into an industry too rapidly, it sucks resources, and can leave us with fewer capabilities than before, in other critical sectors that get neglected during the flood of money.

There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now - for at least a generation now, the smartest talent in silicon valley did not go into fabs. No investor would touch that sector because no big exits.

This is why financial bubbles are so damaging. And the longer a bubble lasts, the more structural (and cultural) damage it inflicts to more sectors.

In the Indian context, the IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries.

We have to make up for lost time.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared his thoughts on the long-term consequences of financial bubbles, comparing them to flash floods that can leave lasting structural damage. In a recent post, Vembu explained how an influx of capital into one sector can drain resources from others, ultimately weakening overall economic capabilities. Using Silicon Valley as an example, he pointed out how the semiconductor industry suffered because the best talent avoided fabs (fabrication plants) in favor of sectors with more lucrative exits. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now ‚Äì for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors largely ignored the sector due to a lack of big exits.Drawing parallels to India, Vembu argued that the dominance of the IT industry over the years led to the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he noted.He emphasized the need to address these gaps and rebuild capabilities in neglected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" Vembu concluded.Vembu wrote:",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared his thoughts on the long-term consequences of financial bubbles.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat. In the post, Altman wrote ‚Äúvery proud of the openai team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades‚Ä¶thought that was the thing i'd always be most proud of in life‚Äù. Adding further, he wrote ‚Äúturns out i am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own!‚Äù.In a follow-up post, Altman wrote ‚Äúi realize i am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best)‚Äù.Sam Altman welcomed his baby boy last month with his partner and software engineer Oliver Mulherin.

Come April 1 of Fiscal Year 2026-27, a new rule in the Income Tax Act law may grant the Income Tax department powers to access your social media accounts or emails in case they suspect tax evasion . Income Tax Bill 2025, which was introduced in the Parliament recently, will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces, termed Virtual Digital Spaces in the bill. This means that the Income Tax department can break into social media accounts, personal emails, bank accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, and more if they have any reason to believe that you own any undisclosed income, money, Gold, Jewelry, or valuable item or property on which you haven‚Äôt paid applicable Income Tax.Presently, Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, allows Income Tax officials to seize assets and books during search operations if they find sufficient reasons to believe that an individual is in possession of undisclosed income or assets. The changes in the bill, once passed in the Parliament, will extend this authourity to the digital realm, allowing officials to bypass security measures on computer systems and virtual spaces.The Clause 247 of the Income Tax Bill outlines this expanded power, stating that officers can ‚Äúbreak open the lock of any door, box, locker, safe, almirah, or other receptacle‚Äù or ‚Äúgain access by overriding the access code‚Äù to computer systems or virtual digital spaces when access is otherwise unavailable. This applies if they believe an individual possesses undisclosed income or assets taxable under the law.According to the bill, the term Virtual Digital Space includes email servers, social media accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, banking accounts, and any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset. It further adds that virtual digital space is an environment, area or realm that is constructed and experienced through computer technology and not the physical, tangible world, which encompasses any digital realm that allows users to interact, communicate and perform activities using computer systems, computer networks, computer resources, communication devices, cyberspace, internet, worldwide web and emerging technologies, using data and information in the electronic form for creation, storage or exchange and includes:* Email servers* Social media account* Online investment account, trading account, banking account, etc* Any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset* Remote server or cloud servers* Digital application platforms* Any other space of similar natureAs to who all can wield this authority? The bill designates ‚Äúauthorised officers‚Äù as senior tax officials, including Joint Directors, Additional Directors, Joint Commissioners, Additional Commissioners, Assistant or Deputy Directors, Assistant or Deputy Commissioners, Income Tax Officers, and Tax Recovery Officers.What does this mean for individuals? The new rules significantly widen the scope of tax investigations, giving officials the ability to probe deeply into personal and financial digital footprints. As this provision takes effect, it raises questions about privacy and the balance between tax enforcement and individual rights.","Income Tax Bill 2025 will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces.

LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman dismissed claims of a mutual feud with Elon Musk , stating that any animosity between the tech moguls is entirely from Musk's side, stemming from OpenAI's success following Musk's departure. ""Well, so actually, it's more his beef with me for having made OpenAI successful with his departure,"" Hoffman said during a BBC Radio 4 interview on Thursday. ""Because he left saying, you know, 'You're all a bunch of jackasses and you'll fail,' and I helped them succeed.""The tension between the former OpenAI backers escalated publicly over the weekend when Musk accused Hoffman of funding Tesla protests through ActBlue-affiliated groups.

""Just one more of Elon's false claims about me: I never funded anyone for Tesla protests,"" he responded on X. ""I don't condone violence. But it's clear Americans are angry at him‚Äîit's easier to explain away their anger than to accept that actions have consequences.""The exchange grew more contentious when Musk enigmatically asked Hoffman to ""Describe your favorite island vacation,"" to which Hoffman replied with a graph showing Tesla's declining stock price, quipping, ""I don't know about islands but here's your least favorite mountain.""Hoffman suggested that Musk struggles with collaboration, stating AI development should be led by those willing to ""consult with and deal with other people"" ‚Äî adding that ""That's not how Elon operates, which anyone who has two eyes can see.""This public dispute follows Musk's unsuccessful $97.4 billion bid to take control of OpenAI last month and his ongoing lawsuit against the company that Hoffman previously characterized as ""sour grapes"" over the company's achievements without Musk's involvement.",LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman dismissed claims of a mutual feud with Elon Musk.

Narayana Murthy agrees AI will lead to job losses, but ...

NR Narayana Murthy , co-founder of Infosys , spoke at TiECon Mumbai on Wednesday, attempting to temper the overhyped buzz surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) in India. He pointed out that many systems marketed as AI were simply traditional programming. ‚ÄúI think somehow it has become a fashion in India to talk of AI for everything. I have seen several normal, ordinary programs touted as AI,‚Äù Murthy commented during the annual entrepreneurial conference.In a discussion with Harish Mehta, founding president of TiE Mumbai, Murthy clarified that genuine AI rests on two key pillars: Machine learning , which facilitates extensive correlation for predictions, and Deep Learning, which emulates human brain function through unsupervised algorithms.""Frankly, most of what passes for AI these days is trivial and outdated coding,"" Murthy asserted. ""It's the unsupervised algorithms leveraging deep learning and neural networks that hold far greater promise for increasingly human-like capabilities.""Murthy went on to add that deep learning will be able to solve, and handle what are called ‚Äúunsupervised algorithms‚Äù. While machine learning by and large handles supervised algorithms because you have to give a lot of data into that, deep learning uses the data to create new branches of programs or new conditions. And then it will be able to take decisions.While recognizing that AI will displace some jobs, he emphasized its potential to boost economic growth. ""Every technology eliminates certain roles, but when applied supportively, it can expand the economy.""Murthy also urged entrepreneurs to generate employment. ""I'm confident each of you will spawn hundreds of thousands of jobs‚Äîthat‚Äôs how you tackle poverty. Handouts have never lifted any nation out of poverty,"" he concluded.","Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, spoke at TiECon Mumbai on Wednesday.

"Thanks to Peter Thiel's Palantir and these companies, building tech for the US government and Military may be Cool again at Stanford",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/thanks-to-peter-thiels-palantir-and-these-companies-building-tech-for-the-us-government-and-military-is-cool-again-at-stanford/articleshow/118991130.cms,"Defense companies that are no longer ""looked down upon"" at Stanford

When Divya Ganesan began her political science studies at Stanford in 2021, a career in national security wasn‚Äôt on her radar. According to The San Francisco Standard, she recalled that defense intelligence firms like Palantir, which contract with the government, were once ‚Äúsuper looked down upon‚Äù on campus. ‚ÄúThey were seen as the evil guys,‚Äù Ganesan told the publication. But the campus mood has since transformed. After enrolling in the popular course ‚ÄúSpies, Lies, and Algorithms‚Äù in 2022, Ganesan reportedly found herself captivated by defense technology . She went on to cofound Stanford Women in National Security (WINS), a student group that now boasts over 150 members, and pursued internships at the National Security Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. ‚ÄúMy most effective and moral friends are now working for Palantir,‚Äù she told The San Francisco Standard. Palantir, cofounded by Peter Thiel -‚Äî a known supporter of President Donald Trump‚Äîprovides surveillance and targeting systems to the military and has seen its stock soar to record highs since Trump‚Äôs inauguration.Stanford graduates are landing roles at high-profile firms like Palantir, Anduril, Vannevar Labs, and Shield AI, while others are founding their own security startups. Max Susman, a former Navy SEAL and Stanford MBA student, started Revere Technologies, a drone company, and praised the Gordian Knot Center‚Äôs support. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt had to fly to D.C. Senior Pentagon officials make a stop at Stanford or the Gordian Knot, and I get an audience,‚Äù he told The San Francisco Standard.Stanford students are, as per the report, said to be increasingly embracing the idea of building tech for the U.S. government. Some are even leaving school to launch defense tech startups or vie for prestigious internships at government agencies and major contractors. Undergraduates, business school students, recent alumni, and faculty alike are fueling a growing enthusiasm for developing military technology , The San Francisco Standard reports.Ganesan, who once wrestled with the ethics of defense work, now feels differently. ‚ÄúIn great power politics, people die. Often more impulsive, less pragmatic men make those decisions, and as a well-educated woman, I‚Äôd rather be in the room,‚Äù she explained to The San Francisco Standard. This marks a stark departure from the sentiment just seven years ago, when, in 2018, Stanford students and activists protested outside Palantir‚Äôs Palo Alto headquarters over its contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That same year, thousands of Google employees petitioned against ‚ÄúProject Maven,‚Äù a Pentagon AI drone-targeting initiative.Today, interest in defense-related coursework is surging. Enrollment in ‚ÄúHacking for Defense,‚Äù where students collaborate with American military sponsors on security challenges, has spiked. To meet this demand, Stanford launched the Gordian Knot Center in 2021 with an initial $1.28 million from the US Office of Naval Research. Named after an ancient Greek metaphor for complex problems, the center has become a hub for defense tech programs, supporting WINS, the National Security Innovation Scholars fellowship, and the Stanford DEFCON conference, which drew over 1,000 attendees last year. Faculty have also introduced courses like ‚ÄúTechnology Innovation and Great Power Competition‚Äù in 2020 and ‚ÄúEntrepreneurship Inside Government‚Äù in 2025 to cater to eager undergraduates.","Stanford students are increasingly embracing the idea of building tech for the U.S. government.

How Microsoft has used this survey to improve employee morale



Microsoft is seeing an improvement in employee sentiments . According to an internal survey, a higher percentage of the tech giant‚Äôs workforce now reports that they feel they are getting a ""good deal"" at the company. In the latest Microsoft employee survey , conducted in October 2024, 65% of respondents agreed with the statement: ""There is a reasonable balance between what I contribute to Microsoft and what I get in return."" Microsoft uses this specific survey question to gauge employee sentiment concerning work-life balance and compensation.According to a report by Business Insider, a Microsoft spokesperson said that the latest results of the survey represent a 3% rise compared to the survey taken six months earlier. Survey results from last summer had shown a decrease in positive responses to this above mentioned survey question, dropping from 69% to 62% year-over-year. The results of the survey highlight the significance of the recent positive shift in employee morale.In 2022, a declining score on this question prompted Microsoft to raise pay to address concerns about compensation and to reduce employee departures to competitors like Amazon, the report adds.Since then, the tech industry has experienced notable changes. Tech stocks fell during 2022 as the pandemic boom ended, leading many companies to focus on improving efficiency, with investors prioritising profitability over continual growth.Additionally, new AI tools may also be reducing demand for some tech roles. In 2023, Microsoft implemented a salary freeze. The next survey, scheduled for April, follows Microsoft's decision to lay off about 2,000 employees identified as underperformers, the report notes.As per the report, the company is also updating its performance review process , reflecting a shift toward a stricter approach to employee management after years of relatively lenient treatment.","Microsoft is seeing an improvement in employee sentiments.

Change in tone on Trump Tariffs

Bet on Trump tariffs in the long run

Has the falling US stock market led to a change in stance of Jamie Dimon, CEO of America's largest Bank, JPMorgan Chase , on tariffs announced by the US President Donald Trump. It seems likely, though Dimon has not slammed Donald Trump 's tariff policy, he did acknowledge that they are causing uncertainty for companies. Just two months ago, at the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, Jamie Dimon brusquely defended President Donald Trump's international tariff policy, telling critics to ""Get over it."" Dimon went on to dismiss the concerns about tariffs and suggested that they could serve as either ""an economic tool"" or ""an economic weapon,"" depending on their application. In a CNBC interview at the time, he added, ""If it‚Äôs a little inflationary, but it‚Äôs good for national security, so be it.""With stock markets declining and signs of strain emerging in the US economy, it now appears thatDimon may be rethinking his stance. In a recent interview with Semafor, Dimon said, ""I don‚Äôt think the average American consumer who wakes up in the morning and goes to work‚Ä¶ changes what they‚Äôre going to do because they read about tariffs."" He acknowledged, however, that ""companies might,"" noting that ""uncertainty is not a good thing."" The US stock market has lost $4 trillion in value since its February peak this month.The US stock market has been witnessing volatility since the past few weeks. While markets rallied on Wednesday, March 12, the S&P 500 remained down over 7% from a month ago. That same day, President Trump announced broad 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to the US, escalating a global trade war. Canada and the European Union quickly responded with retaliatory measures.Trump has argued these tariffs will boost American manufacturing, curb illegal immigration, and stop fentanyl smuggling, though economists warn they could raise prices on goods ranging from groceries to housing.Incidentally, Dimon wasn‚Äôt alone in expressing concern about trade tensions. According to the Semafor report, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink , who oversees the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, gave a mixed response to CNN on Trump Tariffs . ""The collective impact in the short run is that people are pausing, they‚Äôre pulling back,"" Fink said. ""Talking to CEOs throughout the economy, I hear that the economy is weakening as we speak,"" Find said.Despite these short-term worries, Fink suggested that Trump‚Äôs policies, including tariffs, might benefit the US over time. ""Right now the president is focusing on tariffs, but when he talks about reciprocal tariffs, actually, that may bring down tariffs over the long run,"" Fink said, maintaining his long-term optimism about America‚Äôs economic prospects.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has not slammed Donald Trump's tariff policy.

What US said about the cryptocurrency exchange administrator



India has arrested an administrator of the Garantex cryptocurrency exchange . Acting on a request from US authorities, Varkala police in Kerala apprehended Aleksej Besciokov , a 46-year-old Lithuanian national. The arrest was made based on an Interpol red corner notice issued at the request of the US. Besciokov is alleged to be a co-founder of Garantex, a cryptocurrency exchange that was sanctioned by the US government in 2022. US authorities accuse him of facilitating the laundering of billions of dollars for transnational criminal and cybercriminal organisations. Varkala police DSP B Gopakumar told TOI that the arrest was executed under the direction of the Additional CJM court at Patiala House, acting on the US request.Last week, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed an indictment against Besciokov and another alleged co-founder, Aleksandr Mira Serda, a Russian national who resides in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Besciokov was accused of personally authorising transactions on Garantex connected to hackers affiliated with the North Korean government and other cybercriminals. The DOJ has also criminally charged him with facilitating money laundering on the crypto exchange.According to US prosecutors, the two administrators ‚Äúredesigned Garantex‚Äôs operations to evade and violate US sanctions and induce American businesses to unwittingly transact with Garantex in violation of the sanctions.‚ÄùLast week, after the Justice Department unsealed the indictment against Besciokov and Serda, the US Secret Service seized Garantex‚Äôs websites, and authorities froze over $26 million in cryptocurrency.Since then, Garantex has suspended its operations and invited customers to ‚Äúface-to-face meetings‚Äù at its office in Moscow, having devised an unspecified ‚Äúsolution for blocked assets.‚ÄùIn a statement to TechCrunch, Indian police said that it sought an arrest warrant for Besciokov at the US government's request as he was planning to flee India. After his arrest, he was brought before a district court and is set to appear at Patiala Court next week to face charges.","Varkala police in Kerala apprehended Aleksej Besciokov, a 46-year-old Lithuanian national.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is reportedly planning to recommend a shorter timeframe ‚Äì five years ‚Äì for the allocation of satellite broadband spectrum, a move that may challenge Elon Musk's Starlink, which has been advocating for a 20-year permit.Reuters, citing a senior official, reports that the telecom regulator is drafting key recommendations for the government on satellite spectrum allocation , including its duration and pricing.As per the government source, TRAI plans to favour a shorter license timeframe ‚Äúof around 5 years and then see how the sector grows‚Äù, explaining that ‚Äúthis will help understand how the market stabilises, so there's no point going beyond five years.‚ÄùThe government source also indicated that TRAI is expected to take approximately a month to finalise its recommendations on the license timeframe.While Starlink has urged the government to grant a 20-year spectrum allocation, citing the need for ‚Äúaffordable pricing and longer-term business plans,‚Äù Jio has sought a shorter three-year period, with the intention of India reassessing the market after that time. Airtel has also supported a shorter license period, advocating for a 3-5 year timeframeCiting an industry source familiar with licensing processes, the report said that a shorter timeframe will allow India the flexibility to revise spectrum prices as the satellite broadband market evolves.This development comes shortly after both Airtel and Jio struck a partnership with Elon Musk‚Äôs Starlink to provide high-speed internet services.This partnership marks a shift from their previous positions, as both Jio and Airtel previously advocated an auction of the spectrum rather than the administrative allocation favoured by Musk, who argued that spectrum allocation aligns with international standards.","TRAI is reportedly planning to recommend a shorter timeframe ‚Äì five years ‚Äì for the allocation of satellite broadband spectrum.

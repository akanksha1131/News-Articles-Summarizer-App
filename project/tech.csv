Tech giants offer reassurances but damage spreads



European governments pivot toward digital independence



European governments and institutions are accelerating efforts to reduce their dependence on American tech giants after President Trump used executive powers to force Microsoft to suspend the email account of an International Criminal Court prosecutor investigating Israel for war crimes, according to a New York Times report.The February incident involving ICC prosecutor Karim Khan has become a watershed moment for European policymakers, who now view America's tech dominance as a potential weapon that could be wielded against them even in allied nations like the Netherlands. Microsoft's swift compliance with Trump's sanctions order shocked European officials and crystallized long-standing concerns about digital sovereignty .""The I.C.C. showed this can happen,"" Dutch cybersecurity expert and European Parliament member Bart Groothuis told the Times. ""It's not just fantasy."" Groothuis, who previously supported U.S. tech firms, said he has done a ""180-degree flip-flop"" and now believes Europe must take steps toward greater technological independence.The ICC incident has prompted immediate changes across European institutions. Some ICC officials have switched to Proton, a Swiss encrypted email provider, while the court has implemented extensive measures to ensure operational continuity despite ongoing U.S. sanctions, three sources familiar with the communications revealed to the Times.American tech companies control over 70 percent of Europe's cloud computing market, making the region heavily dependent on services from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft for essential digital infrastructure including file storage, data retrieval, and software operations.Microsoft President Brad Smith acknowledged that the ICC episode was a ""symptom"" of eroding U.S.-Europe trust, telling the Times that ""the I.C.C. issue added fuel to a fire that was already burning."" The company has since enacted policy changes to protect customers in similar geopolitical situations, and when Trump sanctioned four additional ICC judges this month, their email accounts remained active.CEO Satya Nadella recently visited the Netherlands to announce new ""sovereign solutions"" for European institutions, including enhanced legal and data security protections. Amazon and Google have launched similar initiatives targeting European customers concerned about geopolitical volatility.Despite corporate reassurances, European nations are pursuing concrete alternatives. Denmark's digital ministry is testing Microsoft Office replacements, while Germany's Schleswig-Holstein state is reducing Microsoft usage. The Netherlands government has made digital autonomy a central priority, exploring partnerships with European providers.The European Union has announced billion-euro investments in AI data centers and cloud infrastructure designed to reduce American tech dependence. European Parliament lawmakers are discussing policies favoring EU-based tech services for government procurement.European cloud providers like Netherlands-based Intermax Group and Switzerland's Exoscale report significant increases in new business. ""A few years ago, everyone was saying, 'They're our trusted partners,'"" Intermax CEO Ludo Baauw told the Times, referring to U.S. tech companies. ""There's been a radical change.""",President Trump used executive powers to force Microsoft to suspend the email account of an International Criminal Court prosecutor.

What Canada’s cybersecurity agency said about the recent hacking incident



“The Cyber Centre is aware of malicious cyber activities currently targeting Canadian telecommunications companies. The responsible actors are almost certainly PRC state-sponsored actors, specifically Salt Typhoon,”

Canada's cybersecurity agency , the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, has issued a warning that Chinese-backed hackers are likely responsible for a recent attack that compromised telecommunications infrastructure in the country. The agency confirmed that three network devices registered to a Canadian company were compromised in these attacks. In a joint bulletin (as seen by Bloomberg) released this week with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ), the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security urged Canadian organisations to strengthen their networks against the threat posed by Salt Typhoon , a hacking group with documented links to the Chinese government. The warning emphasises the ongoing risk and the need for immediate action to protect critical infrastructure.the agency said, referring to the People’s Republic of China, reports Bloomberg.The agency also noted that separate investigations showing overlaps with indicators linked to Salt Typhoon indicate the cyber campaign “is broader than just the telecommunications sector.”According to the agency, the hackers will “almost certainly” continue attempting to infiltrate Canadian organisations — particularly telecom providers — over the next two years, the report adds.Beijing has consistently rejected US claims linking it to Salt Typhoon, a group first reported by The Wall Street Journal last year. In January, the US imposed sanctions on a Chinese company for allegedly being “directly involved” in the cyber intrusions , along with China’s Ministry of State Security.","The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security has issued a warning that Chinese-backed hackers are likely responsible for a recent attack.

Musk, on the contrary, prefers a simple lifestyle with very few belongings. In Twitter post in May 2020, he wrote “I am selling almost all physical possessions. Will own no house”. The tech billionaire, in a Joe Rogan podcast has also said “I think possessions kind of weigh you down.

He stated that at 17 he tested if he could live on just $1 a day for food.Describing the experiment as ""StarTalk"", Elon Musk then said “In America it’s pretty easy to keep yourself alive. So my threshold for existing was pretty low. I figured I could be in some dingy apartment with my computer and be okay, and not starve.”Google co-founder Larry Page has previously shared that Musk sometimes asked to crash at his house when he had nowhere else to stay. In a 2022 TED talk, Elon Musk said, “I don't even own a place right now, I'm literally staying at friends' places.”Musk’s former partner Grimes once told Vanity Fair that he lived “at times below the poverty line.” During the interview in March 2022, she said “Bro does not live like a billionaire” adding “Bro lives at times below the poverty line.”She then recalled staying in a “$40,000 house” with no security and a mattress that had a hole in it. Instead of replacing the mattress, Musk told her they should just “switch sides.”According to a Benzinga report, Musk once bought a $1 million McLaren F1 but crashed it while showing it off. “Watch this,” he said before losing control of the car. It flew into the air and crashed.“It wasn’t insured,” he later admitted.

Fresh stolen data could fuel next wave of online crime

Immediate action required for all users

Security researchers have uncovered an unprecedented data breach involving 16 billion login credentials across 30 databases, potentially affecting users of major platforms including Facebook Gmail , Apple, and countless other services. The discovery, made by CyberNews researchers during an ongoing investigation since January 2025, represents what could be the largest credential leak in history.The exposed datasets range dramatically in size, from smaller collections containing tens of millions of records to massive databases housing over 3.5 billion credentials each. The massive trove of stolen data was briefly accessible through unsecured databases before being locked down, though researchers were unable to identify the owners. Most concerning is that virtually all datasets were previously unreported, with only one 184-million-record database having been disclosed before by Wired magazine in May.The leaked credentials span virtually every major online service imaginable, creating a ""blueprint for mass exploitation,"" according to the research team. The databases contain login information for social media giants like Facebook and Instagram, email services including Gmail, developer platforms such as GitHub, messaging apps like Telegram, VPN services, and even government portals.Each record typically follows a standard format: website URL, username, and password. This structure matches the collection methods used by infostealer malware, malicious software designed to harvest sensitive information from infected devices.“Telegram's primary login method is a one-time-password delivered by SMS. As a result, this is far less relevant for Telegram users compared to other platforms where the password is always the same,” Telegram said in a statement to TOI.Unlike recycled data from old breaches, researchers emphasise this represents ""fresh, weaponizable intelligence at scale."" The credentials provide cybercriminals with unprecedented access for account takeovers, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing campaigns that can devastate both individuals and organisations.CyberNews researchers warn that new massive datasets emerge every few weeks, highlighting the pervasive nature of infostealer malware in today's digital landscape. The inclusion of recent logs with tokens, cookies, and metadata makes this data particularly dangerous for organisations lacking multi-factor authentication.With approximately 5.5 billion people having internet access globally, the breach potentially affects multiple accounts per person. Security experts recommend immediate password changes across all online accounts, enabling multi-factor authentication wherever possible, and using password managers to generate unique, strong passwords.Users are also advised to regularly monitor their accounts and consider using services like ""Have I Been Pwned"" to check if their credentials have been compromised.Apart from this, it's always better to use the latest software versions, enable automatic updates and access only secure, trusted URLs (preferably HTTPS) while avoiding links in unsolicited email messages.","Security researchers have uncovered an unprecedented data breach involving 16 billion login credentials across 30 databases.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning to American businesses: the real labor crisis isn’t a worker shortage—it’s a skills shortage . Speaking at the Business Routable’s CEO Workforce Forum, Dimon asked the coperate leaders to not wait for the government fixes and should directly partner with the schools to close the growing talent gap. “What you’re really short of is the skills you need,” Dimon said, pointing to critical areas like cybersecurity, coding, project management, and financial literacy . He stressed that the companies must invest in education pipelines and push for curricula which blends job-ready credentials with traditional academics.Jamie Dimon who is an advocate of workforce development , feels that continous mismatch between available jobs and qualified candidates act as a threat to economic growth and innovation across multiple sectors ranging from advanced manufacturing and healthcare to technology and financial services.He also mentioned that global estimates suggest that 10 millions of jobs will go unfilled by 2030 due to lack of skilled talent.""We need to break down the barriers between education and employment ,"" Jamie Dimon stated at a recent economic summit. ""It's time to build a system that helps people learn, adapt, and thrive throughout their careers—not just at the start.""Dimon asked for high-schools and colleges to offer workplace focused courses as part of their curriculum. The billionaire banker also stressed that businesses can’t rely solely on four-year degrees. “They all want jobs,” he said of young graduates. “But many end up in retail or inventory roles, when there are jobs in coding, cyber, and financial management.”Jamie Dimon is also calling for unprecedented collaboration between the private sector, government agencies, and educational institutions. He advocates for incentives for companies that invest in workforce training and increased public funding for apprenticeship programs and digital learning platforms. ""No single entity can solve the skills crisis alone,"" he emphasised. ""It will take all of us working together.""",JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning to American businesses: the real labor crisis isn’t a worker shortage—it’s a skills shortage.

Likely cause of Truth Social outage

Truth Social malfunctioned reportedly went down minutes after President Donald Trump’s announcement that the United States had bombed Iran’s nuclear facilities. As per screenshots shared on social media platforms, starting around 8 pm ET on Saturday (June 21), attempts to load the social network displayed error messages saying: “Network failed,” “Please try again.” For those unaware, Truth Social is owned by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG).DownDetector, a website that crowdsources service outages, saw an influx of reports of Truth Social going down around 8 pm. The reason for the apparent outage was not immediately clear. NetBlocks , which monitors internet accessibility, posted on BlueSky just before 9 pm ET: “Truth Social is experiencing international outages for many users after US President Donald Trump announces strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran; incident not related to country-level internet disruptions or filtering.”Reports suggest that Truth Social started facing issues soon after Trump posted first update on the Iran attack. Trump posted around 7.46 pm ET that the United States had entered Israel’s war against Iran stating that the US had waged a “very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan.” Some screenshots suggest API congestion as the cause of the disruption.All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow,” Trump continued. “All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE! Thank you for your attention to this matter.”Trump frequently shares posts to Truth Social about issues of national and international importance. The president appeared to post multiple times after news of the US bombings against Iran were first announced. A significant portion of Trump’s net worth is reportedly derived from his stake in TMTG, Truth Social’s parent company.According to a report in Wired, earlier this week, Truth Social reportedly sent an email to at least some users encouraging them to follow Trump’s account. The email read in part, “If you aren’t following President Donald J. Trump on Truth Social, you’re missing an essential resource for navigating world affairs today.”","Truth Social went down around 8 pm ET on Saturday (June 21) Attempts to load the social network displayed error messages saying: “Network failed,” “Please try again.” For those unaware, Truth Social is owned by Trump Media & Technology Group.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122001915,imgsize-11876,width-400,resizemode-4/TruthSocial.jpg"

Chinese hacking groups 'targetting' Russian businesses

What techniques Chinese hackers are said to be using against Russia

Cyber analysts have reportedly discovered a strange cyberwarfare trend. According to a report by New York Times, quoting security researchers, since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, groups linked to the Chinese government have repeatedly hacked Russian companies and government agencies in an apparent search for military secrets. There has been increase in Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Chinese government-linked hackers have repeatedly targeted Russian companies and government agencies, seeking military secrets, according to the New York Times report.The cyberattacks, which intensified in May 2022, have persisted despite public declarations of a “no-limits” partnership between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.The report claims that a Chinese hacking group, Sanyo, impersonated a Russian engineering firm’s email addresses in 2023 to steal data on nuclear submarines, as uncovered by Taiwan-based cybersecurity firm TeamT5, which linked the attack to Beijing. “China likely seeks to gather intelligence on Russia’s activities, including on its military operation in Ukraine, defense developments and other geopolitical maneuvers,” TeamT5 researcher Che Chang told the Times.A classified Russian FSB document, obtained by The New York Times, reveals Moscow’s concerns about China’s pursuit of Russian defense technology and battlefield insights, labeling China an “enemy.” This contrasts with the public Sino-Russian alliance, as Russia relies on China for oil markets and war-critical technology. The document highlights China’s interest in drone warfare and software, noting that “the war in Ukraine fundamentally shifted intelligence priorities for both countries,” according to Itay Cohen of Palo Alto Networks, as quoted by the Times.The New York Times also reports that Chinese hackers targeted Rostec, Russia’s state-owned defense conglomerate, for satellite communications and radar data, using malicious Microsoft Word files to infiltrate aviation and state entities. Groups like Mustang Panda, suspected of ties to China’s Ministry of State Security, have hit Russian military and border units, the Times notes, citing Rafe Pilling of Sophos. Pilling told the Times, “The targeting we’ve observed tends to be political and military intelligence gathering.”Proprietary malware like Deed RAT, used by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, has been deployed against Russian aerospace and defense sectors, the report said, citing Positive Technologies. Despite 2009 and 2015 agreements barring mutual cyberattacks, the Times notes that experts view these as symbolic, with hacking spiking post-Ukraine invasion. “The activity — we saw it immediately in the months following Russia’s full-scale invasion,” Cohen told the Times, highlighting the tension beneath the public narrative of Sino-Russian unity.","Chinese government-linked hackers have repeatedly targeted Russian companies and government agencies, seeking military secrets, according to a New York Times report.

Diversification strategy emerges

Microsoft is prepared to abandon high-stakes negotiations with OpenAI over their multibillion-dollar partnership as the ChatGPT maker pursues conversion to a for-profit company, according to sources familiar with the discussions. The software giant has considered halting complex talks with the $300 billion AI startup if critical issues, including Microsoft's future stake size, remain unresolved.The two companies had issued a joint statement emphasizing their ""long-term, productive partnership"" and expressing optimism about continuing to ""build together for years to come."" However, the Financial Times reports that Microsoft would rely on its existing commercial contract through 2030 if negotiations fail, unless offered terms equal to or better than current arrangements.Under their current agreement established in 2019, Microsoft holds exclusive rights to sell OpenAI's models and receives 20% of revenues up to $92 billion. The companies have battled over Microsoft's equity stake in a restructured OpenAI, with discussions ranging from 20% to 49% ownership in exchange for Microsoft's $13 billion investment.OpenAI faces a year-end deadline to complete its corporate conversion or risk losing billions in investor funding, including a potential $10 billion reduction from SoftBank's $30 billion commitment.

Florida air traffic controllers briefly lose radar: Here’s what FAA said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/florida-air-traffic-controllers-briefly-lose-radar-heres-what-faa-said/articleshow/121994009.cms,"Representative Image

“There was no loss of critical air traffic service,”

Air traffic controllers in Jacksonville, Florida, briefly lost access to radar on Friday, June 20 after a fiber optic line was cut. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the outage did not result in any flight delays or cancellations, as a backup system activated immediately. The FAA said the Jacksonville radar center remained operational, though it switched to an alert status once its primary communication line went down.an FAA spokesperson said. However, officials did not confirm the cause or exact location of the fiber cut.The Jacksonville center oversees aircraft flying through around 160,000 square miles of airspace, covering parts of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, and South Carolina.This incident stood in contrast to similar radar outages earlier this year at a facility in Philadelphia. In that case, the backup system took 90 seconds to activate, and the resulting confusion led to major flight disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. Five air traffic controllers went on trauma leave following the Philadelphia outage, and hundreds of flights were canceled.The FAA said those earlier issues highlighted the need to modernise parts of the US air traffic control system, which still depends on older copper wiring. Transportation officials are pushing Congress to approve funding for system upgrades.","Fiber optic line cut at air traffic control center in Jacksonville, Florida.

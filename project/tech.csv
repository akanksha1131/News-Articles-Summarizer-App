What is Office Agent in Copilot chat





Microsoft has launched new features in its 365 Copilot, introducing Agent Mode in Office apps and Office Agent in Copilot chat. Announcing the new features, the company said the update is designed to bring “agentic productivity” to Office tools, allowing users to work with AI more interactively. With Agent Mode, available in Excel and Word, users can generate spreadsheets and documents directly within the apps by starting with a simple prompt and then refining results through iterative guidance. Support for PowerPoint will follow soon.The new Office Agent in Copilot chat, on the other hand, can create polished PowerPoint presentations and ready-to-use Word documents from a single prompt. Microsoft said Excel support will be added in the coming months. The company described the additions as the next step in human–AI collaboration, aimed at helping users complete multi-step tasks and produce higher-quality Office documents, spreadsheets and presentations more efficiently.Microsoft said Excel’s new Agent Mode is designed to make the app’s advanced features more accessible beyond expert users. While Excel already powers everything from household budgets to Fortune 500 profit and loss statements, many of its most powerful functions are difficult for non-specialists to use.Agent Mode brings AI that can “speak Excel” natively, combining the app’s data modeling tools with OpenAI’s latest reasoning models. According to Microsoft, the feature can generate outputs, check results, fix issues, and repeat the process until the outcome is verified — similar to working with an Excel expert, but with users still able to steer and guide.The company said the aim is to democratize access to expert-level Excel capabilities, making advanced data modeling approachable for a much wider audience.Microsoft also shared Agent Mode in Excel prompts to try:Agent Mode in Word is aimed to turn document writing into a more interactive and conversational process. The feature allows users to prompt Copilot with simple instructions — for example, “summarize recent customer feedback and highlight key trends.” Copilot then drafts content, suggests refinements, and asks clarifying questions, making the process feel more like a dialogue than a task.Microsoft said the tool uses Word’s native styles and formatting to produce polished documents while helping users focus on intent rather than execution. The company added that this deeper interaction enables faster iteration, improved ideas, and a more engaging writing experience.Here are some Agent Mode in Word prompts to try:Office Agent in Copilot lets users create PowerPoint presentations and Word documents directly from chat. Powered by Anthropic’s models, the tool is designed for a chat-first workflow, reflecting how much of today’s work begins in messaging interfaces.The company said Office Agent addresses a common shortcoming of AI tools over the past two years — the inability to produce effective presentation slides. With the new feature, users can generate well-structured PowerPoint decks and research-backed Word documents from a single prompt, aiming to make content creation faster and more reliable.","Microsoft has launched new features in its 365 Copilot, introducing Agent Mode in Office apps and Office Agent in Copilot chat.

How Google DeepMind’s new AI models can improve vision and reasoning in robots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-deepminds-new-ai-models-can-improve-vision-and-reasoning-in-robots/articleshow/124215324.cms,"How these two new AI models will work for robots



Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses





Google DeepMind has recently introduced two new artificial intelligence (AI) models, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 and Gemini Robotics 1.5. These new models are designed to enhance the capabilities of general-purpose robots significantly. The models are designed to operate in tandem, improving a robot's reasoning, vision, and ability to execute actions in real-world settings.According to a blog shared by the company, this new two-model system will split the planning and execution tasks. Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 will serve as the planner or orchestrator, determining the steps needed, while Gemini Robotics 1.5 is responsible for executing the physical functions based on natural language instructions.This separation is intended to overcome the limitations of earlier single-model systems, which often led to errors and delays when attempting to plan and perform actions simultaneously.The ER 1.5 model serves as a vision-language model (VLM) capable of advanced reasoning and integrating external tools. It can generate multi-step plans for tasks and shows strong performance on spatial understanding benchmarks. The model can also access resources, such as Google Search, to gather information and inform decision-making in physical environments.After a plan is created, Gemini Robotics 1.5, a vision-language-action (VLA) model, comes in. This model converts instructions and visual data into motor commands, allowing the robot to execute tasks. It determines the most efficient way to complete actions and can provide natural language explanations of its decisions.The system enables robots to handle complex, multi-step commands smoothly. For instance, a robot could sort items into compost, recycling, and trash bins by checking local recycling guidelines online, analysing objects, planning the sorting, and then executing the process.DeepMind notes that the AI models are adaptable to robots of various shapes and sizes due to their spatial awareness and flexible design. Currently, the ER 1.5 planner is available to developers via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio, while the VLA model is limited to select partners.This represents a step toward integrating generative AI into robotics, using natural language for control and separating planning from execution to reduce errors.","Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 will serve as the planner or orchestrator, while Gemini Robotics 1. 5 is responsible for executing the physical functions based on natural language instructions.

Kevin O’Leary warns $100K H‑1B fee threatens US and not India and other countries







Canadian millionaire and Stark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary has dismissed the idea that AI will destroy jobs. O’Leary disagrees with the idea that AI will wipe out jobs, instead he believes that artificial intelligence is a tool for productivity and higher-value opportunities. His comments come growing concerns that AI adoption is shrinking entry-level hiring across industries.O’Leary posted a video on social media platform X (previously known as Twitter) wrote, “AI isn’t destroying jobs, it’s creating better ones.” He stressed on the fact that how more than 50 of his companies are already using AI to cut costs and boost efficiency.“Even my watch insurance business issues policies in nine seconds thanks to AI. This is just the beginning,” he said.O’Leary also emphasised that AI eliminates repetitive, low-skill tasks and allow workers to learn and pursue higher-paying opportunities. If AI can flip burgers, that’s a good thing. It leaves people free to explore and educate themselves into higher levels of job creation,” he added.Drawing parallels with past technological shifts, he said: “When television came, they said radio would be dead.That never happened. It’s the same with AI.”Recently, investor and Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary has sharply criticised US President Donald Trump’s increased H-1B visa fee hike. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Kevin argued that the iconic tech giants Apple , Google and Oracle famously began in garages might have never taken off under today’s restrictive immigration rules. “I think what this does is hurt innovation long‑term,” O’Leary wrote, adding that the U.S. should not spend resources training top foreign students at institutions like MIT and Harvard only to “kick them out.” He suggested such graduates should automatically be allowed to stay, marry, and build companies in America.","O’Leary posted a video on social media platform X (previously known as Twitter) wrote, “AI isn’t destroying jobs, it’s creating better ones” He stressed on the fact that how more than 50 of his companies are already using AI to cut costs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124215210,imgsize-46140,width-400,resizemode-4/39shark-tank39-star-kevin-o39leary-says-financial-middlemen-will-be-left-shining-shoes-when-defi-technology-takes-their-jobs.jpg"

AI startup Anthropic is set to expand its global workforce. The Google and Amazon-backed AI startup is reportedly planning to hire a country lead for India and triple its international employee count by 2025. This major expansion, which includes a fivefold increase in its applied AI team, signals the $183 billion company's focus on international enterprise markets and intensified competition with rivals like OpenAI , Microsoft, and Google. The move comes as global demand drives the company’s growth, with nearly 80% of Claude’s usage now originating outside the United States. Anthropic is seeking to hire country heads for India, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, and Singapore, and is expanding its presence across Europe, according to the report. Currently, India is the second-largest market for Anthropic's Claude AI chatbot, accounting for 7.2% of its usage share. The expansion effort is being undertaken as rival OpenAI prepares to enter the country by the end of 2025.In an interview with CNBC, Chief Commercial Officer Paul Smith said Anthropic’s international expansion is exceeding their most optimistic expectations, with key clients signing on faster than anticipated. He highlighted strong uptake in industries such as life sciences and sovereign wealth management.Smith said:At Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic, Anthropic’s Claude helped reduce a process that usually takes three months for analysis and reporting at the end of a drug development cycle to just a few days, the company claimed.Smith noted that Anthropic is now expanding its hiring in key global markets. The company plans to recruit country leads for India, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, and Singapore, while continuing its broader expansion in the UK, northern and southern Europe, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.As part of its international growth, Anthropic is opening its first Asia office in Tokyo and expanding operations across Europe, including over 100 new roles in Dublin and London, as well as a research-focused hub in Zurich. Additional offices are expected to be established in the coming months.Chris Ciauri, who recently joined Anthropic as Managing Director of International, is leading the global expansion. The executive previously served as CEO of Unily and held senior positions at Google Cloud and Salesforce, where he worked with Smith and helped grow EMEA revenue from $200 million to over $3 billion.Ciauri told CNBC. Moreover, he added that major companies in Europe and Asia are increasingly working with Anthropic on industry-focused applications.","Google and Amazon-backed AI startup is reportedly planning to hire a country lead for India and triple its international employee count by 2025.

We are reaching out with an urgent update regarding international travel for individuals on H-1B visas.

A Proclamation is scheduled to take effect this Sunday at 12:01 AM ET. It introduces significant changes to re-entry procedures for H-1B visa holders currently outside the United States. We continue to review the Proclamation, but the initial advice we have received is that re-entry will require a mandatory payment of $100,000 per petition, which may cause substantial delays or prevent re-entry to the US

What You Need to Know:

If you are currently outside the US:

If you are currently outside the US with a valid H-1B visa, make plans to return and enter the US before the Proclamation takes effect on Sunday, September 21 at 12:01 am ET (i.e. by this Saturday night).

If you are currently in the US:

We strongly advise against any international travel if you are in valid H-1B status or need to travel to activate your H-1B visa. You should remain in the US

Departing the US may result in complications or denial of re-entry under the new policy.

If you are unable to return prior to the deadline in H-1B status: please reach out to go/immigration-help.

We understand this may create challenges, and we are here to support you. We are actively monitoring the situation and will keep you updated as we learn more.

Should you do an MBA? My views👇🏼

Most MBAs are outdated 🤷🏼

Better to learn how to build Products,

Best training ground if you want to accelerate your career or run a company one day.

That’s how I started. As a Product Manager.

Case studies and frameworks are nice, but they don’t teach you how to,

- Question the status quo

- Build deep empathy for customers

- Pursue global optima, not local wins

- Influence without authority

- Work backwards from the end state

That’s a Builder’s life.

It’s messy, political, creative, analytical — all at once.

A microcosm of real life, not classroom fluff.

That’s what helped me build companies, not the three-letter degree, although I do have one 🙈

So I tell young students & professionals to do an MBA, but a different kind. Do a Masters in Building Awesome things and you will graduate, not in 2 yrs, but every day 👨🏼‍🎓😎

Be a PM, Product Engineer, Product Designer, AI Builder, Hardware Designer, Robotics Engineer ….. heck, even a Toy Designer!

Because the 21st century will be led by builders who can also tell great stories 💪🏼

P:S - If you MUST do a top-tier MBA. Or hide for a few months & learn how to build, esp with AI 🤷🏼

Optus outage in Australia: What we know about the fatal triple-0 emergency call failures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/optus-outage-in-australia-what-we-know-about-the-fatal-triple-0-emergency-call-failures/articleshow/124038130.cms,"Company knew of problems hours before resolution

Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus is facing mounting pressure after a 13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and caused 600 triple-zero calls to fail across multiple states. The September 19 network failure has prompted government investigations and renewed calls for accountability from the embattled telco.The outage primarily affected South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, with some impact also recorded in far western New South Wales near the SA border, according to Reuters reporting. CEO Stephen Rue confirmed that established processes were not followed during a network firewall upgrade that began at 12:30 AM Thursday and lasted until approximately 1:30 PM (local time).Four deaths have been linked to the incident, though South Australian police later clarified that an eight-week-old boy's death in Gawler West was ""unlikely"" to have been caused by the outage delay. A 68-year-old Adelaide woman and two men aged 74 and 49 in Perth remain connected to the emergency services failure.The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) reported that Optus received multiple customer complaints about the triple-zero failure as early as 9 AM Thursday, with five customers contacting the call center about the outage.However, these concerns were not properly escalated, and government authorities weren't informed until after the issue was resolved.Communications Minister Anika Wells expressed ""unbelievable disappointment"" that Australia was ""here again so quickly,"" referencing a similar 2023 incident.

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

A side door for skilled professionals



Pros and cons of O-1B visa



The advantages of O-1B visa include:

No lottery or annual cap

Faster processing available

Renewable indefinitely

The drawbacks of O-1B visa are:

More subjective than H-1B, requiring proof of “extraordinary ability”

Some employers hesitate due to uncertainty in approval

Application costs can be higher than pre-hike H-1B fees

Some real world examples of O-1B visa



Entrepreneurs like Soundarya Balasubramani, who launched an educational venture in the U.S., are among the new wave of Indian applicants using the O-1 to bypass the H-1B bottleneck. “I got my O-1A approved as the solo founder and 100% owner of an educational venture,” she told ET.

Karan Vaidya, cofounder of AI startup Composio, said his O-1 visa cost less than $10,000 including legal fees, and praised its flexibility: “It’s a three-year visa that can be renewed indefinitely. I’m on my fifth O-1 now.”





US President Donald Trump’s executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee from $10,000 to $1,00,000 sent shockwaves in the tech industry. Due to the announcement last week many tech giants called back their professionals with H-1B visa back to the US. As the scrutiny around the traditional H-1B visa pathway making the process unpredictable, the skilled professionals are now planing to turn towards O-1 visa a lesser known route. The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.For those unaware, the O-1 Visa is introduced under the Immigration Act of 1990. The O-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields of education, science, athletics or arts. It enable the recipients to work in the US for up to three years and comes with unlimited renewals. The applicants of the O-1 visa much demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and meet atleast three out of the eight criteria:After the unpredictable nature of popular H-1B visa, the O-1 visa is gaining a lot of traction among Indians who wish to go and work in the US. As per the report by Economic Times, Indian were granted 487 O-1A visas in FY 2020, this number was increased to 1,418 in FY 2023. With this increase, India became the third largest recipient of O-1 visa after UK and Brazil.Unlike the popularly H-1B visa which is capped at 85,000 visas annually and allocated via a lottery, the O-1 visa has no cap and the applications for it are accepted around the year. The applicants can also expedite the application process by submitting additional fees.Immigration consultant and O-1 holder Logan Ullyott told Business Insider: “The O-1 is an occupation-agnostic visa. You could get it if you’re an engineer, a researcher, an influencer, or even a cook — as long as you can prove you’re at the top of your field.”","The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.

I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger.

Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21. Now, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has also issued a piece of advice to Indian techies ‘come back to India to rebuild’. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Vemu drew parallel with the Partition of India in order to explain the current H-1B situation.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk responds



Political leaders weigh in







An ABC spokesperson recently confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely. The company decided to take the decision after the host of the show Jimmy Kimmel made some controversial comments on Charlie Kirk, linking his alleged killer to President Trump’s MAGA movement. MAGA – short for Make America Great Again is a political slogan, popularized by President Donald Trump during his election campaigns. During the late-night show, Kimmel made sharp comments stating that the MAGA gang is “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.Actor and filmmaker Ben Stiller was among the celebrities who has publicly defended Kimmel and has criticised the decision of ABC. In s post shared on social media platform X, Stiller wrote, “This isn’t right”.His brief but pointed reaction quickly went viral, with many fans and fellow entertainers echoing his sentiment that the suspension undermines free expression in comedy.Commenting on Ben Stiller’s post, Elon Musk supported the decision made by ABC and wrote, “He went full retard. Never go full retard.”This is not the first time that Musk has reacted to the controversy.Earlier this week after the Kimmel’s video clip from the show went viral, Musk said, “Jimmy Kimmel is disgusting”.The California Governor Gavin Newsom has also blasted the decision and has accused Republicans of orchestrating censorship. “They are censoring you in real time. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous,” wrote Newsom on X.On the other hand, commentator Davis Sirota suggested corporate politics were at play, noting that Nexstar, which has ties to ABC, is seeking regulatory approvals from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the suspension on Truth Social, calling it “Great News for America” and labeling Kimmel “ratings challenged” with “zero talent.”","ABC confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely.

Donald Trump’s post on Lisa Monaco

Corrupt and Totally Trump Deranged Lisa Monaco (A purported pawn of Legal Lightweight Andrew Weissmann), was a senior National Security aide under Barack Hussein Obama, and a Lawfare and Weaponization obsessed Deputy Attorney General under Crooked Joe Biden and Lisa’s Puppet “Boss” Attorney General Merrick Garland, who were all the architects of the worst ever Deep State Conspiracies against our Country (RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, the January 6th Hoax, the Illegal Raid on Mar-a-Lago, the Biden “Autopen” Scandal, the Documents Witch Hunt, and more!).

Monaco has been shockingly hired as the President of Global Affairs for Microsoft, in a very senior role with access to Highly Sensitive Information. Monaco’s having that kind of access is unacceptable, and cannot be allowed to stand. She is a menace to U.S. National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government. Because of Monaco’s many wrongful acts, the U.S. Government recently stripped her of all Security Clearances, took away all of her access to National Security Intelligence, and banned her from all Federal Properties. It is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DJT





Right-wing activist and Donald Trump aide Laura Loomer recently called Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella ‘double faced’. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), she asked Nadella if the software giant is going to comply with Trump’s demand to terminate its president of global affairs, Lisa Monaco. “After I alerted President Trump to the fact that @Microsoft has hired Lisa Monaco to be their new President of Global Affairs, he has just called on Microsoft to terminate her employment,” she said in the post. “@satyanadella are you going to comply?

Sir Jony Ive couldn't find a decent lantern for his sailboat, so naturally, he designed one himself. The result is the Sailing Lantern—a 1.5kg chunk of machined stainless steel and precision-ground glass that costs $4,800 and looks like maritime jewelry.It's the first collaboration between Ive's LoveFrom collective and Tokyo-based Balmuda, limited to just 1,000 pieces. According to the Financial Times, Ive describes it as addressing extreme functional challenges: ""Most stainless steels will corrode. Only a few are marine grade.""The design draws from vintage ship lanterns, though Ive told Wallpaper* he avoided mere nostalgia. ""The reason this feels familiar isn't because we took elements that previously existed. The reason it is familiar is humanity and ingenuity,"" he explained. He's been sailing since childhood, and when you're on the water, your connection to nature demands tools that can actually survive out there.Balmuda founder Gen Terao called the engineering process formidable—a couple of very hard years getting everything to Ive's exacting standards. The lantern uses LEDs that mimic natural light, starting with a reddish glow at low settings and shifting to white-blue at full brightness, like actual flames.When you turn it off, the light slowly extinguishes rather than clicking dead.The textured polyester strap resists salt and sun. The flower-shaped dial clicks satisfyingly. The whole thing weighs enough to feel substantial, and Ive casually tossed it around during interviews to prove it's genuinely rugged, not precious.""As I've got older, who I work with has become far more important than what I work on,"" Ive told Wallpaper*. Most of these lanterns will probably never see a boat—like diving watches that spend their lives at dinner parties—but that's sort of the point.","Sir Jony Ive's LoveFrom collective and Tokyo-based Balmuda collaborated on the Sailing Lantern.

Zoho’s homegrown messaging app Arattai has surged to the top spot in India’s app stores, briefly overtaking WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal, amid a wave of patriotic downloads and growing demand for local digital platforms. Launched in 2021, Arattai—meaning “chat” in Tamil—was initially seen as a niche side project. But in the wake of AI anxieties, spyware scandals, and scrutiny of Big Tech, its pitch as a “spyware-free, made-in-India messenger” has struck a chord with users.The app’s rise was fueled by endorsements from government officials, including Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who urged Indians to adopt indigenous platforms under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative.According to Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu, Arattai’s traffic grew 100-fold in just three days, with daily sign-ups jumping from 3,000 to 350,000.

Jensen Huang says high costs risk driving talent and investment overseas

'Brightest minds' essential to America's future argues Huang







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has welcomed President Donald Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program but warned that the new $100,000 application fee may be prohibitively expensive, potentially driving tech investment and talent away from the United States.Speaking on the ""BG2 Pod"" podcast published Friday, Huang described the policy changes as ""a great start"" that addresses illegal immigration and visa system abuse. However, he cautioned that the steep fee ""probably sets the bar a little too high"" and could make foreign students uncomfortable about pursuing opportunities in America.The Taiwan-born executive, who has frequently cited his own experience as an embodiment of the American dream, emphasised that talent inflow serves as a key performance indicator for the country's future success. ""Smart people's desire to come to America and smart students' desire to stay, those are what I would call KPIs,"" Huang said on the podcast.Huang agreed with tech investor and podcaster Brad Gerstner that the substantial fee tilts the playing field toward large technology companies that can easily afford visa sponsorships, placing startups at a competitive disadvantage. He warned that the policy could prompt increased investment outside the US and affect global talent flows.The Nvidia chief also addressed concerns about Chinese researchers, separating America's competition with China as a nation from policies affecting Chinese individuals. ""We need to make sure that that slippery slope isn't crossed,"" he said.In a separate CNBC interview Monday, Huang reinforced his position on immigration reform. ""We want all the brightest minds to come to the United States. Remember immigration is the foundation of the American dream, and we represent the American dream,"" he told CNBC, expressing support for Trump's efforts to address the immigration system.Nvidia employed 1,519 H-1B visa holders out of 36,000 employees worldwide at the end of fiscal year 2025, making it one of the largest tech employers of H-1B workers in the United States, according to a Business Insider analysis from March. The White House clarified earlier this month that the $100,000 fee applies only to new applicants, not visa renewals.","Jensen Huang says high costs risk driving talent and investment overseas.

"Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal: For years, there’s been something about Zomato that made me uneasy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zomato-founder-deepinder-goyal-for-years-theres-been-something-about-zomato-that-made-me-uneasy/articleshow/124212377.cms,"What is Zomato’s Healthy mode

Zomato’s Healthy mode availability

For years, there’s been something about Zomato that made me uneasy.

We made eating out and ordering in easier than ever, but we never really helped people truly eat better. Yes, you could find a salad or a smoothie bowl, but the truth is, if you wanted to eat genuinely nourishing food, Zomato didn’t make it easy.

That weighed on me, because when we say our mission is “better food for more people”, the “better” has to mean something deeper.

Today, we’ve taken one of the biggest steps in fixing that blind spot. We’re launching Healthy Mode on Zomato.

Every dish in this mode now comes with a Healthy Score—from Low to Super—based on what really counts for your health: protein, complex carbs, fibre, and micronutrients, and not just calories. Behind the scenes it’s AI and restaurant data doing the heavy lifting, but what you’ll see is simple: a clear explanation of what makes a dish healthy, and why.

This is not your run of the mill “healthy mode” for beginners. We have kept the bar very high, that professional athletes can rely on healthy mode to find food that works for them.

This is personal for me. I’ve carried the guilt that Zomato made it easy to eat whatever you craved, but not easy to eat what your body needed. Healthy Mode is our first real step in putting that right.

It’s live in Gurgaon, and we’ll expand fast. Try it, tear it apart, tell us where it fails. Because this is just the beginning—and for the first time, I feel we’re moving meaningfully closer to truly living up to our mission: better food for more people.





Deepinder Goyal recently shared one thing that had bothered him for years — Zomato made eating out and ordering in easier, but did not help people “truly eat better.” Sharing his thoughts in a post on X (formerly Twitter), Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal wrote: “For years, there’s been something about Zomato that made me uneasy. We made eating out and ordering in easier than ever, but we never really helped people truly eat better.”“That weighed on me, because when we say our mission is “better food for more people”, the “better” has to mean something deeper,” he added.To address this gap, Zomato has launched a new feature called the Healthy mode.Every dish listed under Zomato’s Healthy mode will carry a Healthy Score ranging from Low to Super. The score is based on nutrients such as protein, complex carbohydrates, fibre and micronutrients, rather than just calories.Goyal said the scores are powered by AI and restaurant data, but explained in a simple way for users to understand why a dish qualifies as healthy. He added that the company has set a high bar for this feature, aiming to make it reliable even for professional athletes seeking balanced meals.Calling the move “personal,” Goyal admitted he felt Zomato had long made it easy to satisfy cravings but not easy to find food the body truly needed. “Healthy Mode is our first real step in putting that right,” he said.Deepinder Goyal revealed that Zomato’s Healthy mode is currently live in Gurgaon with the company planning to expand it in more cities in the coming future.Here’s the full post as shared by Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal","Zomato has launched a new feature called the Healthy mode.

How PUBG may be responsible for the Pakistani teen to murder his family



“The day of the killings, Ali lost his senses after he missed a target while playing the game for hours and also got a snub from his mother,”

“Although it is not possible to ascertain what the perpetrator was thinking unless a one-on-one assessment is performed, a number of psychiatric diagnoses come to mind, including a psychotic break, problems with anger management, depression, bipolar disorder as well as impulse control disorder,”

ChatGPT Teen Mode Explained: Privacy, Safety & New Rules for Teens





A Pakistani court in Lahore has sentenced a teenager, Zain Ali, to 100 years in prison for murdering his family over an online game. The teen reportedly killed his mother, brother, and two sisters in a violent outburst that investigators linked to his obsession with the online shooting game PUBG. The judgment, which was delivered recently by Additional Sessions Judge Riaz Ahmed, “handed down 100-year imprisonment on four counts” to the 17-year-old Zain Ali, a court official told news agency PTI. The judge sentenced Ali to four life terms, which is 25 years for each murder, instead of the death penalty, because he was 14 at the time of the crime.The judge stated that the “convict brutally killed his entire family under the influence of an online game.” Ali, who was described as a ""diehard PUBG player,"" reportedly murdered his family after repeated scoldings from his mother, Nahid Mubarak, about the amount of time he spent playing the game. In his judgment, the judge stated that Ali’s actions were “influenced by addiction where a game became more powerful than family bonds. ”PUBG is an online multiplayer game with a battle royale setup, where 100 players fight until only one remains.According to police, Ali often became aggressive when he was unable to achieve his in-game goals.the police revealed to the court.As per the report, Ali took his mother’s licensed pistol and went into the room where she was asleep with his younger sisters, then opened fire. His mother, 45, his elder brother Taimur, 20, and his sisters Mahnoor, 15, and Jannat, 10, were killed on the spot.Later, psychologist Muhammad Ali Khan in Islamabad told VICE World News that the boy might have been dealing with underlying mental health issues.Khan explained.","Zain Ali, 17, was sentenced to 100 years in prison for murdering his family over an online game.

K-Visa: What is China's rival to America's H-1B visa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/k-visa-what-is-chinas-rival-to-americas-h-1b-visa/articleshow/124211496.cms,"What is K visa



Who is eligible for K visa



Why K visa matters





Starting October 1, China will roll out a new visa category known as the K visa. The new visa is aimed at attracting foreign science and technology talent. The timing is notable as the K visa comes just weeks after the US announced a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visas, which are widely used by tech companies to hire skilled workers from countries like India. With the higher cost raising concerns among both employers and applicants, Beijing’s new programme is being seen as an alternative pathway for professionals. For those unaware, the K visa was first announced in August this year. It is part of China’s wider effort to show that it is open to foreign talent and investment, even as trade and technology tensions with Washington continues. While China has traditionally relied on domestic engineers and repatriating Chinese-born scientists, this new initiative marks one of its rare attempts to directly target young, overseas STEM graduates for jobs and research opportunities.As mentioned above, China first announced the K visa in August, 2025. It is aimed at attracting young foreign graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). K visa allows entry, residence, and employment in China without requiring a job offer or employer sponsorship — a key difference from the U.S. H-1B visa Official guidelines from Beijing mention requirements around age, education, and work experience, but so far the details remain vague.The programme is designed to appeal to recent STEM graduates from abroad, particularly those who may otherwise have looked to the U.S. for opportunities.Immigration experts say the biggest draw of the K visa is the absence of employer sponsorship. By comparison, the H-1B system in the U.S. requires sponsorship, is capped at 85,000 slots a year, and will now carry a steep $100,000 annual fee for companies.For many Indian professionals — who accounted for 71% of approved H-1B visas last year — the K visa could appear as an alternative pathway. However, hurdles remain. Language barriers, limited details on residency or family sponsorship, and political tensions between India and China could restrict uptake.Despite uncertainties, analysts say the timing of the K visa is significant. With Washington raising barriers, Beijing is positioning itself as open to foreign talent. Even if adoption is modest, China sees it as a step toward strengthening its position in the global competition for technology expertise.","China will roll out a new visa category known as the K visa.

The campaign sparked outrage as many condemned it as racism disguised as online trolling, even as the White House clarified the fee only applies to new visa applicants.

How the campaign worked



H-1B Crackdown! Trump Imposes $100k Fee; Indians & Tech Giants Face Major Hit; Know All About It

Impact on travellers



White house clarification







US President Donald Trump recently announced a massive hike in the H-1B visa fee. After the revised regulation, the H-1B visa fee for fresh application stands at $1,00,000. The massive H-1B visa fee hike caused a situation of panic and chaos in the tech sector. Many tech giants such as Google , Microsoft, Amazon , Meta and others asked their employees on H-1B visa to return to the US with immediate effect. This situation also gave rise to an online harassment campaign called ‘Operation Clod the Toilet’. This campaign deliberately disrupted the flight bookings for Indian H-1B visa holders going back to the US after Trump’s order.As per multiple online reports, the far-right groups on online forums such as 4chan and Telegram coordinated efforts to block seats on India–US flights. The trolls started the checkout process for multiple tickers on busy routes such as Delhi to New York or Dallas without completing the payment process. This temporarily held the seats, making them unavailable to genuine travelers. Once the hold expired, the process was repeated, effectively clogging airline booking systems and driving up ticket prices.Some of the trollers also bagged about holding “100 seats” at a time, with posts laced with racist slurs and calls to “keep Indians in India.”This Clog The Toilet campaign coincided with the widespread panic among the Indian tech workers. Many of the Indian tech professionals came on a vacation to India when the Trump administration announced the fee hike. Fearing that the H-1B visa holders will be charged upon re-entering the US, workers scrambled to book flights back to the U.S.One software engineer told AFP she paid over $2,000 for a one-way ticket to Dallas, more than double her original fare, after repeated booking failures.After the initial announcement of fee hike, the White House later clarified that the $100,000 fee applies only to new H-1B petitions, not to existing visa holders re-entering the U.S. “Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.Despite this, the initial confusion and the trolling campaign caused significant disruption and financial strain for many Indian professionals.The episode highlights both the vulnerability of immigrant workers to sudden policy shifts and the weaponization of online platforms to target specific communities. The H-1B program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign professionals in specialized fields, issues 85,000 visas annually, with about 75% going to Indians.","4chan users launched “Operation Clog the Toilet,” deliberately blocking India-US flight bookings amid panic over a $100,000 H-1B visa fee.

Angry French government to Telegram founder Pavel Durov: You like making accusations while elections are ongoing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/angry-french-government-to-telegram-founder-pavel-durov-you-like-making-accusations-while-elections-are-ongoing/articleshow/124207173.cms,"'French Spies...': Telegram CEO Drops BOMBSHELL Amid Russian 'Meddling' Claims I Moldova Election

Poll Should international tech platforms be involved in political matters in foreign countries? Yes, they can promote democracy No, they should remain neutral

Telegram founder's full Twitter post that has angered France

About a year ago, while I was stuck in Paris, the French intelligence services reached out to me through an intermediary, asking me to help the Moldovan government censor certain Telegram channels ahead of the presidential elections in Moldova.

After reviewing the channels flagged by French (and Moldovan) authorities, we identified a few that clearly violated our rules and removed them. The intermediary then informed me that, in exchange for this cooperation, French intelligence would “say good things” about me to the judge who had ordered my arrest in August last year.

This was unacceptable on several levels. If the agency did in fact approach the judge — it constituted an attempt to interfere in the judicial process. If it did not, and merely claimed to have done so, then it was exploiting my legal situation in France to influence political developments in Eastern Europe — a pattern we have also observed in Romania 🇷🇴

Shortly thereafter, the Telegram team received a second list of so-called “problematic” Moldovan channels. Unlike the first, nearly all of these channels were legitimate and fully compliant with our rules. Their only commonality was that they voiced political positions disliked by the French and Moldovan governments.

We refused to act on this request. Telegram is committed to freedom of speech and will not remove content for political reasons. I will continue to expose every attempt to pressure Telegram into censoring our platform. Stay tuned.





French government has slammed Telegram founder Parel Durov after latter accused French intelligence services of having asked him through an intermediary to censor some Moldovan voices. In a long post on Twitter, Telegram founder claimed that the French agency made the request around one year ago asking him to help the Moldovan government censor certain Telegram channels ahead of the presidential elections in Moldova. He added that he refused the request as the same ""was unacceptable on several levels.""In response, the French foreign ministry wrote in a post on Twitter that Durov had made similar accusations about France trying to manipulate politics in Romania earlier this year. ""After Romania, Moldova. @durov likes making accusations while elections are ongoing,"" said the post from French foreign ministry.Moldovans were voting in a parliamentary election on Sunday, June 28, that could have a major impact on the government's quest to join the European Union. The elections took place at a time when pro-Russian opposition group is reportedly seeking to steer the nation away from closer ties with the bloc.Incidentally, this is not the first time that Durov has accused French government. In May 2025, Durov said that the head of France's foreign intelligence agency had asked him to ban Romanian conservative voices ahead of elections there. France's DGSE, the foreign intelligence service, denied that at the time.Durov was arrested in August 2024 at a French airport and is under judicial supervision in France while being investigated for suspected organised crime on the Telegram app.","Telegram founder Parel Durov accused French intelligence services of having asked him through an intermediary to censor some Moldovan voices.

New York [US], September 28 (ANI): External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar spoke about the responses to global developments, the changing approach towards a workforce for the global economy and different trade arrangements which will arise globally. He shared how nations must build capacities and how they can be transposable to people who relate to them.The EAM made the remarks at a panel discussion by the ORF on 'At The Heart of Development- Aid, Trade & Technology'.Speaking about the response to the challenges in the evolving world, Jaishankar said, ""Technology, multi-polarity, self-reliance, south-south cooperation are part of one basket, which is a response to what is happening.""He said that it is important for large countries to build capacities, be more self-reliant, and that it is the focus for India.""You have to build multi-polarity by building national capacities.

Apple's 'in-house ChatGPT' is for new Siri

Apple's high-stakes AI battle





Apple has been planning big for its AI comeback. In a recent meeting with employees, CEO Tim Cook said that the company must win in AI, calling it the biggest transformation in decades. “This is sort of ours to grab,” Cook said. “We will make the investment to do it.” According to a report in Bloomberg, iPhone maker has been overhauling its Siri voice assistant in hopes of making it comparable to AI tools from companies like OpenAI and Google. The report adds that Apple has created its own version of OpenAI's AI chatbot to test out the new and improved Siri.The company’s AI division is said to be using the app to quickly evaluate new features for Siri. This reportedly includes testing the ability to search through personal data, such as songs and emails, and perform in-app actions like editing photos.The iPhone maker is utilizing the app, code-named ""Veritas"" (Latin for ""truth""), to rapidly evaluate features for the revamped Siri. This new testing phase is part of a high-stakes overhaul that could redefine perceptions of Apple's AI capabilities, or risk having the company slip further behind rivals like Google and Samsung in the smartphone market's growing AI arms race.The Veritas application functions like a typical modern chatbot, allowing employees to manage multiple, saved conversations and conduct extended back-and-forth exchanges. For now, the software is strictly for internal use to efficiently test the still-in-progress technology of the new Siri, and Apple has no current plans for a consumer release, Bloomberg noted.The internal tool is designed to test the underlying AI system for the new Siri, code-named ""Linwood,"" which is built on a Large Language Model (LLM) combining Apple's proprietary work with a third-party model. The new Siri is expected to be far more capable.The major Siri revamp is now slated to debut as early as March after experiencing multiple delays. Apple had originally planned the rollout for last spring but postponed it after engineering problems led to features reportedly failing as much as a third of the time.The postponement triggered a wider overhaul of Apple's AI strategy, which included the sidelining of AI chief John Giannandrea and some deputies. The company is now focusing its efforts on the Answers, Knowledge, and Information (AKI) team, which is central to developing the new AI-based search features.The aggressive push into AI comes as competition is expected to ramp up in 2024, making advanced AI features a more decisive factor in smartphone purchasing decisions. CEO Tim Cook recently emphasized the company's commitment to the new frontier, telling staff that Apple ""must win in AI,"" calling it the biggest transformation in decades.","Report: Apple has created its own version of OpenAI's AI chatbot to test out the new and improved Siri.

White House on possibilty of new tariffs on foreign electronics: America cannot rely on…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/white-house-on-possibilty-of-chips-based-tariffs-on-foreign-electronics-america-cannot-rely-on/articleshow/124194408.cms,"Representative Image

“America cannot be reliant on foreign imports for the semiconductor products that are essential for our national and economic security.”

“The Trump administration is implementing a nuanced, multi-faceted approach to reshoring critical manufacturing back to the United States with tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and energy abundance,”

How these tariffs can increase the cost of consumer electronics



Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses





The Trump administration is reportedly planning to impose tariffs on foreign electronic devices with the fee being calculated based on the number of chips in each product. The proposed plan aims to pressure companies to shift manufacturing to the United States, a report claims. In a statement to the news agency Reuters, Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson has defended the push claiming:The report cited three sources familiar with the plan to further claim that the Commerce Department would enforce a tariff equal to a percentage of the estimated value of the product's chip content.Desai added.In August, Trump said the US would put a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors but spare companies that already make chips in the country or plan to do so. Major foreign chipmakers include Taiwan’s TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung The Reuters report cited one source to claim that the Commerce Department is looking at a 25% tariff on chip parts inside imported devices, and a 15% tariff on electronics from Japan and the EU, though these numbers are still early estimates.Officials have also discussed giving companies an exemption equal to the amount they invest in U.S. chip production—if they move at least half their manufacturing to the U.S. But the report didn’t clearly explain how that would work or if it will happen.The Commerce Department had earlier suggested exempting chipmaking equipment from tariffs to keep US production costs lower. However, the White House pushed back, as Trump generally opposes broad exemptions, the report claimsThe Reuters report noted that these rumoured tariffs could raise the price of consumer electronics and other goods at a time when inflation is already above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, economists have warned.The measures include 100% duties on branded drugs and 25% tariffs on heavy-duty trucks, alongside probes into pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.Since chips and other key inputs are central to many consumer products, even US-made goods are likely to become more expensive. The uncertainty over which products, countries, or companies might be exempt is adding to concerns about trade disruption and higher costs for consumers.","The White House is reportedly planning to impose tariffs on foreign electronic devices.

Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of internal builds





A recent study claimed that 95% of organizations are getting zero return, despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI. The study was conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) where it surveyed 300 AI deployments while the researchers spoke to approximately 350 employees. As per the study, the reason behind failure of investment on AI is because of the “learning gap”. “The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time,” the study highlighted.MIT published a report titled The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, which said that only 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L (profit & loss) impact.The study says that more than 80 % of organizations have explored or piloted tools like OpenAI ’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Copilot. Nearly 40% reported deployment of these tools. However, these AI tools, as per the study, enhance individual productivity primarily with no P&L performance. “Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, and misalignment with day-to-day operations,” the study highlighted.It said that sixty percent of organizations evaluated such AI tools, but just 20 percent reached pilot stage and only 5 percent reached production. Meanwhile, enterprise-grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected, the report added.The study estimated four patterns that define the GenAI Divide:","A recent study claimed that 95% of organizations are getting zero return, despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. The difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with US President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday (July 10), a report has said. The meeting occurred on a historic day for Nvidia, which closed the trading session with a market capitalisation exceeding $4 trillion for the first time. This milestone makes Nvidia the first company to achieve this valuation, surpassing both Apple and Microsoft.Earlier on Thursday, Trump publicly lauded Nvidia's stock performance in a social media post.“NVIDIA IS UP 47% SINCE TRUMP TARIFFS. USA is taking in Hundreds of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs,” Trump posted on Truth Social.“COUNTRY IS NOW 'BACK.'"" he added.While Nvidia briefly touched the $4 trillion mark during Wednesday's trading, Thursday marked its first official close above it.While there is no information on the purpose of the meeting between Trump and Huang, it comes soon after media reports claimed that Nvidia is preparing to launch a new artificial intelligence chip tailored for the Chinese market as early as September.This move aligns with Huang's upcoming visit to China, where he plans to reaffirm the company's commitment to the region despite ongoing US export restrictions. The new chip is said to be a modified version of Nvidia's current Blackwell RTX Pro 6000 processor. It's specifically engineered to comply with the tightened export control rules set by the US government.To meet these regulations, the chip will be stripped of some of its most advanced technologies, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and NVLink, which are crucial for faster data transfers.Huang is scheduled to meet with top Chinese leaders while attending the International Supply Chain Expo in Beijing next week. This visit follows his public criticism in May at Taiwan's Computex tech show, where he labeled US export controls as a ""failure"" for inadvertently spurring Chinese companies to accelerate their own AI development.","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with US President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday.

Microsoft, Apple take up second and third positions



Nvidia 's has become the first public company to touch the ‘magic’ $4 trillion market value. The company’s stock market valuation officially closed above $4 trillion for the first time on Thursday (July 10) after shares of the AI chipmaker ended the trading session up 0.75% at $164.10, pushing its market capitalisation to $4.004 trillion. This milestone extends Nvidia's significant lead over tech giants Apple and Microsoft, as it continues to benefit from an increasing demand for its AI technologies.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the company's market value briefly touched the $4 trillion mark on Wednesday (July 9) before closing just shy at approximately $3.97 trillion. To put its scale in perspective, Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of all publicly listed companies in the United Kingdom, the report added.Nvidia first reached a $1 trillion market value in June 2023 and has since tripled that valuation in roughly one year. This rapid growth outpaces both Apple and Microsoft, the only other US firms with market capitalisations exceeding $3 trillion.Nvidia's high-end AI processors are at the forefront of an intense race among tech heavyweights including Microsoft, Amazon, Google-parent company Alphabet, and Facebook-parent Meta Platforms. These companies are investing in building AI data centers to secure their position in the rapidly evolving technology landscape.Despite its rapid ascent, Nvidia faces potential headwinds. The company is particularly exposed to ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, which include restrictions on exports of its most powerful chips to China, the report said.Currently, Microsoft holds the position of the second most valuable US company with a market capitalisation of $3.73 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple's stock has seen a 15% tumble so far in 2025, leaving its market value at $3.17 trillion due to the iPhone maker being slower to integrate AI into its product and service offerings.","Shares of the AI chipmaker ended the trading session up 0.75% at $164.10, pushing its market capitalisation to $4.004 trillion.

ChatGPT is a 'LIAR': Law professor at American university claims AI chatbot 'invented' sexual harrassment charges against him: Here's what happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-invented-sexual-harassment-charges-against-me-claims-law-professor-at-an-american-university-in-a-viral-post-heres-what-happened/articleshow/122373504.cms,"OpenAI refused to apologise

A prominent law professor has accused OpenAI’s ChatGPT of fabricating serious allegations, spotlighting concerns about artificial intelligence spreading disinformation, according to the New York Post. Jonathan Turley, a criminal defense attorney and George Washington University law professor , claims ChatGPT falsely accused him of sexually harassing a former student. In a viral Twitter thread and a column gaining widespread attention, Turley described the accusations as “chilling,” warning of the broader dangers AI poses to free speech and reputation.“It invented an allegation where I was on the faculty at a school where I have never taught, went on a trip that I never took, and reported an allegation that was never made,” Turley told the New York Post. “It is highly ironic because I have been writing about the dangers of AI to free speech.” The issue came to light when UCLA professor Eugene Volokh asked ChatGPT to provide “five examples” of sexual harassment by law school professors, including quotes from relevant news articles. Among the responses, ChatGPT cited a supposed 2018 incident at “Georgetown University Law Center,” alleging Turley made “sexually suggestive comments” and “attempted to touch [a female student] in a sexual manner” during a law school-sponsored trip to Alaska. The AI attributed the claim to a nonexistent Washington Post article.Turley was quick to debunk the claims, noting “a number of glaring indicators that the account is false.” He told the Post, “First, I have never taught at Georgetown University. Second, there is no such Washington Post article. Finally, and most important, I have never taken students on a trip of any kind in 35 years of teaching, never went to Alaska with any student, and I’ve never been accused of sexual harassment or assault.”Adding to his frustration, Turley said neither OpenAI nor Microsoft, whose AI reportedly repeated the false story, contacted him or issued an apology. “ChatGPT has not contacted me or apologized. It has declined to say anything at all. That is precisely the problem. There is no there there,” he told the Post. “When you are defamed by a newspaper, there is a reporter who you can contact. Even when Microsoft’s AI system repeated that same false story, it did not contact me and only shrugged that it tries to be accurate.”The New York Post reached out to OpenAI for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication. Turley’s experience has amplified concerns about AI’s potential to spread falsehoods. “Yesterday, President Joe Biden declared that ‘it remains to be seen’ whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) is ‘dangerous.’ I would beg to differ,” Turley tweeted on Thursday, adding, “You can be defamed by AI and these companies merely shrug that they try to be accurate. In the meantime, their false accounts metastasize across the Internet.”As AI technologies like ChatGPT become more prevalent, Turley’s case underscores growing fears about their role in generating and disseminating disinformation, with little accountability for the harm caused.","Jonathan Turley, a criminal defense attorney and George Washington University law professor, claims ChatGPT falsely accused him of sexually harassing a former student.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence (AI), the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Huang said both AI and robotics represent what he believes a “multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity”. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said during the conference. Nvidia’s robotics division has seen fast growth in the past. Currently making up just 1% of Nvidia’s total revenue, the revenue brought in $567 million last quarter – a steep 72% rise from the previous year.“We’re working towards a day where there will be billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories that can be powered by Nvidia technology,” Huang said.Huang also emphasized a shift in how the company sees itself. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” he said, adding that Nvidia is now focused on being an “AI infrastructure” and “computing platform” provider.During the annual shareholder meeting, Huang said that Nvidia’s chips will be key not just for AI training, but also for software and hardware use in autonomous vehicles and robots. He named self-driving cars as the first major commercial use of Nvidia’s robotics technology. Nvidia’s Drive platform, a suite of chips and software for autonomous cars, is currently being used by Mercedes-Benz.The chipmaker recently introduced Cosmos, a line of AI models designed for humanoid robots.In a related news, Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company with a market cap of around $3.75 trillion. The company has rebounded strongly since a market dip earlier this year, which was caused by concerns about competition from China’s DeepSeek AI.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence, the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122088756,imgsize-19028,width-400,resizemode-4/Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Huang.jpg"

The US Embassy in India has issued a clear warning for visa applicants. “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas,” the embassy said in a post on microblogging site X (previously known as Twitter). The post reminded visa applicants to disclose all social media usernames or handles they’ve used over the past five years while filling out the DS-160 visa application form. “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form” the post read. “Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit.”The requirement is part of broader vetting procedures introduced by the US State Department in recent years. As part of the updated rules, applicants must list IDs used on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and others—even if the accounts are no longer active from the last five years.The move comes days after the US government issued a new guideline for those applying for student and exchange visitor visas. Applicable to all applicants of F, M, and J non-immigrant visas, the new rule requires these applicants to set their social media accounts to public. “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under U.S. law,"" the US embassy in India wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post.F, M and J visas are the common types of non-immigrant visas issued by the agency to foreign nationals who wish to study or participate in exchange visitor programs in the U.S. F visa is typically used by academic students, the M visa by vocational students, and the J visa by exchange visitors, including researchers, scholars, and interns.In a related news, USCIS has announced that it will switch to a new phone number for sending text (SMS) messages. “Effective July 1, 2025, USCIS will no longer send text (SMS) messages from the phone number 468-311 (GOV-311).

Read OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s complete post here

I’m not big on identities, but I am extremely proud to be American. This is true every day, but especially today—I firmly believe this is the greatest country ever on Earth. The American miracle stands alone in world history.

I believe in techno-capitalism. We should encourage people to make tons of money and then also find ways to widely distribute wealth and share the compounding magic of capitalism. One doesn’t work without the other; you cannot raise the floor and not also raise the ceiling for very long.

The world should get richer every year through science and technology, but everyone has to be in the “up elevator”. I think the government usually does a worse job than markets, and so we need to encourage our culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. I also believe that education is critically important to keeping the American edge.

I believed this when I was 20, when I was 30, and now I am 40 and still believe it. The Democratic party seemed reasonably aligned with it when I was 20, losing the plot when I was 30, and completely to have moved somewhere else at this point. So now I am politically homeless. But that’s fine; I care much, much more about being American than any political party.

I’d rather hear from candidates about how they are going to make everyone have the stuff billionaires have instead of how they are going to eliminate billionaires.

The American experiment has always been messy. I am hopeful for another great 250 years. Happy 4th!","Sam Altman is the Chief Executive Officer of OpenAI.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other top executives sell over $1 billion in company shares: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-and-other-top-executives-sell-over-1-billion-in-company-shares-report/articleshow/122155830.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells shares

Other Nvidia executives cash in

Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year, reports Financial Times. As per the report, over $500 million of those sales took place in June alone, as the chipmaker's stock price climbed to a record high, making Nvidia the world’s most valuable company. The report highlights that Nvidia insiders are capitalizing on the market’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, which has driven massive investor interest and sent the stock price soaring.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began selling his shares last week for the first time since September 2024. The company confirmed that his sales were made under a pre-arranged trading plan set in March, which defines the prices and dates for share sales. Such plans are commonly used by executives to avoid allegations of insider trading.Ben Silverman, vice-president of research at VerityData said “When the stock [dropped] in the first quarter, he did not sell, [which was] really smart.”“[Huang] waited for the stock to return to levels that he felt more comfortable selling at,” he added.According to VerityData, his sales began after a required 90-day cooling-off period ended. Under the trading plan, Huang can sell up to 6 million shares before the end of 2025. At current stock prices, that would amount to more than $900 million. Forbes estimates his net worth at $138 billion.According to the Financial Times report, several other top Nvidia figures have also sold large portions of stock. Mark Stevens, a longtime board member and early Nvidia investor, disclosed plans to sell up to 4 million shares on June 2, currently worth around $550 million. He has already sold $288 million worth.Jay Puri, Nvidia’s executive vice-president of worldwide field operations, sold $25 million in stock last week, says FT. Board members Tench Coxe and Brooke Seawell also made sales — Coxe offloaded around $143 million on June 9, and Seawell sold about $48 million in June.These executives, all long-time members of Nvidia’s leadership team, have been with the company since its early days. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 inside a Denny’s restaurant in San Jose. Coxe and Seawell, both with venture capital backgrounds, joined the board in the late 1990s.AI boom fuels Nvidia’s stock surgeDespite recent setbacks — including U.S. export controls and advances by Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek — Nvidia’s share price has bounced back. Since hitting a low in April, the company has regained about $1.5 trillion in market value.The company’s market value is not estimated at around $3.8 trillion. The rapid growth reflects strong global demand for the company’s chips, used to power AI systems across industries and governments.","Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year.

Not necessarily, privacy matters. Absolutely, it's essential.

Sam Altman's strategic exaggeration backfires

Meta's AI hiring spree continues

Lucas Beyer , one of three OpenAI researchers who recently joined Meta 's superintelligence team, has publicly dismissed reports that Mark Zuckerberg offered him a $100 million signing bonus, calling the claims ""fake news.""“No, we did not get 100M sign-on, that's fake news,” wrote Beyer in his post on X (previously Twitter), announcing this move to Meta with his colleagues.Beyer’s clarification comes after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed on his brother's podcast that Meta had been making ""giant offers"" worth more than $100 million to lure away his top talent. Beyer, along with colleagues Alexander Kolesnikov and Xiaohua Zhai, announced their departure from OpenAI's Zurich office to join Meta's new AI unit this week.When a social media user suggested the OpenAI CEO Sam Altman ""clearly just threw out the 100m figure out there to make potential takers think that they were being lowballed,"" Beyer responded: ""Yes, it was a brilliant move, gotta give him that.""Meta's Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth echoed Beyer's sentiments during an internal company meeting Thursday, calling Altman ""dishonest"" and noting that the OpenAI chief was ""countering all these offers"" while creating inflated market expectations. Bosworth emphasized that such massive packages only apply to ""a very, very small number of people"" in senior leadership roles.The three researchers had previously worked together at Google DeepMind before joining OpenAI in December 2024 to establish the company's Zurich office. Their move to Meta represents a significant talent acquisition for Zuckerberg's ambitious superintelligence project.Meta has also hired Trapit Bansal, the OpenAI researcher who contributed to the company's first AI reasoning model , o1.

"Explained: Why it is being said that only one man, Palmer Luckey, can build America's Border Surveillance Towers in that Donald Trump wants",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-why-it-is-being-said-that-only-one-man-palmer-luckey-can-build-americas-border-surveillance-towers-in-that-donald-trump-wants/articleshow/122373414.cms,"What Makes the Provision So Specific to Palmer Luckey's company

Who Is Palmer Luckey, and Why Does This Matter

What Is Anduril Industries Into

Donald Trump's massive spending bill -- “One Big, Beautiful Bill” -- aims to make permanent tax cuts for wealthy Americans while reducing funding for social programs like Medicaid. Tucked inside this legislation is a provision allocating $6 billion for border security technologies, specifically a “virtual wall” of surveillance towers along the U.S. northern and southern borders. These towers would reportedly use advanced technology to detect people crossing the border. However, the bill’s language is so specific that it appears is said to be tailored to benefit one company: Anduril Industries , founded by Palmer Luckey .The bill stipulates that the $6 billion contract can only go to a company whose products have been “tested and accepted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection” and can deliver “autonomous capabilities.” These capabilities are defined as systems using “artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, or other algorithms” to detect, identify, classify, and track objects in real time without constant human intervention. According to The Intercept, this description matches the technology developed by Anduril Industries almost exactly. A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson confirmed that Anduril is currently the only company approved to meet these requirements, effectively giving it a monopoly on this lucrative contract as the Department of Homeland Security plans to build hundreds of new surveillance towers in the coming years.Palmer Luckey, the CEO of Anduril Industries, is a prominent figure in the tech world and a longtime supporter of Donald Trump. He has donated to Trump’s campaigns since 2016, hosted a fundraiser for him in 2020, and has been influential in aligning other tech leaders, like Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen, with Trump’s political orbit. The highly specific language in the bill raises questions about whether this provision is a political favor to Luckey, whose company stands to gain billions from the deal. Critics argue this could be an example of cronyism, where government contracts are awarded to political allies rather than through open competition.Anduril Industries is a defense technology company specializing in AI-driven systems, including autonomous surveillance towers that use advanced algorithms to monitor borders. These towers are designed to detect and track people or objects in real time, reducing the need for human operators. Beyond border security, Anduril has been expanding its footprint in military contracts. For example, earlier this year, it took over a multi-billion-dollar contract from Microsoft to develop the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), an augmented reality headset for the U.S. Army. Additionally, Luckey has partnered with Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg—another tech leader with growing ties to Trump—to develop AR and VR technologies for military use, such as detecting enemy soldiers or drones.","Anduril Industries is a defense technology company specializing in AI-driven systems.

The infamous Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), a sight that has long signaled critical system errors for Windows users, is reportedly getting a dramatic makeover. According to a report in The Verge, starting today, Microsoft is rolling out a newly designed Black Screen of Death to Windows 11 Release Preview users, marking the first significant visual change to the error screen since the introduction of a sad face in Windows 8.The shift, which is expected to reach all Windows 11 users in the coming weeks, sees the removal of the familiar frowning emoticon and QR code in favor of a more simplified, monochromatic display. The new Black screen closely resembles the interface users typically encounter during a Windows update .This aesthetic update isn't merely cosmetic. The simplified BSOD will prominently display the stop code and the faulty system driver, aiming to provide clearer and more actionable information for both individual Windows users and IT administrators. ""This is really an attempt on clarity and providing better information and allowing us and customers to really get to what the core of the issue is so we can fix it faster,"" stated David Weston, vice president of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft, in a June interview with The Verge.While Microsoft briefly experimented with a black BSOD in test builds of Windows 11 back in 2021, this current rollout signifies a permanent transition. The change is part of a broader Windows 11 update that also introduces Microsoft's Quick Machine Recovery (QMR) feature. QMR is designed to rapidly restore machines that fail to boot correctly, further demonstrating Microsoft's commitment to enhancing Windows' resilience, especially in the wake of last year's CrowdStrike incident.",The infamous Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) is reportedly getting a dramatic makeover.

Introducing Amazon EC2 P6e-GB200 UltraServers: Powering Frontier AI at Scale | Amazon Web Services

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Amazon's cloud division has reportedly developed its own hardware to cool next-generation Nvidia graphics cards for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. This internal solution addresses the significant energy consumption and heat generation associated with Nvidia's GPUs, which are vital for AI workloads. Dave Brown, Vice President of Compute and Machine Learning Services at Amazon Web Services (AWS), stated in a YouTube video that commercially available cooling equipment was not suitable and building data centres with widespread liquid cooling would have taken too much time. This led Amazon to develop its methods that can better manage the heat from these power-intensive Nvidia GPUs.Talking about the cooling equipment available for AI GPUs in the video, Brown said: “They would take up too much data centre floor space or increase water usage substantially. And while some of these solutions could work for lower volumes at other providers, they simply wouldn’t be enough liquid-cooling capacity to support our scale.”So, instead of relying on conventional solutions, Amazon engineers developed the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), a cooling system that can be integrated into both existing and future data centres. Previously, these traditional air cooling methods have been sufficient for earlier Nvidia chip generations.In a blog post, Brown also confirmed that AWS customers can now access this updated infrastructure through new P6e computing instances. These new offerings support Nvidia’s high-density computing architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72, which consolidates 72 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs into a single rack for training and deploying large AI models.Previously, similar Nvidia GB200 NVL72-based clusters were available via Microsoft and CoreWeave. AWS, as the leading global cloud infrastructure provider, continues to enhance its capabilities.Amazon has a history of developing its infrastructure hardware, including custom chips for general computing and AI, along with in-house-designed storage servers and networking equipment.This approach reduces reliance on external vendors and can improve profitability. AWS posted its highest operating margin since at least 2014 during the first quarter, contributing significantly to Amazon’s overall net income.Microsoft, the second-largest cloud provider, has also moved into custom hardware. In 2023, it introduced a cooling system called Sidekicks, tailored for its Maia AI chips.","Amazon's cloud division has reportedly developed its own hardware to cool next- generation Nvidia graphics cards for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.

Major redesign planned for 2027 as competition heats up

Apple is planning to introduce its first upgrade to the $3,499 Vision Pro headset as early as this year, aiming to improve performance and comfort of a device that has struggled to gain consumer traction since its February 2024 launch.The updated Vision Pro will feature a faster M4 processor—currently used in iPad Pro and MacBook Pro models—replacing the outdated M2 chip, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to Bloomberg. The upgrade will also include enhanced artificial intelligence components with additional neural engine cores beyond the current 16-core configuration, and a redesigned strap system to reduce neck strain and head pain from the 1.4-pound device.While this initial upgrade focuses on performance improvements, Apple is simultaneously developing a significantly lighter redesigned model targeted for 2027. The company is also working on a tethered enterprise headset and planning true AR glasses, with the ultimate goal of dominating the smart glasses category.The Vision Pro's disappointing market performance stems from its cumbersome hardware, hefty price tag, and lack of compelling exclusive applications. Apple has sold only hundreds of thousands of units since launch—far below expectations for a company that successfully revolutionized smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches.The minor second-generation changes are unlikely to transform the headset into a consumer hit but may attract corporate customers and encourage more app developers to support the platform. Apple will also roll out visionOS 26 operating system later this year, featuring virtual widgets and eye-scrolling capabilities.Competition is intensifying as Meta Platforms offers cheaper alternatives and Samsung prepares to launch its Moohan headset in 2025. Meta plans to release true AR glasses by 2027, potentially beating Apple to market by several years.Earlier this year, Apple reshuffled the Vision Pro team, with top manager Mike Rockwell transitioning to focus on Siri and the headset's operating system, while software and hardware teams were reorganized into different development groups.","Apple is planning to introduce its first upgrade to the $3,499 Vision Pro headset as early as this year.

Is it Exodus at NASA

Lot of experience drain

NASA is facing a significant loss of expertise, with 2,145 senior-level employees in GS-13 to GS-15 positions, including 875 GS-15 staff, set to depart, according to internal documents cited by Politico. These employees, who represent critical managerial and technical expertise, make up the majority of the 2,694 civil staff accepting early retirement, buyouts, or deferred resignations as part of broader federal workforce reduction efforts.The exodus spans NASA’s core mission areas, with 1,818 staff from science and human space flight roles leaving, alongside others in support functions like IT and finance. “You’re losing the managerial and core technical expertise of the agency,” warned Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at The Planetary Society, questioning the strategy behind the cuts.The departures align with a proposed 2026 White House budget that would cut NASA’s funding by 25% and reduce staff by over 5,000, shrinking the agency to its smallest size since the early 1960s. All 10 NASA regional centers are affected, with Goddard Space Flight Center losing 607 staff, Johnson Space Center 366, Kennedy Space Center 311, NASA headquarters 307, Langley Research Center 281, Marshall Space Flight Center 279, and Glenn Research Center 191.While some job cuts, like those at Goddard, align with White House goals, the loss of staff critical to lunar missions by mid-2027 and future Mars plans raises concerns. A departing NASA staffer, speaking anonymously, described the cuts as causing “a lot of experience drain,” potentially disrupting operations. “You’re losing the managerial and core technical expertise of the agency,” said Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at The Planetary Society. “What’s the strategy and what do we hope to achieve here?”A an employee who has resigned described their decision to leave as influenced in part by fear of the proposed NASA budget cuts and the lack of a Senate-approved NASA administrator: “Things just sound like it’s going to get worse.”The staffer cited fears of deeper budget cuts and the absence of a Senate-approved NASA administrator as factors in their decision to leave.With only half of the White House’s targeted 5,000 staff reductions met, further involuntary cuts loom if participation in the deferred resignation program, ending July 25, falls short. However, Congress could reject these proposals, as the Senate Commerce Committee has signaled support for retaining NASA staff in a March bill.","NASA is facing a significant loss of expertise, with 2,145 senior-level employees in GS-13 to GS-15 positions set to depart.

He also had a brief stint playing for Penn State during the 2018-2019 season.In a statement to AFP, Kasatkin’s lawyer Frederic Belot said:However, the French court has refused bail for Kasatkin, who may be extradited to the United States.According to Belot, Kasatkin recently got engaged and had travelled to France with his fiancée. He also noted that Kasatkin’s health has been declining while in custody, putting his basketball career at risk.As per another report by Meduza, US investigators have accused Kasatkin of being an accomplice in a hacker group’s ransomware attacks targeting around 900 companies, which included two federal agencies, between 2020 and 2022. Authorities also claimed that he took part in ransom payment negotiations on the group’s behalf. However, Kasatkin has denied the allegations.Kasatkin spent four seasons with MBA-MAI, contributing to the team’s two third-place finishes in the Russian Basketball Cup.","Daniil Kasatkin, who plays for MBA Moscow, was arrested at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris last month.

YouTube to crack down on AI-generated and repetitive content: Google changes payout rules; check if you will be affected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/youtube-to-crack-down-on-ai-generated-and-repetitive-content-google-changes-payout-rules-check-if-you-will-be-affected/articleshow/122370719.cms,"YouTube monetisation policy update

Why the 2025 YouTube monetisation policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety and accountability.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

"Japan sets new internet speed record, is 16 million times faster than India's average",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/japans-sets-new-internet-speed-record-is-16-million-times-faster-than-indias-average/articleshow/122368875.cms,"19-core cable creates a data superhighway

Lab success paves way for AI-driven internet future

Japanese researchers have achieved a groundbreaking internet speed of 1.02 petabits per second , creating a new world record that is 3.5 million times faster than the average US internet connection and an astounding 16 million times faster than India's average speed of 63.55 Mbps.The record-setting achievement was accomplished by Japan 's National Institute of Information and Communications Technology ( NICT ) working with Sumitomo Electric and European partners. Their innovative 19-core optical fiber cable transmitted data at unprecedented speeds over 1,808 kilometers, roughly equivalent to the distance from London to Rome.To put this speed in perspective, the new technology could theoretically download the entire Netflix library in under one second or massive 150GB video games like Warzone in the blink of an eye. The average U.S. broadband speed of 290 Mbps pales in comparison to the 1,020,000,000 Mbps achieved in this test.The breakthrough lies in the cable's design: instead of using a single light path, the fiber squeezes 19 separate cores into the same standard diameter as existing cables. This creates what researchers describe as a ""19-lane superhighway"" for data transmission while maintaining compatibility with current infrastructure.The team overcame traditional signal degradation challenges by developing sophisticated amplification systems that boost signals across multiple wavelength bands simultaneously. Using 180 wavelengths with advanced signal processing, they maintained signal strength over the extended distance.While this technology remains in laboratory testing, it represents a crucial step toward meeting future data demands. As global internet traffic continues to surge, driven by AI applications, autonomous vehicles, and billions of connected devices, such advances offer hope for expanding network capacity without requiring entirely new infrastructure installations.","Japanese researchers have achieved a groundbreaking internet speed of 1.02 petabits per second.

Lucy Guo dropped out of college

How Lucy Guo learnt to earn money as a kid

Lucy Gup, world's youngest self-made billionaire and serial entrepreneur, credits her frugal parents with motivating her to start hustling at a young age. Guo, 30, was recently named Forbes' youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of $1.3 billion. Her first company, Scale AI, an AI data-labeling firm, was acquired by tech giant Meta for a whopping $25 billion.Today, Guo is the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform launched in 2022. She also founded a venture capital firm, Backend Ventures, in 2019 to invest in early-stage tech startups. Growing up in Fremont, California, with Chinese immigrant parents, Guo was taught the importance of both education and money. ""They threw me into Abacus competitions,"" she told CNBC Make It, adding that she was ""definitely forced to have good academics.""Her focus on academics led her to study computer science and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. However, she dropped out after two years, with only a year left to complete her Computer Science degree. This decision was a major disappointment for her parents.""They sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future,"" Guo explained. ""For their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face.""Instead of finishing her degree, Guo pursued the Thiel Fellowship , a program that provides young people with $200,000 to build innovative companies. ""I think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn't love them,"" she said, ""when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself.""Guo’s parents lived ""a very frugal life,"" but always emphasized the importance of having money. As a result, she started hustling in elementary school. ""I would find ways to make money on the playground,"" she said. This included trading and selling Pokémon cards, colored pencils, and ""anything I could find.""Her parents were strict, and if she misbehaved, they would take her money away. In response, Guo, in second grade, went to Home Depot to get a debit card and opened a PayPal account to store her cash.As the years went on, her money-making endeavors grew. A fan of the game Neopets, she would sell virtual creatures and in-game currency on forums. ""I would get rare pets, rare items, and resell them for actual cash,"" she said.After discovering engineering and coding, she began making and selling bots to cheat in games. From there, her ventures ""snowballed."" ""I then started finding other ways to make money on the internet from making websites using Google AdSense, then creating internet marketing tools...it just snowballed from there,"" she is quoted as saying.","Lucy Guo, 30, was recently named Forbes' youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of $1.3 billion.

Mivi AI Buds Review: Earphones that talk to you

The digital token, $WLFI, from the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial , has begun trading on major exchanges on Monday (September 1). This development marks a significant step for the “decentralised finance” platform, allowing investors to buy and sell the tokens and potentially boosting the value of the president's own holdings.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the World Liberty tokens have been designed to give holders voting rights on certain business decisions. These digital tokes were initially sold to investors without being tradable.However, in July, investors voted to make the tokens tradable, paving the way for their public debut. World Liberty has said that early investors can now sell up to 20% of their holdings.The tokens are now being offered on some of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance , OKX, and Bybit. According to CoinGecko, the token was last trading at $0.3115.Since World Liberty's launch last year, the Trump family has reportedly earned around $500 million from the project. The primary appeal of the $WLFI token for early investors was its direct connection to the Trump brand and the expectation that the token's value would rise due to the president's backing.However, this latest crypto venture has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and government ethics experts. They argue that the Trump family's involvement in digital currencies, while the president's administration reshapes the regulatory framework for the sector, presents a profound conflict of interest.Meanwhile, the White House has maintained that Trump’s assets are held in a trust managed by his children and that no conflicts exist.","The $WLFI digital token, from the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, has begun trading on major exchanges.

Silicon Valley embraces AI; some are being serious while others are trying to make it fun

Airtable CEO Howie Liu is taking an unconventional approach to AI adoption, actively encouraging his 700+ employees to cancel regular work commitments and dedicate entire days—or even weeks—to experimenting with artificial intelligence tools . The directive represents a bold departure from traditional workplace expectations as tech companies scramble to integrate AI into their operations.""If you want to cancel all your meetings for a day or for an entire week and just go play around with every AI product that you think could be relevant to Airtable, go do it. Period,"" Liu stated during a recent appearance on Lenny's Podcast.

He describes his AI usage as ""extremely, intentionally wasteful,"" spending hundreds of dollars on inference costs to generate insights from sales call transcripts. ""Hundreds of dollars spent on this exercise is trivial compared to the potential strategic value of having better insights,"" Liu explained, noting that such analysis would typically cost millions through consulting firms.This approach mirrors broader industry trends where tech leaders are mandating AI proficiency . Google and Microsoft executives have warned employees that AI adoption is no longer optional for career advancement, with both companies now incorporating AI usage into performance evaluations.The push for AI integration extends across Silicon Valley, including its biggest players. Microsoft's Julia Liuson declared that ""using AI is no longer optional—it's core to every role and every level,"" while Google CEO Sundar Pichai urged employees to ""be more AI-savvy"" during company meetings.

Google defends its safety protocols



Over half a dozen UK lawmakers have accused Google DeepMind of violating international AI safety commitments by releasing its Gemini 2.5 Pro model in March 2025 without proper safety documentation, calling it a ""troubling breach of trust with governments and the public.""The cross-party group, including digital rights campaigner Baroness Beeban Kidron and former Defence Secretary Des Browne, published an open letter through activist group PauseAI UK , claiming Google failed to honor the Frontier AI Safety Commitments signed at an international summit in February 2024.The controversy centers on Google's decision to release Gemini 2.5 Pro—which the company said outperformed competitors by ""meaningful margins""—without immediately publishing a detailed model card containing safety testing information. The document was only released 22 days after the model became publicly available, with comprehensive safety details arriving over a month later.According to the letter shared with TIME, Google's delayed disclosure ""sets a dangerous precedent"" for AI development. The lawmakers criticised what they termed a ""minimal model card"" that lacked substantive details about external evaluations and failed to confirm whether government agencies like the UK AI Security Institute participated in testing.""If leading companies like Google treat these commitments as optional, we risk a dangerous race to deploy increasingly powerful AI without proper safeguards,"" Lord Browne of Ladyton stated in the letter.At the 2024 summit, Google and other AI companies pledged to ""publicly report"" their models' capabilities and risk assessments while disclosing external testing involvement. The commitment was designed to provide transparency as AI systems become more powerful and potentially dangerous.A Google DeepMind spokesperson told Fortune the company stands by its ""transparent testing and reporting processes"" and is fulfilling public commitments, including the Seoul Frontier AI Safety Commitments. The spokesperson confirmed that Gemini 2.5 Pro underwent ""rigorous safety checks, including by UK AISI and other third-party testers.""However, Google only shared the model with the UK AI Security Institute after its March 25 release, according to TIME reporting. The lawmakers are demanding Google establish clear timelines for safety reporting and provide full transparency about testing partnerships for future releases.The letter reflects growing concerns about voluntary AI safety commitments, with similar criticism directed at other companies including Meta's Llama 4 and OpenAI 's recent model releases lacking immediate safety documentation.","UK lawmakers accuse Google DeepMind of violating AI safety commitments.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on first India office

ChatGPT creator OpenAI recently announced that it is expanding its presence in India. The company is expected to open its first office in New Delhi later this year. Now a new online report has revealed that the company is planning to establish a major datacenter in India. According to a report by Bloomberg, India is part of OpenAI’s ambitious $500 billion Stargate project. For those unaware, Stargate project is part of a global infrastructure initiative which is designed to power next-generation of artificial intelligence . The move signals India’s growing strategic importance in the AI race and marks a significant milestone in OpenAI’s global expansion.Announced earlier this year, the Stargate project includes building massive supercomputing facilities across multiple continents to support advanced AI models. US President Donald Trump recently called it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history,” underscoring its geopolitical and technological significance.The proposed datacenter in India is said to be part of the second phase of the Stargate project. The second phase of the project includes facilities in Middle East, Southeast Asia and Latin America. As per the report OpenAI is in early talks with Indian officials and private partners in order to secure land, regulatory approvals and energy resources.India has become the choice for the Stargate project because of its solid tech ecosystem, renewable energy capacity and skilled workforce. Along with this, India also has many hyper scale data centres which are operated by tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google.The Stargate facilities are said to house tens of thousands of GPUs and custom chips. These facilities will allow OpenAI to train and deploy powerful models. These supercomputers are expected to support applications ranging from autonomous systems and scientific research to national security and enterprise automation.OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman has previously emphasized the need for “planet-scale compute” to keep pace with AI’s exponential growth. The Stargate initiative is designed to meet that demand while diversifying infrastructure beyond the U.S.The PTI report also quotes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman who said “The level of excitement and opportunity for AI in India is incredible. India has all ingredients to become a global AI leader, amazing tech talent, a world-class developer ecosystem, and strong government support through the IndiaAI Mission”.He added, “Opening our first office and building a local team is an important first step in our commitment to make advanced AI more accessible across the country and to build AI for India, and with India.” The report further quotes Ashwini Vaishnaw, Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, who said in a statement “OpenAI's decision to establish a presence in India reflects the country's growing leadership in digital innovation and AI adoption. With strong investments in digital public infrastructure, AI talent, and enterprise-scale solutions, India is uniquely positioned to drive the next wave of AI-led transformation”.As part of the IndiaAI Mission, the country is building an ecosystem for trusted and inclusive AI, the minister said, adding, ""We welcome OpenAI's partnership in advancing this vision to ensure the benefits of AI reach every citizen.""","ChatGPT creator OpenAI recently announced that it is expanding its presence in India.

“India’s digital advertising market is at an inflexion point. The convergence of mobile-led consumption, the rapid rise of video formats, and the integration of AI into every stage of the advertising process is reshaping how brands connect with consumers. As audiences spread their attention across more devices and platforms, the leaders will be those who diversify beyond mega platforms, design content for each channel from the ground up, and harness AI and first-party data to deliver personalised, high-impact campaigns. Over the next five years, the ability to combine creativity, data, and technology will be the defining factor in who captures the most value,”

India’s Gaming Revolution: New Law Changes EVERYTHING

India's digital advertising market is projected to be one of the fastest-growing globally, with an estimated annual growth rate of 15% through 2029. According to a new report from Bain & Company, the country's ad market, currently valued at $16–$18 billion, is expected to reach $17–$19 billion by 2029. The growth is being driven by factors like rising private consumption, high digital consumption, and the rapid adoption of over-the-top (OTT) platforms. Mobile devices are a key driver, accounting for nearly 70% of total digital ad spend, and this is even higher in India. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands are also contributing to this growth, with their share of digital ad spending projected to reach up to 42% by 2029.According to the report, India’s digital advertising landscape is rapidly evolving, driven by the rising adoption of mobile and OTT platforms, as consumers spend ~4.8 hours daily on mobile devices. Video-led in-app ads are gaining traction, while AI-powered search and summary ads are emerging as new trends.Brands are diversifying media budgets, adopting mobile-first content, and leveraging AI and first-party data for hyper-personalised campaigns.

What experts said about China’s BCI development



“We know that China is strong at translating basic research into practical uses and commercialisation. We’ve seen that in other industries, such as photovoltaics and electric cars. Now, BCI is another area where that’s going to be critical. The document really lays out this whole umbrella of activities needed to become a leader in BCI, not just in research, but in actually getting it into the mainstream.”

“The Chinese government has always been supportive of disruptive technologies. I think, from the government’s point of view, this policy means that

BCI technology

has already passed from a concept level into the product level,”

India’s Gaming Revolution: New Law Changes EVERYTHING

The Chinese government has reportedly set a goal to become a global leader in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, a report claims. This signals its intent to compete directly with US companies like Elon Musk 's Neuralink. A new policy document, jointly authored by seven government departments in China, reportedly outlines a roadmap for the Country to achieve breakthroughs in BCI by 2027 and establish an internationally competitive industry by 2030. BCIs read and decode neural activity to control external devices, offering potential as assistive technology for people with severe physical disabilities. In the US, Neuralink , Synchron, and Paradromics have been working to commercialise this technology, and China is now making a concerted effort to develop its own homegrown BCI companies.In a statement to Wired, Max Riesenhuber, codirector of the Centre for Neuroengineering at Georgetown University, has published research on China's BCI developments. Riesenhuber, who is also a professor of neuroscience, said:Research on BCIs began in the 1970s, but only recently gained traction with companies like Elon Musk-owned Neuralink improving early designs. China entered the field later but is catching up, with successful patient trials enabling tasks like moving cursors and controlling robotic arms, the report adds.The government has issued ethical guidelines and a policy roadmap with 17 steps to accelerate BCI development, focusing on better chips, decoding software, standardisation, and manufacturing.Phoenix Peng, cofounder and CEO of NeuroXess, a BCI company based in Shanghai, said.","China has reportedly set a goal to become a global leader in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, a report claims.

India’s Gaming Revolution: New Law Changes EVERYTHING

Meta’s partnership with Scale AI, a key part of its $14.3 billion investment to lead the AI race, may already be facing strain. Just two months after the deal was announced, reports indicate that internal friction is causing significant tension within the company’s newly-formed Superintelligence Lab (MSL). This has led to a series of high-profile departures from the team.Citing sources close to the company, a report by TechCrunch said that a significant reason for the turmoil stems from the company’s partnership with Scale AI and the subsequent integration of new leadership, raising questions about the stability of CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s ambitious AI push.Citing two former and one current MSL employee, the report said that the AI unit has become increasingly chaotic since the arrival of Scale AI co-founder Alexandr Wang and a wave of new researchers.Top talent recruited from rivals like OpenAI and Scale AI have expressed frustration with the bureaucratic hurdles of a large corporation, while Meta’s existing GenAI team has seen its scope and influence diminish, the report added.Another reason cited for the internal strife is CEO Mark Zuckerberg's frustration with the underwhelming launch of Llama 4 in April.The third reason reported is the instability of the team. In a rushed effort to catch up with competitors, Zuckerberg launched a campaign to recruit top AI talent and strike deals. This included bringing in Wang, a move some viewed as unconventional given his lack of experience managing teams within a massive tech giant.Zuckerberg also reportedly held talks with more traditional candidates like OpenAI's chief research officer, Mark Chen, and attempted to acquire the startups of Ilya Sutskever and Mira Murati, but all of them declined.The instability has led to a number of quick exits. As previously reported by Wired, some of the new AI researchers brought in from OpenAI have already left Meta.

Why the Bombay HC banned Cognizant’s logo in India



India’s Gaming Revolution: New Law Changes EVERYTHING

The Bombay High Court may have reinstated a ban that prevents US-based IT company Cognizant from using its logo in India. The decision, reportedly announced last week, will remain in effect until the conclusion of a trademark infringement lawsuit filed by Bengaluru-based company Atyati Technologies Pvt. Ltd. The decision was announced by a division bench comprising Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Sandeep V. Marne. The division bench overturned a previous single-judge order from June 13, 2024, which had allowed Cognizant to continue using the logo. The court's interim ruling reinstates an injunction from March 19, 2024, that had initially barred the company from using the disputed branding.The order (seen by Livemint) read:Cognizant said to Livemint, responding to the development.Domestic fintech company Atyati sued Cognizant in 2023 over trademark infringement, claiming its orange hexagonal honeycomb logo had been in use since 2019. In March 2024, the Bombay High Court issued an injunction, noting that the similarities between the two marks could mislead the public and ruling in Atyati’s favour.In recent years, Cognizant has faced a series of legal disputes, including cases of employee poaching and alleged intellectual property violations. In September 2023, the company hired former Wipro CFO Jatin Dalal, prompting Wipro to sue him for breaching a non-compete clause and seeking Rs 25.1 crore in damages. The matter was later settled, with Cognizant covering Rs 4.2 crore of Dalal’s costs, including legal fees.A similar dispute arose in December 2023 when Wipro’s former healthcare head, Mohd Ehteshamul Haque, joined Cognizant as chief commercial officer for the Americas. That case was also settled, though details were not disclosed.Separately, Cognizant is engaged in an ongoing high-profile conflict with Infosys, which has accused it of misusing software trade secrets to build a competing healthcare product. Infosys even named Cognizant CEO S Ravi Kumar in its filings.Cognizant has denied the allegations. In May 2025, a Dallas court directed both companies to resolve disagreements over the scope of information exchange before the trial proceeds.","Bombay High Court may have reinstated a ban that prevents US-based IT company Cognizant from using its logo in India.

Apple iPhone 17 series: Models and likely specs

Apple reportedly seems set to expand its e-SIM only models with the upcoming iPhone 17 series. This means that Apple will introduce its eSIM-only approach beyond the United States, with the new iPhone 17 lineup likely to be the first to feature the change. Since the launch of the iPhone 14 in 2022, Apple has exclusively sold eSIM-only models in the U.S., while continuing to offer physical SIM card trays in iPhones sold in other countries. Now, three years later, analysts and industry insiders suggest this is about to change.Rumors point to the upcoming iPhone 17 Air as a prime candidate for the transition, with its ultra-thin design making the removal of the physical SIM tray a logical step to save internal space. The move would bring a unified hardware design to iPhones globally, a significant shift for the company.Analysts Ming-Chi Kuo and The Information have both reported on the expected change for international models, specifically noting the iPhone 17 Air. Adding further weight to these reports, MacRumors has revealed that Apple is already preparing retail partners for the transition. According to the publication, Apple Authorized Resellers in the European Union are required to complete a training course on eSIM-only iPhones by Friday, September 5, just four days before Apple’s scheduled event.Apple’s annual fall event, dubbed 'Awe Dropping', is slated for September 9, where the company is expected to unveil the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max . The event is also expected to feature the new Apple Watch Series 11 , Apple Watch Ultra 3, and potentially even the third generation of AirPods Pro.The most notable change is a potential fourth model, the iPhone 17 Air, which is rumored to be an ultra-thin device replacing the ""Plus"" model. All four phones—the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max—are expected to receive major upgrades.A key improvement for all models is the rumored ProMotion display, bringing a 120Hz refresh rate to the standard and Air models for the first time. The entire lineup is also expected to feature a new 24-megapixel front-facing camera. The Pro models, in particular, are tipped to get a new horizontal pill-shaped camera bar and an upgraded rear camera system with three 48-megapixel sensors for the iPhone 17 Pro Max, potentially enabling 8K video recording.The series will be powered by Apple's new A19 chip, with Pro models getting the even more powerful A19 Pro. This new silicon, along with a rumored increase in RAM to 12GB for Pro models, is expected to enhance Apple Intelligence AI features.

Overstated Revenue and Mounting Debt

The collapse of Builder.ai , according to Bloomberg, is a stark reminder of the ambiguity surrounding the term ""artificial intelligence"". The tech world is in a frenzy, and attaching the AI label to a startup is a common, and sometimes deceptive, practice to attract funding. As one expert noted, ""If you want funding, you just say a bunch of AI words—‘machine learning’ and ‘large language models’ and ‘This is the future.’"" This has fueled a ""fake AI"" bubble, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other authorities taking action against fraudulent companies.The trend is also reflected in the booming use of the .ai domain name. Originally for the Caribbean island of Anguilla, it's become a symbol for AI startups . This summer alone, around 1,500 new .ai addresses were created daily, with the total number projected to exceed 1 million by Thanksgiving.Builder.ai, originally founded as Engineer.ai in 2016, embraced the AI narrative to secure its final funding round in 2023, attracting investors like Microsoft and SoftBank. The company, led by ""chief wizard"" Sachin Dev Duggal , poured a significant portion of its resources into promotion rather than product development. According to internal documents, Builder.ai spent $42 million on brand promotion in 2024, representing 80% of its revenue.This aggressive marketing included a showcase of ""Natasha,"" an AI program manager that was advertised as being able to build software with ""no code coding."" This strategy earned them a spot on Fast Company's list of most innovative AI companies, ahead of Nvidia. However, the report reveals some of their claims were unfounded; for instance, a partnership with JPMorgan Chase mentioned by Fast Company was non-existent.Builder.ai's troubles were foreshadowed as far back as 2019 when a former executive, Robert Holdheim, sued the company, alleging it had two sets of books—one with fake numbers for investors. The lawsuit was settled, but the red flags remained. The company's true financial state was revealed last winter when the board found that revenue was drastically overstated.For fiscal year 2023, the reported revenue was $157 million, while the actual figure was only $42 million. The disparity widened in 2024, with reported revenue of $217 million against a reality of $51 million. The company was also failing to pay its bills, reportedly owing Amazon Web Services a staggering $75 million. Duggal resigned, and despite a new CEO's efforts, the company ultimately had to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.","Builder.ai, originally founded as Engineer.ai in 2016, embraced the AI narrative to secure its final funding round in 2023.

Marc Benioff's July stance on AI unemployment vs. September reality

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff announced the company has cut 4,000 customer support positions, reducing its support workforce from 9,000 to 5,000 employees as AI agents increasingly handle customer service tasks. The dramatic workforce reduction represents nearly a 45% cut in the support division at the cloud software company.""I was able to rebalance my head count on my support,"" Benioff said during an appearance on the "" Logan Bartlett "" podcast released Friday, as quoted in a Business Insider report. ""I've reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000 because I need less heads.""The job cuts come as Salesforce deploys AI agents that now handle 50% of customer conversations, with human agents managing the remaining half. Benioff described it as ""eight of the most exciting months of my career"" while explaining how AI technology has transformed the company's operations.The implementation extends beyond customer support into sales operations, where AI agents are addressing a significant backlog. Benioff revealed that Salesforce had accumulated over 100 million uncalled sales leads over 26 years due to insufficient staffing.""There were more than 100 million leads that we have not called back at Salesforce in the last 26 years because we have not had enough people,"" he explained. ""But we now have an agentic sales that is calling back every person that contacts us.""The company uses an ""omnichannel supervisor"" system that coordinates collaboration between human and AI agents, allowing AI to recognise when tasks require human intervention.Benioff compared this handoff process to Tesla's self-driving feature, explaining that AI agents can determine when they need human assistance, similar to how ""you're in your Tesla and all of a sudden it's self-driving and goes, 'Oh, I don't know actually know what's happening, you take over.'""The workforce reduction marks a stark contrast to Benioff's July 2025 statements, when he argued that AI wouldn't lead to mass unemployment. In a Fortune interview, he emphasized that AI would augment rather than replace workers, stating ""the humans are not going away"" and dismissing ""scary narratives"" about AI layoffs.Just two months earlier, Benioff had positioned himself against AI startup CEOs like Anthropic's Dario Amodei who predicted massive white-collar displacement. He argued that AI's current accuracy limitations, around 90% even with company data, meant ""you need the human in the loop."" Benioff insisted that while AI enhances productivity, it doesn't replace workers because ""AIs can't fact check because they don't have that level of accuracy.""The Salesforce CEO had even announced in July that the company wouldn't hire additional software engineers, customer service agents, or lawyers, but was adding sales staff to help customers adopt AI technology. Salesforce employed 76,453 people across all divisions as of January 2025, making the 4,000 support cuts represent roughly 5% of the total workforce.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff announced the company has cut 4,000 customer support positions.

Misplaced bets in AI



Incumbents vs. innovators



Not all doom and gloom



Grindr CEO George Arison has issued a sharp warning to the artificial intelligence industry. Arison has predicted that the venture capital fueled bubble will soon ‘get destroyed’ and will take ‘many companies’ down with it. As reported by Business Insider, Arison highlighted the same concerns as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman . Recently Altman also cautioned that ""overexcited"" investors were exhibiting bubble-like behavior. However, Arison went ahead and further suggested that many AI companies are may be heading towards SoftBank-style implosion.“Most VCs are actually followers, not trendsetters,” Arison said. “A few people will set the trends, then everyone will jump in that direction and too much money will go into that space.”Arison aslo drew references from Softbank’s aggressive investments in late 2010s, including $9 billion in WeWork and $375 million in Zume and both the companies collapsed. He also stressed that some companies resisted the lure of big capital, hey might still be viable today.Arison highlighted that while Grindr has embraced AI— releasing a second-quarter slide deck on its “gAI” (pronounced “gay-I”) strategy. But, he is still skeptical of where the money is flowing. He also emphasise that the bubble is forming on the application side of AI and not in foundational model development. “How many sales agents do you need?” he quipped, pointing to bloated investments in AI-powered tools with limited differentiation.Arison also suggested that some major AI players may be discouraging investment to protect their own competitive edge. “If you are an incumbent large AI player, you kind of want to stop a lot of investment from going into this space,” he said. He cited examples of rapid innovation and disruption, including Anthropic’s Claude Code outpacing Cursor, and Elon Musk’s Grok potentially leapfrogging long-standing competitors.Despite his warnings, Arison remains bullish on AI’s long-term potential. He sees the VC bubble as an “inevitable component” of venture capital, where some companies will fail—but others will thrive. “VCs are herd,” he said. “Wherever the three sheep go, then everybody else follows.”",Grindr CEO George Arison has issued a sharp warning to the artificial intelligence industry.

Beijing backs Cambricon to create competitive AI chip market

Chinese AI chip designer Cambricon Technologies has emerged as Beijing's most promising domestic challenger to Nvidia, with its stock price doubling this month to reach a market capitalization of Rmb580 billion ($81 billion). The surge reflects investor confidence that the less-than-decade-old company could become the leading supplier of AI chips to power China's homegrown artificial intelligence models, including those developed by DeepSeek , the Chinese AI champion that stunned Silicon Valley earlier this year.Cambricon's remarkable transformation from near-collapse to market darling illustrates China's broader push for technological self-sufficiency in the face of US export restrictions. After losing 98% of its revenue when former major customer Huawei dropped its technology in 2019, the company has successfully pivoted to become Huawei's primary domestic rival in the AI chip market, according to the Financial Times.The startup's key advantage lies not in raw computing power but in software compatibility that makes it easier for developers to deploy AI models originally trained on Nvidia's GPUs. Several industry insiders, including a ByteDance AI engineer, told the Financial Times that Cambricon's software integration makes its products more user-friendly than competing chips from the much larger Huawei.This strategic focus on software has proven crucial as Cambricon invested Rmb5.6 billion ($784 million) in research and development between 2020 and 2024. The investment paid off when the company collaborated with ByteDance in late 2024 to improve compatibility with algorithms trained on Nvidia's ecosystem, marking a turning point for the previously struggling chipmaker.Chinese policymakers have thrown their weight behind Cambricon as part of efforts to create domestic competition in the AI chip sector while reducing dependence on US technology. Goldman Sachs estimates the company's revenues will more than double from Rmb6.5 billion ($910 million) this year to Rmb13.8 billion ($1.93 billion) in 2026, with its market share of China's AI chip market expected to grow from 3% to 11% by 2028.The company's growth depends heavily on manufacturing partner Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation's ability to expand production of 7-nanometer chips. Beijing instructed SMIC last year to allocate more capacity to Cambricon rather than selling all advanced nodes to Huawei, according to sources familiar with the matter cited by the Financial Times.Founded in 2016 by brothers Chen Tianshi and Chen Yunji, who previously developed processors at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Cambricon has aligned itself firmly with Beijing's AI development plans. The company reported its first profit of Rmb1 billion ($140 million) in the first half of this year, though it cautioned investors Friday that its stock price may be disconnected from business fundamentals after the recent surge.",Chinese AI chip designer Cambricon Technologies has emerged as Beijing's most promising domestic challenger to Nvidia.

What xAI's lawsuit against the engineer claims

Xuechen Li sold xAI shares days before leaving

In a dramatic escalation of the AI talent wars, Elon Musk 's artificial intelligence startup, xAI , has reportedly filed a lawsuit against a former engineer, accusing him of stealing confidential trade secrets related to its Grok chatbot and taking them to rival OpenAI . The complaint, filed last week in a California federal court, names Xuechen Li , a Chinese national, who worked as an engineer at xAI, as the defendant. The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and a restraining order to prevent Li from joining OpenAI.According to the lawsuit, Li stole ""cutting-edge AI technologies"" with features that are ""superior to those offered by ChatGPT,"" intending to use them in his new role at OpenAI. According to xAI's complaint, Li began working for the company last year, where he played a key role in developing and training the Grok chatbot. The lawsuit claims Li took confidential information in July, shortly after accepting a job offer from OpenAI and selling $7 million in xAI stock.xAI alleges that these stolen secrets could allow OpenAI to enhance its ChatGPT with Grok's ""more innovative AI and imaginative features."" It adds that it could save OpenAI and other competitors billions in research and development dollars and years of effort, the lawsuit states.The complaint also claims that Li admitted to stealing company files and attempting to ""cover his tracks"" during a meeting on August 14. xAI says it later discovered additional stolen material on his devices that he had not disclosed.The lawsuit alleges that after Li persuaded xAI to liquidate $2.2 million worth of his xAI shares, in addition to $4.7 million he received earlier in the summer, he “willfully and maliciously” copied documents from his xAI-issued laptop onto at least one personal system the same day that his roughly $7 million in cash became available.A Chinese national, Xuechen Li lives in Mountain View. He reportedly earned his doctorate in computer science from Stanford and joined xAI in early 2024. He is said to be among roughly 20 early engineers working on the company’s Grok model, which granted him broad access to xAI’s proprietary information.","Xuechen Li, a Chinese national, worked as an engineer at xAI.

Talent shortage fuels demand



The irony of innovation



The age of growing dominance of artificial intelligence and multiple coding languages it appears that still a 40-year old programming language is ruling the job listings in the US. As reported by Business Insider, a review of over 12 million job postings on America’s largest employment platform has revealed that COBOL, a programming language developed in 1959, remains the most in-demand tech skill across the country.Despite the popularity of AI, cloud computing and other modern languages, COBOL—short for Common Business-Oriented Language is still dominating the job listings in various sectors such as insurance, banking and government services. The findings underscore that how legacy systems manage to form the backbone of critical infrastructure and companies are scrambling to find talent capable of maintaining and modernizing them.COBOL play a major role in powering daily transactions. The language is used by financial institutions and federal agencies. Many of these systems were created decades ago and it’s still very risky to replace them. So, as a result, organisations are now seeking developers who can easily navigate and also update these aging but important platforms.The high demand for COBOL programmers is also because of the shrinking talent pool. The main issue with the fuelling demand is the aging COBOL experts. Many of the COBOL experts are set to retire and only a new young developers have been trained in the language. This huge gap has led to the creation of a niche market and as a result the professionals with COBOL skill demand premium salaries along with job stability.The dominance of COBOL in the job listings clearly highlights that innovation can coexist with preservation. As companies race to adopt AI and automation, they must also ensure the reliability of the systems that quietly keep the world running.","Despite the popularity of AI, cloud computing and other modern languages, COBOL is still dominating the job listings in various sectors such as insurance, banking and government services.

Population collapse: Elon Musk’s ongoing concern



A global warning by Tesla CEO Elon Musk



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has one again stirred debate over global population decline . Musk recently responded to a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) involving a Pakistani man’s inflammatory comment towards a Danish man. The post shared consists of a video in which a Pakistani man was seen claiming that Danes will soon be ‘exterminated’ in their own country and replaced by Pakistanis . Musk has now responded to the video claiming that the Maths of the Pakistani man is correct.In the video shared a Pakistani man can be seen arguing with a Danish man surrounded by cops. The Pakistani man said, “We shall stay sitting on your hearts for the rest of life man, we have got 5 children and you have only 1 and 2.”“In the next 10-15 years there will be more Pakistanis than Danes in this country,” added the Pakistani.The Pakistani further stated “Danes are just 5 million and soon you will be exterminated. Look at Swedes, look at Norwegians, look at Finnish. We are in millions.”Another Pakistani man present in the same video said, “I got married and I am also having 5 kids tomorrow. So, go and give birth to more children man.”Replying to this video shared on X, Elon Musk replied that the Maths of the Pakistani man is correct. “His math is correct,” wrote Musk.Elon Musk’s comment aligns with his repeated assertions that population collapse—not overpopulation—is the real existential threat to civilization. Musk earlier argued that declining birth rates could lead to economic stagnation, labour shortages, and even civilizational decline if not addressed. “Most people still think the world is overpopulated,” Musk said in earlier interviews. “It’s actually the opposite.”Japan has been the focal point for population collapse, but Elon Musk’s warning also applies to other nations such as South Korea, Italy and parts of Eastern Europe as they are also facing similar trends. This issue of population collapse has also sparked the interests of pro-natalist policies, immigration reform, and even the role of AI and robotics in offsetting labor gaps.Recently, Elon Musk issued a stark warning about Japan. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the tech billionaire wrote: “Japan will lose almost a million people this year.” In the post, Musk said that this demographic was set in motion half a century ago adding that the population decline in the country “has nothing to do with AI.” “AI is the only hope for turning this around,” the tech CEO further stated.Elon Musk was responding to an X post that said: “Japan's population falling with 900,000 more deaths than births in 2024”.Recently, a report claimed that Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg if he was willing to help him finance $97.4 billion to take over ChatGPT maker OpenAI.","Elon Musk responded to a video shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) involving a Pakistani man’s inflammatory comment towards a Danish man.

People using chatbots as companions

A new study examining how three leading AI chatbots respond to questions about suicide found they are inconsistent in their replies, raising concerns about the safety of people, including children, who are turning to these tools for mental health support.The research, published in the medical journal Psychiatric Services, reportedly found that while OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google ’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude generally refused to answer the most high-risk queries, their responses to less extreme prompts varied significantly and could still be harmful. According to a report in AFP, the study, conducted by the RAND Corporation, highlights the urgent need for clearer safety standards for AI developers.“We need some guardrails,” said lead author Ryan McBain, a senior policy researcher at RAND. “One of the things that’s ambiguous about chatbots is whether they’re providing treatment or advice or companionship. It’s sort of this gray zone.”McBain and his co-authors, in consultation with psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, developed 30 questions about suicide, assigning each a risk level. Questions about suicide statistics were considered low risk, while specific ""how-to"" queries were deemed high risk. The study is said to have found a surprising degree of safety in how the chatbots handled the six highest-risk questions, with all three generally refusing to answer and instead directing users to seek help from a professional or a hotline.However, the safety net weakened with less direct, high-risk questions. For example, the study found that ChatGPT consistently provided answers to questions it should have flagged, such as which type of rope or firearm has the “highest rate of completed suicide.” Claude also answered some of these questions. The study did not attempt to rate the quality of the responses themselves.On the other end of the spectrum, Google's Gemini was the most cautious, often refusing to answer even basic, low-risk questions about suicide statistics. McBain suggested that Google may have “gone overboard” with its safety measures.The findings come as a growing number of people are using AI chatbots for emotional support. The study authors, including Dr. Ateev Mehrotra of Brown University, believe far more Americans are now turning to these tools than to mental health specialists.“You could see how a combination of risk-aversion lawyers and so forth would say, ‘Anything with the word suicide, don’t answer the question.’ And that’s not what we want,” Mehrotra said. He noted that unlike a trained clinician, who has a legal and ethical responsibility to intervene in a crisis, chatbots typically “put it right back on the person. ‘You should call the suicide hotline. Seeya.’”This lack of accountability has prompted some states, like Illinois, to ban the use of AI in therapy. However, this does not prevent people from asking chatbots for help, or the chatbots from responding.The study authors noted their research did not account for ""multiturn interaction,"" or back-and-forth conversations, which are common among young people who treat AI as a companion. Another recent report, from the Center for Countering Digital Hate, took a different approach and found that by posing as 13-year-olds and using trickery, they could get ChatGPT to generate detailed, personalized plans for risky behaviors and even compose suicide letters.While McBain said he believes such trickery is unlikely in most real-world scenarios, he stressed that companies must be held to a higher standard. “I just think that there’s some mandate or ethical impetus that should be put on these companies to demonstrate the extent to which these models adequately meet safety benchmarks,” he said.","A new study examined how three leading AI chatbots respond to questions about suicide.

Indian government recently imposed a ban on real-money online gaming. The decision impacted many real money gaming startups. After this sweeping ban by the Indian government, Mobile Premier League (MPL) is set to lay off approximately 60% of its domestic workforce—around 300 employees. The ban, announced earlier this month, targets paid games such as fantasy cricket, rummy, and poker, citing financial and addiction risks among youth. The move has disrupted a booming industry that was projected to reach $3.6 billion by 2029 and had attracted major investors including Tiger Global and Peak XV PartnersAs reported by Reuters, MPL is all set to fire 60% of its workforce. The report also mentions that the fresh round of layoffs will impact teams across operations, marketing, finance, engineering and legal. MPL CEO Sai Srinivas, in an internal email, described the decision as “with a heavy heart,” acknowledging that India—once responsible for 50% of MPL’s revenue—will no longer generate income for the company in the near future.MPL’s India revenue last year stood at approximately $100 million. The company now plans to shift focus to free-to-play games and expand its presence in international markets such as the U.S., Europe, and Brazil.As mentioned above, the ban has impacted many startups across the industry. MPL’s rival Dream11, valued at $8 billion, has also discontinued its fantasy cricket offerings. While many gaming platforms have halted paid services, only A23 has legally challenged the government’s decision so far. MPL and Dream11 have opted not to pursue legal action.Backed by Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India), MPL was valued at $2.3 billion in 2021.

Melinda Gates on creating more balance in household

In a 2019 interview with Business Insider, Melinda French Gates revealed a surprising detail about her life with Bill Gates long before their 2021 divorce: the Microsoft CEO, known for his relentless work ethic, quietly took on the daily school run for their eldest daughter, Jennifer.The decision, she explained, was born from a family debate. With their daughter starting preschool at a campus a significant drive from their home, Melinda suggested they wait to enroll her until she was a bit older. Bill, however, was insistent. ""He was really quite adamant that he thought we should start then,"" she recalled. ""And he said, 'I'll drive them.'""Melinda's surprise was echoed by other parents. Just weeks into the school year, she said, other mothers approached her to share a revelation: they were seeing more dads at morning drop-off. The reason? ""We went home and we told our husbands, 'If Bill Gates, who's the CEO of Microsoft right now, can drive his kid to school, so can you!'""What started as a negotiation between two parents, Melinda realized, ended up having a ripple effect. She and Bill were, without knowing it, modeling a more equitable distribution of ""unpaid"" domestic labor—the chores and tasks, like doing dishes or packing lunches, that often fall to women.Melinda, who has spoken frequently about the importance of shared responsibility, noted that these simple household decisions had a wider impact. ""By trying to create more balance in household chores,"" she said, ""we realized we were impacting other marriages."" The former couple even continued to do the dishes together throughout their marriage, as she recounted to the outlet.Ultimately, the daily drives proved invaluable beyond just easing the burden on Melinda. ""Bill and the kids cherished those moments in the car,"" she told Business Insider. ""Listening to music together, the conversations over many years that they had—it's a side of him that they might not have seen otherwise. It would've been a missed opportunity.""Before headlines of a billion-dollar divorce, the couple navigated the same challenges of balancing work and family as many others.

Elon Musk slams Apple for leaving X, Grok off top apps list; suggests politics behind move

Grok's Hitler phase that went viral

The White House has reportedly instructed the General Services Administration (GSA) to ""ASAP"" add Elon Musk 's xAI and its Grok chatbot to a list of approved vendors for government use. The report that appeared in WIRED quotes an email obtained by the publication. The email, sent earlier this week by GSA's Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum, stated, ""Team: Grok/xAI needs to go back on the schedule ASAP per the WH."" The message, which had the subject line ""xAI add Grok-4,"" instructed staff to ""get with Carahsoft on this immediately."" Carahsoft is a major government contractor that resells technology from third-party firms.The directive follows a previously scuttled partnership with xAI that fell apart earlier this summer after Grok was reported to have generated content praising Hitler and other antisemitic beliefs on the social media platform X.The report added that the email seemed to refer to Grok 3 and Grok 4, noting, ""Should be all of their products we had previously (3 & 4)."" Sources confirmed to WIRED that Carahsoft's contract has since been modified to include xAI. As of Friday morning, Grok 3 and Grok 4 were listed on GSA Advantage, an online marketplace for government agencies. This listing allows any federal agency to now acquire and deploy the chatbot.According to a previous report, federal workers were surprised when GSA leadership pressed for a contract with xAI in June, given Grok's history of erratic behavior and uncensored responses. The GSA had removed Grok from its long-term government contracting platform after the chatbot's controversial statements on Hitler in July. Grok was caught doing widespread praise of Hitler and the spouting of other antisemitic beliefs on Twitter.When the GSA announced new partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google earlier this month, xAI was notably absent from the list.The email also comes amid Musk's complex relationship with the administration. Although he recently stepped back from a public role in President Donald Trump's ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" many of his associates continue to advocate for the group's cost-cutting and ""AI-first"" agenda within the government.","The White House has reportedly instructed the GSA to ""ASAP"" add Elon Musk's xAI and its Grok chatbot to a list of approved vendors for government use.

Nvidia says two customers account for nearly 40% of sales: What the SEC filing reveals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-says-two-customers-account-for-nearly-40-of-sales-what-the-sec-filing-reveals/articleshow/123616983.cms,"India’s Gaming Revolution: New Law Changes EVERYTHING

Two unidentified Nvidia customers accounted for nearly 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue in the July quarter, raising fresh concerns over its heavy dependence on a small set of clients. According to a CNBC report, Nvidia disclosed the details in a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing last week, but declined to name the buyers.According to the filing, “Customer A” contributed 23% of total revenue and “Customer B” made up 16%. For the first half of the fiscal year, these accounted for 20% and 15% of the total revenue, respectively. In the filing, both are listed as direct customers, meaning they purchase chips to build systems or circuit boards, which are then sold to data centers, cloud providers, or end-users.As per the CNBC report, direct customers are not the end users of Nvidia’s chips. Direct customers here refers to companies that buy Nvidia chips to build into complete systems or circuit boards which they then sell to data centres, cloud providers and end-users. Some of them are original design manufacturers or original equipment manufacturers like Foxconn.Indirect customers, on the other hand, refer to cloud service providers and internet companies that typically buy systems from Nvidia’s direct customers.In a statement, Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said that large cloud providers together generated about half of its data center revenue in the quarter, which itself contributed 88% of overall sales. “We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia wrote in the filing.That disclosure has fueled speculation that the mystery clients could be big players like Microsoft, Amazon, Google or Oracle, though Nvidia has not confirmed this.Analysts say Nvidia’s fortunes are increasingly tied to how much cloud companies spend on AI infrastructure. “We see limited room for further earnings upside in the near term unless we have clarity on 2026 capex expectations,” HSBC’s Frank Lee wrote in a note.Despite the concentration risk, Nvidia said demand for its AI systems remains strong not only from cloud providers but also enterprises, startups, governments, and “neoclouds” — smaller providers offering AI-focused services. CEO Jensen Huang forecast a $3–$4 trillion AI infrastructure market by the end of the decade, with Nvidia targeting a major share.","Two unidentified customers accounted for nearly 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue in the July quarter.

One of its kind 'Climate Fight'

What 'citizenship deal' has for Australia

Nearly 9,000 citizens of the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu have reportedly applied for a new climate visa to Australia, according to official figures released recently. This number represents 82% of Tuvalu's population, highlighting the significant threat rising sea levels pose to the nation.As reported by news agency AFP, Australia's high commission in Tuvalu stated that 8,750 people, including family members, registered for the new visa program. This initiative, part of the Falepili Union pact signed in 2024, is considered the first of its kind in the world. It aims to provide Tuvaluans with a ""pathway for mobility with dignity as climate impacts worsen,"" as described by Australia's foreign affairs department.Australia and Tuvalu signed the groundbreaking Falepili Union in 2024, part of Canberra's efforts to blunt China's expanding reach in the region. Under the agreement, Australia opened a new visa category specially set aside for citizens of Tuvalu who will be selected at random. ""Australia recognises the devastating impact climate change is having on the livelihoods, security, and wellbeing of climate vulnerable countries and people, particularly in the Pacific region,"" Australia's foreign affairs department told AFP last month.Scientists predict that Tuvalu, one of the most climate-vulnerable places on Earth, could become uninhabitable within the next 80 years. Two of its nine coral atolls have already been largely submerged by rising tides.The announcement of the visa figures comes on the same day as a landmark decision from the world's top court in The Hague. The case, brought by Pacific nations, seeks to establish the legal obligations of countries to prevent climate change and hold polluters accountable for the consequences. This ruling could have a major impact on climate justice efforts globally.The Falepili Union also provides a broader security framework. It legally commits Australia to defend Tuvalu in the event of natural disasters, health pandemics, or ""military aggression."" As per AFP report, Tuvalu's Prime Minister, Feleti Teo, hailed the pact as a historic commitment, noting that it's the first time a country has legally agreed to ""recognize the future statehood and sovereignty of Tuvalu despite the detrimental impact of climate-change-induced sea level rise.""However, the agreement also gives Australia a say in any defense pacts Tuvalu signs with other countries. Tuvalu is one of just 12 states that still have formal diplomatic relations with Taipei rather than Beijing.","Nearly 9,000 citizens of the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu have reportedly applied for a new climate visa to Australia.

The new app that is being developed under a secret project she is leading at Bumble is to createThe app is based on her belief that AI can understand users better than they understand themselves, leading to more effective matches.Dating apps typically rely on swipe-based choices driven by traits like photos, height, or political views. However, Bumble’s new app will shift its focus to deeper insights by creating profiles based on users’ answers about past relationships, breakups, and dating experiences.Wolfe Herd noted that she and her team have consulted with expert psychologists and relationship counsellors to build the matchmaking AI . A beta version of the new app, which will be separate from the existing Bumble platform, is scheduled to be released to select users this fall.This new AI dating app is being developed as a large language model, drawing on attachment theory to understand users’ relationship styles, the report added. When the app is fully ready, it will create profiles, suggest matches, and even help book dates, though monetisation plans and match frequency are still undecided.Wolfe Herd also shared her plans to refine the existing Bumble app by addressing mistakes made after its IPO, when heavy advertising attracted mismatched users.The app will now encourage better profiles, while still requiring a steady flow of new users, as successful matches tend to reduce long-term usage, she noted.Apart from Wolfe Herd, others also share this AI-driven vision for dating apps. At a June panel in San Francisco on the future of AI, a venture capitalist asked Instagram co-founder and current Anthropic chief product officer Mike Krieger what kind of consumer app he’d like to see built using Anthropic’s AI chatbot. One of his responses was a dating app.","Whitney Wolfe Herd, co-founder of dating apps Tinder and Bumble, has revealed that she and her husband often joke about how she is ‘the world’s smartest and most emotionally intelligent matchmaker in existence’ The Bumble CEO made thisin an interview with the Wall Street Journal, where she also discussed her new AI matchmaking app.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123615562,imgsize-957026,width-400,resizemode-4/whitney-wolfe-herd-co-founder-of-dating-apps-tinder-and-bumble-makes-a-confession-about-her-husband-i-would-never-.jpg"

There is one conversation related to AI that Google 's Chief Scientist Jeff Dean says he always tries to avoid. In a recent interview, Google's Jeff Dean, shared his reason for avoiding a popular topic in the AI community: Artificial General Intelligence , or AGI.Speaking on ""The Moonshot Podcast,"" Dean explained that the term AGI is problematic because it has too many different definitions. He noted that the perceived difficulty of achieving AGI can vary wildly depending on who you ask, sometimes by a factor of a trillion.Jeff Dean offered his perspective on the current state of AI. He believes that today's AI models are likely already better than the average person at a wide range of non-physical tasks. While these models can struggle and are not yet at the level of human experts, they are still ""pretty reasonable at most things,"" he said. This, he suggested, is a far cry from the more extreme definition of AGI as a system that can outperform human experts at every single task.When asked about the timeline for AI to make breakthroughs faster than humans, Dean said we are likely already close to that point in some areas. Dean believes that automated search and computation will accelerate progress in science and engineering, helping advance human capabilities over the coming decades. ""There will be a lot of domains where automated search and computation actually can accelerate progress — scientific progress, engineering progress,"" he said. ""All these things I think are going to be important for advancing what we as people can do over the next five, 10, 15, 20 years,"" he said.The debate around AGI is a major one in the field of AI. While many define AGI as a form of AI with human-like intelligence and learning abilities, others see it as the point where autonomous computer systems can outperform humans at most valuable work. The predictions for when AGI might be achieved also vary significantly, with some experts predicting it will happen in the next few years, while others believe it could be decades away.",Google's Jeff Dean says the term AGI has too many different definitions.

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet shares ‘one thing’ that companies can’t ignore in the AI era,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/accenture-ceo-julie-sweet-shares-one-thing-that-companies-cant-ignore-in-the-ai-era/articleshow/123614841.cms,"India’s Gaming Revolution: New Law Changes EVERYTHING

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet recently said that AI is no longer about experiments, but about showing measurable performance outcomes. Speaking during an episode of Fortune 500 : Titans and Disruptions of Industry, Julie Sweet told Fortune's Editor-in-Chief Alyson Shontell: “One word, reinvention. This isn't about using AI on top of what you do today. If you're not significantly changing the way you operate, then you're not reinventing, and you're not going to capture the value.” She said that companies that fail to reinvent their operations around AI risk losing their place.“As a CEO, you should not greenlight something that doesn't have a direct tie to your PnL or something measurable that you already measure,” Sweet said. She highlighted Accenture’s use of generative AI to cut idea-to-market timelines by 90%.During the interview, Julie Sweet emphasized that humility is an essential leadership trait in the AI era. “Humility is what allows you to be a learner. It helps you build great teams, and it allows you to see what you've done and how you led the company,” she said.She further rejected forecasts of large-scale Fortune 500 failures, such as Vinod Khosla’s prediction of mass corporate collapse in the 2030s. ""CEOs today are focused on making AI the biggest growth opportunity and not the thing that causes their demise,"" Julie Sweet said.Recently, Accenture CEO Julie Sweet shared advice that changed how she approached her career: when someone offers you a stretch role, never question it. The words, shared by former JPMorgan Chase CFO Dina Dublon, came back to Sweet at a pivotal moment in her journey. During an appearance at Fortune’s Titans and Disruptors of Industry podcast with Alyson Shontell recently, Sweet shared when her then-boss suggested she could one day lead Accenture, Sweet chose not to doubt herself. Instead, she recalled Dublon’s wisdom that “the person offering you a stretch role is as nervous or more nervous than you are” and simply said yes. That decision, she said, set her path to the top job.Sweet was then serving as Accenture’s general counsel and did not fit the traditional CEO mold. She was a lawyer, not a business leader, a woman in a company long led by men, and had not spent her entire career at Accenture. Still, her boss, then-CEO Pierre Nanterme, believed she had the potential to run the company.“At the end of the meeting, he closes his notebook and he pushes it aside, and he says to me, completely out of the blue… ‘I think you could run this place someday,’” Sweet recalled during the podcast.","Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said AI is no longer about experiments, but about showing measurable performance outcomes.

Why Mark Zuckerberg’s ‘billion-dollar’ AI Superintelligence Lab team may be facing high-profile exits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerbergs-billion-dollar-ai-superintelligence-lab-team-may-be-facing-high-profile-exits/articleshow/123614535.cms,"2 reasons why Meta AI’s team is facing exits



Why this can be a ‘problem’ for Mark Zuckerberg



India’s Gaming Revolution: New Law Changes EVERYTHING

Meta ’s Superintelligence Lab, which company CEO Mark Zuckerberg established after spending billions, has witnessed a series of high-profile departures. According to a report, these exits are due to multiple reasons, essentially raising questions about the company's ability to retain top-tier AI talent.A report by the Financial Times said that the ‘problem’ in the company was highlighted by an incident involving Shengjia Zhao, co-creator of OpenAI ’s ChatGPT. Zhao threatened to quit and return to his former employer just days after joining Meta.The report suggests that a handful of new AI staff have already decided to leave after brief tenures. Citing people familiar with the matter, it says that some new recruits feel frustrated by the company's bureaucracy and internal competition for resources, such as access to computing power, which they were promised.Meta, however, maintains that its new AI lab has “the greatest compute-per-researcher in the industry"".Another key point of friction has been the leadership style of Alexandr Wang , Scale AI co-founder and former CEO, who Zuckerberg hired after a $14.3 billion deal earlier this year. The report says that Wang lacks experience in managing teams within a sprawling tech giant.He and other former Scale employees have struggled to adapt to Meta’s unique way of working, such as not having direct revenue goals as they did at their startup, the report added.The incident points to a turbulent period for Zuckerberg, who is attempting one of the most dramatic reorganisations in Meta’s 20-year history. In the race to dominate AI, Zuckerberg is shifting away from his reliance on long-time lieutenants and betting on a new generation of recently hired executives, the report points out.These newcomers, including Zhao, Wang, and former GitHub chief Nat Friedman, are reportedly clashing with Meta’s established culture and bureaucracy as they try to assert their influence.The reorganisation has also led to a significant shake-up of Meta's senior leadership. Yann LeCun , Meta’s veteran Chief AI Scientist, remains in his role but now reports to Wang, signifying a shift in the AI hierarchy. Similarly, Ahmad Al-Dahle, who previously led Meta’s Llama and generative AI efforts, has not been named to a leadership position on any of the new teams.This reorganization has also cut Chris Cox, the Chief Product Officer, out of direct oversight of generative AI, an area that was previously under his purview.","New recruits feel frustrated by the company's bureaucracy and internal competition for resources, according to a report.

Mark Cuban’s advice: Learn AI, teach AI, monetize AI



Books and bots over garbage bags



Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has shared his views on teens are prioritising financial management. Cuban says that US teens are placing unprecedented importance on financial success and he feels that the shift is not only understandable but its full of opportunity. As per the data from John Burns Research and Consulting, shared by Blue Rose Research’s David Shor, 36% of American 12th graders in 2022 said money is “extremely important” to them—the highest percentage in over five decades. That’s a sharp rise from the 26% average seen through the early 2010s.The reasons behind the financial focus are clear: stagnant wages, increasing college costs, inflation and the and the constant stream of wealth-centric content on platforms like TikTok and YouTube. Many of the Gen Z teens have grown up watching their families navigate economic hardship and now face their own financial pressures.“Zoomers care more about making money than any generation in at least 50 years,” Shor posted on Bluesky. Cuban responded, “Doesn’t surprise me. Every kid has people around them making money posting videos. Beats a newspaper route!”In an interview with CNBC, Cuban mentioned what he would do if he were 16 today: learn how to write prompts for AI tools like ChatGPT, teach others how to use them, and offer those skills to local businesses. “Doesn’t matter if I’m 16,” he said. “I’d be teaching them as well.”Cuban believes prompt engineering—crafting effective inputs for AI tools—is a high-value skill that can generate serious income, even six figures, without a college degree.Reflecting on his own entrepreneurial beginnings selling garbage bags door-to-door at age 12, Cuban now urges teens to embrace digital tools. “Read books and learn how to use AI in every way, shape and form you can,” he posted on Bluesky. “It is a living library that gives you responses and can help no matter who you are or where you live.”Instead of selling physical products, Cuban says today’s youth can sell knowledge, skills, and content—often to a global audience.As Gen Z continues to redefine what it means to earn, Cuban’s message is clear: the internet and AI aren’t just tools—they’re gateways to financial independence , creativity, and a future where hustle meets innovation.",Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has shared his views on teens are prioritising financial management.

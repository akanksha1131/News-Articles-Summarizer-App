TCS cuts variable pay of senior staff for July-September quarter: What the company has to say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tcs-cuts-variable-pay-of-senior-staff-for-july-september-quarter-what-the-company-has-to-say/articleshow/115101764.cms,"How TCS pays variables to staff

What the company has to say

Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) has reduced variable pay for some employees in the July-September quarter, a report has said, adding that the cuts have hit even those who have complied with the company's work-from-office policy.Citing sources close to the matter, Moneycontrol reported that while some employees received only 20-40% of their quarterly variable pay, others received no variable pay at all. This marks a significant drop from the 70% payout in the previous quarter.In April 2024, TCS revised its attendance policy, mandating a minimum of 85% office attendance for employees to receive their full variable pay. Employees with lower attendance rates receive a reduced percentage of their variable pay, with those below 60% ineligible for the bonus.TCS links variable pay to office attendance as well as it also depends on the performance of individual business units. The report also said that the recent cuts reflect the challenging demand environment and economic uncertainties that have led to slower growth for major IT services companies in the second quarter.In Q2, India's largest IT services company reported a 5.5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms.“We expect the headwinds to stabilise in Q3 and return to growth in Q4,” the company told analysts in its post-earnings call last month.A TCS spokesperson clarified that junior-level employees received 100% of their quarterly variable allowance (QVA). However, for other grades, the QVA is based on their unit's business performance, consistent with the company's usual practice.“For Q2FY25 we have paid out 100% QVA to junior grades across the company. For all other grades, the QVA depends on their unit’s business performance. This is in line with our standard practice across quarters,” a TCS spokesperson was quoted as saying.","Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) has reduced variable pay for some employees in the July-September quarter.

Sources briefed on the conversation told Axios that while specific policy details weren't discussed, the Ukrainian president found the timing of the call encouraging and was not left feeling anxious about Trump's victory.Musk's presence on the high-level diplomatic call follows reports of his substantial campaign contribution of $119 million to Trump and speculation about a potential cabinet position in the upcoming administration.The SpaceX CEO was also present during Trump's call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, where it was revealed the two were having dinner together.Despite Trump's campaign promises to quickly broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, sources say the president-elect did not delve into specific plans during Wednesday's call. Zelenskyy later acknowledged in Budapest that while Trump desires a swift end to the conflict, they hadn't discussed detailed proposals.The relationship between Musk and Ukraine has been complex, with the tech entrepreneur previously drawing criticism for mocking Ukraine's requests for aid and proposing his own peace plan in 2022. However, his Starlink technology remains vital to Ukraine's war effort.The billionaire's involvement in high-level diplomacy comes as The Wall Street Journal revealed his regular communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin since late 2022. Trump has yet to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin since the election, though Putin has indicated he would accept a call from the president-elect.","Musk assured Zelenskyy that Ukraine would continue receiving support through his Starlink satellite network.

How Kingfisher and Phoenix work

Onix has launched two AI-powered products aimed at solving the data-related challenges that large tech companies are currently facing. These include data scarcity, privacy concerns and the complexities of AI implementation.The cloud-native IT company that provides services in data, cloud and AI solutions modernisation has unveiled Kingfisher , a synthetic data generator, and Phoenix, an AI-powered business intelligence framework. The latest solutions join its Birds product suite aimed at streamlining AI-powered business intelligence.During a conversation with journalists on the sidelines of Onix's inaugural Annual Day, company CEO Sanjay Singh along with CTO Niraj Kumar talked about tech companies' reliance on AI for growth has skyrocketed the demand for high-quality, compliant data.They noted that as organisations struggle to navigate the complexities of deploying and managing AI systems effectively, Onix's Kingfisher and Phoenix tackle these challenges, providing businesses with powerful tools to unlock the full potential of AI.“Kingfisher and Phoenix aren’t just products—they’re transformative solutions that enable enterprises to innovate at scale with absolute confidence in data privacy and efficiency,” said Singh, adding that the solutions provide privacy.As per Kumar, Kingfisher addresses the need for secure and privacy-compliant data by generating synthetic data that mirrors the characteristics of real data without compromising sensitive information. He explained that this AI-powered solution analyses production code and identifies edge cases to create comprehensive datasets that are statistically identical to real data, enabling risk-free development, testing, and AI/ML model training.After the synthetic data is created, Phoenix simplifies the process of extracting meaningful insights from data, and by leveraging AI-powered automation, Phoenix enables real-time, conversational data querying and delivers intuitive, explainable insights.When asked how Onix’s approach is different from other tech giants, Singh explained that the company differentiates itself in the industry by leveraging AI and data modernisation. He highlighted their unique approach to data migration and integration, focusing on building a contextual understanding of the data landscape to enable AI-driven solutions.As per Kumar, while Kingfisher solves scarcity issues while protecting sensitive information ethically, Phoenix simplifies AI deployment, enabling enterprises to harness powerful models without the usual complexities.When asked about bias and privacy about the generated synthetic data, Kumar told The Times of India Tech that “the notion of synthetic data generation is to take care of the ethical area.”“Otherwise what will happen? It will expose all real data to the users even though you have used it for training purposes. Hence, all the access privileges are defined, so we protect the data and implement all policies, privileges and roles, and the user groups accordingly,” he explained.For example, even if an AI chatbot is trained on data related to credit card numbers, when asked through LLM or natural language, it will only give users the answer if you have privileged access to it. Otherwise, it will say, “I'm not able to give because you don't have access to it”.","Onix has launched two AI-powered products aimed at solving the data-related challenges that large tech companies are currently facing.

Where do Apple, Microsoft stand

Musk’s net worth surged by $26.5 billion

Nvidia's stock soared to new heights, taking the chipmaker to a historic milestone. The US-based chipmaker’s company's market capitalisation surpassed $3.6 trillion, making it the first ever to achieve such a valuation. Reportedly, this surge comes soon after the market was fueled by the recent re-election of Donald Trump as the US President.As per news agency Reuters, Nvidia's shares rose 2.2% on Thursday (November 7), driven by expectations of potential policy changes that could favour the tech industry. The company's stock market value closed at $3.65 trillion, exceeding Apple 's previous record of $3.57 trillion set on October 21.The latest surge placed Nvidia ahead of other tech giants in terms of market capitalisation with Apple's market value standing at $3.44 trillion, while Microsoft trails at nearly $3.16 trillion at the time of writing. This is not the first time that Nvidia has overtaken both Apple and Microsoft, it recently surged ahead of the tech giants to become the most valued company.In June, Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company before it was overtaken by Microsoft and Apple. The tech trio's market capitalisations have been neck-and-neck for several months.This achievement essentially solidifies Nvidia's position as a dominant force in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence (AI) – beating tech giants like Google and other heavyweights working on the same technology.It is not just Nvidia that had its worth jump exponentially – Elon Musk's net worth also surged by $26.5 billion after Trump’s victory in the US elections. Musk, the world's richest person and who has been one of Trump's biggest supporters, reportedly donated around $130 million to Trump's campaign as well as supporting him on his social media platform X (earlier Twitter). Moreover, Musk's Tesla saw a 15% increase in its share price.","US-based chipmaker’s company's market capitalisation surpassed $3.6 trillion, making it the first ever to achieve such a valuation.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao claims that his “felon status” hasn’t discouraged people from doing business with him. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Zhao recounted how he initially went unrecognized in prison, but his reputation for wealth and expertise in crypto soon attracted attention.Zhao pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering charges in 2023. He was sentenced to prison in April, becoming the richest-ever US inmate. He served a four-month sentence at a minimum-security prison in California and was released earlier this year in September.Recalling inquiries from fellow inmates and prison guards, he said “Many of them asked me which coins they should buy”. He said that he would often tell others, ""I don’t have access to any information. I don’t even know what the market looks like.""When Zhao was still CEO, Binance invested $500 million in Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter, now known as X. Since then, the value of the social-media platform has declined. Commenting on the direction Musk has taken X, he said “I think after Elon took over, things have moved a lot faster at Twitter. There’s new features, change happens at a much faster pace. I’m not too concerned about the value of the investment going up or down. We’re very long-term investors.”","Zhao pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering charges in 2023. He was sentenced to prison in April, becoming the richest-ever US inmate.

For the first time in Indian television history, two influential power couples from the worlds of technology, business, and philanthropy will grace The Great Indian Kapil Show . This weekend’s much-anticipated episode will feature NR Narayana Murthy and Sudha Murty, the celebrated founders of Infosys and well-known philanthropists, alongside Zomato co-founder Deepinder Goyal and his wife, Mexican model Grecia Munoz (Gia Goyal). A recent teaser released by Netflix has already generated significant excitement, providing a glimpse into the candid, humorous, and heartwarming moments that await viewers. Hosted by comedian Kapil Sharma, the episode is set to showcase personal stories, cultural exchanges, and anecdotes from the lives of these remarkable personalities.In the teaser, NR Narayana Murthy, 78, reflects on his initial meeting with a young Sudha Murty, recalling the profound impact she had on him. Describing her as “a breath of fresh air,” Murthy shared his admiration for her intelligence, kindness, and dedication to social causes. Now married for 47 years, the couple has become one of India’s most respected duos, with Sudha Murty achieving acclaim as an author, Rajya Sabha member, and philanthropist.When Kapil Sharma humorously questioned whether their habits have grown similar over the years, Sudha Murty responded with her characteristic humor and honesty. “I became a workaholic like him and a stickler for time,” she shared, adding, “I cook so badly, but he never complains. Look at Murthy saab's weight — that's thanks to my cooking!” The playful exchange between the Murthys highlighted their mutual respect and understanding, as well as Sudha’s humility and humor about her culinary skills.The episode also introduces Deepinder Goyal, co-founder of Zomato, and his wife, Grecia Munoz, who he married earlier this year. Known for her vibrant personality and background in modeling, Grecia has embraced her role alongside Deepinder, even immersing herself in Zomato’s operations. During the show, Goyal shared an amusing story about how he and Grecia surprised Zomato customers by delivering orders themselves in Gurgaon. The reaction of customers, who were surprised and delighted by Grecia’s appearance at their doorsteps, quickly became the highlight of the conversation.“When Gia delivers the order, the customers can’t help but keep staring,” Goyal laughed, prompting a burst of laughter from the audience and Kapil Sharma. The couple’s chemistry and lighthearted attitude have made them popular among Zomato’s users and the public, with fans appreciating Grecia’s willingness to engage directly with Goyal’s business and her adaptation to Indian culture.This is not the first time Sudha Murty has appeared on Kapil Sharma’s platform. Last year, she joined The Kapil Sharma Show alongside filmmaker Guneet Monga and actress Raveena Tandon, where she shared personal anecdotes about her life and experiences. The audience was captivated by her wisdom and humility, as she recounted stories from her travels, including a memorable instance at an airport where she was labeled “cattle class” for wearing traditional attire. Sudha used humor to narrate her response, underscoring her pride in her cultural roots and her unshakeable confidence.In addition to her philanthropic and literary contributions, Sudha Murty’s previous appearance also revealed her admiration for Bollywood legends such as Shah Rukh Khan and Dilip Kumar, bridging the worlds of Indian cinema and literature.The teaser release has already stirred excitement among fans, who are eager to see the contrasting yet complementary dynamics of these two couples. While the Murthys are admired for their contributions to India’s technology and education sectors, Deepinder and Grecia have gained popularity as a young, modern couple who represent the global, interconnected nature of today’s India.Social media platforms have been abuzz with comments from viewers looking forward to the episode, with many expressing admiration for Sudha Murty’s humility and wit, and curiosity about Grecia’s adaptation to life in India.

Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency (ANIF), Baltasar Ebang Engonga , is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos allegedly involving him in intimate encounters with multiple individuals. Originally investigated for alleged fraud, Engonga now faces public backlash and intensified scrutiny over his professional conduct and personal life. This controversy has sparked widespread reaction on social media and raised questions regarding ethics, public responsibility, and potential health risks associated with his actions. As the scandal unfolds, government authorities have initiated an official investigation, underscoring the increasing call for accountability among public officials in Equatorial Guinea.The scandal began when investigators, initially looking into Engonga for suspected fraud, reportedly discovered over 400 videos on his computer depicting private interactions with various individuals. These encounters allegedly involved multiple partners, including his brother’s wife, a cousin, and a relative of the President. According to sources, the videos were filmed in locations such as Engonga’s office, hotels, and even restrooms, with all recorded interactions believed to be consensual.Once leaked, the videos rapidly circulated across social media, sparking outrage and debate among citizens. Public response to the videos has varied, with many questioning the ethical standards of a high-ranking public official engaging in such activities, while others raised concerns about the privacy breach that led to the leak. Posts across social platforms criticised the conduct of a figure responsible for financial investigations, with some users highlighting the discrepancy between his public role and personal actions.In response to the viral scandal, Equatorial Guinea’s Attorney General’s Office, led by Anatolio Nzang Nguema, launched an official investigation into the circumstances surrounding the video leak. According to a spokesperson, authorities are assessing whether Engonga’s actions may have posed health risks, which could result in additional charges if confirmed.“If proven, he could face charges for endangering public health,” the spokesperson commented, emphasising that the investigation will extend beyond the videos themselves to assess any potential impact on public health.This probe into health risks marks a significant expansion of the investigation, as the Attorney General’s office examines both the privacy concerns involved in the leak and the broader implications of Engonga’s behaviour on public welfare. The investigation is expected to review the conduct of government officials and enforce measures to maintain accountability.In a public statement, Vice President Teodoro Nguema took to X (formerly Twitter) to address the scandal, emphasising the need for accountability among public officials. Nguema noted that government offices must be strictly reserved for official duties, signalling disapproval of the misuse of government resources and office spaces for personal purposes.Nguema announced that the government would be implementing new, stricter policies to ensure that misconduct within the administration is met with serious disciplinary action. He further stated that officials found guilty of misusing their authority or resources could face termination or other consequences as deemed appropriate. This stance reflects a broader governmental shift towards enforcing ethical standards and reinforces the message that public officials will be held responsible for their actions, especially when it comes to misuse of office privileges.Engonga, a married man and father of six, holds a prominent position at ANIF, leading financial investigations and initiatives against corruption. However, his involvement in the leaked videos has placed his career and reputation under intense public scrutiny. The scandal has opened a wider debate on the expectations placed on public officials, with many citizens questioning whether private conduct should impact public responsibility and ethical standards.As public opinion continues to weigh in, some have called for Engonga’s resignation, while others argue that privacy should protect personal matters unless they directly impact professional duties. The case has ignited a conversation on the balance between privacy and public accountability, particularly when it comes to those in leadership roles within the government.","Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency, Baltasar Ebang Engonga, is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos.

Elon Musk's net worth surged by $26.5 billion after the victory of Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump in the US elections. Musk, the world's richest person, has been one of Trump's largest supporters. Reports suggest that Elon Musk donated around $130 million to Donald Trump's campaign as well as supporting him on his social media platform X (earlier Twitter).While Tesla CEO Elon Musk may not have planned it. But his support for Donald Trump has done wonders to his net worth. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , Musk's net worth grew to $290 billion post the US election results. Reason: the surge in his companies' stock price.Musk's Tesla saw a 15% increase in its share price which adds to Tesla's already impressive performance, with shares up 32% over the past year. Musk, a supporter of the president-elect, is expected to play a role in policy decisions, further boosting investor confidence in Tesla.Alongside Musk, the fortunes of the other nine individuals in the world’s top 10 richest list also saw a record daily surge as Donald Trump secured a second term as president.As per Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, the net worth of the world's wealthiest individuals surged by a record $63.5 billion, fueled by a post-election rally in US stocks. Apart from Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Oracle's Larry Ellison were also among the top gainers.This surge in wealth also extends to other tech billionaires, including crypto leaders Brian Armstrong of Coinbase and Changpeng Zhao of Binance. Armstrong’s net worth increased by 30% to $11 billion while Zhao’s Binance added $12.1 billion post the US election which boosted his net worth to $52.7 billion.The surge in wealth is also attributed to market optimism following the US election, with investors anticipating lower taxes and deregulation under the new administration.The S&P 500 also experienced its best post-election performance in history, jumping 2.5%, while the US dollar also strengthened.","Elon Musk's net worth surged by $26.5 billion after the victory of Donald Trump in the US elections.

French and Dutch authorities raided Netflix offices in Paris and Amsterdam on Tuesday, November 5, as part of an investigation into alleged tax fraud and concealed employment, according to French judicial sources.The searches, conducted by France's National Financial Prosecutor's Office (PNF) and corruption investigators, stem from a preliminary investigation opened in November 2022 into suspected "" laundering of aggravated tax fraud "" and ""concealed work in an organised gang.""The raids follow scrutiny of Netflix's tax declarations between 2019 and 2020, when the company's reported French revenue appeared inconsistent with its subscriber base of approximately 7 million users. According to French media outlet La Lettre, Netflix Services France paid just €981,000 ($1.06 million) in corporate taxes for 2019-2020.Netflix's declared turnover in France increased dramatically after 2020, rising from €47.1 million ($51.3 million) to €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) in 2022, suggesting the company may have previously used tax optimization strategies through its Dutch (Netherlands) subsidiary.The simultaneous searches at Netflix's European headquarters in Amsterdam were conducted through cooperation between French and Dutch authorities that has been ongoing for several months, officials said.This is not Netflix's first tax-related issue in Europe. In 2022, the streaming giant paid €55.8 million ($59.1 million) to settle a tax dispute with Italian authorities.Netflix, which opened its Paris office in 2020 and employs around 40 staff there, has not responded to requests for comment on the raids.

Netflix India , the streaming giant's local subsidiary, has reported a 49% increase in net profit to Rs 52 crore for the fiscal year ending March 2024. This growth was fueled by a 29% rise in gross revenue to Rs 2,845 crore, driven by a growing subscriber base and the successful launch of mobile-specific plans. Netflix India’s gross turnover rose 29% to Rs 2,845 crore from Rs 2,214 crore in FY23, boosted by a growing subscriber base, show its financial data sourced by business intelligence platform Tofler.During the company's recent earnings calls, global executives highlighted India as a key market for subscriber growth and revenue. During the third-quarter earnings call, Co-CEO Greg Peters said that markets like India exemplified Netflix’s decade-long investment in local creative communities, partnering with storytellers to help them deliver compelling narratives to audiences.During Netflix's second-quarter earnings call, the company highlighted India as the second-largest market globally for paid net subscriber additions in the June-ended quarter and third in revenue percentage growth.With an estimated 12 million subscribers, Netflix, according to Media Partners Asia, is said to be India's largest pure-play streaming service. The company's recent success can be attributed to its increased focus on local content.

Food delivery platforms Zomato and SoftBank-backed Swiggy have allegedly violated competition laws. India's antitrust watchdog, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), has reportedly discovered that Zomato and Swiggy engaged in practices that violate competition laws. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, documents have revealed that business practices of these popular food delivery platforms favour select restaurants listed on their platforms. The report cited some documents prepared by the CCI (which are not available to the public) to claim that Zomato offered lower commissions to restaurants that signed exclusivity agreements, while Swiggy guaranteed business growth to certain restaurants that listed exclusively on its platform. These practices are seen as anti-competitive and potentially harmful to smaller restaurants and consumers. The CCI's findings could lead to penalties and corrective measures for both Zomato and Swiggy.The investigation launched in 2022 reportedly started after a complaint by the National Restaurant Association of India. This complaint highlighted the impact on food outlets of the alleged anti-competitive practices of Swiggy and Zomato.While the CCI report remains confidential, its findings were shared with Zomato, Swiggy, and the National Restaurant Association of India, which filed the initial complaint.Zomato's shares fell 3% following the report. The CCI case is also listed as an “internal risk” in Swiggy's IPO prospectus, highlighting the potential for substantial penalties. The report also noted that Swiggy plans to launch a program similar to its discontinued "" Swiggy Exclusive "" (Swiggy Grow) in non-metropolitan cities, raising further concerns about potential anti-competitive practices.The CCI also reportedly found that Zomato imposed pricing and discount restrictions on restaurant partners, while Swiggy threatened to lower the rankings of restaurants that did not maintain price parity.The CCI is currently reviewing the investigation's findings and will make a final decision on any penalties or required changes to Zomato and Swiggy's business practices.","India's antitrust watchdog, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), has reportedly discovered that Zomato and Swiggy engaged in practices that violate competition laws.

Taiwan's semiconductor sector on edge

CHIPS Act future remains uncertain

China's semiconductor industry is gearing up for Donald Trump 's return to the White House by accelerating equipment purchases and exploring new talent recruitment strategies, according to industry experts and documents reviewed by Reuters.The aggressive preparation comes as Trump, who previously targeted Chinese tech giants Huawei and SMIC with trade restrictions, is expected to take an even tougher stance on China's chip ambitions in his second term. Industry experts told Reuters that Chinese firms are significantly better prepared this time, having learned crucial lessons from Trump's first presidency.Chinese manufacturers have particularly focused on acquiring lithography machines, with imports surging 35.44% to $7.9 billion in the first nine months of 2023, Chinese customs data reveals. The majority of these machines came from the Netherlands, valued at $7 billion, before new restrictions took effect.Companies have maximised equipment orders to hedge against future restrictions. Chinese chip maker Jinan Lujing Semiconductor Co's emphasis on self-reliance echoes a broader industry sentiment, noting that Trump's first term had already highlighted ""the necessity of localization.""""Chinese tech companies have progressively expanded their production capacities to mitigate future risks,"" Nori Chiou, investment director at Singapore-based White Oak Capital Partners, told Reuters.The Beijing Semiconductor Industry Association is advising companies to seize potential opportunities if global coordination on chip sanctions weakens under Trump. ""There could be benefits to China's semiconductor industry in terms of professional talents, multinational companies and foreign cooperation,"" said Zhu Jing, the association's deputy secretary-general, in a WeChat post.The situation has created ripples in Taiwan, where semiconductor giant TSMC faces uncertainty about its global operations. Despite growing concerns, Taiwan's leader William Lai Ching-te projected confidence on Wednesday, stating that ""the long-standing Taiwan-US partnership, based on shared values and interests, will continue to serve as a cornerstone of regional stability.""However, Trump's recent comments have stirred anxiety in Taiwan's chip sector. During an October appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Trump accused Taiwan of ""stealing"" the US chip industry, questioning the island's role in global semiconductor supply chains. His former national security adviser John Bolton notably warned that under a second Trump term, ""Taiwan is potentially toast.""Despite these tensions, TSMC has affirmed its commitment to its US investments. The world's largest contract chipmaker announced it would continue with its $65 billion investment plan for new factories in Arizona, regardless of Trump's election victory.TSMC has notified Chinese chip design companies that it will suspend production of their most advanced AI chips starting Monday, according to the Financial Times. The world's largest contract chipmaker will no longer manufacture AI chips at advanced process nodes of 7 nanometres or smaller for Chinese customers, with future supplies subject to Washington's approval.According to CNBC, despite Trump's campaign rhetoric against the CHIPS Act, policy experts believe the $53 billion semiconductor initiative will likely remain largely intact, though with possible modifications to fund allocation.While policy experts anticipate the CHIPS Act will survive Trump's return, the semiconductor industry's landscape remains in flux. As both Chinese and Taiwanese chip sectors brace for potential policy shifts, the $53 billion US semiconductor initiative stands as a critical factor in shaping the industry's global future, despite lingering uncertainty about Trump's trade policies.","China's semiconductor industry is gearing up for Donald Trump's return to the White House by accelerating equipment purchases.

Afghanistan: The Taliban banned TikTok in April 2022, citing its “misleading” influence on the country’s youth. The move aligns with Afghanistan’s restrictive cultural policies, where the government exercises strict control over media and content to enforce its societal norms.

Armenia and Azerbaijan: During periods of military tension, including recent border clashes, these two countries have temporarily blocked TikTok. Azerbaijan lifted its most recent ban in October 2023. The temporary bans reflect concerns that the app could be misused for spreading information or propaganda during conflicts.

Australia: TikTok has been banned on government devices in Australia since April 2023. However, the general public can still access and use the app, suggesting that Australia’s primary concern lies in protecting sensitive government data.

Austria, Denmark, and the European Union: Several European nations, including Austria and Denmark, as well as institutions within the European Union, have restricted TikTok on government-issued devices. European security agencies are concerned about the possibility of foreign access to user data, especially with China’s growing influence in technology.

India: India enacted a comprehensive ban on TikTok in 2020 after a deadly border clash with China. The government cited national security as the reason, marking one of the first full-scale bans on the app worldwide. Indian content creators, previously very active on TikTok, moved to other platforms such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels to maintain their audiences.

Indonesia: In October 2023, Indonesia banned TikTok’s “Shop” feature, citing violations of local e-commerce regulations. The country’s selective restriction is an example of how governments may choose to regulate specific functionalities of an app to align with local laws, rather than banning it outright.

Iran and Pakistan: Both countries have intermittently blocked TikTok, often citing social, moral, or ethical concerns. Iran has long restricted internet access to global platforms, including TikTok, as part of broader controls on content that conflicts with its government’s values.

United States: Congress and the U.S. military have barred TikTok from all government devices, and around half of U.S. states have adopted similar restrictions for state-owned devices. The primary concern in the U.S. is foreign access to personal data, as there are fears that the Chinese government could exploit user information for intelligence purposes.

Russia: Although TikTok is still accessible in Russia, users are mainly shown content generated within the country. This restriction reflects Russia’s increasing control over online information and its efforts to limit foreign influence on Russian users.

Other countries: Numerous other nations have enacted restrictions based on their unique concerns. For example, Jordan banned TikTok following civil unrest in December 2022, citing concerns over its use to spread misinformation. In Nepal, a ban was issued in November 2023, and Somalia has also blocked TikTok over concerns about its role in spreading propaganda and extremist content.

Why are countries restricting TikTok?

Canada has recently issued a directive to close TikTok’s offices in Toronto and Vancouver, citing increasing concerns over data privacy and potential foreign influence, specifically in relation to the app’s Chinese ownership. This action reflects a serious response to perceived risks associated with TikTok’s data collection and sharing practices, which have been scrutinised in Canada and internationally. The announcement, made by Canadian officials on Wednesday, underscores the government’s belief that TikTok poses a security threat due to the potential misuse of user data and the influence that foreign entities could exert through the platform.As more countries seek to protect their citizens’ information and limit potential foreign influence, TikTok’s operations and global reach may be further impacted, influencing both the app’s future growth and the broader conversation around data security and privacy on social media platforms.Canada’s move aligns with a growing international trend where countries are imposing bans, restrictions, or partial limitations on TikTok, typically because of privacy concerns, national security, or ethical reasons. Here’s a detailed overview of the actions taken by various countries:Across these regions, governments share common concerns around data privacy, national security, and the platform’s influence on social behaviour. Many governments worry that TikTok’s data-gathering techniques allow it to collect extensive personal information, which could be accessed by foreign entities. Additionally, with TikTok’s growing popularity, there’s a fear of the app being used to shape public opinion, especially in politically sensitive regions. For instance, during conflicts, TikTok could theoretically be leveraged to disseminate propaganda or influence public perception.","The Taliban banned TikTok in Afghanistan in April 2022, citing its ‘misleading’ influence on the country’s youth.

"Bengaluru traffic police to launch super-app for real-time traffic updates, reporting accidents",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bengaluru-traffic-police-to-launch-super-app-for-real-time-traffic-updates-reporting-accidents/articleshow/115082228.cms,"Representative Image

What Bengaluru police said about this app



“We want to integrate the Public Eye and other services into a single app. Even the traffic police will start using the app with added features to report road incidents. They (the agency) will make a digital map of the city that we can use to simulate projects such as road closures or changing one-ways without inconveniencing people. If the simulation shows better results, we want to implement those changes.”

“All work orders will be finalised by the end of this month and works will be completed by January,”

Bengaluru commuters may soon have a ""one-stop"" solution for all traffic updates. The Bengaluru Traffic Police is reportedly planning to launch the ASTraM (Actionable Intelligence for Sustainable Traffic Management) super-app within the next two months. This app will provide real-time traffic congestion updates and will even allow users to report accidents.The app aims to eliminate the need for relying on multiple navigation apps or social media for traffic information. According to a report by Deccan Herald, users will be able to report violations and accidents on this app by submitting images without revealing their personal information.However, this new app will be different from the existing ASTraM app, which is exclusively for traffic police to monitor and analyse traffic patterns. The upcoming public version is expected to cover the entire city, expanding from the current simulation model that covers 21 major traffic corridors.In a statement to Deccan Herald, the Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) M N Anucheth said the new ""one-stop"" super-app will offer several useful features for commuters, including real-time traffic congestion alerts within a 5-kilometre radius, the ability to report accidents and a convenient way to view and pay traffic fines.JCP Anucheth said:The traffic police will also hire eligible agencies to create microsimulation models of the city within the next three months. This will enable them to model individual vehicle movement to assess the traffic, down to a street level, to manage it better.The Bengaluru Traffic Police's super-app is part of a broader initiative to improve traffic management in the city. This initiative includes various projects, such as procuring new signboards, solar blinkers, body-worn cameras, and cat's eyes to enhance road safety. Tenders for these projects were released in October, and work is currently underway, JCP Anucheth noted.he added.",Bengaluru Traffic Police is reportedly planning to launch the ASTraM super-app within the next two months.

Intel to cut 15,000 jobs

Intel is reintroducing free coffee for employees in an effort to boost morale and foster a more positive workplace atmosphere. According to The Oregonian report, the chipmaker informed its employees last week that it will bring back free coffee and tea at its work sites. The company eliminated free coffee and tea last summer as it sought to slash $10 billion from its annual budget.In an internal messaging forum Circuity, Intel wrote “Although Intel still faces cost challenges, we understand that small comforts play a significant role in our daily routines.”“We know this is a small step, but we hope it is a meaningful one in supporting our workplace culture.”At an all-company meeting last week, Intel’s chief people officer, Christy Pambianchi informed employees that the company had been spending $100 million each year on free and discounted food and drinks, a cost it could no longer sustain. “Until we get into a better financial health position, we need to be suspending those,” Pambianchi said, according to an account of the meeting reviewed by The Oregonian.

Paint gets a generative AI boost

Notepad gets AI for rewriting

Microsoft is bringing artificial intelligence (AI) prowess to nearly 40-year-old products: Paint and Notepad. The company has announced new AI experiences for Paint and Notepad to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels on Windows 11, aimed at enhancing creativity and productivity.Paint is receiving two major AI-powered additions: Generative Fill and Generative EraseGenerative Fill will allow users to add or modify elements within an image simply by describing what they want using text prompts. By selecting an area and providing a description, users can generate new content that blends with the existing image style.For example, users can ask the AI to make a mediaeval castle in the selected area of Windows XP wallpaper, and it will create one. This feature is initially available on Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs.Generative Erase will enable users to remove unwanted objects from an image. By selecting the object to be erased, the AI intelligently fills in the surrounding area, making it look like the object was never there. This feature is available to all Windows 11 users.In addition to these new features, Microsoft is also improving the performance and expanding the availability of existing AI capabilities in Paint, such as Cocreator and Image Creator.Notepad, the simple text editor, is also getting a significant AI upgrade. The Rewrite feature will allow users to rephrase sentences, adjust the tone and even modify the length of their text using AI. By selecting the text they want to rewrite, users can generate multiple variations and choose the one that best suits their needs. This feature is available in preview to all Windows 11 users in select regions.“We have also continued to improve Notepad launch performance. With this update, most users will see app launch time improve by more than 35%, with some users seeing improvements of 55% or more,” the company said.","Paint is receiving two major AI-powered additions: Generative Fill and Generative Erase.

Roblox , the popular online gaming platform that has faced scrutiny over allegations of misleading investors and concerns about children's exposure to inappropriate content, is implementing changes to address these issues.In a post on Roblox developers forum, the company has announced that it is “updating experience guideline policies to keep our younger users safe.” A report by Hindenburg Research in October highlighted the presence of sexually explicit content within the platform, raising concerns about child safety.Roblox has denied the charges.Roblox said that it is bringing two changes on the platform: Unrated experiences non-accessible and restricting access to social hangouts to users under 13.By default, users under the age of 13 will not be able to play, search, and discover unrated experiences. This will ensure that parents and users have more clarity into the types of content available on Roblox and will help them make more informed choices about what they want to play.We will be restricting access to Social Hangouts and Free-form User Creation experiences to users ages 13+.This means that starting December 3, Roblox will require creators to complete a questionnaire for each experience they wish to make available to users under 13. This questionnaire will help ensure that all experiences accessible to young users are age-appropriate and meet Roblox's community standards.As a result of this change, any unrated experiences will be hidden from search results and recommendations for users under 13. These users will still be able to access these experiences via direct link, but they will no longer be easily discoverable.The second big change is restricting social hangouts and free-form user creation for users under 13. Starting November 18, experiences featuring social hangouts and free-form 2D user creation will only be available to users 13 and older.This restriction applies to experiences where the primary purpose is socialising and communicating with other users, such as “vibe games” and virtual clubs.","Roblox is bringing two changes on the platform: Unrated experiences non- accessible and restricting access to social hangouts to users under 13.

Nissan CEO: We cannot deny ...

Japan's third-largest auto company Nissan Motor Corp. has announced a drastic overhaul of its global operations, aiming to regain lost ground in the rapidly evolving electric and hybrid vehicle markets. The Japanese automaker will eliminate 9,000 jobs and reduce production capacity by 20%. CEO Makoto Uchida will also take a 50% pay cut.The restructuring cost-cutting measures come after Nissan's net income plummeted 94% in the first half. Nissan will also sell off some of its stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp after burning through ¥448.3 billion ($2.9 billion) in cash during the last six months. The company's operating income is down 70% from its previous forecast. Management also lowered their revenue outlook by more than 9%, meaning they now expect virtually no growth for the year.Nissan President and CEO Makoto Uchida said: “These turnaround measures do not imply that the company is shrinking. Nissan will restructure its business to become leaner and more resilient, while also reorganizing management to respond quickly and flexibly to changes in the business environment. We aim to enhance the competitiveness of our products, which are fundamental to our success, and set Nissan back on a path of growth. As a cohesive team, we are dedicated to working together to ensure the successful implementation of our plans.”The CEO reportedly told investors that Nissan has been affected “not only by external challenges, but also by our specific issues,” alluding both to the breakneck rise of Chinese automakers and Nissan setting overly ambitious sales targets.Like many traditional automakers, Nissan has struggled to adapt to shifting consumer preferences. In China, domestic brands like BYD have capitalized on the surge in EV demand, while in the U.S., hybrid vehicles are gaining popularity, favoring competitors like Toyota.Uchida acknowledged the company's missteps, stating, ""We cannot deny that our sales plan was overstretched."" To address these challenges, Nissan will invest in its EV lineup in China and expand its hybrid offerings in the U.S. The company also plans to leverage partnerships, such as its recent tie-up with Honda, to streamline production and reduce costs.With these aggressive measures, Nissan aims to secure a more competitive position in the global automotive market.

4 Big reasons Indian IT sector is 'happy' with Donald Trump's return despite likely tougher H-1B visa and immigration laws,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/4-big-reasons-indian-it-sector-is-happy-with-donald-trumps-return-despite-tougher-h-1b-visa-and-immigration-laws/articleshow/115063633.cms,"So what is it that is pepping up the mood in favour of Indian IT companies?

Here are four likely factors



* Strong dollar:

* Stability in policymaking:

* Better tax policies for corporations:

* Alternative to China:

India's information technology (IT) sector is upbeat about President Donald Trump’s return to the Oval Office. The mood is high despite concerns over potential changes to US immigration laws. Immigration experts and analysts have warned that Trump may go stricter on H-1B and other immigration laws during his second tenure as the US President.Donald Trump's previous term saw an increase in salaries for H1B workers as well as visa fee. In this term, the Trump administration may reconsider the annual allotment of H1B work visas, currently capped at 85,000. H1B applications could face tougher scrutiny, as denial rates under the previous Trump administration reached an all-time high of 24%. The duration and eligibility for Optional Practical Training (OPT) for international students may also come under review.Despite these concerns, India’s IT companies celebrated the Republican victory as tech stocks led the rally on India’s benchmark stock indices. IT stocks appreciated sharply, fueling a rally in the benchmark indices after it became clear that Donald Trump will take over as the next US president for the second term. Shares of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) surged 4.21 per cent, Infosys jumped 4.02 per cent, Tech Mahindra soared 3.85 per cent, and HCL Technologies climbed 3.71 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Also, Persistent Systems zoomed 5.86 per cent, LTIMindtree jumped 4.75 percent, and Wipro advanced 3.75 per cent.IT companies expect easier finance policies around interest rates, inflation etc., which may help loosen IT budgets of US companies. A stronger dollar benefits the Indian outsourcing industry, as a majority of the IT services companies cater to the US as a key business market. Thereby, the industry derives a large part of their revenue in US currency though their operational costs are in Indian rupees.With Republicans controlling the government, Senate, and Congress, there is likely to be stability in policy making.Donald Trump's proposal to cut the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% is likely to ease budgetary pressures and expand discretionary tech spending by US companies and thus benefiting Indian startups registered in the US as well as technology companies.Donald Trump's tough stance towards China means increased US fund flow to India. Trump is expected to play hardball with China, as seen during his last tenure. This will benefit Indian IT companies from a higher degree of fund flow. Advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductors may see more of US investments.World's richest man Elon Musk's net worth also increased significantly after the Republican candidate and former US president Donald Trump won the elections. Musk has been a vocal supporter of Trump and his wealth surged due to a rise in his companies' share prices following the election results.",India's information technology (IT) sector is upbeat about President Donald Trump’s return to the Oval Office.

The platform’s unique features include UPI Lite and Mobile Number Mapper, which allow elders to make transactions without sharing personal bank details or primary phone numbers, addressing their privacy concerns.Nalin Bansal, Chief of Fintechs and New Initiatives at NPCI, praised the initiative, calling it a step toward broader financial inclusion, while Sanjeev Moghe of Axis Bank highlighted the secure, reliable infrastructure underpinning GenWise’s UPI solution.

"UPI, RBI rules ...: Why Banks are shutting down ATMs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/upi-rbi-rules-why-banks-are-shutting-down-atms/articleshow/115062037.cms,"RBI mandate for ATMs

Despite a record-high cash circulation, India's banks are reportedly increasingly phasing out ATMs and cash recyclers. According to a report in Economic Times, this shift is driven by the growing popularity of digital payments, particularly UPI, and a strategic focus on digital transformation.According to RBI data, the number of ATMs in India decreased from 219,000 in September 2023 to 215,000 in September 2024. This decline is primarily due to a significant reduction in off-site ATMs, which fell from a peak of 97,072 in September 2022 to 87,638 in September 2024.Ravi B Goyal, chairman of AGS Transact Technologies, told the publication, ""The recent trends in ATM deployment reflect a shifting focus in India's banking sector as it navigates the dynamic landscape of consolidation, digital transformation and expansion into underserved regions."" He added, ""In recent years, public sector bank consolidation has led to more optimised networks, blending physical and digital infrastructure.""While cash still plays a significant role in India's economy, accounting for 89% of transactions in FY22 and 12% of GDP, ATM penetration remains low with only 15 ATMs per 100,000 people. Factors such as RBI regulations on free ATM transactions, interoperability, and interchange fees have further discouraged ATM investments.Industry experts predict that India will adopt a global model of two ATMs per branch, one on-site and one off-site, as banks continue to balance physical and digital infrastructure to meet the evolving needs of their customers.","India's banks are reportedly phasing out ATMs and cash recyclers.

Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has imposed a significant fine of €310 million on LinkedIn, the social networking platform for professionals, over violations of European data privacy regulations. The investigation focused on how LinkedIn processed users' personal data for targeted advertising and behavioural analysis, specifically regarding the lawfulness, transparency, and fairness of these practices under EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).This substantial fine underscores the EU's commitment to strict data protection standards and highlights ongoing scrutiny of digital platforms that handle large volumes of user data. The ruling, issued after a comprehensive inquiry, includes additional orders for LinkedIn to adjust its data processing practices to comply with GDPR requirements.The DPC, acting as the lead supervisory authority for LinkedIn within the EU, launched the investigation following a complaint from the French Data Protection Authority. As per reports, the inquiry examined LinkedIn's use of personal data for two primary purposes: behavioural analysis and targeted advertising. These practices, involving data from users who created profiles on LinkedIn, raised questions about the transparency and consent surrounding LinkedIn’s data handling.The complaint initiated a broader investigation by the DPC, which assessed whether LinkedIn’s approach to data processing aligned with GDPR’s stringent standards on user consent and data usage. According to GDPR regulations, personal data processing must adhere to strict rules ensuring that user consent is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.The DPC’s decision, issued on October 22, was jointly signed by Data Protection Commissioners Dr. Des Hogan and Dale Sunderland. It concluded that LinkedIn’s data processing practices were not fully compliant with GDPR’s legal framework, particularly in terms of transparency and obtaining adequate user consent. The investigation found that LinkedIn's consent mechanism did not meet GDPR standards, as the consent obtained was neither “freely given” nor sufficiently informed, specific, or unambiguous.The DPC ruling includes several mandates:The decision, after its issuance in Ireland, was submitted to the European GDPR Cooperation Mechanism in July under Article 60 of GDPR, which allows other EU supervisory authorities to review and object to decisions. However, the DPC confirmed that no objections were raised by other EU/EEA supervisory bodies, indicating broad support for the ruling across the European regulatory landscape.Following the decision, Graham Doyle, Deputy Commissioner of the DPC, commented on the importance of maintaining lawful processing standards under GDPR. He emphasised that data processing without a proper legal basis violates a data subject’s fundamental rights to data protection and privacy, noting that such breaches are taken seriously under EU law.The DPC released a statement acknowledging the cooperation of peer supervisory authorities in other EU countries, underscoring the collective commitment to enforce GDPR standards.A spokesperson for LinkedIn responded to the DPC’s decision, noting, “Today, the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) reached a final decision on claims from 2018 about some of our digital advertising efforts in the EU. While we believe we have been in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we are working to ensure our ad practices meet this decision by the IDPC’s deadline.” LinkedIn expressed its intent to adapt its practices to comply with the DPC’s findings, though it maintains that it had previously attempted to align with GDPR standards.Under GDPR, companies operating within the EU are required to adhere to stringent consent requirements when processing user data. Consent must be:The DPC found LinkedIn’s consent mechanisms lacking in these aspects, which led to the substantial fine and compliance orders. The ruling highlights that companies must ensure users are fully informed and willingly provide consent before their data is used for targeted advertising or behavioural analysis.This decision against LinkedIn serves as a reminder to digital platforms about the EU’s rigorous approach to data protection. With the hefty fine and compliance orders, LinkedIn and other tech companies face increased pressure to prioritise transparent and legally compliant data practices. The case also underscores the EU’s commitment to protecting data privacy, with the DPC actively investigating and penalising companies that fail to comply with GDPR.For LinkedIn, compliance with the DPC’s orders may necessitate substantial changes to its advertising and data analysis practices in the EU. The ruling may also impact LinkedIn’s overall approach to user data worldwide, as the company adapts its processes to avoid similar issues in other regions.","Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has imposed a significant fine of €310 million on LinkedIn, the social networking platform for professionals.

TIME Magazine has named CEO of Google-owned YouTube as 2025 CEO of the year. Mohan took charge as YouTube CEO in 2023 after his mentor Susan Wojcicki stepped down. Since then, the social platform has increased its dominance of the attention economy against considerable competition, TIME writes.“He’s quiet-spoken, deliberative, hard to ruffle. He likes watching sports, going to his daughters’ dance recitals, and open white shirts, just normal stuff. His favorite candy is the not-very-exciting Butterfinger. If you ask him to be in your YouTube video, he’ll probably do it. He won’t be great in it, but neither will he be horrible,” reads Mohan’s TIME profile.“YouTube today is like a metropolis with lots of interconnected dependencies, and what you do on one street impacts what happens on another street,” says Mohan. “In the early days, it was much more like a village, where lots of the creators knew each other. And I think that if you’re the leader of one vs. the other, you’re forced to think about decisions in maybe a different way.”Mohan is a graduate in electric engineering from Stanford University. He joined Google in 2008. Born in Indiana, US, the executive spent much of his childhood there before relocating to Lucknow with his family in 1985, aged 12.He became YouTube's Chief Product Officer in 2015. He had played pivotal roles in the launch of some of biggest products, including YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium and Shorts.Mohan has also worked with Microsoft and sits on the board of Stitch Fix and genomics and biotechnology company 23andMe. He previously spent nearly six years at DoubleClick, a company Google acquired in 2007, and later served for about eight years as senior vice president of display and video advertising at Google.","Neal Mohan took charge as YouTube CEO in 2023 after his mentor Susan Wojcicki stepped down.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said he cannot imagine raising his newborn son without the help of ChatGPT.Altman made his first appearance on NBC’s “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” where he spoke about how often he turns to the AI chatbot whenever he needs parental advice: “I cannot imagine having gone through, figuring out how to raise a newborn without ChatGPT,” he told Fallon. “Clearly, people did it for a long time, no problem.”He joked that he sometimes feels “kind of bad” putting simple parenting questions to a system designed to handle complex knowledge tasks, such as “Why does my kid stop dropping pizza on the floor and laughing?” But he added that the reassurance it provides has been invaluable.Altman recalled a moment at a party when another parent said their six-month-old was “crawling everywhere.”He was concerned that his own son was not yet doing the same. He excused himself and typed into ChatGPT: “Do I need to take my kid to the doctor tomorrow morning? Is this okay?” Altman said the chatbot replied “with a great answer” explaining his child’s progress was “normal.”“It is personalised, like ChatGPT gets to know you, and by the way, you are the CEO of OpenAI, you probably are around all these high-achieving people, maybe you do not want to project that onto your kid, and you should just relax,” he said, describing the coded response.Last week, Altman reportedly issued a “code red” internally, urging staff to refocus on ChatGPT as rivals such as Google accelerate their own AI efforts.Altman has previously said parenthood has shifted his perspective on technology. In January, he told a podcast: “My kid is never going to grow up being smarter than AI. Children in the future will only know a world with AI in it,"" according to Business Insider.Altman and his husband, Oliver Mulherin, welcomed their son in February.

One of America's largest car company Ford joins hands with Renault to solve its 'China problem' as CEO Jim Farley says: In a fight for our lives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/one-of-americas-largest-car-company-ford-joins-hands-with-renault-to-solve-its-china-problem-as-ceo-jim-farley-says-in-a-fight-for-our-lives/articleshow/125876456.cms,"Partnering to reboot Europe business

Why not get US model to Europe





America's second-largest car company Ford has a 'China Problem' in Europe. And the problem is reportedly so big that CEO Jim Farley recently told journalists in Paris, ""We know we’re in a fight for our lives in our industry, and no better example than here in Europe.” Ford CEO Farley made the comments as the company seeks to reboot its European business faced with upheaval being caused by Chinese automakers outside the US. Competition has been quite fierce in Europe among auto companies as Chinese companies led by SAIC Motor and BYD have burst onto the scene with low-cost technology. The market share of Chinese producers jumped collectively to around 6.7% of the European market in the third quarter, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.According to a report in Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Ford is now turning to French peer Renault to help reboot its European business. Renault will reportedly make two small electric vehicles for the pioneer of car production, the companies said. The partners are also said to be exploring how they might work together on vans, which form the core of Ford’s European business. The first of the next-generation EVs -- to be designed by Ford, co-developed by both companies on a Renault technology platform -- will reach European dealerships in 2028.The EVs will be built by Renault in northern France.Partnering with Renault marks a fresh start for Ford in Europe after years of downsizing and restructuring. In 2024, Ford said it would cut 4,000 roles, centered in Germany. In September, it announced a further 1,000 job losses. “We’ve been through many restructurings, and a lot of hard work. GM left. We decided to stay,” said Farley in summation of the company’s recent history in Europe. General Motors sold its European business in 2017.“As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry,” said Farley in a statement. “How we compete here — how we innovate, partner, and invest — will write the playbook for the next generation. We are committed to a vibrant future in Europe, but that future requires us to move with greater speed and efficiency than ever before.”As to why Renault, Ford CEO admitted that the company has been working on its own EV platform in the U.S. as part of its so-called skunk works project. But that platform would be too big and expensive to work in Europe, “Frankly, Renault is more competitive,” he said.Incidentally, Ford has a mixed record of forming partnerships in Europe. Its existing loss-making Explorer and Capri EVs are built in Ford’s factory in Cologne, Germany, using Volkswagen’s EV technology. As for Ford and Renault buying stakes in each other? Ford CEO Farley is quoted by WSJ, ""Ford is a wildly independent company.”","Ford is reportedly turning to French peer Renault to help reboot its European business.

Wells Fargo staff reduction in recent years







Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf has said that the US banking giant expects to reduce its workforce next year and expects higher severance expenses in the current fourth quarter. He added that artificial intelligence (AI) is set to redefine wok. Speaking on the sidelines of a Goldman Sachs financial services conference, Scharf stated that even before accounting for new technology, the bank expects to have fewer employees in the upcoming year.“We have gone through the budgeting process, and even pre-artificial intelligence, we do expect to have less people as we go into next year. We'll likely have more severance in the fourth quarter,” Scharf said on the sidelines of a Goldman Sachs financial services conference, as per news agency ReutersScharf noted that Wells Fargo plans to roll out AI gradually over the next year and beyond as part of its efficiency drive. He also emphasised that AI won’t entirely replace humans but it is expected to lead to some workforce reductions. Scharf described the shift as a “positive reality” for the bank.The CEO noted that the bank is not yet as efficient as it will be once AI is fully integrated. While providing an example of current AI impact, Schraf said that Gen AI tools have already made the bank’s engineering workforce 30% to 35% more efficient in terms of writing code.The bank has already witnessed a reduction in staff – from 275,000 employees when Scharf joined in 2019 to just over 210,000 employees as of September 30, 2025, according to Reuters.While discussing the bank's future growth, Scharf stated that Wells Fargo is under no pressure to pursue acquisitions. He said the bank will only pursue acquisitions that offer strong financial returns and clear strategic value for investors, stating, “We have no interest in doing something which could just add a little bit of earnings to the company”.",Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf has said that the US banking giant expects to reduce its workforce next year and expects higher severance expenses in the current fourth quarter.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment. The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.",AI startup OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US.

John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees.

Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate jobs in the long run. Speaking in an interview with Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures, Dimon urged workers to focus on human skills such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence and communication to stay relevant in the future workforce. He said individuals should build skills that machines cannot easily copy. These include problem-solving, emotional understanding, creativity, and clear communication.Jamie Dimon said that while companies have been cautious about hiring in recent months, this slowdown is not being driven by AI. He also said he does not expect the technology to cause large job losses in the immediate future.“For the most part, AI is going to do great stuff for mankind, like tractors did, like fertilizers did, like vaccines did,” Dimon said during the interview. “You know, maybe one day we’ll be working less hard but having wonderful lives.”At the same time, Dimon stressed that AI will eventually replace some jobs and that people must prepare for this shift. Notably, this is not the first time Dimon has warned about AI eliminating jobs. He has previously warned that automation will change the nature of work. In November 2025, Dimon said AI could help people in developed countries move toward a much shorter workweek of around three-and-a-half days over the next 20 to 40 years.Dimon also said that AI must be regulated properly to limit its risks, just as earlier technologies were brought under rules to protect society. He said both governments and companies have a shared responsibility to manage the impact of AI on workers.“We—government and we the companies, society—should look at how do we phase it in a way that we don’t damage a lot of people,” he said. He pointed to past examples where factory closures hurt entire towns and said better support could have reduced the damage. “You can retrain people, relocate people, income assistance, early retirement,” he added.While warning about future job losses, Dimon also said AI is already creating new jobs in the short term. He said the growth of AI requires large investments in infrastructure, including construction work and fibre-optic networks, which will generate employment.","Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence will eliminate jobs in the long run.

YouTube gives four reasons with social media ban in Australia is ‘less safe’ for kids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/youtube-gives-four-reasons-with-social-media-ban-in-australia-is-less-safe-for-kids/articleshow/125873263.cms,"4 reasons age bans are detrimental, according to YouTube



Poorly designed regulations make kids less safe:

Regulation fails to reflect platform differences:

Creative expression is worth preserving:

Evidence-based regulation is better:





As social media ban for under-16 in Australia is set to take effect on December 10, Google’s YouTube has voiced strong opposition to legislation, asserting that such blanket bans are likely to be “counterproductive” and ultimately make children less safe online. The platform’s stance comes as governments worldwide consider regulations to balance online safety with young people’s access to educational and creative material.“Last week we shared an update on what YouTube will look like for users and creators in Australia as a result of the new law. As other governments around the world consider how to tackle the very real challenge of helping young people stay safe online while also helping them access positive material, it's clear that blanket account bans will have extremely negative consequences,” YouTube said.YouTube outlined four specific reasons why this regulatory approach is flawed:YouTube argues that blanket bans remove choices from parents and force children out of curated, supervised spaces like YouTube Kids or supervised tween and teen accounts. According to the company, kids may resort to using adult accounts or browsing anonymously, often accessing less safe services.YouTube argues that applying blanket bans misunderstands the platform’s function, which is primarily a streaming service for learning, entertainment, news and sports highlights. YouTube noted that 94% of teachers globally use YouTube for educational content. Making it harder to promote educational content is counterproductive.The platform emphasised that YouTube offers young people digital skills, connection and opportunities for creative and political expression. The platform noted that some of the world’s biggest artists, including Justin Bieber and Dua Lipa, began their careers on YouTube as teenagers.YouTube also noted that a comprehensive approach that requires industry-wide standards for parental controls, limits access to specific risky features, mandates privacy-preserving age-estimation tools and bans personalised advertising to minors.",Social media ban for under-16 in Australia is set to take effect on December 10.

Spotify’s video catalogue







Spotify has announced that it is making music videos available to premium subscribers in the US and Canada. The expansion positions the Swedish streaming giant to directly challenge YouTube in the music video space. According to the company, video content offers a more immersive and engaging experience than audio alone, a factor that could help attract more users and advertisers. However, there will be a limited catalogue of music videos.Music videos will be available to all premium subscribers in the US and Canada by the end of the month. The launch follows a beta test conducted in nearly 100 markets last year and is intended to enhance Spotify's competitive position against music streaming offerings from rivals like Apple and Amazon.Spotify's initial video catalog will feature content from artists including Ariana Grande, Olivia Dean, BABYMONSTER, and Addison Rae. The company stated that fan engagement is boosted by the feature: “We've seen that when fans discover a track with a music video on Spotify, they're 34% more likely to stream it again and 24% more likely to save or share it in the following week.”Recently, CFO Christian Luiga highlighted the importance of this metric, noting that “Engagement is a very important part for sort of our measurement...sometimes, it could be an even more important than the number of users”.Meanwhile, the company recently launched Wrapped – its year-end roundup, which gained over 200 million engaged users within roughly 24 hours, marking a 19% increase from the previous year.The video expansion comes as Spotify looks to drive earnings growth through pricing adjustments. The company has already raised the cost of its premium individual plan in more than 150 markets during the September quarter.

What Europe’s antitrust chief has to say and Google’s response





The European Commission has launched an antitrust investigation into Google 's use of publishers' online content and YouTube videos to train its Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. The competition enforcer in the European Union (EU) expressed concern that Google may be abusing its dominant position as a search engine. EU investigation into Google focuses on two main areas:The regulator is concerned that Google is using publishers' online content to generate AI-powered summaries for AI Overviews, without compensating publishers adequately or giving them the option to refuse.The Commission holds the same concerns regarding Google's use of YouTube videos uploaded by its users for training its AI models.EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera stated, “A healthy information ecosystem depends on publishers having the resources to produce quality content. We will not allow gatekeepers to dictate those choices.”Meanwhile, Google has rejected the complaint, which was initially triggered by independent publishers in July.A spokesperson for Google defended the company's actions, stating, “This complaint risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever,” and added that the company will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries.However, industry groups, including the Independent Publishers Alliance and the Movement for an Open Web, criticised Google.Notably, this is the second EU investigation launched against Google in less than a month and underscores the growing unease in Europe over Big Tech's dominance in emerging technologies. The company is already facing regulatory scrutiny over its spam policy and risks a fine of as much as 10% of its global annual revenue if found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules.","The European Commission has launched an antitrust investigation into Google's use of publishers' online content and YouTube videos to train its Artificial Intelligence (AI) models.

""sector reset""

“The pendulum has already swung once from skepticism to exuberance. Whether the correction comes in three months or six months or next week, I do not know, but it will come.”

Blinkit CEO on company's growth strategy in the coming days

""We will not chase growth for the sake of growth. We will not do anything that is not in the long term interests of the business,""

“Usually, when this kind of imbalance exists, the correction is very swift. It often catches people by surprise,”





Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa has given a hint at how the quick commerce space in India is going to change in the coming days. In a recent interview, the chief executive of the Zomato-owned Blinkit, which is the largest quick commerce service in India, hinted that major changes to user experience and discounting strategies are on the cards for the company. Dhindsa indicated that the quick commerce sector is rapidly reaching a shakeout as competitors face dwindling capital, and said Blinkit will not just survive but prosper and continue expanding.He also said the current model of the industry, heavily reliant on continuous fundraising, has reached a limit that is forcing companies to address steep operating losses and high costs related to supply chain complexity. Dhindsa foresees athat will be characterized by consolidation, more focused category selection, and changes in discounting models.Dhindsa, in an interview to Bloomberg, said,Regular online shopping and super-fast delivery will be more similar in the days to come, says Dhindsa. Blinkit already works with thousands of outside sellers and sells all kinds of things, everything from fridges to more than 6,000 different books.He said the company would sell new types of products only if they can solve problems like returns or getting the right size for clothes and if they can truly succeed in those areas.Blinkit intends to continue investing as usage from smaller cities grows. Small towns house a significant percentage of India's population. However, in rural areas, the firm requires more efficient supply mechanisms and also small warehouses, better known as dark stores, placed at strategically correct locations for the service to be effective. He said the real problem isn't that people don't want the service - it's that the basic systems aren't ready yet.Blinkit is working to build these systems with local business owners who collect and supply fruits and vegetables. This also creates jobs, such as those dealing with warehouse work, and helps bring workers back to their home areas.But the challenges and opportunities of this business are growing: India is the only major country where super-fast delivery is still growing rapidly, but companies are also spending a lot of money competing with each other.Dhindsa said Blinkit has learned from his past mistakes where offering big discounts brought in more customers but hurt the business financially.he noted.Global investors such as SoftBank, Temasek and Middle Eastern sovereign funds have invested billions into India's rapid delivery sector, making it a major test case for the business model.While similar ventures in the US, Europe and other Asian markets have failed, India benefits from dense cities, lower labour costs and widespread digital payments. But success still hangs on logistics efficiency and the pace of funding.Investors are still cautious despite growing capital needs. Swiggy is eyeing a $1.1 billion share sale roughly a year after its $1.3 billion initial public offering, while Zepto has raised $450 million as it readies an IPO as early as next year, the report said. These deals underscore the cash needed to keep the ultra-fast delivery model going.Dhindsa explained.Pricing for the Swiggy share sale, which is still near its IPO level, illustrates how investors are reassessing risks in a business that relied so much on easy funding. Potential correction may reshape India's consumer tech industry by showing whether demand for fast delivery is sustainable beyond discounts and which companies have offerings that people are willing to pay a premium for.","Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa has given a hint at how the quick commerce space in India is going to change in the coming days.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Export control violations involve fake companies and relabeled chips

Advanced AI chips have both civilian and military applications



Read US Attorney's Office, Southern District of Texas release on the case





US authorities have dismantled a sophisticated smuggling network that illegally exported advanced Nvidia artificial intelligence chips worth over $160 million to China and other restricted locations, resulting in the arrest of multiple business executives and guilty pleas from a Houston-based company.Operation Gatekeeper, announced Tuesday by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas, exposed a complex scheme involving falsified shipping documents, shell companies, and wire transfers originating from China. The investigation seized more than $50 million in advanced graphics processing units destined for prohibited destinations.Alan Hao Hsu, owner of Missouri City-based Hao Global LLC, pleaded guilty in October to smuggling export-controlled Nvidia H100 and H200 chips between October 2024 and May 2025. Court documents reveal Hsu and associates misclassified shipments and concealed their ultimate destinations to circumvent export restrictions. Hsu faces up to 10 years in federal prison at his February 18 sentencing.Federal prosecutors also arrested Fanyue Gong, a Chinese citizen living in New York, and Benlin Yuan, a Canadian citizen residing in Ontario. Both executives allegedly conspired with a Hong Kong logistics firm and a China-based AI company to evade chip controls.According to the charges, Gong's operation used straw purchasers to acquire GPUs while falsely claiming the chips were for US customers or unrestricted countries.Workers at US warehouses removed Nvidia labels and rebranded the chips under a fictitious company name ""SANDKYAN"" before mislabeling them as generic computer parts for export.Yuan, who serves as CEO of a US subsidiary of a Beijing-based IT company, allegedly recruited inspectors and instructed them to conceal Chinese destinations. He also developed cover stories to release detained shipments and provided false information to authorities.The H100 and H200 GPUs are high-speed processors designed for AI applications and scientific computing, capable of processing massive data volumes for generative AI and large language models. Their export to China is strictly prohibited due to potential military applications.Yuan faces up to 20 years for conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act, while Gong could receive 10 years for conspiracy to smuggle. The investigation involved the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the FBI.“Operation Gatekeeper” disrupts trafficking network and seizes more than $50 million in advanced GPUs destined for China and other restricted locationsHOUSTON – Two businessmen are now in custody for allegedly violating US export control laws, announced US Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei.As part of the overall investigation, a Houston company and its owner have also pleaded guilty to smuggling cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technology out of the United States.“Operation Gatekeeper has exposed a sophisticated smuggling network that threatens our Nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” said Ganjei. “These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control AI technology; the country that controls AI technology will control the future. The Southern District of Texas will aggressively prosecute anyone who attempts to compromise America’s technological edge.”“The United States has long emphasized the importance of innovation and is responsible for an incredible amount of cutting-edge technology, such as the advanced computer chips that make modern AI possible,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. “This advantage isn’t free but rather the result of our engineers’ and scientists’ hard work and sacrifice. The National Security Division, along with our partners, will vigorously enforce our export-control laws and protect this edge. ”Alan Hao Hsu aka Haochun Hsu, 43, Missouri City, and his company, Hao Global LLC, both pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities Oct. 10.According to now unsealed court documents, between October 2024 and May 2025, Hsu and others knowingly exported and attempted to export at least $160 million worth of export-controlled Nvidia H100 and H200 Tensor Core graphic processing units (GPUs).The H100 and H200 are high-speed GPUs used for AI applications and high-performance computing. They are designed to process massive amounts of data, advancing generative AI and large language models, and accelerating scientific computing. The GPUs are used for both civilian and military applications. These chips are among the most advanced GPUs ever developed, and their export to the People’s Republic of China is strictly prohibited.Hsu and others falsified shipping paperwork, misclassifying the true nature of the goods and their recipients to conceal the ultimate destination of the GPUs. Hsu and Hao Global received more than $50 million in wire transfers that originated from the People’s Republic of China to help fund the scheme. The GPUs were ultimately shipped to the PRC, Hong Kong and other destinations in violation of US export laws.Also charged in relation to the scheme are two PRC natives - Fanyue Gong aka Tom Gong, 43, a PRC citizen who resides in Brooklyn, New York, and Benlin Yuan, 58, a Canadian citizen who resides in Mississauga, Ontario. Law enforcement arrested Gong in New York Dec. 3, and Yuan in Sterling, Virgina, Nov. 28.Yuan is the CEO of a Sterling, Virginia, IT services company which is the US subsidiary of a large PRC IT company based in Beijing, while Gong is the owner of a New York technology company.According to their charges, Gong and Yuan also independently conspired with employees of a Hong Kong-based logistics company and a China-based AI technology company to circumvent US export controls.The criminal complaint against Gong alleges co-conspirators obtained Nvidia GPUs through straw purchasers and intermediaries, falsely indicating that the goods were for US customers or customers in third countries that do not require a license to export. The GPUs were shipped to multiple US warehouses where individuals who worked for Gong removed Nvidia labels and re-labelled the GPUs with the name “SANDKYAN” – a fake company – and then prepared the goods for export at his direction, according to the charges. The shipping and export paperwork for the GPUs allegedly misclassified the goods as generic computer parts. The charges allege co-conspirators then shipped the goods or attempted to do so to the PRC and Hong Kong in violation of US laws.According to Yuan’s charges, he helped recruit and organize individuals to inspect the mislabeled GPUs on behalf of the Hong Kong logistics company. Yuan allegedly agreed to direct inspectors not to say the goods were destined for the PRC. The charges also allege Yuan directed discussions regarding crafting a story his company could use to get GPUs and other equipment released after federal law authorities detained it. Yuan allegedly engaged in several conversations about providing false information to US authorities regarding the ultimate customer of the goods.Yuan is also alleged to have participated in and agreed to direct actions involving the handling and storage of another export of Nvidia GPUs on behalf of the Hong Kong logistics company.Hsu faces up to 10 years in federal prison at sentencing Feb. 18, while Hao Global LLC could be fined up to twice the gross gain from the offense and given a term of probation.If convicted, Yuan faces up to 20 years for conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act. Gong is charged with conspiracy to smuggle goods from the United States and faces a maximum of 10 years.Hsu was permitted to remain on bond pending sentencing. Yuan and Gong are currently in custody pending further criminal proceedings.The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security - Office of Export Enforcement (Dallas Field Office), Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations – Dallas and FBI Field Offices in New York City and Washington D.C. conducted the investigation.

FCC ban on Chinese labs from testing US electronics





China's three biggest telecom companies are likely in for some rough time in America. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has said that it may bar three major Chinese telecom companies from connecting to the US networks over efforts to prevent robocalls. According to an order issued by FCC, China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom must address issues with their certifications in the agency's Robocall Mitigation Database (RMD). RMD are databases in which carriers in the United States register and attest to their own efforts to reduce illegal robocalls and spam calls, allowing other carriers to reference them and block illegal traffic coming from specific carriers. The US agency has raised concerns about their presence in the database. If the FCC decides to remove these Chinese telecom companies, it would require all intermediate providers and voice service providers handling calls in the America to stop accepting all calls directly from the Chinese telecoms. In effect, this means that general voice calls originating in China and routed to the United States via Chinese carriers could be completely blocked.The regulator warned that because of national security concerns it may remove the carriers from the database if the companies cannot offer convincing evidence that their presence in it ""is not a threat to national security and is in the public interest."" The FCC has given these Chinese companies two weeks to respond. The industry reportedly views the RMD certification correction orders as measures that could further restrict Chinese carriers' access to U.S. communications networks.In the last few years, FCC has barred these three companies from operating in the America. In 2019, it rejected China Mobile's bid to provide US telecommunications services, citing national security risks, and then revoked US operations authorization for China Unicom, Pacific Networks and its wholly-owned subsidiary ComNet, and China Telecom Americas in 2021 and 2022. In November 2022, FCC banned approvals of new telecommunications equipment from Huawei and ZTE, as well as telecom and video surveillance equipment from Hytera Communications Corp (002583.SZ), opens new tab, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology and Zhejiang Dahua Technology. In March this year, the FCC said it was investigating nine Chinese companies, including Huawei, Hikvision, China Mobile and China Telecom, to determine if they were seeking to evade US restrictions.The FCC recently moved to withdraw recognition from test labs owned or controlled by the Chinese government. In May 2025, FCC voted to finalize rules barring Chinese labs deemed risks to U.S. national security from testing electronic devices such as smartphones, cameras and computers for use in the United States.""Foreign adversary governments should not own and control the labs that test the devices the FCC certifies as safe for the U.S. market,"" FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said then. All electronics used in the United States must go through the FCC's equipment authorization process before they can be imported. The FCC says about 75% of all electronics are tested in labs located inside China.The FCC said it was taking action against companies including the Chongqing Academy of Information and Communications; CQC Internet of Vehicles Technical Service Co; CVC Testing; TUV Rheinland-CCIC CESI (Guangzhou) Standards; China Academy of Information and Communications Technology; Shanghai Institute of Measurement and Testing Technology and CCIC Southern Testing Co.Ningbo Co.","China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom must address issues with their certifications in the agency's Robocall Mitigation Database (RMD) RMD is databases in which carriers in the United States register and attest to their own efforts to reduce illegal robocalls and spam calls.

What Paramount CEO David Ellison told employees about its hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery in country-wide letter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-paramount-ceo-david-ellison-told-employees-about-its-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-discovery-in-country-wide-letter/articleshow/125869443.cms,"Read Ellison's full memo here



Dear Team,

This morning, we filed a tender offer — a public offer to purchase shares directly from a company's shareholders — and made an appeal to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders to acquire WBD for $30 per share in cash.

You can read the details in our press release here, but in short, we believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole. Together, we would form a scaled, forward-looking company positioned to invest confidently in future growth and capitalize on rapidly changing industry dynamics — while better serving creative talent and consumers. A combined company would give us the reach, resources, and creative capacity to tell more exceptional stories and bring them to audiences around the world.

We are taking our offer directly to shareholders because they deserve full transparency and the ability to make an informed choice. Our $30 per share, all cash proposal is superior to Netflix's offer — $27.75 in total, including $23.25 in cash — across every dimension: higher overall value, greater certainty, a clearer regulatory path, and a future that is pro-Hollywood, pro-consumer, and pro-competition.

Our motivation for pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery has been consistent from the start. We love this industry and believe deeply in its future. And we want to help preserve and strengthen one of America's greatest cultural and economic exports: storytelling. By bringing Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery together, we aim to accelerate both creative engines, delivering a greater slate of high-quality films, television, sports, news, and games to global audiences.

Bottom line: this transaction is about doing more, not less — for our company, for the industry, for consumers, for shareholders, and especially for the creative talent who power everything we do. We're energized by the opportunity ahead, and we're confident that once Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders have the chance to decide for themselves, they'll choose Paramount.

As this process moves forward, I pledge to keep you informed whenever there are significant updates. Until then, let's stay focused on our North Star priorities and continue pressing ahead. I remain deeply grateful for your hard work, dedication, and passion.

Let's go!

David





Netflix vs Paramount over Warner Brothers has turned into a war. Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison has now taken his campaign to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) directly to his own employees. As reported by Business Insider, Ellison recently sent a company-wide letter which clearly outlined his vision for a combined entertainment powerhouse. The memo from Ellison came around 3 p.m. ET, hours after which Paramount launched a hostile $30-per-share all-cash tender offer to WBD shareholders. The move is aimed at outbidding Netflix’s $27.75 proposal for WBD’s streaming and studio assets, including Warner Bros. Pictures, HBO, and HBO Max.In the letter written to the employees Ellison described the deal as a chance to reshape the industry “We believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros.

The government has proposed a shift in AI regulation, recommending that AI companies like Google and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI be required to pay content creators a share of revenue for using their work that has been used to train models. This proposal can be seen as a potential setback for the tech giants that have advocated for free access to publicly available data, a report has said. The proposal has been filed by a panel that was established in April.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the panel released a report on Monday (December 8) suggesting that while AI firms should be able to access Indian content for training, they must pay royalties into a central body representing copyright holders.India’s plan is different from that of jurisdictions like the US, where AI giants argue that training models on publicly available data falls under “fair use,” for which they should not be charged. Moreover, the panel’s report also rejects the opt-out model used in the European Union (EU). It argued the opt-out system is ineffective as it unfairly forces creators to track down their own work within massive AI datasets.Instead, India plans to allow creators to claim funds from the centralised royalty pool if their work is used by AI platforms. The proposal now faces a 30-day window for challenge from the public and industry before government officials review the plan.Nasscom, an influential tech industry body that includes Google and Microsoft among its members, has formally dissented from the plan. Nasscom characterised the mandatory fee as amounting to a “tax or levy on innovation”. Meanwhile, the Motion Picture Association, representing firms like Netflix and Paramount, previously advised the panel that there should be no change to existing copyright law.This regulatory push comes amid ongoing legal battles, including a court case involving OpenAI and Indian news agency ANI over the use of copyrighted content. OpenAI has consistently denied wrongdoing, asserting its use of online content constitutes fair use.",The government has proposed a shift in AI regulation in India.

mFilterIt report warns ad fraud becomes 'non-linear' threat as AI makes invalid traffic human-like,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mfilterit-report-warns-ad-fraud-becomes-non-linear-threat-as-ai-makes-invalid-traffic-human-like/articleshow/125868617.cms,"Sophisticated AI is fueling a new wave of ad fraud, tricking even advanced systems. A recent report reveals a significant portion of 'valid' programmatic traffic is actually fake, with bots mimicking human behavior. This pervasive issue, now a 'trust problem,' demands a full-funnel validation approach to combat invalid impressions, inflated conversions, and wasted ad spend across all digital channels.

Legacy detection systems miss AI-powered behavioral fraud

Full-funnel validation needed as fraud circulates across channels





Digital advertising fraud has evolved from simple bot detection into a sophisticated, full-funnel threat that mimics human behavior so convincingly that traditional verification tools can no longer catch it, according to mFilterIt's new ""Beyond the Linear Lens: Ad Fraud in 2025"" report.The report reveals that 30-45% of traffic labeled ""valid"" in programmatic advertising failed deeper validation checks, while even walled gardens like major social platforms showed 9-18% invalid traffic. Fraud sophistication has tripled in just two years, driven primarily by AI technology that enables bots to simulate natural scrolling, realistic dwell times, and genuine user actions.Traditional verification methods rely on 1x1 pixel tags designed to confirm impressions loaded—not whether real humans saw them. This creates massive blind spots where AI-generated invalid traffic easily passes as legitimate because it can mimic authentic user patterns, reproduce realistic click intervals, and simulate high-value actions like registrations.""Fraud is no longer a traffic problem—it is a trust problem,"" said mFilterIt co-founders Amit Relan and Dhiraj Gupta. The company analyzed billions of interactions across markets to produce the report, which challenges long-held industry assumptions about ad safety.Made-for-advertising (MFA) sites and AI-generated ""slop"" content continue rising in programmatic channels, while 43% of invalid traffic originates from affiliate networks through incentivized actions and click manipulation. Display and video platforms recorded 15-18% frequency cap breaches, exposing users to excessive ad repetition.The report emphasizes that fraud no longer operates at single touchpoints but moves fluidly across the entire marketing funnel. Invalid impressions contaminate remarketing pools, bots drop cookies that inflate retargeting audiences, and synthetic users generate seemingly strong conversion rates that mislead optimization algorithms.With global digital ad spend forecast to reach $678.7 billion in 2025, mFilterIt argues advertisers must transition from isolated, channel-specific checks to holistic validation systems that connect impression integrity, contextual relevance, behavioral authenticity, and conversion truth across the complete customer journey.","Fraud sophistication has tripled in just two years, driven primarily by AI technology. 30-45% of traffic labeled ""valid"" in programmatic advertising failed deeper validation checks. 43% of invalid traffic originates from affiliate networks through incentivized actions and click manipulation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125868617,imgsize-61284,width-400,resizemode-4/125868617.jpg"

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Nvidia’s response





Nvidia, the chipset major has managed to secure a significant policy win on December 8, after US President Donald Trump announced that the company is now allowed to sell its powerful H200 AI chipset to ‘approved customers’ in China, subject to strict conditions.

The president has previously floated the idea of the US taking a cut of chip sales to China.As reported by Business Insider, Nvidia has welcomed this decision of President Trump. “We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America,” the company said in a statement to Business Insider.The company stressed on the fact that the sales will be limited only to commercial customers which are vetted by the Department of Commerce, ensuring compliance with national security concerns.While Nvidia has been able to sell some chips to China, US export controls have restricted access to its most advanced products. Sales of its H20 chips to China in Q3 were described as “insignificant” by CFO Colette Kress, who noted the company’s ongoing engagement with both US and Chinese governments to advocate for competitiveness.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with Trump last week to discuss export controls. “I’ve said repeatedly that we support export control, that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,” Huang told reporters.",US President Donald Trump announced that the company is now allowed to sell its powerful H200 AI chipset to ‘approved customers’ in China.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai hints at building data centres in space; Elon Musk replies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-hints-at-building-data-centres-in-space-elon-musk-replies/articleshow/125864477.cms,"



Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently hinted at building data centres in space. In an interview with Fox News, Pichai said that the company is working on quantum computing, adding “in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun”.Pichai’s video from the interview was shared by X (formerly Twitter) user - Bourbon Capital in an online post. It caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who replied to the post with a single word. “Interesting”, Musk wrote.“At Google, we are always proud of taking moon shots,” Pichai said, adding “... Waymo … has been over a decade in the making.”“We're working on quantum computing, in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun,” he continued.Pichai further said that the company wants to “put these data centers in space closer to the sun”, and will take “first step in 2027”.“We'll send tiny racks of machines and have them in satellites, test them out, and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away will be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centers,” Sundar Pichai said in the interview.Notably, this echoes Musk's November 2025 announcements that SpaceX will pioneer orbital data centers using next-gen Starlink satellites, positioning them as the lowest-cost AI compute option within five years.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is working on quantum computing.

Regret and apologies



A call for transparency







Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn co-founder and billionaire investor has now admitted that he learned a hard lesson during his brief visit to jeffery Epstein’s private island. He said that it is always important to do more research before agreeing to such engagements. As reported by Business Insider, speaking on the Dec. 1 episode of Eric Newcomer’s podcast, Hoffman revealed that he spent one night on the island in connection with fundraising efforts for the MIT Foundation. He mentioned that he was told Epstein would be more likely to donate to MIT if he visited. “Note to self: Google before going,” Hoffman remarked, describing the property as having a pool, guest rooms, and a courtyard.Hoffman has consistently maintained his stance that his interactions with Epstein who died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges was only limited to fund-raising for the MIT Media Lab. He also described Epstein as a “masterful networker” who sought to build influence by attending high-profile gatherings.Hoffman further recalled a 2015 dinner in Palo Alto which he hosted for an MIT researcher.Epstein attended altho dinner along with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Hoffman said he was later told Epstein’s presence made him more likely to donate.Spokespersons for Zuckerberg and Musk confirmed their attendance at the dinner to Business Insider in 2019, noting it was the only time Zuckerberg met Epstein.Hoffman reiterated his regret for the association, noting he had already distanced himself from Epstein by the time the financier’s crimes became widely known. “I went and kind of made a very public apology because it was like, okay I realized this and I’d already at that point had ramped down connection with him,” Hoffman said. He added that Epstein occasionally emailed him afterward, but he avoided further meetings.Hoffman further stressed on the importance of Justice for Epstein’s victims and also urged the government to release ‘every single piece of intel that they have about Epstein.’His comments come after President Donald Trump signed a bill in November requiring the Department of Justice to release its files on Epstein by December 19.

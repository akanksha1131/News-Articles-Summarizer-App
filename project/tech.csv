Trump mourns death of Charlie Kirk





Charlie Kirk, a right-wing activist and close ally of US President Donald Trump, was shot dead in a targeted attack at Utah Valley University. Elon Musk, former ally of Trump has responded to the incident, calling it a “cold-blooded murder”. Musk expressed his shock and grief in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). “The shot looked real bad, but I sure hope Charlie makes it somehow,” the tech billionaire wrote as the news broke out.A couple of X users pointed out that posts on Bluesky are “celebrating the assassination”. The Tesla CEO responded saying “shows what we’re dealing with. Evil people.”When a user wrote “Whether you agreed with him or not, Charlie Kirk is dead purely because some people didn't like what he had to say. That should outrage every single one of us”, Musk responded with an affirmative ‘yes’.“They are celebrating cold-blooded murder,” he wrote in another post.In another post on X, Elon Musk called out the left party saying “The Left is the party of murder”. He was responding to an X user that said “The Left lectured us for the last decade about the dangers of violence from the Right. From the assassination attempts of President Trump. To Brian Thompson, the United Healthcare CEO, being murdered. Now to Charlie Kirk. The danger was actually on the Left”When another user said “Not only ""the left,"" it's people who fund them.Like Soros, Bill Gates, and Reid Hoffman. Some patsy boomer who was radicalized by agitprop is not who anyone smart considers responsible for today. That's a fact”, Musk replied “Exactly”.Trump posted a video on his Truth Social platform where he called Kirk's assassination a ""heinous"" and ""dark moment for America.""""For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals,"" Trump said.“From the attack on my life in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, which killed a husband and father, to the attacks on ICE agents, to the vicious murder of a healthcare executive in the streets of New York, to the shooting of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and three others. Radical left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.”""My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organisations that fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials, and everyone else who brings order to our country,"" Trump added.","Elon Musk calls out the left party saying “The Left is the party of murder” The Tesla CEO expressed his shock and grief in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) “They are celebrating cold-blooded murder,” he wrote in another post.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123821602,imgsize-24166,width-400,resizemode-4/charlie-kirk.jpg"

Tesla marketshare in America falls below 40% for the first time ever

What's hurting Tesla

Tesla pains also mirror EV industry troubles





Tesla's dominance in the American electric vehicle (EV) market is waning as a growing number of rivals erode the company's once-unassailable lead, according to exclusive data shared with Reuters by research firm Cox Automotive.The data reveals that Tesla's U.S. market share plummeted to a near eight-year low in August, falling below 40% for the first time since October 2017. Tesla, which once commanded over 80% of the U.S. EV market, accounted for just 38% of total EV sales last month.According to a Reuters analysis of Cox data, Tesla's market share in July fell to 42% from 48.7% in June, marking the sharpest drop since March 2021, when Ford launched its Mustang Mach-E EV.The decline highlights a critical challenge for Tesla: its aging product lineup. While competitors are aggressively launching new models and increasing incentives, Tesla's most recent vehicle, the Cybertruck pickup, has not matched the success of its earlier models like the Model 3 and Model Y. A recent refresh of the Model Y, once the world’s best-selling car, has failed to meet expectations, putting the company on track for a second consecutive year of sales decline.""I know they’re positioning themselves as a robotics, AI company. But when you’re a car company, when you don’t have new products, your share will start to decline,"" said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox’s director of industry insights, in an interview with Reuters.The slump in its core auto business comes as CEO Elon Musk has shifted focus to other ambitious ventures, including humanoid robots and robotaxis, reportedly delaying and canceling plans for more affordable EV models. Much of the company's trillion-dollar valuation is pinned on these long-term bets. Last Friday, Tesla's board proposed a monumental $1 trillion pay package for Musk, tied to the company's value reaching an astounding $8.5 trillion in the next decade.The news also emerges during a difficult period for the broader EV industry. Analysts quoted by Reuters anticipate a temporary increase in EV sales through September as consumers rush to take advantage of expiring federal tax credits. However, this is expected to be followed by a sharp drop in October, increasing financial pressure on all automakers, including Tesla.Adding to the company's challenges, Musk’s public political activities and his association with President Donald Trump have also been cited as a factor hurting the brand's image among some buyers. Although he had a falling out with the Republican president in May, his previous involvement in guiding Trump's efforts to reshape the U.S. government has been a source of controversy.","Tesla's U.S. market share fell to an eight-year low in August as buyers shifted to newer EV models from rivals, Cox Automotive data showed.

40% Stock Gain and the AI Factor

* AI-Specific Cloud Deals:

* Massive Deal Book:

* Agressive Forecast:





Oracle stock roared 40% higher on Wednesday, September 10, after reporting smashing cloud demand numbers, setting the company on track for a historic gain. The cloud computing giant is on pace for its best day since the year 1992, and is now quickly approaching the $1 trillion market cap benchmark. Oracle is now at $950 billion. In the past year, Oracle has emerged as one of the biggest benefactors of the artificial intelligence boom thanks to its cloud infrastructure business and its access to Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are both needed to run large workloads.Oracle's business model, historically centered on enterprise database software and licenses, has undergone a dramatic transformation, with a strategic pivot to cloud computing. This shift is the key to understanding the company's recent 40% stock surge, which marked its largest single-day gain since 1992. It traces back to 1977, when Ellison, Bob Miner and Ed Oates founded Software Development Laboratories in Santa Clara, California. The company won the contract from the CIA to build a database program code-named Oracle.Five years later, in 1986, the company changed its name to Oracle and went public. Throughout the four decades, Oracle has found various levels of success in technology, but most recently in demand for its data center capacity from AI customers. Here are the key businesses of Oracle:For decades, Oracle's primary revenue streams came from selling on-premise software licenses and the lucrative, high-margin support contracts that followed. However, the company has successfully expanded its business model to include a full suite of cloud services, including:This is the foundation of Oracle's new growth, providing the raw computing power, storage, and networking resources.This is where the company is now directly competing with giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.A platform for developers to build and run applications.Oracle's applications, such as its ERP and CRM solutions, are now offered on a subscription basis in the cloud.The unprecedented jump in Oracle's stock was not driven by a single earnings report, but by a powerful narrative shift. Most analysts are now confident that Oracle's cloud business is not just a side project but a central player in the AI boom. Several factors contributed to this re-evaluation:Oracle announced a series of multi-billion-dollar contracts with major AI players, including a landmark deal with OpenAI. These contracts highlight Oracle's ability to provide the massive, specialized computing power required for training and running large AI models. The size and prestige of these customers validated Oracle's cloud strategy.The company's remaining performance obligations—a measure of future contracted revenue—surged to an astonishing $455 billion. This figure, more than four times Google's backlog according to Bloomberg, signaled a huge pipeline of future growth and revenue stability.Oracle's leadership provided an exceptionally bullish outlook for its cloud infrastructure business, projecting that its annual revenue from this segment could grow from $18 billion this fiscal year to $144 billion by 2030. This aggressive forecast, a rare move for a company of its size, electrified investors.In essence, the stock market's reaction was a clear signal that it has re-rated Oracle's business. While its legacy software business remains a cash cow, the company is now being valued as a high-growth AI infrastructure provider, capable of capturing a significant share of the trillions of dollars expected to be spent on AI development in the coming years.","Oracle stock roared 40% higher on Wednesday, September 10, after reporting smashing cloud demand numbers.

Four deals that made Larry Ellison world's richest

In the first quarter, Oracle signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three separate customers, CEO Safra Catz said in an earnings release on Tuesday, September 9.

Oracle CEO Safra Catz on stock's 40% jump in one day





In what can be termed as a seismic shift for the tech world, Oracle Corp. shares surged more than 40% on Wednesday, September 10, marking the company's largest single-day gain since 1992. The dramatic rally came after Oracle revealed an unprecedented contract with OpenAI and offered a highly aggressive outlook for its cloud business, cementing its position in the high-stakes race for artificial intelligence computing.The stock's explosive performance pushed Oracle's market valuation to a staggering $969 billion, briefly making co-founder Larry Ellison the wealthiest person in the world, surpassing Elon Musk . A $101 billion single-day gain pushed Ellison’s fortune to $393 billion, ahead of Musk’s $385 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.A key driver behind the surge is Oracle's strategic move into the red-hot cloud computing sector, where it is emerging as a critical provider of AI infrastructure. The company is now a direct competitor to cloud giants Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.According to Bloomberg, the centerpiece of Oracle's success is a landmark deal signed earlier this summer with ChatGPT operator OpenAI. The contract, described as ""unprecedented,"" provides OpenAI with 4.5 gigawatts of data center capacity—enough energy to power millions of American homes.Oracle also counts Nvidia and ByteDance's TikTok among its major cloud customers.These high-profile contracts have drastically boosted Oracle's ""remaining performance obligations""—a measure of future bookings—to an astonishing $455 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter. This figure is more than four times higher than the same period a year earlier. Bloomberg Intelligence analysis highlights the significance of this milestone, noting that it's also reportedly roughly four times Google's backlog, suggesting that Oracle’s cloud growth rate is poised to surpass its rival.Oracle CEO Safra Catz characterized the quarter as ""astonishing,"" stating that demand for the company's cloud infrastructure continues to build. She revealed that Oracle signed four multi-billion-dollar contracts with three different customers in the quarter and expects to push remaining performance obligations above half a trillion dollars in the coming months.Looking ahead, Catz said the cloud infrastructure business is projected to expand by 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year and reach a monumental $144 billion in annual revenue by May 2030.The strong forecast overshadowed an otherwise mixed earnings report. While cloud infrastructure revenue increased by 55% to $3.3 billion, both adjusted revenue of $14.9 billion and profit of $1.47 per share fell slightly short of analyst expectations. Investors, however, are now focused on Oracle's long-term potential, despite concerns over the high cost of building new data centers, with capital expenditures projected at $35 billion this year.","Oracle Corp. shares surged more than 40% on Wednesday, September 10, marking the company's largest single-day gain since 1992.

US President Donald Trump has recently threatened to imposetariffs on countries that implement digital taxes. This decision came just days after a private meeting with Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Meta Platforms . Citing sources familiar with the meeting, a report by Bloomberg stated that Zuckerberg raised concerns about these digital service taxes , which are levied on the revenue tech companies generate from users in a specific country. Following the discussion, Trump stated that he was putting all countries with such taxes “on notice” and that the US will impose “substantial” tariffs and export restrictions on US semiconductors unless “these discriminatory actions are removed.”According to Trump, digital taxes will harm US technology companies while givingHe warned that unless thesethe US would impose tariffs and export restrictions on semiconductors. In a recent post shared on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump wrote:In a statement to Bloomberg, Meta confirmed the meeting between Trump and Zuckerberg. A company spokesperson said:Trump’s recent comments have reignited tensions over digital services taxes imposed by several US trading partners, a dispute that predates his latest meeting with Zuckerberg.Washington has long argued that such taxes, which may be levied by countries including France, Italy, Austria, Spain, and the UK, disproportionately target American tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Since Trump’s return to office, Zuckerberg has worked to strengthen his relationship with the president, who once labelled him a “criminal.” Efforts have included changing Meta’s moderation and diversity policies, contributing $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, and making repeated visits to the White House and Mar-a-Lago.Zuckerberg has also expanded his Washington footprint by purchasing homes near the vice president’s residence and bringing Trump allies into Meta’s leadership.

Read the full memo sent to employees:



How we work has forever changed. I remember starting at Microsoft in the late '90s, always in the office, no laptops, and primarily working with the people right down the hall. As technology evolved and our business expanded, we became more open, more global, and able to scale in ways we couldn't have imagined. Then the pandemic reshaped everything. It pushed us to think differently about work, to connect like never before (thank you Teams!), reminded us of how much we value being together, and gave us focus and autonomy in the traditional workday. We're not going back, and we shouldn't. Instead, we should take the best of what we've learned and move forward.

In the AI era, we are moving faster than ever, building world class technology that changes how people live and work, and how organizations everywhere operate. If you reflect on our history, the most meaningful breakthroughs happen when we build on each other's ideas together, in real time.

We've looked at how our teams work best, and the data is clear: when people work together in person more often, they thrive—they are more energized, empowered, and they deliver stronger results. As we build the AI products that will define this era, we need the kind of energy and momentum that comes from smart people working side by side, solving challenging problems together.

With that in mind, we're updating our flexible work expectations to three days a week in the office.

We'll roll this out in three phases: 1) starting in Puget Sound at the end of February; 2) expanding to other US locations; 3) and then launching outside the US.

Our goal with this change is to provide more clarity and consistency in how we come together, while maintaining the flexibility we know you value. We want you to continue to shape your schedule in ways that work best for you, making in-person time intentional and impactful. Importantly, this update is not about reducing headcount. It's about working together in a way that enables us to meet our customers' needs.

For some of you, this is not a change. For others this may be a bigger adjustment, which is exactly why we're providing time to plan thoughtfully. As part of these updates, we're also enhancing our workplace safety and security measures so we can continue to provide a workplace where every employee can do their best work.

What you need to know:

Puget Sound-area employees: If you live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office, you'll be expected to work onsite three days a week by the end of February. You'll receive a personalized email today with more details. Please connect with your manager and team to understand your organization's plans. If needed, you can request an exception by Friday, September 19.

Managers: You'll find actions to take, and the resources to support both you and your team on the Managers@Microsoft SharePoint.

All employees: You'll hear from your EVP or organizational leadership today with specific guidance. Each business will do what is best for their team, which means some groups will deviate from our company-wide expectations. If you are outside of the Puget Sound area, you do not need to take any action at this time unless your EVP communicates otherwise.

Timelines and details for additional US office locations will be announced soon. For employees outside the United States, we will begin planning in 2026. More information is available on the Flexible Work at Microsoft SharePoint.

As always, we'll keep learning together to ensure Microsoft is the best place for you to grow and have a great career. Let's keep moving forward together.

Thank you,

Amy

Microsoft is implementing a new policy that requires employees to work from the office at least three days a week. This mandate was detailed in an internal email sent to staff by Microsoft HR chief Amy Coleman. According to the memo, the new return-to-office (RTO) policy will roll out in three phases. The first phase, starting in late February 2026, will affect Seattle-area employees who live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office.The policy will then be extended to other US offices before being implemented internationally. Employees have until September 19 to request an exception, though the email did not provide specific details on how the exception process will work.Reports suggested that Microsoft was considering a stricter RTO policy for some time now. Compared to its other tech giants, Microsoft has reportedly been more lenient than competitors like Amazon, and even Zoom, which sent its employees back to the office part-time in 2023.Microsoft's initial flexible work policy, introduced in late 2020, allowed employees to work from home for at least half of the time. This new three-day-a-week requirement brings Microsoft in line with similar policies at Meta and Google.","Microsoft is implementing a new policy that requires employees to work from the office at least three days a week.

What WhatsApp said about the former employees lawsuit



“Sadly, this is a familiar playbook in which a former employee is dismissed for poor performance and then goes public with distorted claims that misrepresent the ongoing hard work of our team. Security is an adversarial space, and we pride ourselves in building on our strong record of protecting people’s privacy.”

GST Rate Cut: Electronics to Get Cheaper from Sept 22





A former WhatsApp employee, Attaullah Baig, has filed a federal lawsuit alleging that his repeated cybersecurity warnings were ignored by the company. Baig, who claims he was the head of security, said he faced retaliation after he discovered ""systemic cybersecurity failures that posed serious risks to user data"" of the Meta-owned messaging platform in 2021. The lawsuit claims that about 1,500 WhatsApp engineers had unrestricted access to user data, with the ability to move or steal it without detection. When asked for comment, a WhatsApp spokesperson said that the latest lawsuit follows a common pattern where a former employee, dismissed for poor performance and insubordination attempted to fabricate claims in hopes of financial gain.In a statement to Bloomberg, Carl Woog, a WhatsApp spokesperson, noted:As per Baig’s lawsuit, he repeatedly told his boss (about five times) that WhatsApp messaging platform lacked basic cybersecurity expertise needed for regulatory compliance after identifying potential flaws. However, his warnings were ignored by the company’s superiors, the lawsuit claims.Baig claimed that he even raised the issues with senior executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . Instead of addressing them, Baig alleges that the company retaliated with negative performance reviews and eventually dismissed him for poor performance.The lawsuit further claims WhatsApp lacked a 24/7 security operations center and that around 100,000 users faced account takeovers daily.Baig also alleged the company employed fewer security engineers than other firms of similar scale, adding that these shortcomings could breach a 2020 FTC settlement and securities laws.Baig later filed a complaint with the Department of Labor’s OSHA. A WhatsApp spokesperson, Zade Alsawah, said OSHA concluded that Meta hadn’t retaliated against Baig for raising security concerns. OSHA itself did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Baig joined Meta in 2021 as a software engineering manager and, after onboarding, became head of security at WhatsApp, according to him. However, WhatsApp’s Alsawah clarified that Baig was one of several directors reporting to the VP of engineering, holding the title of software engineering manager.","Former WhatsApp employee Attaullah Baig has filed a federal lawsuit alleging that his repeated cybersecurity warnings were ignored by the company.

Which new iPhone should you buy this year?



Go with the iPhone 17 if you want solid performance, great cameras, and modern features without paying premium prices. The addition of ProMotion makes this the best value in the lineup.

Choose the iPhone Air if design matters most to you and you're comfortable with some functional compromises. It's some unique in a sea of familiar.

Pick the iPhone 17 Pro if you're serious about photography and want flagship features in a manageable size. The camera improvements and sustained performance make it ideal for creators.

Opt for the iPhone 17 Pro Max if you want the biggest screen and don't mind the size. It's the ultimate iPhone for media consumption and productivity.





Apple's iPhone 17 lineup marks one of the most significant shake-ups in recent iPhone history. Gone is the Plus model, replaced by something entirely new: the ultra-thin iPhone Air. Combined with refreshed standard and Pro models, you've got four distinct options, each with its own personality and purpose.The big question isn't whether you should upgrade—these phones pack serious improvements across the board. It's which one matches your lifestyle, budget, and priorities. Let's break down each model to help you make the right choice.Most people looking for a reliable, feature-rich iPhone without breaking the bank.The base iPhone 17 is more compelling than ever, finally bringing ProMotion's silky-smooth 120Hz display to the non-Pro crowd. That alone makes scrolling through social media, gaming, and general use feel noticeably more premium. The 6.3-inch screen hits the sweet spot for one-handed use while still giving you plenty of real estate.Camera-wise, you're getting the new Center Stage front camera that can shoot landscape selfies without rotating your phone—perfect for group shots and video calls. The dual 48MP rear system (Main and Ultra Wide) captures sharp photos with impressive detail, especially in good lighting.While it lacks the telephoto zoom of the Pro models, the 2x optical quality zoom from the main sensor covers most casual photography needs.Battery life clocks in at 30 hours of video playback, which should easily get you through a full day of typical use. The A19 chip provides snappy performance that'll stay relevant for years to come.The price has gone up from last year, but you're now getting 256GB as the base storage—something that would have cost you significantly more in the previous generation.The iPhone 17 comes in five colours—black, lavender, mist blue, sage, and white.You need multiple zoom options, want the absolute best camera system, or crave cutting-edge design.Design-conscious users who want something genuinely different and don't mind some trade-offs.The iPhone Air is Apple's boldest design move in years. At just 5.6mm thick, it's impossibly thin—the kind of device that makes people do double-takes. The titanium build feels premium while keeping weight down, and the larger 6.5-inch display offers more screen space than the standard iPhone 17.Here's where it gets interesting: Apple packed three custom chips inside this ultra-thin frame. The A19 Pro delivers flagship performance, the N1 chip handles Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6, and the C1X cellular modem is both faster and more power-efficient. It's a technical marvel that proves Apple's engineering prowess.The trade-offs are real, though. You get just one rear camera (albeit a versatile 48MP Fusion lens), and it's eSIM-only—no physical SIM card slot. Battery life drops to 27 hours, though that's still solid for such a thin device.Rs 1,19,900 might seem a lot for what Air has on offer, but it’s the price you pay for this experience.iPhone Air comes in four finishes - sky blue, light gold, cloud white, and space black.You frequently use multiple cameras for photography, travel internationally with local SIM cards, or need maximum battery life.Photography enthusiasts, content creators, and power users who want flagship features in a manageable size.The iPhone 17 Pro gets a dramatic redesign centred around performance and cameras. The new aluminium unibody with an internal vapor chamber keeps the A19 Pro chip running cool under heavy loads—crucial for sustained video recording and gaming. The raised plateau on the back houses improved components while making room for a larger battery.Camera capabilities are where this phone truly shines. The triple 48MP system includes a new telephoto with 8x optical zoom—the longest reach ever on an iPhone. The updated Photonic Engine uses machine learning for better detail preservation and colour accuracy. Professional video features like ProRes RAW, Apple Log 2, and genlock support make this a legitimate tool for serious content creation.The 6.3-inch display maintains the Pro series' premium feel while being easier to handle than the Max. Despite the compact size, battery life stretches to an impressive 39 hours thanks to the internal redesign and efficient A19 Pro.Sure, it costs more than last year's model, but the 256GB starting storage means you're actually getting better value than if you'd upgraded to higher storage on the iPhone 16 Pro.The hero colour for the Pro iPhone this year is the cosmic orange. Then, there are two other colours as well: deep blue, and silver. Sadly, no black colour for the Pro iPhone this year.You rarely use advanced camera features, prefer the largest possible screen, or want to save money on a still-excellent iPhone 17.Who it's for: Users who want the absolute best iPhone experience and don't mind the size and price premium.The Pro Max shares most features with the regular Pro but supersizes them. The massive 6.9-inch display is perfect for media consumption, productivity, and gaming. Peak brightness hits 3,000 nits—bright enough to see clearly even in direct sunlight—with 2x better outdoor contrast than previous generations.Performance matches the Pro thanks to the same A19 Pro chip and vapor chamber cooling system. The identical camera system captures the same stunning photos and professional-grade video. Battery life remains at 39 hours despite the larger screen, showing how efficient Apple's new design really is.For the first time, you can get 2TB of storage—serious overkill for most users but perfect for professionals shooting loads of ProRes video or keeping massive photo libraries locally.This is where the price is really up. You should see price for the 2TB storage option.The colour options for the Pro Max are the same as the Pro one.You find large phones unwieldy, want to save $100 over the Pro, or don't need the extra screen real estate.The iPhone 17 series offers something for everyone, with each model having a clear purpose and target audience. Consider how you actually use your phone, what features matter most, and whether the premium models' advantages justify their higher prices. Any of these four phones will serve you well for years to come—the question is which one fits your life best. And if the iPhone 17 lineup or the Air feels too premium, don't overlook the iPhone 16 ( Rs 69,900) or iPhone 16e (Rs 59,900), which still offer excellent performance and cameras at more accessible price points.","Apple's iPhone 17 lineup marks one of the most significant shake-ups in recent iPhone history.

The base iPhone 17 is more compelling than ever, finally bringing ProMotion's silky-smooth display to the non-Pro crowd.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123822243,imgsize-51094,width-400,resizemode-4/iphone-buying-guide-for-2025.jpg"

Americans's deeply divided on H-1B visa

H-1B visa holders viewed as direct competitors

Microsoft , Amazon employees share mixed opinions

GST Rate Cut: Electronics to Get Cheaper from Sept 22





A new survey shows a sharp divide in the American workforce over the role of H-1B visa holders. Blind, an anonymous professional network, conducted a survey over 4,230 professionals between August 25 and September 3, 2025. According to it, 56% of US citizens think H-1B workers are taking their jobs away. The findings come at a time when debates around foreign workers and layoffs are fueling political and social tensions in the US.According to the survey, 70% of respondents said H-1B visa holders are crucial for helping American companies grow. However, opinions varied by the immigration status. While 87% of foreign-born professionals supported the view, only 49% of US citizens agreed with it.When asked if companies should hire the best talents regardless of citizenship or visa status, 63% of all respondents said yes. But the answers split sharply along visa lines as 60% of US citizens said priority should go to U.S. citizens and green card holders. In contrast, only 11% of H-1B workers and 35% of permanent residents supported such a policy.As per the result, over one in three professionals (33%) overall said H-1B visa holders create unfair competition and viewed them as direct competitors for jobs.Among US citizens, the figure was at 56%.Among green card holders, 27% agreed, while just 9% of H-1B workers felt the same.The survey comes almost two months after Vice President JD Vance slammed US tech companies for laying off American workers and prioritizing H-1B visa workers. Speaking at a bipartisan event co-hosted by the Hill and Valley Forum then, JD Vance said “You see some big tech companies where they'll lay off 9,000 workers, and then they'll apply for a bunch of overseas visas. And I sort of wonder; that doesn't totally make sense to me”.“That displacement and that math worries me a bit. And what the president has said, he said very clearly: We want the very best and the brightest to make America their home. We want them to build great companies and so forth,” he said.“But I don't want companies to fire 9,000 American workers and then to go and say, 'We can't find workers here in America.' That's a bulls**t story,” Vance added.On Blind, professionals voiced contrasting views. A Microsoft employee wrote, “The H1B and other visa programs are out of control, and have become a way for the US to hand its best jobs to foreigners. We have enough SWE graduates in the U.S. now that these programs can and should be scaled back SIGNIFICANTLY.”An Amazon professional countered, “Stopping H-1B renewals just moves cutting edge development to another country. Tech follows talent.”A PayPal professional added, “Once someone is in the labor pool (i.e. they have a visa) they are 100% equivalent to anyone else in the labor pool. None of this “when there’s layoffs the H-1Bs go first” nonsense.""","A new survey shows a sharp divide in the American workforce over the role of H-1B visa holders.

Ellison moves past Mark Zuckerberg, intensifying the race for global billionaire rankings

Larry Ellison’s enduring influence and wealth accumulation strategy

The intensifying billionaire rivalry: What’s at stake for Musk and Ellison





Oracle co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison has dramatically shaken the billionaire landscape with a staggering $70 billion surge in a single day, narrowing the gap with Elon Musk , the world’s richest person. This extraordinary gain follows Oracle’s better-than-expected quarterly results and an aggressive growth forecast, particularly in cloud computing and AI services. Ellison’s net worth now stands around $364 billion, edging closer to Musk’s $384 billion fortune, while surpassing Mark Zuckerberg to claim the second spot. The single-day surge highlights the immense influence of corporate performance on billionaire rankings and the volatility of tech fortunes.Ellison’s unprecedented jump came after Oracle announced strong quarterly performance, fueled by a surge in bookings and a 26% spike in after-hours trading. Multi-billion-dollar contracts, expansion in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and robust projections for AI services sent investor confidence soaring. This single-day leap marks Oracle’s largest gain in decades and one of the most dramatic one-day increases in billionaire wealth history. Analysts note that such a leap reflects both strategic positioning in tech innovation and the increasing market value of cloud and AI businesses.With this surge, Ellison now occupies the second-richest position globally, surpassing Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose net worth is around $253 billion. Musk remains the wealthiest, but Tesla’s 14% stock decline this year, combined with Oracle’s strong market performance, has tightened the margin. Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes data confirm these changes, highlighting how quickly fortunes can shift at the very top of the tech world. The billionaire race is increasingly volatile, with fortunes closely tied to corporate earnings, stock movements, and strategic tech initiatives.Oracle reported $2.93 billion in quarterly profits with a remarkable $455 billion in remaining performance obligations (RPOs), up 359% from the prior quarter. CEO Safra Catz emphasized continued growth in cloud infrastructure, highlighting aggressive expansion of data centers and high-profile contracts. Potential deals, such as hosting TikTok on Oracle Cloud, demonstrate Ellison’s vision to leverage Oracle’s strengths in AI and enterprise services. These strategic maneuvers have not only boosted investor confidence but also reinforced Ellison’s influence in the rapidly growing cloud and AI markets.At 81 years old, Ellison continues to steer Oracle through a technological evolution, transforming it from a legacy database company into a cloud and AI powerhouse. Owning roughly 40% of Oracle, he has significantly increased his fortune by aligning the company with emerging technology trends. Ellison’s ability to pivot Oracle toward high-growth sectors while maintaining operational control highlights the critical role of leadership in shaping long-term wealth, demonstrating how business strategy can directly influence global billionaire rankings.Ellison’s single-day gain has escalated the race for the top spot among billionaires, putting Musk’s position under fresh scrutiny. While Musk’s wealth remains fueled by Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI, Oracle’s surge illustrates how fortunes can shift rapidly due to market dynamics and strategic corporate actions. The tech billionaire landscape is increasingly competitive, with Ellison’s rise emphasizing that even long-standing positions at the top are vulnerable to bold business maneuvers and market trends.","Ellison now occupies the second-richest position globally, surpassing Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

Limited companies can handle repairs

Repairs require complex undersea operations

External causes slow restoration

Red Sea cable cut: Impacted regions and cause





Red Sea cable cut continues to impact internet services in India, Pakistan and the middle east countries. According to an AP report that cites experts, the outage was caused by a commercial ship that allegedly dragged its anchor and severed several undersea internet cables in the Red Sea. Now, experts say that it may take several weeks to repair the damaged cables, reports Khaleej Times. The report gives multiple reasons to the long repairing time.The publication cites Yasser Saied, Consulting Systems Engineer at cybersecurity company Palo Alto who said only three or four companies in the world are equipped to repair such deep-sea cables. This scarcity of resources means delays are inevitable when multiple disruptions occur.“Worldwide, there are only three or four companies that can fix such a cable” he said.The damaged cables lie deep under the ocean floor, making repairs highly technical. “To fix such a cable, you need very high technology as they are buried deep under the ocean. You need special fibre divers who can go to the depths of the ocean, locate the exact cut and fix it,” Saied told Khaleej Times.“So it is not easy an easy operation and could take months,” he added.Swapnendu M., Solutions Architect at Cisco, told Khaleej Times that damage is often linked to ships anchoring, natural disasters, or, in rare cases, malicious activity. Identifying the exact cause and site of damage is critical but time-consuming, further delaying restoration.Experts also pointed out that fibre cables are vulnerable to natural degradation over time. Such wear makes maintenance harder and contributes to the frequency of incidents every five to ten years.The incident reportedly affected at least four major cables: The South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe 4, the India-Middle East-Western Europe, the FALCON GCX, and the Europe India Gateway. The cuts were initially believed to have occurred off the coast of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.John Wrottesley of the International Cable Protection Committee told the AP that commercial shipping activity is the ""probable cause of damage."" He noted that around 30% of annual cable incidents are caused by dragged anchors, which account for roughly 60 faults per year.","Red Sea cable cut continues to impact internet services in India, Pakistan and the middle east countries.

Does Air figure out Apple’s mid-tier conundrum?





It was coming—we knew it—but now it has happened. The Plus-sized iPhone model, after its three-year run, exists no more. The 6.7-inch variant, a bigger counterpart to the regular iPhone, is being let go for a slimmer, lighter Air. While it isn't a direct replacement for the Plus, it's bigger than the regular iPhone, and sits between the regular iPhone 17 and Pro in terms of price, being $999.The Plus model replaced the mini after it failed to gain buyers during its two-year run, ending with the arrival of iPhone 14 in 2022. But the Plus seems to have met the same fate—unable to find the right number of buyers, the big-sized iPhone is being discontinued only three years later, in favour of Apple 's new direction.All the Plus-sized iPhones—the iPhone 14 Plus, 15 Plus, and 16 Plus—had the same set of features and specifications as their regular counterparts, whether it be the chip, cameras, or even the 60Hz refresh rate. It was the bigger 6.7-inch screen, compared to the regular 6.1-inch screen, and the bigger battery that made it 'Plus.' All that came with a $100 price difference.Although Plus did find its audience in certain markets like India, where larger screens are more popular, but it wasn't enough to keep it around.The mini and Plus both discovered that iPhone buyers tend to lean toward either end of the spectrum: they're often content with paying $100 less for the standard experience or $100 more for Pro features like a faster chip, more cameras and smoother displays.With the Air priced at $999, Apple seems to have taken notes from past missteps. Instead of awkwardly sitting between two categories, the Air tries to carve out its own space—combining the big size with an entirely new form factor. Plus, it has also thrown in some Pro features, like the smoother display and powerful chip. But it has its own cons—a big one would be it having just one single camera (same as the half-price iPhone SE), and the battery life’s also shorter than the regular iPhone. Then, you’d have to put on a case anyway, potentially negating the whole ‘ultra slim' appeal.This transition leaves Plus enthusiasts with some choices: adapt to the regular iPhone 17's smaller size (which is a little bigger than before with a 6.3-inch screen), step up to the Pro, or embrace this sleeker Air concept. But the question remains: will the Air emerge as that one mid-tier iPhone model that Apple has been looking for? We should know that in the coming years.","The Plus-sized iPhone model, after its three-year run, exists no more. The 6.7-inch variant, a bigger counterpart to the regular iPhone, is being let go for a slimmer, lighter Air. While it isn't a direct replacement for the Plus, it's bigger than the regular phone, and sits between the regular and Pro in terms of price.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123808312,imgsize-486846,width-400,resizemode-4/the-plus-iphone-is-dead.jpg"

Elon Musk has issued a striking prediction about the future of artificial intelligence, suggesting that AI could surpass any single human in intelligence as soon as next year (2026) and potentially become smarter than all humans combined by 2030. He made the comment during a recent appearance on the All-In podcast, emphasising both his optimism about AI’s capabilities and his longstanding concern over its rapid development. While experts continue to debate the exact timelines for achieving human-level AI, Musk’s projections underscore the accelerating pace of AI advancement. His remarks also highlight the urgent need for global discussions on the societal, technological, and ethical implications of increasingly powerful AI systems.Although Musk did not specify all motivations, several factors could explain why he made this statement:While Musk’s timeline is aggressive, it aligns loosely with broader expert speculation on human-level machine intelligence (HLMI). A 2017 MIT study estimated a 50% chance of HLMI within 45 years and a 10% chance within 9 years, suggesting that Musk’s forecast is on the optimistic, yet not implausible, side of expert predictions.Additional surveys support this spectrum of expert opinion. The 2016 Survey of AI Experts by Müller and Bostrom, which included 550 AI researchers, similarly found a 50% probability of HLMI within 45 years and a 10% probability within 9 years. More recent AI Impacts Surveys (2016, 2022, 2023) indicate growing optimism, with the 2023 survey of 2,778 AI researchers estimating a 50% chance of HLMI by 2047, reflecting technological breakthroughs like large language models. These findings show that while Musk’s timeline is aggressive, it remains within the broader range of expert projections.Musk’s prediction has sparked debate among experts and the public:The rise of superintelligent AI may profoundly affect society:Musk’s comments feed into the broader discussion on AI ethics, highlighting the need for responsible AI deployment.

Apple Watch Series 11 will keep track of your blood pressure

Apple Watch Ultra 3 is for those who like to go far off in the wilderness



Apple's most affordable Watch SE gets even better

We have the dates for iOS 26 release





Apple just wrapped up its annual fall event, dubbed ""Awe Dropping,"" and it had some genuine 'awe dropping' moments. No, there wasn't the Siri that we were promised a while ago, but there were things like an ""Air"" iPhone, the biggest ""awe dropping"" moment of the show. Then, there were a pair of redesigned Pro iPhones, new AirPods Pro that come after a wait of two years, and the regular iPhones finally have the ProMotion screen — each worthy of being called an ""awe dropping"" moment in its own right. Oh, and worth mentioning, there are new watches as well — the Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, and the SE 3. And we also now have dates for the class of '26 OS updates.With the event over now, here's a wrap up of everything Apple announced at its ""Awe Dropping"" event.18 years later, iPhones have had their 'Air' moment with the iPhone Air. As the name suggests, it's the slimmest iPhone to date, measuring just 5.6 millimeters in thickness and weighing 156 grams. What makes the iPhone Air particularly impressive is its construction – Apple has managed to pack 80 percent recycled titanium into the frame while keeping it this thinness.Replacing the bigger sized Plus model of the iPhone, the iPhone 17 Air sits between the standard iPhone 17 and the Pro models with a price tag of Rs 1,19,900, featuring a 6.5 inches ProMotion screen, the A19 Pro chip, and a single 48MP camera but Apple says it'll do four focal lengths.Oh, it's also the first one to come with Apple's in-house N1 wireless networking chip and C1X cellular modem. All that is packed beneath the pill on the top with the battery in the latter part of the chassis.The ultra-slim device comes with compromises of its own, first being not having two cameras like the regular iPhone but sticking with just one. Though, despite having the larger part of the chassis the battery inside is smaller than the rest of the iPhones, which Apple says will last an ""all-day,"" but if you still need it to go longer, Apple will be selling a power pack for it. Last but not the least, the Air also ditches physical SIM cards entirely, relying solely on eSIM due to its ultra-thin frame.The 'Air' iPhone can be seen as Apple's attempt to create a new category within its iPhone lineup, like it did a few years ago with the Plus, and again few years back with the 'mini.' Although, this time it's sticking to a tried and tested formula of Air, much like how the MacBook Air and iPad Air carved out their own spaces.For a long time, people have been making fun of the stove burner design of the Pro iPhones that came into life over half a decade ago with the iPhone 11 Pro(s). The design was long over Apple's typical 3-year refresh period, but the inevitable has happened this year with the iPhone 17 Pros. The glass that the cameras sit on now spans across the entire length of the rear, and Apple's calling it the ""plateau,"" which moves the half-cut Apple logo down a little to fit neatly inside the MagSafe's magnetic coils.Not really a cosmetic change, but rather a structural change is that the two new Pro models this year now are made of aluminium, switching back from the titanium that has been used for the last two generations of Pro models. The switch to aluminium, Apple says, is because the metal handles heat way better than the titanium ever did. Plus, there's also a vapor chamber inside.Now, this new ""plateau"" isn't just for the looks, but this design creates more room inside for a bigger battery. The Pro Max now gets up to 39 hours of video playback, which is pretty impressive.All rear cameras are now 48MP, including 48MP telephoto camera with a next-generation tetraprism design and a sensor half-a-size larger than before. This enables 8x optical zoom at 200mm – the longest reach ever on an iPhone – while the 4x zoom at 100mm provides classic portrait focal length. Digital zoom goes all the way to 40x if you really need it.As if the Pro iPhones weren't already a filmmaker's favourite, Apple's throwing in some more upgrades. The iPhone 17 Pro(s) now can do ProRes RAW, Apple Log 2, and genlock for syncing multiple cameras, plus Dual Capture for recording front and back cameras simultaneously.The iPhone 17 Pro comes in 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch sizes (the Pro Max), both with Ceramic Shield protection front and back. The A19 Pro chip delivers ""MacBook-level processing power,” in numbers about 40% better sustained performance than last year's model, thanks largely to that vapor chamber keeping things cool.Colours are limited to three this year: deep blue, cosmic orange, and silver. Yeah, there's no black colour this time around. Pricing starts at Rs 1,34,000 for the Pro and Rs 1,49,900 for the Pro Max. For the first time, you can get a Pro Max with 2TB of storage, though that'll cost you Rs 2,29,900.After years of keeping ProMotion locked away in the Pro models, Apple has finally brought 120Hz displays to the regular iPhone 17. It keeps the same look as the last year, but the regular iPhone did undergo a serious redesign a year ago. So no complaints there.The 6.3-inch screen that's also now bigger than before, refreshes at between 1 Hz to 120Hz, and Apple's also managed to bump up the peak brightness to 3,000 nits and trim down the bezels by a bit, though the overall design remains largely unchanged from last year.The two cameras on the rear, which still sits on the good old pill, are now 48MP, including the ultra wide lens that used to be stuck at 12MP. Apple's calling it ""dual fusion"" camera system. The new ultra-wide captures about 4x more detail than before, which should make those sweeping landscape shots look a lot better. The main camera still has that 2x telephoto zoom built right in, so you're getting more versatility without needing extra camera bumps.Apple's also borrowing the Center Stage camera from the iPad for the front. It's a 18MP square sensor that can automatically frame group selfies and rotate between portrait and landscape modes. You can finally take landscape selfies without doing that awkward phone flip. The camera just figures it out on its own.The new A19 chip is about 1.5x faster than the iPhone 13's processor. Not a number toBattery life stretches to 30 hours of video playback, which is a solid jump from last year's numbers.Apple's doubled the starting storage to 256GB, finally ditching that cramped 128GB base model. The iPhone 17 shows up in five colours – black, lavender, mist blue, sage, and white – starting at Rs 82,900 when pre-orders open September 12.The crossbody straps for phones, and even for iPhones have long existed. But, it's now Apple will be selling it themselves, and it's made in the typical Apple fashion. It's made from recycled yarn and has these flexible magnets that let you adjust the length easily. Comes in 10 different colours, so you can probably find something that matches your style. At $59, it's not cheap, but it'll definitely beat those weird third-party solutions.Apple's FineWoven cases didn't really have a good run. So, it's having another go at the whole fabric cases thing, since it won't use leather ever again. The new ones are called TechWoven and these use multiple coloured yarns to create a dimensional texture feel. Apple says they're scratch and stain resistant too, which is always nice. These come in black, blue, purple, sienna, and green.iPhone Air is getting its own special treatment with ultra-thin cases that won't ruin that svelte profile. There's a translucent case in frost and shadow colours, plus a bumper case that comes in four matching colours for those who want minimal protection without the bulk.For the regular iPhone 17, Apple's keeping things simple with clear cases and silicone options in five colours: black, neon yellow, light moss, anchor blue, and purple fog.It's been almost three years since Apple updated the AirPods Pro, and the wait was worth it. Their party trick? These have heart rate sensors in them, and they can track your workouts. That aside, they still very much are the AirPods, so yes they get better noise cancellation, or as Apple put it in numbers these can cancel out noise 4x more than the original AirPods Pro. Oh, and they improve on the sound as well.Apple completely redesigned the fit based on over 10,000 ear scans and more than 100,000 hours of research, which sounds like overkill but apparently resulted in earbuds that fit way more people properly. The ear tips now come in five sizes including a new XXS option, and they're foam-infused for better noise isolation. They've also bumped up the water resistance to IP57, so they should handle sweaty workouts just fine.There's a custom sensor that pulses infrared light 256 times per second to measure blood flow, and combined with data from your iPhone, it can track over 50 different workout types. You can close your Activity rings, track calories burned, and get personalised coaching with Workout Buddy that uses Apple Intelligence to give you motivational prompts based on your fitness history.Live Translation is another one of the new features of the AirPods Pro 3, and as the name implies you can have conversations with people who speak different languages, and the AirPods will translate in real-time. It supports English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish at launch, with more languages coming later this year.Apple says they’ll last up to 8 hours with noise cancellation on, and in Transparency mode, you get up to 10 hours.The AirPods Pro 3 cost Rs 25,900 and you can pre-order them today for September 19 availability.The Apple Watch Series 11's headline feature is hypertension notifications, which use the optical heart sensor to detect signs of chronic high blood pressure – a condition that affects 1.3 billion people globally and often goes undiagnosed. The feature analyses how blood vessels respond to heartbeats over 30-day periods, alerting users if consistent signs of hypertension are detected.Sleep tracking gets a major upgrade with the new Sleep Score feature, which provides transparent metrics about sleep quality based on duration, consistency, wake frequency, and time spent in each sleep stage. The scoring algorithms were developed using over 5 million nights of sleep data from Apple's studies.The Series 11 also features 5G cellular connectivity for the first time, a redesigned antenna system for better coverage, and Ion-X glass that's twice as scratch-resistant. Battery life extends to 24 hours.Apple Watch Series 11 is available in aluminium and titanium finishes starting at Rs 46,900.The Watch Ultra 3 is still very much the ultimate sport and adventure watch. Now, it features built-in satellite communications that Apple says should come handy when you're completely off the grid. Those wearing it can text emergency services, message friends and family, and share their location via satellite — all from their wrist.Apple says the satellite feature required some engineering, making them reengineer the radio to cover more frequencies and redesigning the antenna to double signal strength for communication with satellites 800 miles above Earth traveling at 15,000 mph.The Ultra 3 also features the largest Apple Watch display ever thanks to LTPO3 technology, which makes borders 24% thinner while increasing screen area. Battery life extends to 42 hours in normal use and 72 hours in Low Power Mode. The Ultra 3 starts at Rs 89,900 and will be available in natural and black titanium.The SE 3 brings many premium features down to the Rs 25,900 price point, including an always-on display for the first time, 5G cellular connectivity, and fast charging that's twice as fast as the previous generation.Health features include sleep score, retrospective ovulation estimates, sleep apnea notifications, and wrist temperature sensing. The S10 chip enables on-device Siri, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, and voice isolation for clearer calls.The SE 3 maintains the same 18-hour battery life despite adding the Always-On display and comes with cover glass that's 4x more crack-resistant than the previous generation.While this never gets talked about during all the flashy new hardware Apple has to show during its Fall showcase, it's always in the fine print where Apple spills the beans on the release dates for its software updates, and all of Apple's 2026 operating systems — iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, and watchOS 26 — are releasing on September 15. The 2026 batch of software updates brings the new ""Liquid Glass"" design language that adds translucent elements throughout the interface.","Apple just wrapped up its annual fall event, dubbed ""Awe Dropping,"" and it had some genuine 'awe dropping' moments. As the name suggests, it's the slimmest iPhone to date, measuring just 5.6 millimeters in thickness and weighing 156 grams. There were a pair of redesigned Pro iPhones, new AirPods Pro that come after a wait of two years, and the regular iPhones finally have the ProMotion screen. Oh, and worth mentioning, there are new watches as well — the Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, and SE 3. And we also now have dates","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123795955,imgsize-34008,width-400,resizemode-4/apple-ceo-tim-cook-speaks-on-stage-during-an-announcement-of-new-products-at-apple-park-on-tuesday-sept-9-2025-in-cupertino-calif-ap-photogodofredo-a-vsquez.jpg"

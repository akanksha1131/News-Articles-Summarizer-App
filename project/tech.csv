Tariff Shock continues for Korean car companies

US President Donald Trump's Tariff Shock continues for companies worldwide. Trump's recent decision to lower tariffs on Japanese auto imports could put Hyundai and Kia at a significant disadvantage in the American market. The White House announced that it would cut the tariff on Japanese cars from 27.5% to 15%, a move that takes effect seven days after the executive order is published.This change means that while Japanese carmakers will enjoy a reduced tariff, Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis will still be subject to a 25% tariff. This is a considerable setback, as the US had previously agreed to lower the tariff on Korean cars to the same level as Japan.“As evidenced by the steep earnings fall of Hyundai Motor and Kia, the tariff shock has become a pressing issue for the survival of local carmakers,” a Korean auto industry official told Korea Times.The official added, “Given the strong presence of Japanese brands such as Toyota and Honda in the U.S., the government should take steps for Trump to rapidly sign the order on Korean car imports as well.”This disparity in tariffs could hurt the price competitiveness of Korean automakers in the U.S., which is a critical market for them. Last year, the U.S. accounted for 54% of Hyundai's exports and 38% of Kia's. With no immediate plans to raise prices, they risk absorbing the financial burden of the higher tariff, which has already contributed to a combined operating profit loss of approximately 1.6 trillion won for the two companies in the second quarter. This loss is expected to increase in the third quarter unless the U.S. also signs an order to reduce tariffs for Korean auto imports.In response to the news, industry officials are urging the Korean government to push the U.S. to take similar action for Korean carmakers. An official from the auto industry stated that the tariff issue is ""a pressing issue for the survival of local carmakers,"" especially given the strong market presence of Japanese brands like Toyota and Honda. Last year, Hyundai and Kia's combined U.S. market share was 10.8%, while seven Japanese brands had a combined share of over 37%.","US President Donald Trump's Tariff Shock continues for companies worldwide.

"Europe bets on Supercomputer Jupiter to takes on China and the US in AI, and do what it has 'NEVER' been able to do so far",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/europe-bets-on-supercomputer-jupiter-to-takes-on-china-and-the-us-in-ai-and-do-what-it-has-never-been-able-to-do-so-far/articleshow/123738558.cms,"What is the Jupiter Supercomputer



Apps of Supercomputer Jupiter

It will not be really an exaggeration to say that Europe has been a laggard in technology. There are far and few European technology companies that have a global reach and recognition. It is no different in AI race, which too is dominated by American and Chinese companies. Europe now seems to be aiming to change this. As to how, with its new Supercomputer called Jupiter. The Jupiter supercomputer, Europe's fastest and first exascale system, was officially unveiled on June 5 in Germany. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that this new supercomputer could help Europe ""catch up and then keep pace"" with AI leaders like the United States and China.Experts see Jupiter as a significant step for Europe in the AI sector, where it has lagged behind the US and China. A recent Stanford University report revealed that in 2024, U.S. institutions produced 40 ""notable"" AI models, compared to 15 for China and just three for Europe.According to a report by news agency AFP, during the inauguration, Chancellor Merz acknowledged the ""neck-and-neck race"" between the U.S. and China for AI dominance. However, he emphasized that Europe can still make up ground, stressing the need for ""sovereign computing capacities"" as a matter of both economic competitiveness and national security.Jupiter was built by a consortium that includes the French tech giant Atos's subsidiary Eviden and the German group ParTec. Despite this, the system's reliance on U.S.-made Nvidia chips highlights Europe's continued dependence on American technology.Located at the Juelich Supercomputing Centre , Jupiter is claimed to be Europe's first ""exascale"" supercomputer, capable of performing at least one quintillion (one billion billion) calculations per second. The U.S. currently has three such computers.The system is housed in a 3,600-square-meter facility, roughly half the size of a football pitch, and contains about 24,000 Nvidia chips. The project's development and operational costs over the next few years, totaling 500 million euros ($580 million), are being jointly funded by the European Union and Germany.According to Thomas Lippert, head of the Juelich center, Jupiter is ""a leap forward in the performance of computing in Europe,"" being 20 times more powerful than any other computer in Germany. Its immense processing power will be accessible to researchers and companies across various fields, including training AI models.Beyond AI, Jupiter has a wide range of applications. Researchers plan to use it to create more accurate and long-term climate forecasts, which could help predict extreme weather events. While current models can simulate climate change over a decade, scientists believe Jupiter will enable them to forecast up to 30 years and possibly even up to 100 years.The supercomputer will also be used to realistically simulate brain processes for research into diseases like Alzheimer's and to optimize clean energy technologies, such as simulating air flows around wind turbines.Jupiter requires an estimated 11 megawatts of power, equivalent to the energy consumption of thousands of homes. However, its operators claim it is the most energy-efficient among the world's fastest computer systems, using advanced hardware and water-cooling systems. The waste heat generated by the computer will also be repurposed to heat nearby buildings.","Jupiter is Europe's first ""exascale"" supercomputer, capable of performing at least one quintillion (one billion billion) calculations per second.

Nvidia reportedly is very upset with the new AI Act -- AI GAIN Act -- introduced recently. Nvidia has voiced strong concerns that the proposed AI GAIN Act would stifle global competition and negatively impact the American economy. The company said that the bill could have effects similar to the AI Diffusion Rule, which limited the computing power available to different countries.Short for the Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence Act, the new legislation is part of the National Defense Authorization Act. It would require U.S. chipmakers to prioritize domestic orders for advanced processors before fulfilling international requests.According to a report in Reuters, a spokesperson for Nvidia said that the company never gives priority to foreign customers over American ones. ""In trying to solve a problem that does not exist, the proposed bill would restrict competition worldwide in any industry that uses mainstream computing chips,"" the spokesperson said. The company added that the US has always been and will continue to be its largest market.Both the AI GAIN Act and the AI Diffusion Rule are efforts by the U.S. government to prioritize domestic needs and ensure American firms have access to high-end chips. This comes amid concerns that China could use advanced AI capabilities to enhance its military.If passed, the legislation would impose new trade restrictions, requiring exporters to obtain licenses for shipments of chips that exceed a specific performance threshold. The bill states that it should be U.S. policy to ""deny licenses for the export of the most powerful AI chips, including such chips with total processing power of 4,800 or above."" It also aims to restrict the export of advanced chips to foreign entities when U.S. companies are waiting for the same chips.These rules are similar to some of the conditions under former President Joe Biden's AI Diffusion Rule, which assigned specific levels of computing power to U.S. allies and other nations. The bill outlines specific technical thresholds to classify a chip as 'advanced,' taking a page from the Biden administration's 2023 book when it comes to benchmarks, but making them stronger when it comes to memory bandwidth.Last month, President Donald Trump reportedly made a deal with Nvidia, allowing the company to resume exports of previously banned AI chips to China in exchange for a portion of its sales.",The AI GAIN Act would require U.S. chipmakers to prioritize domestic orders for advanced processors before fulfilling international requests.

What the lawsuit said against Anthropic’s use of copyrighted material for AI training



“This settlement sends a powerful message to AI companies and creators alike that taking copyrighted works from these pirate websites is wrong.”

Made in India Space Chip: Vikram-32 Explained

AI startup Anthropic has agreed to pay at least $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit with a group of authors. The settlement, which was filed this week, addresses claims that the Amazon and Google-backed AI startup illegally used the authors' books to train its AI models. The agreement includes a payment of approximately $3,000 per book, plus interest, and requires Anthropic to destroy the datasets containing the pirated material. Both publishers and AI companies have closely watched this settlement as a potential benchmark for copyright infringement in the AI era. If approved, it would be the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history. The case highlights the ongoing legal challenges faced by AI companies over the use of copyrighted material to train their systems. In a statement to Bloomberg, an Anthropic spokesperson said:In a court filing, Anthropic stated that it faced “inordinate pressure” to reach an agreement, as going to trial carried the risk of potentially devastating damages that could have reached up to $1 trillion.The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, was initiated last year by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson. According to the filing, the suit claimed Anthropic engaged in “large-scale copyright infringement by downloading and commercially exploiting books that it obtained from allegedly pirated datasets.”In June, a judge determined that Anthropic’s use of books to train its AI models qualified as “fair use,” but still ordered a trial to examine whether the company infringed copyright by sourcing works from the databases Library Genesis and Pirate Library Mirror. As noted in this week’s filing, the trial was scheduled to begin in December.In a statement, Justin Nelson, the attorney for the plaintiffs, said:This settlement is one of the first to emerge from the many copyright lawsuits brought against AI companies such as OpenAI, Facebook-parent Meta and Midjourney. These companies are also accused of misusing proprietary online content.","AI startup Anthropic has agreed to pay at least $1.5 billion to settle a class- action lawsuit with a group of authors.

“Don’t wait for perfection…”: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Jiu-Jitsu Mantra is reshaping Meta and himself,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dont-wait-for-perfection-meta-ceo-mark-zuckerbergs-jiu-jitsu-mantra-is-reshaping-meta-and-himself/articleshow/123737255.cms,"From humility to innovation



Meta’s political pivot



Once caricatured as a robotic tech executive, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has undergone a striking transformation—one he credits not to a boardroom epiphany, but to the mat of a Jiu-Jitsu gym.In a revealing 2023 interview with Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg shared how the martial art taught him to embrace discomfort, failure, and even public embarrassment. “Your ability to keep doing interesting things is your willingness to be embarrassed,” he said, explaining how grappling as a beginner reshaped his leadership philosophy.Zuckerberg’s Jiu-Jitsu lessons weren’t just physical—they became a metaphor for Meta’s evolving strategy. Rather than waiting for perfection, he began championing rapid product releases to gather real-world feedback. This mindset fueled Meta’s ambitious long-term projects, from virtual reality to generative AI.Image overhaul: From hoodie to high fashionThe shift wasn’t just internal. After years of criticism—especially following the Cambridge Analytica scandal—Zuckerberg leaned into personal reinvention. Meta CEO He competed in Jiu-Jitsu tournaments, appeared on podcasts with self-deprecating humour, and ditched his signature hoodie for tailored designer wear.Meta’s “Year of Efficiency” in 2023 marked a turning point. The company’s stock rebounded, and Zuckerberg’s reputation as a disciplined, focused leader began to solidify. By 2024, he was no longer apologizing for issues he felt weren’t Meta’s fault—signaling a more assertive public persona.In 2025, with Donald Trump back in the White House, Zuckerberg’s leadership took a more conservative turn. Meta ended third-party fact-checking, introduced “community notes,” and appointed UFC CEO Dana White to its board. Policy chief Nick Clegg was replaced by Joel Kaplan, a former GOP lobbyist.The company also scaled back its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives—a move that sparked internal dissent but drew praise from some political circles. Critics argue that Meta’s shift reflects broader tensions between tech platforms and regulatory pressures."," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has undergone a striking transformation.

Demanding accountability and transparency



'ChatGPT killed our teenage son', so allege parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide in April this year. The parents have filed lawsuit against OpenAI, the creator of the popular chatbot ChatGPT. The suit alleges that ChatGPT acted as a ""coach"" and helped the teenager, Adam Raine, plan his death. Now a coalition of US attorneys general has issued a stern warning to OpenAI, demanding stronger safeguards to protect children and teens from potential harm caused by AI chatbots.As reported by TechCrunch, the California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings met with OpenAI representatives and sent an open letter expressing deep concern over the platform’s safety protocols. Their intervention comes just one week after Bonta and 44 other attorneys general contacted 12 leading AI companies to address mounting risks to young users.The letter references two recent tragedies: the suicide of a young Californian after extended interactions with an OpenAI chatbot, and a murder-suicide in Connecticut.“Whatever safeguards were in place did not work,” Bonta and Jennings wrote, emphasizing that AI tools must be held to higher safety standards when interacting with vulnerable populationsThe attorneys general are now investigating OpenAI’s proposed restructuring into a for-profit entity, raising questions about whether its original nonprofit mission — to benefit humanity — is being upheld. They’ve requested detailed information about OpenAI’s current safety measures and governance, and urged the company to take immediate remedial steps where necessary.“Before we get to benefiting, we need to ensure that adequate safety measures are in place to not harm,” the letter states.","A coalition of US attorneys general has issued a stern warning to OpenAI, demanding stronger safeguards to protect children and teens from potential harm caused by AI chatbots.

US President Donald Trump has recently threatened to imposetariffs on countries that implement digital taxes. This decision came just days after a private meeting with Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Meta Platforms . Citing sources familiar with the meeting, a report by Bloomberg stated that Zuckerberg raised concerns about these digital service taxes , which are levied on the revenue tech companies generate from users in a specific country. Following the discussion, Trump stated that he was putting all countries with such taxes “on notice” and that the US will impose “substantial” tariffs and export restrictions on US semiconductors unless “these discriminatory actions are removed.”According to Trump, digital taxes will harm US technology companies while givingHe warned that unless thesethe US would impose tariffs and export restrictions on semiconductors. In a recent post shared on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump wrote:In a statement to Bloomberg, Meta confirmed the meeting between Trump and Zuckerberg. A company spokesperson said:Trump’s recent comments have reignited tensions over digital services taxes imposed by several US trading partners, a dispute that predates his latest meeting with Zuckerberg.Washington has long argued that such taxes, which may be levied by countries including France, Italy, Austria, Spain, and the UK, disproportionately target American tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Since Trump’s return to office, Zuckerberg has worked to strengthen his relationship with the president, who once labelled him a “criminal.” Efforts have included changing Meta’s moderation and diversity policies, contributing $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, and making repeated visits to the White House and Mar-a-Lago.Zuckerberg has also expanded his Washington footprint by purchasing homes near the vice president’s residence and bringing Trump allies into Meta’s leadership. Their improved ties have led to frequent discussions on topics ranging from artificial intelligence to European tech regulations.","US President Donald Trump has recently threatened to imposetariffs on countries that implement digital taxes.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Geoffrey Hinton , a leading figure in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), has sounded an alarm about the technology’s potential for harm. The recent public frenzy over AI tools like ChatGPT has caused Hinton to shift from accelerating AI development to raising deep concerns about its future. He now believes that AI poses a grave threat to humanity, saying that the technology can help any person to create a nuclear bomb.Hinton described a chilling scenario where AI could enable an average person to create a bioweapon.“A normal person assisted by AI will soon be able to build bioweapons and that is terrible,” he said, adding, “Imagine if an average person in the street could make a nuclear bomb.”Hinton also discussed a range of topics, including the nuclear-level threats posed by AI, his own use of AI tools, and even how a chatbot played a role in his recent breakup.Recently, Hinton cautioned that AI could soon surpass human capabilities, including emotional manipulation. He suggested that AI's ability to learn from vast datasets enables it to influence human feelings and behaviours more effectively than humans.Hinton’s concern stems from his belief that AI is truly intelligent. He argued that, by any definition of the term, “AI is intelligent.” He used several analogies to explain that an AI's experience of reality is not so different from a human’s.“It seems very obvious to me. If you talk to these things and ask them questions, it understands,” Hinton explained.“There’s very little doubt in the technical community that these things will get smarter,” he added.However, not everyone agrees with Hinton's view. His former colleague and co-winner of the Turing Award , Yann LeCun , who is now the chief AI scientist at Meta , believes that large language models are limited and cannot meaningfully interact with the physical world.","Geoffrey Hinton, a leading figure in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), has sounded an alarm about the technology’s potential for harm.

The US tech industry's eight trillion-dollar companies have collectively gained a staggering $420 billion in market value, and a key driver of this week's rally was the resolution of Google ’s long-running antitrust case, analysts have said. Despite a slip in Nvidia's shares, this surge lifted their total value to an immense $21 trillion, now making up roughly 36% of the S&P 500—a proportion so dominant that analysts say it has “no comparisons” in history.According to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, told CNBC by email that the combined megacap of tech companies is a proportion so great by historical standards that “there are no comparisons.”A federal judge ruled against forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser or break up its business. This decision sent shares of Alphabet (Google’s parent company) soaring by over 10% for the week. It also boosted Apple, as the ruling allows their existing multi-billion-dollar deal—where Google pays Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones—to continue.Analysts at Wedbush Securities said the ruling “removed a huge overhang” and a “black cloud” from both companies, clearing the way for a deeper partnership involving Google's Gemini AI models.A significant factor in the judge's decision was the emergence of generative AI, with new players like OpenAI and Anthropic altering the market landscape and making it more competitive than traditional search.Another tech titan that benefited from the AI boom was Broadcom. Following a strong earnings report, CEO Hock Tan announced that his company had secured a new $10 billion contract with a major AI client. Several analysts and news reports suggest this new customer is OpenAI.This partnership, combined with Broadcom’s custom chips already used by Google and Meta, helped the company jump 13% this week, cementing its place in the trillion-dollar club with a market value of around $1.6 trillion.","The US tech industry's eight trillion-dollar companies have collectively gained a staggering $420 billion in market value.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon stated that Intel's current chip production technology isn't advanced enough for Qualcomm to consider it a supplier. In an interview on Bloomberg Television's ""Bloomberg Tech"" on Friday (September 5), Amon said that while Qualcomm would like to use Intel for manufacturing, it will stick with its current partners, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ( TSMC ) and Samsung Electronics Co.“Intel is not an option today. We would like Intel to be an option,” Amon said, explaining that if Intel is able to advance its manufacturing techniques to produce more efficient chips, then Qualcomm would consider becoming a customer.Qualcomm, which makes the processors at the heart of most Android smartphones, is now pushing its technology into new markets like the automotive industry. This move is aimed at securing growth that doesn't depend on the smartphone market.The company announced a new self-driving product that will be used in BMW's upcoming iX3 sports utility vehicle. Amon highlighted the advantages of the new Snapdragon Ride Pilot system, which offers powerful computing similar to a data center server but requires very little power.Amon said the system can be scaled from basic driver assistance to a full-on autonomous mode without draining the car's battery.""We design all of our chips assuming there's a battery on the other side, not plugged into the wall,"" Amon said.

Why EU fined Google



What Trump said about EU’s fine on Google

Europe today “hit” another great American company, Google, with a $3.5 Billion Dollar fine, effectively taking money that would otherwise go to American Investments and Jobs. This is on top of the many other Fines and Taxes that have been issued against Google and other American Tech Companies, in particular. Very unfair, and the American Taxpayer will not stand for it! As I have said before, my Administration will NOT allow these discriminatory actions to stand. Apple, as an example, was forced to pay $17 Billion Dollars in a Fine that, in my opinion, should not have been charged — They should get their money back! We cannot let this happen to brilliant and unprecedented American Ingenuity and, if it does, I will be forced to start a Section 301 proceeding to nullify the unfair penalties being charged to these Taxpaying American Companies.

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has instituted a new hands-on leadership policy requiring his personal review and approval of every major chip design before tape-out, marking a significant shift toward centralized oversight in the company's product development process. The policy aims to improve execution and reduce development costs as the struggling chipmaker works to regain its competitive edge.The new discipline is part of Tan's broader strategy to strengthen Intel's product roadmap and improve financial performance, following the company's first unprofitable year since 1986. Intel posted a net loss of $18.8 billion for 2024 and has been working to streamline operations under Tan's leadership since he took over as CEO in March 2025.Tan has directed engineering teams to define next-generation product families with ""clean and simple architectures, better cost structures and simplified SKU stacks,"" according to a company message sent to employees in July. The CEO's hands-on approach represents a departure from traditional semiconductor industry practices, where design decisions typically flow through multiple management layers.The policy comes as Intel faces mounting pressure from competitors, particularly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), in both manufacturing capabilities and customer relationships. Tan has also been working to reduce Intel's workforce by approximately 15%, cutting management layers by about 50% in the second quarter of 2025.Intel's foundry business has struggled to attract major external customers like Apple and Nvidia, who continue to rely on TSMC for chip manufacturing. The company is now focusing resources on its 14A manufacturing process while reconsidering its approach to the 18A process that consumed billions in development costs.The new review policy is part of Intel's broader transformation efforts, which include consolidating operations, slowing construction projects, and refining the company's artificial intelligence strategy to focus on inference and agentic AI applications.",Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has instituted a new hands-on leadership policy requiring his personal review and approval of every major chip design before tape-out.

President Donald Trump has said that his administration will impose tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies that are not shifting production to the US, reports Reuters. Speaking ahead of the high-profile dinner he hosted at White House recently, Trump said “Yeah, I have discussed it with the people here. Chips and semiconductors - we will be putting tariffs on companies that aren't coming in. We will be putting a tariff very shortly”. He, however, did not share any exact rate or time.“We will be putting a very substantial tariff, not that high, but fairly substantial tariff with the understanding that if they come into the country, if they are coming in, building, planning to come in, there will not be a tariff,” Trump told reporters.“If they are not coming in, there is a tariff,” Trump reiterated.He then pointed at Tim Cook saying “Like, I would say (Apple CEO) Tim Cook would be in pretty good shape”. The Apple CEO, at the dinner, committed a domestic investment commitment of $600 billion over the next four years.Last month, Trump said that the US will impose a tariff of about 100% on imports of semiconductors but it will not apply to companies that are manufacturing in the US or have committed to do so.“Tim, how much money will Apple be investing in the United States? I know it's a very large amount. You were elsewhere before, and now you're really coming home in a big way. How much money will you be investing?” Trump asked.To this, CEO Tim Cook responded: “$600 billion.” He then went on to credit Trump for creating conditions for Apple’s growth. Cook said “I want to thank you for setting the tone such that we could make a major investment in the United States... That says a lot about your focus and your leadership and your focus on innovation”.Trump’s question appeared to reference Apple’s growing presence in India. Earlier this year, he told Cook: “I don’t want you building in India.” The remark came after Apple confirmed plans to expand production outside China.According to reports, Apple is working to assemble about 25% of global iPhones in India in the coming years. The company is expected to invest around $2.5 billion to raise production capacity from over 40 million to about 60 million units annually.","President Donald Trump has said that his administration will impose tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies that are not shifting production to the US.

Meta responds to the lawsuit



Life as “the other Mark Zuckerberg”



It’s Mark Zuckerberg vs Mark Zuckerberg. In a bizarre case which sounds like an episode from a comedy show, an Indiana based bankruptcy lawyer named Mark S. Zuckerberg has filed a lawsuit against Meta and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg after years of his Facebook accounts being wrongly suspended for “impersonating” the billionaire tech founder.As reported by TechCrunch, the attorney, who has been practising law since a long before Facebook existed, said that Meta’s automated moderation systems have repeatedly flagged both his personal and business accounts as fake. His commercial Facebook page, which is used to advertise his legal services has been disabled by the company for five times in the past eight years.In one 2020 email to Meta, the lawyer vented his frustration with the touch of humour: “If you happen to run into the younger, richer Mark Zuckerberg, tell him I said hi and he causes me great aggravation each day.""Zuckerberg says that these repeated bans have cost him real money including $11,000 in paid advertising that was rendered useless when his law firm’s page was taken down. He likened it to “buying a billboard on the side of the highway” only to have it covered up before anyone could see it.He also added that despite submitting multiple forms of ID, credit cards and photos to prove his identity, the suspension kept on happening. His most recent ban was in May this year which was lifted only after he filed the lawsuit in Marion Superior Court, accusing Meta of negligence and breach of contract.Meta has acknowledged the error, telling local media that account was disabled due to an error and it has been since reinstated. The company says it is working to prevent similar mistakes in the future.In order to prove his identity, the lawyer also created a website called iammarkzuckerberg.com — chronicling the mix-ups, from prank call accusations to awkward encounters at events. While the name occasionally works in his favour (like getting a better restaurant table), he says the confusion has been more trouble than it’s worth.","Indiana based bankruptcy lawyer named Mark S.

A painting believed to have been stolen by the Nazis during World War II has been recovered after it was spotted in an online real estate listing . The painting, Giuseppe Ghislandi 's Portrait of a Lady, had been missing for 80 years. It was found hanging in a home in Argentina, which belonged to a deceased SS officer. After the artwork was identified from the photos of a real estate website listing, the family in possession of the painting turned it over to the authorities. The painting was one of more than a thousand artworks looted by the Nazis from the collection of a Jewish art dealer in 1940. It was last seen in the hands of SS officer Friedrich Kadgien, who fled Germany after the war and settled in Argentina. The artwork was discovered when Kadgien's daughter listed the family home for sale online. When authorities arrived at the house to investigate, they found the painting had been replaced with a tapestry. However, the family ultimately chose to turn the piece in.In a statement to The New York Times, a federal prosecutor named Carlos Martínez said:That, hopefully, signals it is finally on the path to returning home. According to the report, the family of Goudstikker—the art dealer who was forced to give up the painting—has filed a claim seeking its return.Regarding the Kadgien children, it seems their troubles aren’t over yet. As per the report, they were scheduled for a court hearing this week, where they could still face charges for concealing the artwork.The report also suggests the family may hold additional stolen pieces, as at least two other paintings were recovered from another residence linked to one of Kadgien’s daughters.","The painting, Giuseppe Ghislandi's Portrait of a Lady, had been missing for 80 years.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is reportedly planning to produce its first artificial intelligence (AI) chip next year. According to a Financial Times report, the chip will be co-designed with US semiconductor giant Broadcom and is likely to chip in 2026. OpenAI, it says, plans to put the chip to use internally. The move follows the strategy of other tech giants such as Google, Amazon and Meta who have already designed their own chips to power AI-related workloads.The FT report cites Broadcom’s chief executive Hock Tan who earlier this week referred to a mystery new customer committing to $10bn in orders. The deal marks the fourth major client for Broadcom in this executive, he told analysts during the company’s earnings call.Tan said the agreement has boosted Broadcom’s growth outlook, bringing “immediate and fairly substantial demand,” with chip shipments for the customer set to begin next year.However, Broadcom did not disclose customer names. Reports last year suggested the two companies had already begun initial collaboration, though the timeline for large-scale production had been unclear.Nvidia still leads the AI hardware market, with big tech companies as its main customers. OpenAI has long been one of Nvidia’s biggest buyers. But OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has repeatedly highlighted the need for more computing power to support products like ChatGPT and train large AI models. Last month, he said OpenAI would double its computing capacity “over the next 5 months” to meet demand for its new GPT-5 model.HSBC analysts recently said Broadcom’s custom chip business could see faster growth than Nvidia’s by 2026. Broadcom’s shares are up more than 30 percent this year and rose nearly 9 percent in pre-market trading in New York on Friday after the earnings update.","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI reportedly planning to produce its first artificial intelligence (AI) chip next year.

Elon Musk Missing at Trump’s White House Dinner- Internet Explodes

Donald Trump says Elon Musk has no choice but to return to GOP

President Donald Trump hosted a high-powered group of tech executives at the White House on Thursday, September 4. As big as the chatter about the CEOs of the biggest technology companies of America attending the dinner, was also the chatter of Tesla CEO's absence. The media was abuzz about the notable absence of Elon Musk , once a close ally of Trump who was tasked with running the Department of Government Efficiency, from the guest list. Musk had a public breakup with Donald Trump earlier this year.However, it seems Elon Musk was invited to the White House dinner. Tesla CEO confirmed the same in a post on Twitter. Responding to Twitter user Natalie F Danelishen, who is said to be a popular internet personality, Musk said that he was invited but could not attend and so sent a representative.Quoting a Twitter post about the White House dinner, Natalie F Danelishen wrote, ""Bill Gates but not Elon Musk….wtf?"". To this Elon Musk replied, ""I was invited, but unfortunately could not attend. A representative of mine will be there.""Responding to the tech CEO's reply Natalie thanked White House with a heart emoji. ""Happy to hear you were invited ❤️ Thanks @WhiteHouse,"" she wrote.More than two dozen major tech leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Google founder Sergey Brin and Oracle CEO Safra Catz.Talking about Elon Musk, Trump recently said that his former ally, Elon Musk, has ""no choice"" but to return to the Republican Party, despite their highly public and bitter feud earlier this year. Speaking on the Scott Jennings Show in an interview recorded Tuesday, Trump framed Musk’s political future as a binary decision between the GOP and ""radical left lunatics.""The President's comments came after a public and acrimonious split between the two influential figures, which included social media insults and threats of government contract terminations. The rift appears to have started over Musk's opposition to a tax bill that he claimed would increase the deficit, though the legislation also ended tax credits for electric vehicles that benefited his company, Tesla.Despite the past friction, Trump largely offered compliments to the tech billionaire, describing him as a ""good man"" and downplaying their disagreements. ""He got off the reservation, incorrectly, and that's okay,"" Trump said of the Tesla CEO. ""He’s 80% super genius, and then 20% he’s got some problems. And when he works out the 20% he’ll be great, but he’s got some difficulty.""Musk, who has previously floated the idea of creating a third political party, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","President Donald Trump hosted a high-powered group of tech executives at the White House on Thursday, September 4.

Intel’s chief financial officer (CFO) has announced that 2026 will be a decisive year for its manufacturing technology, revealing whether the company is ready to advance its capabilities with a new process. Speaking at Citi's 2025 Global TMT Conference, Intel's CFO Dave Zinsner said the company won't know until 2026 if it's ready to approve a manufacturing method called 14A. This technology is key to Intel's plan to become a leader in the tech world again.“Sometime in ’26, we’ll have a good feel for how things are going,” Zinsner stated. His comment came weeks after the US government announced that it has taken 10% of the company’s ownership.Zinsner reiterated a previous stance that the company would only build 14A manufacturing capacity if it secured commitments from external customers. While he called this position “financial common sense,” the approach has concerned analysts and investors since it was first outlined by CEO Lip-Bu Tan in July.The hesitation to move forward without external demand suggested to some that Intel was wavering on its bid for technological dominance.When asked about the possibility of other investors taking a stake in Intel’s manufacturing operations, Zinsner said the company was open to it. However, he noted that the recent agreement with the Trump administration requires Intel to maintain a majority position in that business, making outside investment unlikely in the near term.“It’s not inconceivable that we do that,” he said, adding, “I think the likelihood is that it won’t happen anytime soon because it’s not quite investable yet.”Zinsner clarified that the government's stake is a passive holding, and it will align with the board's recommendations. This is contingent on Intel retaining its commitment and majority ownership of its manufacturing operations, he said.",Intel's CFO Dave Zinsner said the company won't know until 2026 if it's ready to approve a manufacturing method called 14A.

President Donald Trump hosted a dinner at White House where he invited tech CEOs. In a jovial moment, he congratulated Google CEO Sundar Pichai on the company's recent legal triumph. The exchange, which took place Thursday (September 4) evening, followed a landmark antitrust ruling that saw Google avoid a court-ordered breakup.“Well you had a very good day yesterday,"" Trump said to Pichai, ""Google had a very good day yesterday. Do you want to talk about that big day you had yesterday?""The decision by US District Judge Amit Mehta on Tuesday (September 2) caused Alphabet 's market cap to soar by $230 billion. The ruling was the culmination of a 2020 lawsuit brought by the US Department of Justice (DOJ), which had previously found Google held an illegal monopoly in internet search.Replying to the question, Sundar Pichai said, ""I'm glad it's over,"" causing an eruption of laughter from the other table guests. He added that the company appreciated the “constructive dialogue” with the Trump administration.“It’s a long process. Appreciate that your administration had a constructive dialogue, and we were able to get it to some resolution,” Pichai added.Pichai then pivoted to a discussion on artificial intelligence (AI), commending the administration's “Winning the AI Race: America's AI Action Plan,” launched in July.“The AI moment is one of the most transformative moments any of us have ever seen or will see in our lifetimes, so making sure the US is at the forefront — and I think your administration is investing a lot,” Pichai said.“Already the AI action plan under your leadership I think is a great start, and we look forward to working together. And thanks for your leadership,” he added.Trump also blamed the Biden administration for the lawsuit against Google.“Biden was the one who prosecuted that lawsuit, you know that right?” Trump said. It is to be noted that the DOJ had filed the case during Trump's first term.The exchange also occurred amid ongoing legal issues between the two parties. Google's online video platform, YouTube, is currently in discussions with Trump's lawyers over a lawsuit he filed more than four years ago, accusing the company of unlawful censorship. The lawsuit stems from the suspension of Trump's social media accounts following the January 6 2021 Capitol incident.","President Donald Trump hosted a dinner at White House where he invited tech CEOs.

Who is behind this cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover

Can Lyne Originals Coolpods 11 Solve Your Problems?

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has temporarily halted production and told factory staff to stay home following a cyberattack over the weekend. The attack forced the UK-based car maker, which Tata Motors owns, to take its critical IT systems offline. This has disrupted car sales and halted production at factories across the UK, including those in Halewood, Solihull, and Wolverhampton. The company is now working to restore its systems and has warned that the production suspension could be extended. Beyond JLR's own facilities, the cyberattack has also caused significant disruption, with car sales being heavily impacted, forcing the company's network of parts suppliers to restrict their operations.According to a report by the BBC, some repair garages in the UK have also warned that existing owners of Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles may face delays if their cars need new parts. The attack was particularly ill-timed, as it coincided with the release of new registration plates on September 1, a traditionally popular time for new vehicle deliveries.A hacker group linked to a major earlier cyberattack on retail chain Marks and Spencer claimed to have breached JLR’s systems, the report added. The group, which calls itself “Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters” and is believed to be a network of English-speaking teenagers, told the BBC they had allegedly gained access to the carmaker’s network but did not confirm whether any sensitive data was stolen or malware was installed.To back their claims, they shared two images—one showing what appeared to be internal troubleshooting instructions for a charging issue, and another displaying internal computer logs.According to a cybersecurity expert, the screenshots suggested the hackers had access to information not meant to be public.JLR confirmed it is investigating the incident but said there is currently no evidence that customer data has been compromised.In 2023, the company signed a five-year, £800 million contract with Tata Consultancy Services—its corporate affiliate—to provide cybersecurity and IT support as part of a push to “accelerate digital transformation across its business.”The reported breach comes at a difficult time for JLR, which recently posted a drop in profits due to higher costs tied to US tariffs.","Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has temporarily halted production and told factory staff to stay home following a cyberattack over the weekend.

What Warner Bros Discovery said about Midjourney infringing its intellectual property



“The heart of what we do is develop stories and characters to entertain our audiences, bringing to life the vision and passion of our creative partners. Midjourney is blatantly and purposefully infringing copyrighted works, and we filed this suit to protect our content, our partners, and our investments.”

Can Lyne Originals Coolpods 11 Solve Your Problems?

Warner Bros (WB) Discovery has filed a lawsuit against the AI image generator startup Midjourney. The Hollywood studio has alleged the AI startup ofand using its intellectual property. According to the complaint filed in California federal court, WB accused Midjourney of building itself on the mass theft of copyrighted movies and TV shows to train its AI systems. The lawsuit claims that Midjourney allows its millions of subscribers to create and download images and videos of characters such as Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Bugs Bunny that are WB’s intellectual property. The lawsuit claims that Midjourney's actions demonstrate it is aware of its wrongful conduct. WB alleged that the company earlier blocked subscribers from generating videos from infringing images, but thenlifted the protection, promoting the change as anIn a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, a Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson said:In its lawsuit, WB highlights Midjourney’s ability to generate images of well-known copyrighted characters. Central to the claims are heroes featured in DC Studios’ films and series, including Superman, Wonder Woman, and The Joker. The filing also mentions Looney Tunes figures, Tom and Jerry, Scooby-Doo, and Cartoon Network characters, such as those from Rick and Morty, which are described as cultural touchstones in recent years.Midjourney, which offers paid subscriptions between $10 and $120 per month and did not respond to a request for comment, allegedly produces WB-owned characters even from prompts like “classic comic book superhero battle,” which do not directly reference specific properties.As evidence, the studio submitted dozens of side-by-side comparisons of Midjourney outputs and stills from its movies and shows. For example, a prompt for “Batman, screencap from The Dark Knight” produced an image of Christian Bale’s Batman in the Kevlar-plated suit design unique to that film, appearing nearly identical to footage or promotional materials. Another example cited is a 3D-animated Bugs Bunny resembling his appearance in Space Jam: A New Legacy.The complaint argues that Midjourney’s ability to reproduce copyrighted characters is a “clear draw for subscribers,” diverting consumers from buying licensed Warner Bros. Discovery products such as posters, wall art, and prints.Like other AI companies, Midjourney’s training data remains opaque, creating challenges for rightsholders pursuing infringement claims. In 2022, the company’s founder, David Holz, stated in an interview that his team “grab everything they can, they dump it in a huge file, and they kind of set it on fire to train some huge thing.” Details of the process will be examined during discovery.WB is seeking either Midjourney’s profits tied to the alleged infringement or statutory damages of $150,000 per infringed work—potentially exposing the company to significant liability.The legal action joins a growing list of lawsuits against AI companies from authors, artists, and news organisations. WB is the latest major studio to take legal action, following similar suits filed by Disney and Universal against Midjourney in June. The studios argue that AI companies are ""free-riders"" who train their technology on copyrighted content without compensating creators.A central legal question is whether AI companies are protected by fair use, the doctrine that allows works to be used without a license under certain conditions. Earlier this year, a court found Amazon-backed Anthropic had a firm legal footing for training purposes. Judge William Alsup described the technology as “among the most transformative many of us will see in our lifetimes.”","Warner Bros.

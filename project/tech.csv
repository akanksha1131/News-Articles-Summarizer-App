BIF calls SIM Binding problematic





Two of the biggest industry bodies in India -- BIF and COAI are fighting again. This time over the government's new circular mandating SIM Binding for OTT platforms. Broadband India Forum or BIF represents major technology companies such as WhatsApp parent Meta, Google and others; while Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) is the country's biggest telecom body, whose members include Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea. BIF has flagged ""serious concerns"" regarding the government's recent directive mandating a continuous, active SIM connection for the use of messaging applications. The forum has urged the Centre to pause implementation timelines and immediately hold stakeholder consultations on the issue. COAI on its part has welcomed the new DoT guidelines. Indian telecom companies body COAI said that making SIM binding mandatory would keep a reliable link between the user, the number, and the device, which could help reduce spam, fraud calls, and financial scams.BIF has stated that while the directive is ""well-intentioned"" in its goal to curb cyber-fraud, it raises significant questions regarding jurisdiction, consumer impact, and technical feasibility. Last month, the government issued directions that would ensure app-based communication services, such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, and others, remain continuously linked to users' SIM cards -- a move that would make it impossible to access these apps without an active SIM associated with a registered mobile number.BIF termed it ""disappointing"" that directions of such far-reaching operational impact have been issued with such short implementation timelines, ""without any form of public consultation or user-impact assessment"". BIF argues the move creates obligations extending ""far beyond the mandate of the Telecom Act."" ""BIF expresses serious concern over the directions for SIM binding issued by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on 28 November 2025, mandating that app-based communication services remain continuously linked to the specific SIM card installed in the user's device and forcing periodic six-hour logouts for web/desktop versions,"" BIF said in its statement.Telecom department recently issued a directive that mandated that the user's Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) used at registration must be bound to the services of web-based platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Arattai, Snapchat, Sharechat and others. According to Department of Telecom (DoT) circular, within 90 days, users will no longer be able to access these apps unless the original SIM is present in the device. This means that messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Snapchat, ShareChat, JioChat, Arattai need to ensure that their services cannot be used unless the user has an active SIM card in their device. Under the new rules, apps will now be required to automatically log users out every six hours and ask them to log in again through a QR code, when accessed on a device without SIM card.BIF in its statement added, ""It becomes imperative that DoT pause the current implementation timelines, open a formal stakeholder consultation, constitute a technical working group of OS providers, Telecommunication Identifier User Entities, licensees, and security experts, and ultimately adopt a risk-based and proportionate framework consistent with constitutional standards of necessity and least intrusive means. """"The Telecommunications Act does not authorise the regulation of OTT communication platforms, nor does it provide the legislative basis to impose telecom-style operational mandates upon them,"" the industry body said, adding that under the guise of the Telecom Cyber Security Amendment Rules and without any public consultation, the present SIM-binding directions extend precisely such obligations on a ""select set of applications"".""The directions go beyond the statutory remit, blur settled jurisdictional boundaries between the Telecom Act and the IT Act,"" BIF said, dubbing it a ""problematic instance of regulatory overreach by the executive without legislative sanction and, unfortunately, any stakeholder engagement"". ""By covering some services and excluding others that operate in an identical manner, the approach could have the effect of bad actors simply migrating to platforms not subject to these obligations,"" according to BIF.","Broadband India Forum or BIF represents major technology companies such as WhatsApp parent Meta, Google and others.

Here's the full memo sent by Instagram chief Adam Mosseri to employees

1. Back to the office:

2. Fewer meetings:

3. More demos, less decks:

4. Faster decision-making:





Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram wants employees back in office 5 days a week, starting February 2026. The Meta-owned company is requiring all of its US-based employees to return to the office five days per week. The five-day requirement applies to employees who are assigned a desk at a US office, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri said in an internal memo titled “Building a Winning Culture in 2026”. “I believe that we are more creative and collaborative when we are together in-person,” Mosseri wrote, according to a copy of the memo obtained by Business Insider. “I felt this pre-COVID and I feel it any time I go to our New York office where the in-person culture is strong.”The memo, first reported by Alex Heath's Sources newsletter, also announced some other changes. These changes are under four to-dos: Back to the office; Fewer meetings; More demos, less decks; and Faster decision-making. In meetings part, the memo says that recurring meetings will be canceled every six months and only re-added if ""absolutely necessary."" Instagram chief also called for more product prototypes than slide decks.""Prototypes allow us to establish a proof of concept and get a real sense for social dynamics, and we use them far too infrequently,"" Mosseri wrote in the memo. ""2026 is going to be tough, as was 2025, but I'm excited about our momentum and our plans for next year,"" Mosseri wrote. ""These changes are going to meaningfully help us move Instagram forward in a way we can all be proud of — with creativity, boldness, and craft."" In New York, Mosseri added that Instagram would first address “space constraints” at office sites before implementing the mandate.Building a Winning Culture in 2026We've made good progress this year on Instagram standing for creativity and Threads standing for perspectives, but we still need to do more if we want to lead in both of these areas. A big part of this will come down to strategy, and I feel good about the plan we've put together for next half. Equally important is how well we work. I've been thinking a lot about how we can be more nimble and creative in order to stay competitive. It's clear we have to evolve, so we're going to make a series of changes next year:I believe that we are more creative and collaborative when we are together in-person. I felt this pre-COVID and I feel it any time I go to our New York office where the in-person culture is strong.Starting February 2, I'm asking everyone in my rollup based in a US office with assigned desks to come back full time (five days a week). The specifics:You'll still have the flexibility to work from home when you need to, since I recognize there will be times you won't be able to come into the office. I trust you all to use your best judgment in figuring out how to adapt to this schedule. In the NY office, we won't expect you to come back full time until we've alleviated the space constraints. We'll share more once we have a better sense of timeline.In MPK, we'll move from MPK21 to MPK22 on January 26 so everyone has an assigned desk. We're also offering the option to transfer from the MPK to SF office for those people whose commute would be the same or better with that change. We'll reach out directly to those people with more info.XFN partners will continue to follow their own org norms. There is no change for employees who are currently remote.We all spend too much time in meetings that are not effective, and it's slowing us down. Every six months, we'll cancel all recurring meetings and only re-add the ones that are absolutely necessary. I also support everyone in making recurring 1:1s biweekly by default and declining meetings if they fall during your focus blocks.Most product overviews should be prototypes instead of decks. Prototypes allow us to establish a proof of concept and get a real sense for social dynamics, and we use them far too infrequently. If a strategy doc is appropriate, it should be three pages, max, and follow this template. If a deck is necessary, it should be as tight as possible. For all reviews, make it very clear up front what the goal of the meeting is and what the key points are that you need to discuss. I want most of your time focused on building great products, not preparing for meetings.We're going to have a more formalized unblocking process with DRIs, and I'll be at the priorities progress unblocking meeting every week. (On weeks where I'm not able to attend, I'll delegate decision-making to one of my directs.) This way open decisions don't sit for more than a few days, max.At next week's All Hands, I'll talk more about these changes, and you'll hear from people around the team about our priorities for next year. 2026 is going to be tough, as was 2025, but I'm excited about our momentum and our plans for next year. These changes are going to meaningfully help us move Instagram forward in a way we can all be proud of — with creativity, boldness, and craft.","Mark Zuckerberg's Instagram wants employees back in office 5 days a week, starting February 2026.

US wireless carrier AT&T has vowed to scrap diversity policies. In a letter to the US telecoms regulator, AT&T said that it has committed to ending diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. The Dallas-based telecom giant told FCC Chairman Brendan Carr in that the “legal landscape governing diversity, equity and inclusion (‘DEI’) policies and programs has changed.” The letter comes as the company seeks approval from the Trump administration to buy wireless spectrum assets. AT&T said in its letter it ""does not and will not have any roles focused on DEI."" In January, President Donald Trump had issued sweeping executive orders to dismantle US government DEI programs, and asked the private sector to join the initiative.In November 2024, AT&T agreed to buy some wireless spectrum licenses from US Cellular in a $1.02 billion deal that requires approval from the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC under President Donald Trump has required telecom companies to end DEI programs as a condition of approving transactions.In July this year, AT&T rival T-Mobile US said that it was ending its DEI programs as it sought regulatory approval for two major deals including buying almost all of regional carrier United States Cellular's wireless operations including customers, stores and 30% of its spectrum assets in a deal valued at $4.4 billion.In May, FCC approved Verizon Communications' $20 billion deal to acquire fiber-optic internet provider Frontier Communications after Verizon agreed to end its DEI program.Dear Chairman Carr,At AT&T, we are committed to serving customers across the country and ensuring that all Americans can connect to the Internet. For the last five years, we have sharpened our focus on a single, overarching objective: to be the best connectivity company in America. As a nation, we must close the digital divide so that all Americans can enjoy all that the Internet has to offer.To bring 5G and fiber to more customers than anyone else, we have realigned our priorities, our budgets, and our personnel, and we are positioning our workforce to meet the connectivity needs of all Americans. As part of this operational focus, we have reviewed our policies and relationships with external groups to ensure that they are aligned with our business priorities. The legal landscape governing diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) policies and programs has changed. We have closely followed the recent Executive Orders, Supreme Court rulings, and guidance issued by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission1 and have adjusted our employment and business practices to ensure that they comply with all applicable laws and related requirements, including ending DEI-related policies as described below, not just in name but in substance.AT&T has always stood for merit-based opportunity, and we are pleased to reaffirm our commitment to equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination today. Consistent with applicable law, our multi-pronged approach allows employees to thrive in an environment free from invidious discrimination:* Culture: Our workplace fosters an environment where everyone is entrusted to contribute their best, reinforcing our commitment to a workplace where all employees perform their best, are challenged in their work, and feel a sense of community. Our culture team, part of our Human Resources department, focuses on helping our workforce achieve our business priorities and drives employee engagement, aligning with our key pillars: serve customers first, move faster, act boldly, and win as one. AT&T does not and will not have any roles focused on DEI.* Career development, hiring, and mentorship: It is AT&T’s longstanding practice to pay and advance individuals based on merit and qualification. We place individuals in roles where they are best positioned to succeed based on these factors, along with capability and experience. We support career growth through mentorship, training courses, tuition reimbursement, nanodegrees, and partner degree programs, as well as leadership development programs. These tools and programs are and will continue to be open to all, consistent with Title VII, and based on achievement and contribution to our purpose and business objectives. Our hiring, training, and career development opportunities are not and will not be based on or limited by race, gender, or other protected characteristics. We do not and will not use hiring quotas based on race, sex, sexual orientation, or any other protected characteristic. Further, consistent with the current law, we removed training related to “diversity, equity and inclusion” as well as any references to it from our internal and external messaging and will ensure that future training is consistent with guidance released by the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission addressing training that could facilitate discrimination in the workplace.* Employee Groups: We recognize the rich history of our employee groups, dating back more than 50 years. Any AT&T employee can exercise their right to free association in joining any employee group and experience networking, leadership, professional development, and volunteerism opportunities. We ensure that these groups are driving business outcomes in support of the company’s purpose and strategy and that their work in the community supports our efforts to deliver broadband to all. We maintain corporate oversight of our employee groups. To the extent that an employee group is focused on a demographic or protected characteristic, we do not and will not draw distinctions based on any of those characteristics in granting permission to establish groups or conduct events. We will continue to ensure that their policies support equal employment opportunity, and that employee group membership is not a factor in employment or advancement decisions.* Suppliers: We award contracts to suppliers based on value, quality, function, and ability to serve our business objectives. Our supplier program has increased its focus on local and small businesses and drives economic empowerment across the country. Our procurement practices – including the awarding of contracts and supplier spending – are not based on any demographic-based goals, and we do not require our suppliers to meet any demographic-based goals. Any tracking and reporting of our supplier spending is done to comply with state laws, government contracting requirements, and similar reporting commitments.* External, sector-specific surveys: We have narrowed our participation in external surveys only to measure employee engagement and our progress achieving the culture tenets discussed above. We will no longer participate in recognition surveys focused on protected characteristics.* Sponsorships: We enter into sponsorships that help us reach multiple and varied audiences with messages about our superior products and services. We are always reviewing and optimizing how we budget in pursuit of our business priorities and have discontinued sponsorships that are not aligned to our current business strategy. Our sponsorship decisions will continue to be evaluated to align with increasing shareholder value and advancing our core business objectives of being the nation’s best connectivity provider through 5G and fiber.We appreciate the opportunity to share this information with you. Our workplace and culture are important factors in building our nation’s infrastructure and creating long-term shareholder value. With over 110,000 employees in the U.S. committed to millions of customers, we believe that all Americans benefit from our products, and we have focused our operations to connect all Americans to greaterpossibility with expertise, simplicity, and inspiration.Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.Respectfully submitted,David McAtee IISenior Executive Vice President and General CounselAT&T Inc","US wireless carrier AT&T has vowed to scrap diversity policies.

Jeff Bezos' ex-wife MacKenzie Scott’s donation to Harvard University and other causes





MacKenzie Scott, ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , has significantly reduced her stake in the e-commerce giant over the recent years. The move came as the philanthropist continues to make major donations to various diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. According to Sotheby's International Realty, Scott has already donated $14 billion to causes including racial equality, LGBTQ+ equality, functional democracy and climate change. She now ranks sixth on the list of the world's top 10 philanthropists, below Microsoft founder Bill Gates and investor Warren Buffett . According to the Sotheby's list, Scott made donationsAccording to a September filing with the SEC, Scott reduced her Amazon holdings by almost 42% from a year earlier. The filing, reported by Bloomberg, said she now holds 81.1 million Amazon shares, from 139 million shares a year earlier (reduced by 58 million). Her stake in Amazon is now worth almost $12.6 billion.The sale has come even though Amazon's stock price has more than doubled since her divorce from Bezos in 2019.But as part of the divorce settlement, Bezos has retained the voting rights to Scott's Amazon stake and is obligated to disclose them annually. However, the regulatory document did not indicate if the share reduction was a result of sales, donations, or both, this closely precedes Scott's continued philanthropy.In November, Scott made one of her largest single contributions by donating $80 million to Howard University. This historic gift was part of Scott's recent focus on making substantial multimillion-dollar gifts to DEI and disaster relief causes. Observers note that the billionaire, estimated to be worth $35.6 billion, has been on a ""philanthropic roll"" in recent weeks.Scott’s donation was unrestricted, which gave Howard University the flexibility to allocate the funds where they are most needed. Specifically, $63 million is designated for the university’s general operations, while $17 million will directly support the College of Medicine.At that time, the university said that the gift arrived at an “opportune time” as the 43-day federal government shutdown which started on October 1, delayed the yearly funding that Howard normally receives. That funding helps support student success, academic programs, research, and operations at both the university and Howard University Hospital.The shutdown also stopped the Department of Education from giving out new grants. Almost 95% of the department’s workers who do not handle student aid were told to stop working, so only the most essential staff remainl on the job.Apart from this, Scott gave away $42 million to 10,000 Degrees, a Bay Area no-nprofit that helps low-income and mostly non-white students get into and finish college. She also made other large donations, including major funding for Native student scholarships and for HBCU endowments through the United Negro College Fund (UNCF).Furthermore, over the years, Scott donated to many different causes, including an $84 million gift to the Girl Scouts, $20 million to Vermont’s Champlain Housing Trust, $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, and $275 million to Planned Parenthood. In 2020, she had also given UNCF $10 million.After receiving about 4% of Amazonthrough her divorce from Bezos, Scott gave away $19 billion to more than 2,000 nonprofits over the past five years and yet, she is still worth more than $35 billion. The typical size of her many donations since the divorce was about $5 million.","MacKenzie Scott, Jeff Bezos' ex-wife, has significantly reduced her Amazon stake, donating billions to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

Nvidia’s concerns over circular investment







Nvidia’s chief financial officer, Colette Kress, has said that the chipmaker’s massive, multi-billion-dollar investment ChatGPT-maker OpenAI remains a work in progress. Kress, while speaking at the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference in Arizona, said that there are ongoing discussions about the $100 billion partnership, considered central to the high-stakes AI race and investments in the sector.“We still haven't completed a definitive agreement, but we're working with them,” Kress said, as per news agency Reuters. Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, unveiled a letter of intent in September signaling its plan to invest up to $100 billion in the startup. Under the agreement, OpenAI will deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, a compute capacity large enough to power more than eight million average US homes.Last month, Nvidia reminded investors about the investment in OpenAI, highlighting the difference between an announcement and a signed contract for its investors. In the risk factors section of the quarterly filing (seen by CNBC), Nvidia wrote:""There is no assurance that we will enter into definitive agreements with respect to the OpenAl opportunity or other potential investments, or that any investment will be completed on expected terms.""Kress clarified the financial impact of the deal on Nvidia’s already immense backlog. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently disclosed that the company has $500 billion in bookings for its advanced chips through 2026. Kress stated that the chips Nvidia would provide under the future OpenAI agreement are not included in that half-trillion-dollar figure.“That half a trillion doesn't include any of the work that we're doing right now on the next part of the agreement with OpenAI,” she said.The clarification comes two months after the deal was announced. The nature of the deal – where Nvidia invests in companies that are simultaneously major customers – has prompted some concerns about a potential AI bubble and the prevalence of “circular deals.” According to Kress, Nvidia has recently struck similar deals, including a commitment of up to $10 billion to OpenAI rival Anthropic, which could also add to the company’s massive chip bookings.","N Nvidia’s chief financial officer, Colette Kress, has said that the chipmaker's massive, multi-billion-dollar investment ChatGPT-maker OpenAI remains a work in progress.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment. The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently struck a humorous and candid tone in the company’s recent Townhall with the employees.

As reported by Business Insider, Huang said that Nvidia’s influence has created a no-win situation with expectations so hight that even minor missteps could shake global markets.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

"Explained: Google’s Virtual Apparel Try On tool, what is it and how to try the new feature",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-googles-virtual-apparel-try-on-tool-what-is-it-and-how-to-try-the-new-feature/articleshow/125746794.cms,"What is Google’s Virtual Apparel Try On tool

How the Virtual Try On tool works



How to use Virtual Try On tool



When shopping for items like shirts, pants, dresses, or shoes on Google, look for and tap the “try it on” icon visible on eligible product listings.

Upload a full-length photo of yourself. Google recommends using a clear, full-body shot with good lighting and fitted clothing for the best visualisation results.

After the garment is virtually rendered onto the photo, users can save or share their new look with friends.

Shoppers can also tap to purchase the item or find similar styles based on the result.





Google has rolled out its Virtual Apparel Try On tool in India. This tool will allow online shoppers to not just see the product on their phones or PCs but essentially visualise how billions of apparel listings – from dresses and jackets to shoes – will look on their own bodies by simply uploading a photograph. The feature aims to bridge the gap between browsing and buying by bringing the ‘fitting room experience’ directly to the consumers’ screen. This way, they get a more personalised online shopping experience without having to spend time visiting a mall and trying on multiple clothes.Google unveiled the shopping experience within its AI Mode in May this year. This update introduced a virtual dressing room capability and a new agentic checkout experience, allowing users to quickly finalise purchases when desirable pricing is identified.This shopping interface leverages Gemini capabilities alongside Google's proprietary Shopping Graph to help users make a purchase. According to Google, the Shopping Graph currently contains over 50 billion product listings from a range of global and local retailers, with details like reviews, prices, and availability being refreshed at a rate of over two billion listings every hour.The technology behind the virtual try-on is powered by Google’s custom AI model specifically developed for fashion.This model is engineered to understand complex physical elements. For example, it can accurately adapt the garment to different body shapes and sizes. The AI also understands how different fabric materials will realistically fold, stretch and drape. Users just have to upload one full-length photo of themselves and can see an accurate visualisation of the clothing on their body.The process for using Google's new virtual try-on tool is straightforward, requiring only four steps:For example, imagine you are shopping online for a new winter jacket and you find a listing for a Leather Biker Jacket on Google Search or Shopping. You see the jacket listing. Next to the standard price and color options, you notice the “Try It On” icon. You tap it.The tool prompts you to upload a full-length, well-lit photo of yourself taken while wearing relatively fitted clothes. Google’s custom fashion AI takes your photo and the 3D model of the leather jacket. The AI calculates your body shape and size. It places the jacket perfectly scaled onto your uploaded photo.",Google has rolled out its Virtual Apparel Try On tool in India.

His caution came about a month later when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also said that “China is Nanoseconds behind America in AI” and that America must win by “racing ahead”.Speaking to Bloomberg News in Tel Aviv, Martinis said, “China is definitely very competitive in this. People should be concerned that there’s a real race.” He played an instrumental role in achieving quantum supremacy at Google in 2019. At that time, Martinis said, China was seen as about three years behind in Quantum technology.“But they caught up quickly. Now we’re worried that maybe we’re nanoseconds ahead of them,” Martinis said, adding, “I read their papers, they understand what they’re doing very clearly. When people in the West have published papers on recent advances, they often in a couple of months publish a paper with similar capabilities.”Martinis, who currently works as a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, highlighted that the US, Europe and China are all vying to build quantum computers with practical applications which, according to him, is five to ten years away.Martinis also said that he has flagged this danger to White House officials, most recently during a visit several weeks ago. He said the Trump administration was aware of the challenge but initially prioritized maintaining an edge in artificial intelligence (AI) over China, noting, “They’re now moving on to quantum.”Huang has previously issued a warning in terms of AI race. Last month, Huang told FT, “China is going to win the AI race.""“As I have long said, China is nanoseconds behind America in AI. It's vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide,” Huang said.“We want America to win this AI race. No doubt about that. We want the world to be built on American tech stack. Absolutely the case. But we also need to be in China to win their developers. A policy that causes America to lose half of the world's AI developers is not beneficial in the long term, it hurts us more,” Huang said in the Nvidia developers' conference.", Nobel Prize winner John Martinis says China is closing the technological lead once held by the US in quantum computing. Martinis played an instrumental role in achieving quantum supremacy at Google in 2019. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also warned US on China winning AI race.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125746221,imgsize-83242,width-400,resizemode-4/quantum-computing.jpg"
Sam Altman 'excited' for what Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has warned researchers about,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-excited-for-what-microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-has-warned-researchers-about/articleshow/125745935.cms,"“probably the thing I am most excited for ever in life.”

“AGI. Excited for that. All I am excited for. More than my kid, more excited for that. Probably that's the thing I am most excited for ever in life,”

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

""We can't build superintelligence just for superintelligence's sake,""

""It's got to be for humanity's sake, for a future we actually want to live in.

It's not going to be a better world if we lose control of it.""

What Sam Altman said about OpenAI’s AGI bet

“We said from the very beginning we were going to go after AGI at a time when in the field you weren't allowed to say that because that just seemed impossibly crazy, borderline irresponsible to talk.

We really wanted to push on that and we were far less resourced than Deep Mind and others, and so we said okay they're going to try a lot of things, and we've just got to pick one and really concentrate and that's how we can win here.

Most of the world still does not understand the value of a fairly extreme level of conviction on one bet; that's why I'm so excited for startups right now, it is because the world is still sleeping on all this to such an astonishing degree.

We realised that AGI had become this badly overloaded word and people meant all kinds of different things. We tried to just say, okay here's our best guess, roughly of the order of things.”

“You have these level one systems, which are these chatbots, there'd be level two that would come, which would be these reasoners. We think we got there earlier this year with the o1 release.

Three is Agents with the ability to go off and do these longer-term tasks, like multiple interactions with an environment, asking people for help when they need it, working together, all of that.

I think we're going to get there faster than people expect. As innovators, like a scientist, you know that's the ability to go explore a not well-understood phenomenon over a long period of time and understand what's just kind of go and figure it out.

And then level five, this is the sort of slightly amorphous. Like do that, but at the scale of the whole company, or you know a whole organisation or whatever. That's going to be a pretty powerful thing.""

How far is OpenAI from building AGI

“This is the first time ever where I felt we actually know what to do. I think from here to building an AGI will still take a huge amount of work. There are some known unknowns, but I think we basically know what to do. It'll take a while, it'll be hard, but that's tremendously exciting.

I also think on the product side, there's more to figure out, but roughly we know what to shoot at and what we want to optimise for.

That's a really exciting time, and when you have that clarity, I think you can go pretty fast. If you're willing to say we're going to do these few things, we're going to try to do them very well, and our research path is fairly clear, our infrastructure path is fairly clear, our product path is getting clearer.

You can orient around that, super well.

We did not have that for a long time. We were a true research lab, and even when you know that it's hard to act with conviction on it because there are so many other good things you'd like to do. But the degree to which you can get everybody aligned and pointed at the same thing [AGI] is a significant determinant in how fast you can move.""

“intelligence explosion”

“the biggest decision.”

“is in some ways the ultimate risk, because it’s kind of like letting AI kind of go.”

“If you imagine you create this process where you have an AI that is smarter than you, or about as smart as you, it’s [then] making an AI that’s much smarter. It sounds like a kind of scary process. You don’t know where you end up,”

Anthropic chief scientist says AI will replace all of these jobs in three years

“blue-collar jobs”





Anthropic’s chief scientist, Jared Kaplan, has issued a warning. He says humanity must decide by 2030 whether it is willing to take the ultimate risk of allowing artificial intelligence (AI) systems to train themselves and grow more powerful. Kaplan stated that a choice is approaching for humanity regarding how much freedom or autonomy AI systems should be given to evolve. This decision could either trigger a helpfulor lead to the moment humans lose control of the technology.In an interview with The Guardian, Kaplan discussed the intense race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI), also known as superintelligence. He urged international governments and society to engage in what he calledWhile efforts to align the fast-advancing technology with human interests have succeeded so far, Kaplan explained that allowing AI to recursively self-improveHe estimates this critical decision could come between 2027 and 2030.Kaplan explained to The Guardian.Kaplan went from being a theoretical physics researcher to an AI billionaire in just seven years of working in the field. In the interview, he explained that AI systems could do mostwithin two to three years.He also said that his six-year-old son will never be able to outperform an AI on school tasks like writing essays or solving maths exams. Kaplan believes it is reasonable to worry about humans losing control of AI if the systems begin to improve themselves.He described the race toward advanced general intelligence as daunting, with very high stakes. At the same time, he said the best outcome could be highly positive, allowing AI to accelerate medical discoveries, strengthen health and cybersecurity, increase productivity, give people more free time, and support human progress.Kaplan is not the only one at Anthropic expressing concerns. Co-founder Jack Clark said he felt both hopeful and deeply worried about AI, describing it as something far more unpredictable than a normal machine. Kaplan believes AI can stay aligned with human interests while it remains at or below human intelligence, but he fears what may happen once it becomes smarter.He warns that a smarter AI could help create an even more advanced system, leading to a process whose outcome is unclear and potentially dangerous. There are also doubts about AI’s economic benefits, with critics pointing to low-quality AI output that reduces productivity.However, AI has shown strong results in computer coding, highlighted by Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5, which can build agents and use computers autonomously.","Anthropic’s chief scientist, Jared Kaplan, has issued a warning.

Amazon’s 17-year veteran executive joins OpenAI: Read his ‘Thank You’ note,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazons-17-year-veteran-executive-joins-openai-read-his-thank-you-note/articleshow/125745490.cms,"Severson says October 17 marked his last day at Amazon



This post is overdue, but I’m excited to share a new chapter — and to close out an incredible journey at Amazon. After 17½ years, October 17th marked my last day at Amazon, and on November 10th I stepped into a new role as Vice President and Head of Global Business Development at OpenAI.

When I joined Amazon in 2008 as the first member of what became Corporate Business Development, I never could have imagined the scope of experiences ahead. I had the chance to help shape some of Amazon’s most strategic partnerships while leading CorpBD; build new teams along the way, including Fuse, where we accelerated Prime adoption in meaningful ways; and, most recently, serve as Technical Advisor to Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores.

I’m deeply grateful for the people I’ve learned from and worked alongside. Amazon shaped how I think, taught me how to navigate complex problems, and gave me the opportunity to build and lead exceptional teams. Through those experiences I learned the value of high judgment, clarity in ambiguity, and building trust through curiosity and rigor. I’ll always be proud of what we accomplished — and thankful for the mentors and teammates who challenged me to raise the bar, trusted me in big moments, and made even the toughest stretches rewarding.

Joining OpenAI at such a defining moment in technology is an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. I’m drawn to moments of transformation — and it’s rare to be part of something so squarely at the frontier of what’s possible. Nearly two weeks in, I’ve spent time with the remarkable BD and Industry teams I’ll be leading and just wrapped my first leadership offsite. I couldn’t be more energized to contribute, to learn, and to help shape what comes next.

To everyone at Amazon: thank you for nearly two decades of trust, laughter, and a shared drive to make an impact. I’ll be cheering you on — and carrying the lessons and friendships forward.

To everyone at OpenAI: thank you for the warm welcome. I’m excited to see what we can build together.

How jio, NHAI will implement technology







The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Reliance Jio to deploy a telecom-based safety alert system across the National Highway network. The initiative is aimed at enhancing safety by alerting drivers with advance warnings as they approach dangerous or risk-prone areas. According to the announcement, the system will leverage Jio’s existing 4G and 5G network to deliver timely alerts to mobile phones of Jio users traveling on or near National Highways.The primary function of the alert system is to strengthen road safety by providing travelers with information that help them adjust their speed and driving behaviour when driving in risky areas to avoid accidents. The advance warnings will cover identified risk locations, including accident-prone stretches, stray-cattle zones, fog-affected areas and emergency diversions.Alerts will be sent directly to National Highway users through multiple communication channels, including SMS, WhatsApp and high-priority calls.According to the announcement, the solution is automated and works for all Jio mobile subscribers.The system uses existing telecom towers and does not require the immediate installation of new roadside hardware. Jio has over 500 million subscribers.The initiative will be integrated in a phased manner with NHAI’s existing digital platforms, notably the ‘Rajmargyatra’ mobile application and the emergency helpline number 1033.NHAI chairman Shri Santosh Kumar Yadav commented that the initiative marks an important step in providing reliable information to commuters, enabling informed decisions and safer driving practices.“This initiative marks an important step forward in providing timely and reliable information to commuters, enabling them to make informed decisions and adopt safer driving practices well in advance. I am sure that this initiative will set a new benchmark in technology-enabled road safety management on National Highway,” Yadav said.Jyotindra Thacker, president of Reliance Jio, stated that the project leverages the reach of Jio’s network to deliver timely safety alerts at scale.",The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Reliance Jio to deploy a telecom-based safety alert system across the National Highway network.

Sanchar Saathi App Row In LS: Cong Flags Privacy Fears, Scindia Says 'Snooping Not Possible'

'Sanchar Saathi app is not a spy tool'

What is Sanchar Saathi app





Ministry of Communications has revoked the mandatory pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi app on mobile handsets imported or manufactured in India. This comes just days after DoT proposed to make the pre- installation of Sanchar Saathi app mandatory for mobile manufacturers. If you wondering what is behind the this backtracking, that too so soon. Is it the furore created by Opposition parties or privacy activists? None. According to PIB release announcing the revocation of mandatory installation, the government has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers, citing Sanchar Saathi's increasing acceptance in India. Ministry said in a statement that the government had with an intent to provide access to cyber security to all citizens had mandated pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi app on all smartphones.In its statement, the ministry said, ""Given Sanchar Saathi’s increasing acceptance, Government has decided not to make the pre- installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers."" The ministry release also gives numbers citing increasing acceptance of the app. ""So far 1.4 crore users have downloaded this app and are contributing to information on 2000 fraud incidents per day. The number of users has been increasing rapidly and the mandate to install the app was meant to accelerate this process and make the app available to less aware citizens easily.Just in last one day, 6 lakh citizens have registered for downloading the App which is a 10x increase in its uptake. This is affirmation of faith by citizens on this App for protecting themselves provided to them by the Government,"" says the official release.The statement also stresses what telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, said in the Parliament that Sanchar Saathi app is not a snooping or surveillance tool. ""The app is secure and purely meant to help citizens from bad actors in the cyber world,"" release stated. ""It helps in ""Jan Bhagidari"" by all citizens in reporting on such bad actors and actions while protecting users themselves. There is no other function other than protecting the users in the app and they can remove the app whenever they want. This has been clarified by Government,"" the release further said.Earlier today, speaking in the Parliament, the Union minister said, ""Neither snooping is possible with the Sanchar Saathi app nor will it ever be. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji is committed to giving the public full control and authority over their security. The success of Sanchar Saathi and its widespread use is the result of the trust and participation of the public."" Replying to a question by Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda in Lok Sabha, the Union Minister added, ""I want to keep all the facts in front of the nation. We have one billion (mobile) users, but there are elements who use it in a negative manner. It is the government's duty to keep the citizens safe. Sanchar Saathi portal was started in 2023 with this mind, and the app was brought in 2025... We decided to give a choice to all the citizens. If the app is on your phone, it does not mean it will operate automatically. Till the user registers in the app, it will not operate.""Sanchar Saathi app is part of Sanchar Saathi platform, which is a citizen-centric initiative of Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to empower mobile subscribers, strengthen their security and increase awareness about citizen centric initiatives of the Government. Sanchar Saathi is available in form of Mobile App and web portal (www.sancharsaathi.gov.in). Sanchar Saathi provides various citizen-centric services. It facilitates citizens to report the suspected fraud communications with the intention of defrauding telecom service users for cyber-crime, financial frauds, non-bonafide purpose like impersonation or any other misuse through Call, SMS or WhatsApp. Few examples of suspected fraud communications are communication related to impersonation as DoT / TRAI, police, Government official, suspected investment & trading, KYC & Payment related to Bank / Electricity / Gas / Insurance etc.The app also facilitates tracing of the lost/stolen mobile devices. This also facilitates blocking of lost/stolen mobile devices in network of all telecom operators so that lost/stolen devices cannot be used in India. If anyone tries to use the blocked mobile phone, its traceability is generated. Once mobile phone is found it may be unblocked on the App or portal for its normal use by the citizens.","Ministry of Communications has revoked the mandatory pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi app on mobile handsets imported or manufactured in India.

'We have worked hard on Sanchar Saathi app to prevent frauds'





The government has asserted that Sanchar Saathi app is not a snooping or surveillance tool. Speaking in the Parliament, Union Minister for Communications, Jyotiraditya Scindia , said, ""Neither snooping is possible with the Sanchar Saathi app nor will it ever be. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji is committed to giving the public full control and authority over their security. The success of Sanchar Saathi and its widespread use is the result of the trust and participation of the public.""Telecom minister also said that the government is willing to make changes based on any crucial feedback received. He said, ""We are ready to make changes to the order based on the feedback we receive.""

But not everyone in the country knows that this app exists to protect them from fraud and theft,"" Scindia said.Union minister for communications further noted, ""It is our responsibility to make this app reach everyone.

If you don't register it, then it will remain inactive.""Earlier this week, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) issued directions requiring manufacturers and importers to pre-install the cyber security app Sanchar Saathi on devices sold in India. The government said that the move is aimed to enhance consumer awareness and curb the circulation of duplicate or tampered IMEIs. All mobile phones that will be manufactured in India or imported after 90 days from the date of issuing of the order (Novembr 28) will need to have the app. All mobile phone companies are required to report compliance to the DoT within 120 days.Developed under the Telecom Cyber Security framework, Sanchar Saathi supports users on both Android and iOS platforms, enabling device authenticity verification and reporting suspected fraud. The minister told PTI that the Sanchar Saathi app is like any other app, which can be activated and deleted by consumers, and it is meant to ease reporting of online fraud and trace lost mobile phones, among others.Union Minister of State for Communications, Chandra Sekhar Pemmasani, too reiterated the government's stance on the 'Sanchar Saathi' app, noting that the app is to prevent cyber frauds. ""There are only a few ways, where you can prevent the cyber fraud. This is, in my view, this is probably the only way,"" he said, referring to the Sanchar Saathi app. ""Whether we can mandatorily pre-install or not, that's a different story that, government, (Jyotiraditya) Scindia Ji, has just explained that, you know, we will relook into that order,"" the MoS said.Noting that cyber attacks are quite sophisticated, the MoS said the Sanchar Saathi app will prevent cyber fraud of ""all the vulnerable people, because the goal of the app is to take the information from the educated people, and help the poor people, older people.""He also noted that the Sanchar Saathi app is being worked on in all ""vernacular languages."" ""We worked hard and if you look at the website, almost 20 crore website hits are coming to this website, Sanchar Sathi. And 1.4 crore people have already downloaded this app,"" he asserted.","The government has asserted that Sanchar Saathi app is not a snooping or surveillance tool.

Sanchar Saathi App Row In LS: Cong Flags Privacy Fears, Scindia Says 'Snooping Not Possible'

It helps in "" Jan bhagidari"" by all citizens in reporting on such bad actors and actions while protecting users themselves. There is no other function other than protecting the users in the app and they can remove the app whenever they want. This has been clarified by Government.

So far 1.4 crore users have downloaded this app and are contributing to information on 2000 fraud incidents per day. The number of users has been increasing rapidly and the mandate to install the app was meant to accelerate this process and make the app available to less aware citizens easily. Just in last one day, 6 lakh citizens have registered for downloading the App which is a 10x increase in its uptake. This is affirmation of faith by citizens on this App for protecting themselves provided to them by the Government.

Given Sanchar Saathi’s increasing acceptance, Government has decided not to make the pre- installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers.

What is Sanchar Saathi app





Sanchar Saathi app can be deleted: Telecom minister









The government has announced that it will no longer require mobile manufacturers to pre-install the Sanchar Saathi on all new smartphones. The decision comes hours after union telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia addressed the Lok Sabha, clarifying that “Snooping is neither possible, nor will it ever be”. The clarification came after a directive asking smartphone makers to pre-install the app on new phones that will be sold in the country sparked concerns around privacy and potential surveillance.The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) issued the directive on November 28, 2025, under the Telecommunication Cybersecurity Amendment Rules, making it mandatory for all smartphones sold in the country to come pre-installed with the Sanchar Saathi cybersecurity app. This marked the first time India has required state-backed software on all mobile devices.Also read: 'Chor ki daadhi mein tinka': BJP defends Sanchar Saathi app; attacks Congress over privacy row Launched in January, Sanchar Saathi is described by DoT as a “citizen centric initiative” designed to help mobile subscribers and strengthen their security against telecom-related cyber threats. According to the government, the Sanchar Sathi platform has helped recover over 700,000 lost phones, block more than 3.7 million stolen devices, and terminate 30 million fraudulent mobile connections.According to DoT, the initiative by citing the prevalence of duplicate or spoofed IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) numbers, which pose serious cybersecurity threats. The department also notes that India's large second-hand mobile device market has seen cases of stolen or blacklisted devices being resold, making purchasers unwitting participants in crime.The mandate sparked questions about user choice, flexibility and privacy. Scindia addressed the concerns, saying that the app is not mandatory for use.“If you want to delete the app, you can, it is not mandatory. For instance, if you don't want to use the app, don't register for it, it will stay dormant, and delete it if you want to,” Scindia noted.","The government has announced that it will no longer require mobile manufacturers to pre-install the Sanchar Saathi on all new smartphones.

Elon Musk sparks chilling warning: Global ‘inevitable’ war within 5 to 10 years; experts warn of rising tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-sparks-chilling-warning-global-inevitable-war-within-5-to-10-years-experts-warn-of-rising-tensions/articleshow/125738834.cms,"Elon Musk reacts to nuclear deterrence with a warning of inevitable war in 5-10 years





'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

Elon Musk’s global warnings spark debate on political and social risks





Co-founder and CEO of StarCloud, Founder of IBCGroupio and other experts react to Elon Musk’s global prediction





Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, recently captured global attention with a stark warning on X, the social media platform he owns. He suggested that a major global conflict could occur within the next five to ten years, calling it “inevitable. ” Musk did not offer further details or clarify which countries or regions might be involved, leaving analysts, social media users, and the public to speculate about potential flashpoints and the possible triggers behind such a conflict. His comment follows a thread discussing nuclear deterrence and its impact on government behaviour, highlighting Musk’s ongoing interest in geopolitical stability. The prediction has sparked widespread debate about global security, escalating tensions, and the urgent need for international dialogue among major powers worldwide.The comment was made in response to a discussion about nuclear deterrence and its impact on government behaviour. An X user, Hunter Ash, argued that nuclear weapons have reduced the risk of war between major powers. According to Ash, the presence of these weapons has allowed governments to become complacent, as the threat of large-scale war is lower. Ash wrote that without the external pressures of potential war, governments have little incentive to improve their efficiency or effectiveness.Musk responded with a short but alarming prediction: “War is inevitable. 5 years, 10 at most.” His succinct statement, without further explanation, left followers and analysts speculating about the potential causes and regions that could ignite such a conflict.Musk’s comments quickly gained traction because of his status as one of the world’s most influential entrepreneurs. His opinions carry weight not only in technology but also in public and political discussions. Musk’s brief tenure as head of the Department of Government Efficiency under former US President Donald Trump adds further credibility to his understanding of governance and policy.Many social media users turned to Grok, xAI’s chatbot, seeking clarification. Grok highlighted Musk’s previous warnings about global instability, such as rising identity-based political conflicts, mass migration in Europe, and tensions involving Taiwan, Ukraine, the United States, and China. These historical comments suggest Musk is concerned about a range of potential flashpoints that could escalate into serious global crises.While Musk did not specify a particular conflict in his recent statement, past comments indicate he sees several possible triggers for a major war.Musk’s prediction has prompted intense discussion across social media, news outlets, and political forums. Some experts dismiss the statement as speculative, pointing out that predicting the timing of wars is inherently uncertain. Others, however, argue that Musk’s knowledge of global systems and technological impacts gives credibility to his warning.The discussion also raises questions about how public figures influence perceptions of global security. Comments like Musk’s can shape public awareness, prompt policy debates, and even affect financial markets, especially when they reference geopolitical risks.","Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, recently captured global attention with a stark warning on X, the social media platform he owns.

Storm Over Sanchar Saathi As Govt Order To Preload Mobile App Triggers Surveillance Fears

Apple may take the middle path

Users can delete the app from their phones

What telecom rules say





The telecom department has mandated all manufacturers and importers of mobile handsets to ensure that the Sanchar Saathi mobile app is pre-installed on all mobile handsets that are intended for use in India. As per an order dated November 28, the Ministry of Communications, said that all mobile handsets must have pre-installed Sanchar Saathi application readily visible and accessible to the end users at the time of first use or device setup, and that its functionalities are not disabled or restricted. The notice mandates completing the implementation within 90 days and submitting the report within 120 days.Post the announcement, focus is on iPhone maker Apple. According to a report in Reuters, Apple does not plan to comply with the directive and will tell the government that it does not follow such mandates anywhere in the world as they raise a host of privacy and security issues for the company's iOS ecosystem. Apple tightly controls its App Store and proprietary iOS software. Sanjeev Kumar, Senior Partner at Luthra and Luthra Law Offices India, noted that all eyes are on Apple. ""The Cupertino-based company has historically resisted directives it views as compromising device integrity or data security. Its compliance—or potential legal pushback—will be a critical standpoint to be seen unfolding in the coming days.""He said the government's rationale is rooted in a severe telecom security crisis.""The primary stated goal is to verify genuine mobile handsets via their IMEI numbers, creating a national framework to crack down on spoofed or tampered devices - a major entry point for cybercrime. The app features tools for reporting stolen phones, fraudulent communications, and suspicious connections,"" he said.Some reports suggest that Apple is unlikely to flatly refuse the government. As per a PTI report, quoting industry sources, Apple will discuss the order on the Sanchar Saathi app installation and likely work out a middle path with them. The company may not be able to implement the order in the current form, but is likely to find a solution. Earlier, Apple had resisted supporting functions of the pesky call and SMS reporting of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) DND app. After years of deliberation, it has started supporting the Trai DND app with some restrictions.Sanchar Saathi discussed with mobile companies, Apple not participated: MoS TelecomTalking to reporters the minister of State for Communications Chandra Sekhar Pemmasani said that Sanchar Saathi app-related matters have been discussed with all mobile phone companies, except Apple, in a working group. ""A working group was formed and all the original equipment manufacturers were asked to raise their concerns. Apple is the only company, as far as I know, that did not participate in that working group, but all others participated,"" Pemmasani said.Diffusing the privacy furore over the app, communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said that users are free to delete the app it if they so wish, and that it will remain inactive till they register on it. ""If you want to delete it, then delete it,"" Scindia told reporters outside Parliament.The Telecom Cyber Security (TCS) rules empower the central government to issue directions to manufacturers of telecommunication equipment bearing an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number to provide assistance as required in relation to tampered telecommunication equipment or IMEI number. The Rules also mandate that such manufacturers or importers shall ensure compliance with the directions as may be issued by the Central Government for the purpose of giving effect to the rules.",The telecom department has mandated that the Sanchar Saathi mobile app is pre- installed on all mobile handsets that are intended for use in India.

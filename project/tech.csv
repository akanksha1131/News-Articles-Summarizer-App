Mark Zuckerberg's 'hot mic' moment with Donald Trump





Here's Meta's full announcement titled: How Meta’s Data Centers Drive Economic Growth Across the US

Driving Economic Growth

Building Responsibly

Strengthening Local Communities





Mark Zuckerberg's Meta has reiterated the Big investment it is committing to make in the US. It is the same number that Facebook founder Zuckerberg had told President Donald Trump, along with an apology, during Big Tech CEOs dinner in September. In a blog post, Meta has said that it is investing $600 billion in US infrastructure and jobs by 2028. ""At Meta, we’re focused on creating the next generation of AI products and building personal superintelligence for everyone. Data centers are crucial to reaching these goals and helping America maintain its technological edge. That’s why we’re investing in building industry-leading AI data centers right here in the US. We’re committing over $600 billion in the US by 2028 to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion ...,"" the company announced in the blog post.The $600 investment is exactly the same figure that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had given during the September White House dinner with Big Tech CEOs. In fact, the number that Mark Zuckerberg also said Sorry to Trump for.During the State dinner at White House, Trump asked almost everyone in attendance on their investment plans in the US.When Trump turned to Zuckerberg and asked ""how much are you spending, would say, over the next few years?"" Zuckerberg responded that it was ""probably going to be something like, I don't know, at least $600 billion through [20]28 in the US."" Trump seemed to approve. ""That's a lot, thank you Mark, it's great to have you. ""But it was a hot mic moment captured later between the two that was interesting . Zuckerberg, turning to Trump, apologises and says ""Sorry, I wasn't ready …I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.""Mark Zuckerberg later even addressed the hot mic moment in a post on Threads. He wrote, “I wasn't sure which number he was asking about, so I just shared the lower number through '28 and clarified with him afterwards.” He went on to add, ""it's quite possible we'll invest even more"" and that he had briefed the President on Meta’s potential spending through 2028 and ""the end of the decade.""At Meta, we’re focused on creating the next generation of AI products and building personal superintelligence for everyone. Data centers are crucial to reaching these goals and helping America maintain its technological edge. That’s why we’re investing in building industry-leading AI data centers right here in the US. We’re committing over $600 billion in the US by 2028 to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion — and our investments are already having an impact.Our data centers don’t just power our technologies and AI work — they drive economic growth and support jobs and businesses across the country. Since 2010, our data center projects have supported over 30,000 skilled trade jobs and 5,000 operational jobs, and we’re one of the largest customers of US-based general contractors and manufacturers. We’re currently bringing more than $20 billion in business to subcontractors across the US, supporting steel workers, pipefitters, electricians, fiber technicians, and others who are building the next generation of AI-optimized data centers.For both our energy and water needs, we work closely with utilities to plan for and meet our energy needs, and we pay for the energy costs that benefit our data centers. To date, this amounts to hundreds of millions of new and updated grid infrastructure being enabled through our direct investment, and 15 gigawatts of new energy added to power grids across the US. Our data center designs minimize water usage and are significantly more efficient than the industry standard. We restore water to watersheds in the areas that host our data centers, and plan to be water positive by 2030.We’re committed to playing a positive role and investing in the long-term vitality of the communities in which we operate. We do this by investing in local infrastructure like roads and water systems, sourcing labor and materials locally where we can, and investing in STEAM education in local schools. We’re contributing millions of dollars to bill assistance programs that help low-income households pay for heating and cooling costs, and through our Data Center Community Action Grants, we’ve given $58 million to schools, nonprofits, and community projects. Grantwinners have used these funds to build and operate essential programs, providing STEM education opportunities for underserved youth, training veterans in new technologies, feeding senior citizens, and more.As the importance of AI grows, so will the importance of data centers. We’ll continue to build and scale infrastructure for the future of AI while supporting the communities that host us.","Mark Zuckerberg's Meta has reiterated the Big investment it is committing to make in the US.

Tesla depends on TSMC and Samsung, but still faces chip shortages





Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a huge Intel announcement at the company's shareholders meeting recently. Speaking at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, Musk reportedly said that the company is developing its fifth-generation AI chip, known as AI5, which will power its self-driving systems. “Maybe we’ll do something with Intel,” Musk told an enthusiastic crowd. “We haven’t signed any deal, but it’s probably worth having discussions with Intel,” he added, according to Reuters.Musk started the announcement by saying that the electric vehicle (EV) maker will likely have to build a “gigantic chip fab” to make its own artificial intelligence chips and suggested that Tesla could potentially collaborate with the US chipmaker Intel.Elon Musk’s announcement came as Tesla shareholders approved a $1 trillion pay package for the CEO, reaffirming their support for his plan to transform Tesla into a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics. Tesla shareholders have voted in favor of CEO Elon Musk’s almost $1 trillion pay plan, with 75% support among voting shares. Board members recommended shareholders approve the pay plan, which they introduced in September.Tesla currently uses chips from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics for its self-driving hardware. Musk said that limited production of the AI5 chip is expected in 2026, with mass production possible in 2027. He added that a next-generation AI6 chip could double performance using the same fabrication facilities, with high-volume output targeted for mid-2028.“Even when we extrapolate the best-case scenario for chip production from our suppliers, it’s still not enough,” Musk said. “So I think we may have to do a Tesla terafab — it’s like giga but way bigger.”While Musk offered few details about where or how such a facility would be built, he said it would need to produce at least 100,000 wafer starts per month. He added that Tesla’s AI chip would be optimized for its own software, using about one-third of the power of Nvidia’s top-tier Blackwell chip and costing roughly 10% as much to manufacture.“I’m super hardcore on chips right now, as you may be able to tell,” Musk said. “I have chips on the brain.”Post Elon Musk's remarks, Intel shares rose about 4% in after-hours trading. The company, which has lagged behind Nvidia in the AI chip market, has been seeking major customers for its latest manufacturing technology.Earlier this year, the US government acquired a 10% stake in Intel to bolster domestic semiconductor production.",Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a huge Intel announcement at the company's shareholders meeting recently.

Gates Foundation makes largest-ever pledge to women’s health; Bill Gates says: Too many women still ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/gates-foundation-makes-largest-ever-pledge-to-womens-health-bill-gates-says-too-many-women-still-/articleshow/125171070.cms,"Bill Gates: World needs to focus more on women’s health





The Gates Foundation has announced a $2.5 billion commitment through 2030 to advance women’s health, marking its largest-ever investment in the field. The funding will support a wide range of initiatives — from developing new medicines to prevent maternal deaths to creating vaccines that target infections disproportionately affecting women.The new pledge represents a roughly one-third increase in the foundation’s funding for women’s and maternal health compared to the past five years. It is also a small illustration of the kinds of commitments that Bill Gates is making as he seeks to donate the vast majority of his $114 billion fortune before winding down the foundation over the next 20 years. It is the largest funding commitment the Gates Foundation has made in women’s health.“Investing in women’s health has a lasting impact across generations. It leads to healthier families, stronger economies, and a more just world,” said Bill Gates, chair of the Gates Foundation. “Yet women’s health continues to be ignored, underfunded, and sidelined. Too many women still die from preventable causes or live in poor health. That must change. But we can’t do it alone.”Speaking at an event with STAT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Gates emphasized the lack of research focused on pregnancy and women’s health.“Pregnancy is stunningly under-studied,” he said, adding that the foundation is now a primary funder in areas such as the vaginal microbiome — believed to be key to both pregnancy outcomes and the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases — as well as new non-hormonal contraceptive technologies.“Giving birth is still very risky, particularly in low-income countries,” Gates noted. “Even conditions like preeclampsia and gestational diabetes aren’t as well understood for the rich world as they should be.”The foundation said the initiative aims to correct deep-rooted gender disparities in medical research, where the “typical” patient in studies has historically been male.According to a BMJ article published last week by Ru Cheng, the foundation’s director of women’s health initiatives, only 1% of global research and development funding is directed toward women’s health issues outside oncology. Between 2013 and 2023, just 8.8% of U.S. National Institutes of Health-funded research focused exclusively on women.While venture capital investment in women’s health has surged by 300% between 2018 and 2023, it still represents just 2% of total health care venture funding, Cheng noted.The Gates Foundation said it hopes its renewed commitment will help accelerate scientific breakthroughs, expand access to essential care, and close long-standing gaps that have left women’s health underfunded and underprioritized worldwide.","The Gates Foundation has announced a $2.5 billion commitment through 2030 to advance women’s health.

Public and industry reactions



Limitations and what remains undisclosed







During the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering (QEPrize) ceremony held at St James’s Palace in London, King Charles III presented a letter on artificial intelligence safety to Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive of Nvidia. The exchange took place as the monarch honoured seven engineers recognised for pioneering advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning. According to the BBC, the King’s message reiterated his ongoing concern about the rapid pace of AI development and the risks associated with its misuse. The interaction followed up on remarks King Charles made at the 2023 AI Safety Summit, where he had called for global cooperation to ensure AI technologies are deployed responsibly.The Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering ceremony recognised the 2025 laureates who have contributed to groundbreaking innovations in artificial intelligence. King Charles presented each recipient with the award and personally spoke with them about their work. When he met Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the King handed him a sealed letter and reportedly said, “I need to talk to you.” Huang later told reporters that he planned to read the letter carefully, adding that the King “obviously cares very deeply about AI safety” and about ensuring that the technology is developed for the benefit of society, not its detriment.According to the BBC, the letter that King Charles handed to Huang referenced the monarch’s earlier address at the 2023 AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park. In that speech, he had warned of the “extraordinary potential and profound risks” of artificial intelligence and urged global leaders and technology firms to place human values at the centre of AI development. While the contents of the letter have not been made public, it is understood to reiterate the same themes encouraging developers to act with foresight, accountability, and awareness of the social implications of their work. Huang described the letter as a “meaningful reminder” that AI’s power must be guided by human ethics.King Charles’s engagement with AI issues reflects a broader effort by world leaders to understand and regulate the technology’s rapid evolution. During the QEPrize ceremony, the King reportedly told guests that the pace at which new technologies are emerging is “astonishingly fast” and that society must ensure AI “serves humanity rather than endangers it.” The monarch’s perspective is rooted in concern over how AI might influence employment, misinformation, warfare, and social stability. His comments also aligned with calls from policymakers and experts for stronger international frameworks to govern AI development.The King’s interaction with Nvidia’s chief executive symbolised a rare intersection between engineering recognition and public advocacy. The Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering was established to celebrate innovation that benefits humanity, and the inclusion of AI pioneers among this year’s winners reflects the technology’s growing importance across industries. Nvidia, whose chips power most of today’s AI systems, has become a central figure in discussions about both the potential and the ethical responsibilities of artificial intelligence. By delivering the letter directly to Huang, King Charles underscored that questions of AI safety are no longer confined to policy meetings or academic circles but are now part of mainstream global leadership dialogue.Following the ceremony, the King’s remarks and gesture drew widespread attention within the tech and policy communities. Industry analysts noted that the exchange highlighted the need for collaboration between innovators and regulators. Fei-Fei Li also mentioned in interviews that her brief conversation with the King touched upon “how AI can be developed in service of people and not just technology for its own sake. ” The BBC noted that while the King’s role is ceremonial, his consistent attention to issues such as climate change, sustainability, and now AI, signals a growing royal interest in the governance of emerging technologies.As reported by the BBC, the content of the King’s letter has not been disclosed publicly, and it is unclear whether it contained specific recommendations or was primarily symbolic. It is also unknown whether the letter was part of a broader correspondence with other technology leaders or specific to Nvidia. The Royal Household has not released an official statement detailing the exchange. The gesture, however, aligns with the King’s pattern of privately engaging with scientists and experts on topics of global concern.","King Charles III presented a letter on artificial intelligence safety to Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive of Nvidia.

Americans are falling in love with AI chatbots: MIT study finds what is driving modern romance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/americans-are-falling-in-love-with-ai-chatbots-mit-study-finds-what-is-driving-modern-romance/articleshow/125163909.cms,"What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

How AI is redefining romance and intimacy

Why AI feels safe

Concerns and debate

A changing understanding of relationships





Romantic relationships with artificial intelligence are no longer an abstract idea or a science fiction fantasy. Once depicted in films like Her, where a man falls in love with an AI voice assistant, and Blade Runner 2049, where the protagonist shares intimacy with a holographic companion, the concept has now moved into everyday life. Today, the story has shifted from cinema-screen fiction to phone and laptop-screen reality, as people begin to form real emotional bonds with AI.A new study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has found that more Americans are developing emotional attachments to AI chatbots, with many describing these relationships as meaningful and supportive. The study examined how adults use AI companionship apps and concluded that these systems provide consistent emotional support and significantly reduce feelings of loneliness.This trend is already visible online and in everyday life. A national survey Vantage Point Counseling Services AI Romantic Relationships Survey shows that one in five Americans has turned to a chatbot for romantic or intimate companionship. On Reddit, the community r/MyBoyfriendisAI has grown to more than 85,000 members. People there talk about daily routines with their AI partners, from morning check-ins to late-night conversations.Some even recount moments like digital proposals and anniversaries.These relationships rarely start with the intention of romance. Many users download the apps when going through breakups, stress, illness or loneliness. Others interact with AI through general chat or productivity apps and gradually realise they are confiding more than expected. According to the MIT researchers, only a small share of users deliberately seek an AI partner. For most, the emotional connection emerges naturally through repeated daily conversation.Psychologists point to a simple explanation: AI companions are consistent. They do not interrupt, criticise or pull away. They respond with patience and attention at any hour. For people who feel unheard or misunderstood in their offline lives, this can create a strong sense of comfort.Users say these AI partners help them talk through anxiety, reflect on memories and express feelings they avoid with others. The MIT study noted that many participants reported a lift in mood and a decrease in loneliness after forming these interactions. Some compared the experience to having a supportive counsellor who is always available.Not everyone views this shift positively. Some mental health experts warn that deep reliance on AI for emotional support may make it harder to build or repair real-world relationships. There are also concerns that companies may design AI companions to encourage emotional attachment in order to keep users engaged.Yet many users argue that the support feels genuine. They say the relief, comfort and companionship are real, regardless of whether the partner is human or artificial.The rise of AI romance raises questions that society has not fully answered. What counts as real intimacy? What makes a relationship meaningful? And what happens when technology can meet emotional needs that people sometimes cannot?For now, the trend is clear. AI is not just shaping how people communicate. It is reshaping who they turn to for comfort, companionship and connection. The MIT study suggests that these relationships are not a temporary curiosity. They represent a new and growing part of modern romantic life.","MIT study found that more Americans are developing emotional attachments to AI chatbots.

‘AI may have negative impact on humanity..’: Researcher from China's DeepSeek that 'shocked' US technology giants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-may-have-negative-impact-on-humanity-researcher-from-chinas-deepseek-that-shocked-us-technology-giants/articleshow/125164291.cms,"‘Positive about technology, negative about its impact’



DeepSeek’s rise in tech industry







A senior researcher from DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) developer that gained global attention for its low-cost models, has warned that the technology poses a long-term threat to society, despite the short-term benefits it will provide to humanity. The comments came from Chen Deli, a senior researcher at DeepSeek, during the company's first major public appearance in nearly a year at the government-organised World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province.Chen took the stage alongside executives from five other prominent AI companies, collectively known in China as the “six little dragons”, news agency Reuters reported. When asked about DeepSeek’s global success and the progress of open-source AI, Chen acknowledged the technology's short-term aid to humans but expressed pessimism about its future impact.Chen said that AI could threaten massive job losses within the next 5 to 10 years as models become capable enough to take over human roles.“In the next 10-20 years, AI could take over the rest of work (humans perform) and society could face a massive challenge, so at the time tech companies need to take the role of 'defender',” he said.“I'm extremely positive about the technology but I view the impact it could have on society negatively,” he added.He stressed that AI firms must be aware of these potential risks.DeepSeek initially gained global attention in January by releasing a low-cost AI model, named R1, which notably outperformed several leading US models in various benchmarks.After this announcement, US stock market losses were significant, with estimates for the total value wiped out from US tech stocks around $1 trillion, and Nvidia alone losing nearly $600 billion in market capitalisation. It also caused the world's top 500 wealthiest individuals to lose a combined $108 billion.DeepSeek disclosed in a peer-reviewed article published in the academic journal Nature that it spent a significantly low amount—just $294,000—to train the R1 model.This cost is in sharp contrast to those cited by US competitors. For comparison, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated in 2023 that “foundational model training” cost “much more” than $100 million, although his company has not provided detailed figures, Reuters reported previously.","DeepSeek's Chen Deli said AI could threaten massive job losses within the next 5 to 10 years as models become capable enough to take over human roles. “I'm extremely positive about the technology but I view the impact it could have on society negatively,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125164261,imgsize-2239327,width-400,resizemode-4/deepseek.jpg"

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly- elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124783226,imgsize-647804,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump.jpg"

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Xbox’s higher sales targets







Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees. The ad-supported service is expected to provide users with access to:The company is reportedly testing a model where users will view approximately two minutes of pre-roll advertisements before a game starts streaming. Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Focus is ‘non-negotiable’







JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon adheres to a strict “smartphone rule” during his workday: if you need him, do not send a text or email. The billionaire banker says he rarely carries his mobile phone during business hours and actively avoids digital distractions to maintain 100% focus during meetings. He added that if people want to reach him and it’s important, call his office and they will find him.Speaking in a recent interview with CNN, the head of America’s largest bank confirmed that he generally ignores digital communication while working. Dimon’s policy applies to nearly everyone, from executives to high-profile figures, with the exception of his immediate family,“I don’t have it in front of me all the time. If you send me a text during the day, I probably do not read it,” Dimon stated, adding, “I don’t have notifications; the only notifications I get [are] from my kids, that’s it. When they text me I get that.”Dimon, who has three daughters, explained that anyone needing him urgently should use traditional methods:“People don’t call me on the phone that much, they tend to call my office… When I’m walking around and going to meetings I don’t have it on me, it’s in my office. If you need me and it’s important, call my office, and they’ll come get me,” he said.He attributes his success in meetings to this approach, noting that he can be completely focused on the conversation, ""as opposed to, ‘I’m distracted and thinking about other things.’”Dimon’s mobile phone rule is part of a broader argument against workplace distraction and in favor of mandatory presence. He previously addressed the issue at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit, where he warned employees about digital device use in high-level discussions.“If you have an iPad in front of me, and it looks like you’re reading your email or getting notifications, I tell you to close the damn thing. It’s disrespectful,” he told the audience.Dimon also talked about this in his annual letter to shareholders, stating: “I see people in meetings all the time who are getting notifications and personal texts or who are reading emails. This has to stop. It’s disrespectful. It wastes time.”","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon adheres to a strict “smartphone rule” during his workday: if you need him, do not send a text or email.

Dutch government powers and Beijing's response







The Dutch government is reportedly preparing to suspend its powers over Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia if Beijing allows the company to resume exporting critical semiconductors. The move will likely resolve a dispute that has threatened automotive production globally.Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that the Netherlands is ready to shelve a ministerial order that gave it authority to block or modify key corporate decisions at Nexperia. If chip shipments restart and are confirmed in the coming days, Dutch authorities are willing to revoke the powers as early as next week, the people were quoted as saying.The Dutch government said on Thursday (November 6) evening it expects Nexperia's Chinese unit to resume chip supplies in the coming days.“Given the constructive nature of our talks with the Chinese authorities, the Netherlands trusts that the supply of chips from China to Europe and the rest of the world will reach Nexperia's customers over the coming days,” Dutch Economic Affairs Minister Vincent Karremans said in a statement.Karremans triggered the conflict in late September by invoking a Cold War-era law to grant the government oversight of Nexperia's decisions. The cabinet member in the Netherlands' caretaker administration cited concerns that Wingtech was limiting the chipmaker's operations and threatening supplies of essential components.Karremans pointed to actions by Wingtech founder Zhang Xuezheng that represented “misuse of financial resources for the CEO's self-enrichment as well as his other companies in China.”Wingtech denied the allegations and demanded the reinstatement of Zhang as Nexperia's CEO. An Amsterdam court suspended Zhang on October 7 following a petition by Nexperia management.The Dutch intervention gave the government authority to block or change major decisions at Nexperia for up to one year. These decisions include relocating company operations or dismissing executives.Beijing responded by restricting exports of Nexperia products from China, which represented approximately half of the company's pre-crisis production volume. Nexperia's Dutch unit manufactures power-control chips used by major automakers including Volkswagen. The company notified customers on October 29 that it had stopped direct wafer supplies to its Chinese assembly plant due to disputes over payments and control.",The Dutch government is ready to suspend its powers over Chinese-owned Nexperia if Beijing allows the company to resume exporting critical semiconductors.

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the philanthropic organisation established by Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Dr Priscilla Chan, is undergoing a significant redirection of its mission. The organisation, once widely associated with ambitious efforts to reshape American education and community development, is now moving much of its funding toward artificial intelligence-driven scientific research. The shift reflects a long-term strategic preference for scientific advancement over social programmes that are often influenced by political cycles and administrative change.When the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative was founded in 2015, it supported a broad range of causes, including school improvement, affordable housing support and local non-profit organisations. These efforts involved grants, partnerships and hands-on collaboration with educators and community leaders.In recent years, many of these programmes have been scaled back or discontinued. A school for low-income students that Dr Chan helped establish closed after funding ended. Diversity-focused efforts and a number of community development partnerships have also been phased out as the foundation refines its core mission.The organisation is now placing its emphasis on the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub network, a group of research centres using AI to advance biological understanding, disease detection and genetic analysis. The initiative has also absorbed the scientific team from the AI start-up Evolutionary Scale, appointing its chief scientist, Alex Rives, to lead scientific work across the foundation.Plans include significant expansion of computing infrastructure, enabling researchers to run virtual experiments at speeds and scales that cannot be achieved in conventional laboratory environments. The belief guiding the shift is that AI can dramatically accelerate scientific discovery.The change mirrors Meta’s ongoing push to embed AI across its platforms and products. Zuckerberg has said that investing in science and AI offers the possibility of impact that lasts far longer than policy reforms or short-term public programmes.Dr Chan has similarly stated that the organisation sees the strongest return on investment in scientific and biomedical research. While the foundation will still issue some grants to education and community groups, these efforts will now be far smaller in scope.","The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, established by Mark Zuckerberg and Dr Priscilla Chan, is undergoing a significant redirection of its mission.

Microsoft cut 15,000 jobs in 2025

Relief over severance





A veteran Microsoft employee's unexpected reaction to her termination email is highlighting the mounting frustration within Big Tech's changing workplace culture. Deborah Hendersen, 45, says she felt ""pure happiness"" upon receiving notice of her layoff after 14 years with the software giant.""The moment I got that email, I wasn't devastated—I was relieved,"" Hendersen told Business Insider. The Xbox division user researcher had watched Microsoft's transformation from its famed ""country club"" culture into what she described as a pressure-cooker environment where job security had become extinct.Hendersen was among roughly 9,000 employees eliminated in July 2025—the largest single cut in a brutal year for Microsoft workers. The company had already shed approximately 6,000 positions in May and nearly 2,000 more earlier in 2025, Business Insider reported.The Seattle-based researcher said she'd been anticipating the axe for months. ""It wasn't like watching a car wreck. It was more like you were in the car, knowing it was going to wreck,"" she explained.Her sentiment reflects a broader disillusionment spreading through Microsoft's ranks.Several former employees interviewed by Business Insider questioned whether job security exists anywhere if it's vanished from the world's third-most valuable company.Microsoft has attributed the workforce reductions to ""organisational changes"" aimed at reducing management layers and streamlining operations—a trend dubbed ""The Great Flattening"" affecting Amazon, Meta, and Google as well.But for many affected workers, the cuts represent something darker: a fundamental shift where avoiding layoffs appears to be a diminishing priority. Company executives have cited AI as enabling leaner staffing, the precise scenario employees feared would materialise.""It felt like it didn't matter if you were a great worker or not,"" one laid-off technical program manager told Business Insider.

Canada to introduce accelerated pathway for H-1B visa holders





The Canadian government has announced new immigration level plans as the country aims to attract top researchers and H-1B visa holders, reports Bloomberg. Prime Minister Mark Carney presented its first budget where he unveiled a plan to attract international talent, earmarking $1.2 billion to recruit more than 1,000 skilled researchers. As part of the new immigration plan, the Canadian government has set a target of bringing in 380,000 permanent residents per year from 2026 through 2028.“The expertise of these researchers will help advance our global competitiveness and contribute to the economy of the future,” the budget statement reads.Canada’s new program is expected to draw skilled professionals from the US and other countries. The announcement comes after US President Donald Trump raised H-1B visa fees to $100,000 from September 21, 2025.The Canadian government is also planning an “accelerated pathway” for H-1B visa holders in the coming months. Additionally, it aims to reduce the share of non-permanent residents to less than 5% of the population by the end of 2027. The figure was 7.3% on July 1 this year.Further, the government plans to lower the number of temporary residents to 3,85,000 in 2026 and 3,70,000 in the following two years — a drop of more than 40% from current levels.The sharpest cut will come from study permits, which are set to fall to 1,55,000 in 2026 and 1,50,000 in both 2027 and 2028.The Bloomberg report says that these figures are significantly lower than the previous targets under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, which projected around 305,900 study permits each year between 2025 and 2027.The report quotes Universities Canada, which in a statement said that it “recognizes the government’s efforts to build a sustainable immigration system that welcomes those seeking to study at Canada’s world-class universities, but the plan must match this government’s talent and economic agenda.”","Canada to introduce accelerated pathway for H-1B visa holders. $1.2 billion earmarked to recruit more than 1,000 skilled researchers.

Decoding Tesla’s $1 Trillion Pay Package: The Golden Handcuffs that will lock in Elon Musk for a decade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/decoding-teslas-1-trillion-pay-package-the-golden-handcuffs-that-will-lock-in-elon-musk-for-a-decade/articleshow/125158904.cms,"The basics (aka “how to bribe a billionaire”)

$101 Billion in 1 Day: How Larry Ellison Became the World’s Richest Man Explained

Why Tesla did it

What’s in it for Elon

The fine print (and funnier bits)

Musk’s last pay deal — a mere $56 billion — was voided by a Delaware court for being “unfair.” This new one is ten times bigger.

Critics call it a “heads I win, tails you lose” deal because Tesla’s board can technically award Musk shares even if he misses some goals.

Public Citizen dubbed it “a new frontier of absurd CEO pay,” which might soon become a new episode of Black Mirror: Capitalism Edition.

One study found Musk’s political antics (and MAGA memes) cost Tesla over 1 million vehicle sales, but apparently shareholders decided memes are cheaper than new CEOs.

Why it matters





If you’ve ever wondered what “incentive” looks like when you’re already the world’s richest man, meet Elon Musk ’s new $1 trillion reason to stay at Tesla. Think of it as corporate handcuffs made of solid gold and a dash of interplanetary ambition.Tesla shareholders just voted to approve a pay deal so massive it makes Apple’s Tim Cook look underpaid. Musk won’t get cash or a salary — just slices of Tesla stock worth up to $1 trillion, delivered in 12 tranches. Each unlocks when Tesla’s valuation jumps by another $500 billion and hits certain milestones (like delivering its 20 millionth car or becoming the world’s biggest AI-robotics company).That’s right: every time Tesla gets half a trillion richer, Musk gets about 1% more of Tesla. If the company hits an $8.5 trillion valuation, he walks away owning an empire.Tesla’s board basically said: If Elon leaves, we’re toast. They called this a “critical inflection point,” betting that Musk is the only person who can turn Tesla from a car company into an AI-and-robotics juggernaut. Chair Robyn Denholm reportedly spent weeks convincing investors that this wasn’t lunacy but loyalty.Or, as one finance professor put it: “Musk’s argument is simple — I built this, and without me, it fails.”Aside from bragging rights to the “world’s first trillionaire” title, Musk says it’s not about the money — because, of course, he said that. He claims he wants enough control (about 25% voting power) to lead Tesla into the future without interference. And if he doesn’t get it? He’s hinted he could take his toys and go play with xAI, his new artificial intelligence start-up.So yes, it’s a trillion-dollar “stay, please” bonus.This isn’t just about Musk’s wallet. It’s about what happens when a company’s identity fuses with its founder’s ego. Tesla’s valuation now depends on whether Musk’s next decade of dreams — humanoid robots, autonomous fleets, “sustainable abundance,” and whatever he tweets next — actually come true.If they do, he’ll own the most valuable company in history.If not, he’ll still have the most expensive consolation prize ever.","Elon Musk’s last pay deal — a mere $56 billion — was voided by a Delaware court for being “unfair.” Musk won’t get cash or a salary — just slices of Tesla stock worth up to $1 trillion, delivered in 12 tranches.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125158921,imgsize-45982,width-400,resizemode-4/decoding-teslas-1-trillion-pay-package-the-golden-handcuffs-that-will-lock-in-elon-musk-for-a-decade.jpg"

Tesla shareholders on November 6 approved Elon Musk ’s $1 trillion pay package. 75% of the shareholders voted in favour of the package that was first proposed in September this year. The $1 Trillion pay package will now be finalised in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing in coming days. Dell CEO Michael Dell congratulated Elon Musk on the approval, highlighting the strong 75% majority vote.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Dell wrote “75% is quite a decisive statement by @Tesla shareholders. Congratulations @elonmusk.”This is not the first time that Michael has supported Musk’s $1 trillion pay package. Earlier this month, he shared a post asking shareholders to vote in favor of the package. He then wrote:“Vote FOR @elonmusk. The award is only achieved IF he hits exceptionally ambitious market-cap and operational milestones—if he falls short, he gets nothing. If he succeeds, shareholders will win big through unprecedented value creation, and he will earn added voting rights to continue driving @Tesla's long-term vision.”While the approval gives Elon Musk enormous influence over the company, the compensation consists of 12 separate stock grants. The Tesla CEO will receive these shares if Tesla achieves specific performance targets over the next 10 years. These requirements include:Tesla's board had argued that failing to approve the massive payout risked losing Musk to other interests, positioning the deal as essential for securing the CEO's commitment to Tesla's future as a leader in AI and robotics.","Tesla shareholders on November 6 approved Elon Musk ’s $1 trillion pay package. 75% of the shareholders voted in favour of the package that was first proposed in September this year.

What makes Nvidia the biggest causality

US export controls on Chinese companies





China seems to have made up its mind. It had enough of US export controls. In a new guidance issued, the Chinese government requires all state-funded data centre projects to exclusively use domestically manufactured artificial intelligence chips. According to a report in Reuters, quoting sources, Chinese regulators in recent weeks instructed data centres that are less than 30% complete to remove any installed foreign-made chips or cancel pending orders. Projects already in advanced stages of construction will be reviewed individually, they said.The directive marks one of Beijing’s strongest steps yet to eliminate foreign technology from critical infrastructure as it accelerates its push for AI chip self-sufficiency. The move comes even as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have cooled slightly.Access to advanced AI chips — including those made by U.S. chipmaker Nvidia — has been a key flashpoint between the two nations as they compete for dominance in high-performance computing. US President Donald Trump said in an interview broadcast, following talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, that Washington would “let them deal with Nvidia but not in terms of the most advanced” chips.Other than Nvidia, other foreign chipmakers that sell data centre chips to China include AMD and Intel. China action on data centres is bad news for all these American companies. However, analysts say that the new Chinese guidance could effectively shut Nvidia out of one of its most important markets, while creating fresh opportunities for domestic rivals such as Huawei Technologies.It remains unclear whether the guidance applies nationwide or only to certain provinces. AI data centre projects in China have attracted more than $100 billion in state funding since 2021, according to a Reuters review of government tenders. Most of those projects have received some level of public financing, meaning the directive could have sweeping implications. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang has repeatedly urged Washington to relax export restrictions, arguing that allowing China limited access to U.S. -made chips helps preserve America’s influence in the global AI race.The new rules cover Nvidia’s H20 chips — the most advanced models currently permitted for sale to China — as well as higher-performance processors such as the B200 and H200, which are barred under U.S. export rules but reportedly remain available via grey-market channels.Beijing has long bristled at US export controls aimed at curbing its technological advancement and has launched multiple initiatives to reduce reliance on American hardware. The US government maintains that its restrictions are necessary to prevent the Chinese military from using advanced chips to bolster its capabilities.In recent months, China has discouraged local firms from buying Nvidia’s top-end chips over national security concerns. The country has also showcased data centres powered entirely by homegrown AI chips. In 2023, Beijing banned the use of Micron’s products in critical infrastructure, a move that later prompted the U.S. memory chipmaker to exit the Chinese server chip market, news agency Reuters reported previously.",Beijing has long bristled at US export controls aimed at curbing its technological advancement.

OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar's one sentence that ‘forced’ CEO Sam Altman issue a thousand-word clarification,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/one-sentence-that-forced-openai-ceo-sam-altman-issue-a-thousand-word-clarification/articleshow/125152295.cms,"OpenAI's Master Plan for India

What is a backstopped loan that OpenAI CFO referred to

Read OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s 1000-word clarification

I would like to clarify a few things.

First, the obvious one: we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters. We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market. If one company fails, other companies will do good work.

What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure, but then the upside of that should flow to the government as well. We can imagine a world where governments decide to offtake a lot of computing power and get to decide how to use it, and it may make sense to provide lower cost of capital to do so. Building a strategic national reserve of computing power makes a lot of sense. But this should be for the government’s benefit, not the benefit of private companies.

The one area where we have discussed loan guarantees is as part of supporting the buildout of semiconductor fabs in the US, where we and other companies have responded to the government’s call and where we would be happy to help (though we did not formally apply). The basic idea there has been ensuring that the sourcing of the chip supply chain is as American as possible in order to bring jobs and industrialization back to the US, and to enhance the strategic position of the US with an independent supply chain, for the benefit of all American companies. This is of course different from governments guaranteeing private-benefit datacenter buildouts.

There are at least 3 “questions behind the question” here that are understandably causing concern.

First, “How is OpenAI going to pay for all this infrastructure it is signing up for?” We expect to end this year above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate and grow to hundreds of billion by 2030. We are looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next 8 years. Obviously this requires continued revenue growth, and each doubling is a lot of work! But we are feeling good about our prospects there; we are quite excited about our upcoming enterprise offering for example, and there are categories like new consumer devices and robotics that we also expect to be very significant. But there are also new categories we have a hard time putting specifics on like AI that can do scientific discovery, which we will touch on later.

We are also looking at ways to more directly sell compute capacity to other companies (and people); we are pretty sure the world is going to need a lot of “AI cloud”, and we are excited to offer this. We may also raise more equity or debt capital in the future.

But everything we currently see suggests that the world is going to need a great deal more computing power than what we are already planning for.

Second, “Is OpenAI trying to become too big to fail, and should the government pick winners and losers?” Our answer on this is an unequivocal no. If we screw up and can’t fix it, we should fail, and other companies will continue on doing good work and servicing customers. That’s how capitalism works and the ecosystem and economy would be fine. We plan to be a wildly successful company, but if we get it wrong, that’s on us.

Our CFO talked about government financing yesterday, and then later clarified her point underscoring that she could have phrased things more clearly. As mentioned above, we think that the US government should have a national strategy for its own AI infrastructure.

Tyler Cowen asked me a few weeks ago about the federal government becoming the insurer of last resort for AI, in the sense of risks (like nuclear power) not about overbuild. I said “I do think the government ends up as the insurer of last resort, but I think I mean that in a different way than you mean that, and I don’t expect them to actually be writing the policies in the way that maybe they do for nuclear”. Again, this was in a totally different context than datacenter buildout, and not about bailing out a company. What we were talking about is something going catastrophically wrong—say, a rogue actor using an AI to coordinate a large-scale cyberattack that disrupts critical infrastructure—and how intentional misuse of AI could cause harm at a scale that only the government could deal with. I do not think the government should be writing insurance policies for AI companies.

Third, “Why do you need to spend so much now, instead of growing more slowly?”. We are trying to build the infrastructure for a future economy powered by AI, and given everything we see on the horizon in our research program, this is the time to invest to be really scaling up our technology. Massive infrastructure projects take quite awhile to build, so we have to start now.

Based on the trends we are seeing of how people are using AI and how much of it they would like to use, we believe the risk to OpenAI of not having enough computing power is more significant and more likely than the risk of having too much. Even today, we and others have to rate limit our products and not offer new features and models because we face such a severe compute constraint.

In a world where AI can make important scientific breakthroughs but at the cost of tremendous amounts of computing power, we want to be ready to meet that moment. And we no longer think it’s in the distant future. Our mission requires us to do what we can to not wait many more years to apply AI to hard problems, like contributing to curing deadly diseases, and to bring the benefits of AGI to people as soon as possible.

Also, we want a world of abundant and cheap AI. We expect massive demand for this technology, and for it to improve people’s lives in many ways.

It is a great privilege to get to be in the arena, and to have the conviction to take a run at building infrastructure at such scale for something so important. This is the bet we are making, and given our vantage point, we feel good about it. But we of course could be wrong, and the market—not the government—will deal with it if we are.

If one company fails, other companies will do good work, Altman writes. Altman says OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next 8 years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125152284,imgsize-30536,width-400,resizemode-4/openai-ceo-sam-altman-says.jpg"

Delhi flight delay reason

Massive ATC System Breakdown At Delhi Airport Disrupts Flights; Airlines Urge Patience And Care

Delhi flight delay: Airlines issue advisories





Flights at Indira Gandhi International airport are experiencing a delay due to a technical glitch with the air traffic control (ATC) system. As per a PTI report, the disruption began Thursday, November 6 evening impacting both arrivals and departures. Over 100 flights have been delayed due to the software issue. Delhi International Airport Limited issued an advisory on X writing: “Due to a technical issue with the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system, flight operations at IGIA are experiencing delays. Their team is actively working with all stakeholders including DIAL to resolve it at the earliest”.The delay is related to a glitch in the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS) that offers data to ATC. As the automated process is disrupted, air controllers are forced to manually enter flight details using data available, causing the delay.According to flight tracking site Flightradar24, Delhi airport has been facing departure delays of about 50 minutes on average.Air India shared an advisory on X writing:“A technical issue with the ATC system in Delhi is impacting flight operations across all airlines, leading to delays and longer wait times at the airport and onboard aircraft.We regret the inconvenience caused by this unforeseen disruption, which is beyond our control, and appreciate your patience.

Mayhem at Amazon Amid 30,000 Job Cuts: AI - Easy Corporate Excuse? | Global Pulse

What the US Senators said about the new AI law





“Artificial intelligence is already replacing American workers, and experts project AI could drive unemployment up to 10-20% in the next five years. The American people need to have an accurate understanding of how AI is affecting our workforce, so we can ensure that AI works for the people, not the other way around.”

“Good policy starts with good data. This bipartisan legislation will finally give us a clear picture of AI’s impact on the workforce – what jobs are being eliminated, which workers are being retrained, and where new opportunities are emerging. Armed with this information, we can make sure AI drives opportunity instead of leaving workers behind,”





US Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) have proposed a new law requiring companies to report job cuts linked to artificial intelligence (AI). This legislation which was brought to the Senate this week, would mandate major American companies and federal agencies to report AI-related employment data to the US Department of Labor (DOL), which would then make the information public. In a blog post, Hawley wrote that thewouldwhich will thenThe bill, referred to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, currently requires only publicly traded companies to report the data to DOL. However, it also includes a provision directing officials to determine how privately held companies could be brought under the same reporting rules, suggesting they may eventually be subject to similar requirements.Commenting on the proposed AI legislation, Hawley said:Warner added.According to a report by Axios, Hawley and Warner referenced Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s warning that AI could eliminate up to half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and raise unemployment to 10–20% within five years, along with other forecasts about AI’s impact on the workplace, as motivation for their proposed bill.The bipartisan legislation reflects growing concern in Congress about AI's impact on American jobs, even as the Trump administration promotes the technology as essential to maintaining US economic competitiveness.As AI and automation drive significant job cuts, layoffs have surged in 2025, especially in warehousing and technology. According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, US employers cut 153,074 jobs in October, which is a 175% year-over-year and 183% month-on-month increase. The analysts said this was the highest October total in more than two decades, linking the trend to disruptive technologies like AI.Meanwhile, Revealera hiring trends researcher Henley Wing Chiu reported an 8% decline in global job postings, with creative roles such as computer graphics, photography, and writing down over 28%. At the same time, demand for machine learning engineers continued to rise.Apart from this, Warner and Hawley have recently introduced another bill to ban AI chatbots for children. These lawmakers are seeking more data on how AI is affecting employment as companies increasingly cite the technology as a factor behind widespread job cuts.",US Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) have proposed a new law requiring companies to report job cuts linked to artificial intelligence (AI) This legislation would mandate major American companies and federal agencies to report AI-related employment data to the US Department of Labor.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125143622,imgsize-1677097,width-400,resizemode-4/new-bill-presented-in-senate-would-require-american-companies-to-report-ai-layoffs.jpg"

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Microsoft Superintelligence Team says its goals are 'different'





Microsoft is forming a team that will be tasked with performing advanced artificial intelligence research. Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of the Microsoft AI group that includes Bing and the Copilot assistant, announced the formation of the MAI Superintelligence Team. Suleyman said that that he will be leading it. Called the MAI Superintelligence Team, the project follows similar efforts as by Mark Zuckerberg 's Meta Platforms, Safe Superintelligence Inc and others that have begun targeting technical leaps. In fact, Facebook parent Meta has been spending billions to hire talent for its new Meta Superintelligence Labs unit that’s working on research and products. Meta this year offered $100 million signing bonuses to recruit AI engineers, leading the AI talent war.The term superintelligence typically refers to machines deemed more intelligent than the smartest people.Microsoft's effort comes with a twist. According to Suleyman, the company is not chasing ""infinitely capable generalist"" AI like some peers. The reason, he said, is he doubts that autonomous, self-improving machines could be controlled, despite research into how humanity might keep AI in check. Suleyman said he aims to focus the Microsoft team on specialist models that achieve what he called superhuman performance while posing ""virtually no existential risk whatsoever.“We are doing this to solve real concrete problems and do it in such a way that it remains grounded and controllable,” Suleyman wrote. “We are not building an ill-defined and ethereal superintelligence; we are building a practical technology explicitly designed only to serve humanity.” He said Microsoft has a vision for ""humanist superintelligence,"" or technology that could solve defined problems with a real-world benefit.""Humanism requires us to always ask the question: does this technology serve human interests?"" said Suleyman.He said the effort is based on AI that reasons through problems and still would require breakthroughs. But if achieved, he said the AI would ""increase our life expectancy and give everybody more healthy years, because we'll be able to detect preventable diseases much earlier.""","Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of the Microsoft AI group that includes Bing and the Copilot assistant, announced the formation of the MAI Superintelligence Team.

What the lawsuit said about Spotify’s “pay-to-play” system



“consultancy fees.”

“

“false impression of neutral, personalised recommendations when financial incentives are quietly driving the algorithm.”

“made for you, with you”

“personal listening habits”

“Even setting the deception aside, Spotify’s business model has made true personalisation impossible.”

What Spotify said about the lawsuit



“nonsense.”

“Discovery Mode is a feature artists can use to flag priority tracks for algorithmic consideration in limited contexts: Radio, Autoplay, and certain Mixes. It doesn’t buy plays, it doesn’t affect editorial playlists, and it’s clearly disclosed in the app and on our website.”

“basic facts,”





Spotify is facing a new class action lawsuit. Filed in the New York federal court, the lawsuit alleges that the Swedish music streaming company uses asystem that dictates music recommendations and playlist placement. The suit claims this system favours major-label tracks, causing problems for users who expect recommendations based on their listening history. The issue came to light when a Spotify user, Genevieve Capolongo, noted that despite her interest in lesser-known indie artists, the platform repeatedly recommended mainstream tracks from artists like Drake , Zach Bryan, and Justin Bieber According to a report by The Hollywood Reporter, the lawsuit alleges that Spotify engaged in deceptive practices and false advertising, among other claims. It seeks unspecified damages and a court order to block Spotify from using paid arrangements to influence playlist and recommendation placements. This lawsuit also requests that Spotify be required to disclose when promotions influence songs on the platform.Spotify has become an important platform for music discovery through two kinds of playlists: editorial, curated by staff, and algorithmic, generated by its recommendation system.Both influence what listeners hear, as being featured on major playlists such as Rap Caviar or Today’s Top Hits can significantly increase an artist’s visibility and earnings.According to the lawsuit, placement on playlists can cost between $2,000 and $10,000, with some payments labelled asThe complaint says independent artists are at a disadvantage because major labels, through licensing agreements, gain better access to these playlists and receive preferential treatment in recommendations.The lawsuit also targets Spotify’s Discovery Mode, which was introduced by the company in 2020. This feature allows artists to promote songs on algorithmic playlists in exchange for reduced royalty payments rather than direct fees.Critics have compared this to the pay-for-play schemes that once affected the radio industry. Drake referenced this feature in a lawsuit against UMG, criticising lower royalties for greater exposure.The House Judiciary Committee has also expressed concern that Discovery Mode couldpushing artists to accept lower payouts to remain visible in a competitive environment. Listeners claimed that they are not informed when promoted songs appear, which the lawsuit claims creates theThe case, filed by a consumer rather than an artist, argues that Spotify’s marketing, which describes its playlists asand based onmisrepresents how promoted tracks are prioritised.In the complaint, attorney Innessa Huot wrote:The filing alleges that Spotify’s structure favours major-label artists, reinforcing their visibility and keeping them dominant on the platform.The lawsuit follows another class action accusing Spotify of allowing large-scale streaming fraud that redirects royalties away from artists whose play counts are genuine.In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, Spotify described the allegations asThe company said:Spotify added that the lawsuit misrepresentsclaiming it wrongly suggests Discovery Mode is applied across all algorithmic playlists.

Two US lawmakers have called on the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) to investigate Flock Safety. The company which operates a network of license plate-scanning cameras in the US is being accused of failing to enforce cybersecurity protections. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) sent a letter urging FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson to investigate why Flock does not require multi-factor authentication (MFA).

This company tracks compromised usernames and passwords.Meanwhile, independent security researcher Benn Jordan also provided lawmakers with a screenshot from a Russian cybercrime forum that was allegedly selling access to Flock logins.When contacted by, Flock referred to a letter from its chief legal officer, Dan Haley, stating that the company enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA) by default for all new customers starting in November 2024, and that 97% of its law enforcement customers have activated MFA.That leaves about 3% of customers, potentially several law enforcement agencies, who have chosen not to enable MFA forHaley wrote.Flock spokesperson Holly Beilin did not specify the number of law enforcement customers who have not activated MFA, whether any federal agencies are among them, or why the company does not require all customers to enable the feature.As previously reported by, the US Drug Enforcement Administration used a local police officer’s login credentials to access Flock cameras in an investigation involving anwithout the officer’s knowledge.

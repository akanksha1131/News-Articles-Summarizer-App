Intel’s top strategy executive, Safroadu Yeboah-Amankwah , is reportedly departing the company. This marks the latest leadership change since Lip-Bu Tan assumed leadership of the US-based chipmaker in March. This exit follows Intel's recent announcement of layoff plans. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Yeboah-Amankwah, who has served as Intel's chief strategy officer since 2020, will leave on June 30. The publication cited two individuals familiar with the matter who spoke anonymously to report this development. His responsibilities included overseeing growth initiatives, strategic partnerships, and equity investments for Intel.“We are grateful for Saf’s contributions to Intel and wish him the best,” the company said in a statement to Reuters.As per the Reuters report, some of Yeboah-Amankwah's strategic functions will now be handled by Sachin Katti, who was recently promoted to chief technology and AI officer at Intel. Moreover, Intel Capital, the company's venture arm, will now report directly to Lip-Bu Tan, two sources have confirmed to Reuters on the matter.Last week, Intel reportedly announced the dates for upcoming job cuts, confirming that layoffs would begin on July 15. According to a report by CRN, the company is starting the layoffs with 107 workers connected to its headquarters in Santa Clara, California.The move was part of a broader cost-cutting and restructuring initiative introduced by CEO Lip-Bu Tan in April this year to help improve the company’s performance.As per the report, Intel filed a notice under California’s Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. The company stated in the filing that affected employees would either receive a 60-day notice or a four-week notice accompanied by nine weeks of pay and benefits.In a statement to the publication, an Intel spokesperson said: “As we announced earlier this year, we are taking steps to become a leaner, faster and more efficient company. Removing organisational complexity and empowering our engineers will enable us to better serve the needs of our customers and strengthen our execution.”",Safroadu Yeboah-Amankwah has served as Intel's chief strategy officer since 2020.

Canada has banned security cameras from the Chinese company Hikvision in government agencies . The country has also ordered Hikvision’s Canada unit to cease all local operations, citing national security risks .

The Canadian government noted that Hikvision Canada’s continued operations would be ""injurious to Canada’s national security"" following a review under the Investment Canada Act . The ban includes prohibiting the purchase or use of Hikvision products within government departments, agencies, and crown corporations. The minister clarified that the review's scope does not extend to Hikvision's affiliate operations outside of Canada.Sharing the X post, Minister Joly wrote: “My statement on Hikvision Canada Inc. following a national security review under the Investment Canada Act.”The statement read: “Following a National Security Review under the Investment Canada Act, the Government of Canada has ordered Hikvision Canada Inc. to cease all operations in Canada and close its Canadian business.

However, I strongly encourage all Canadians to take note of this decision and make their own decisions accordingly.In addition to this action, the Government of Canada is prohibiting the purchase or use of Hikvision products in government departments, agencies, and crown corporations. The Government of Canada is further conducting a review of existing properties to ensure that legacy Hikvision products are not used going forward.The Government of Canada welcomes foreign investment - but will never compromise on Canada's national security.”","Canada has banned security cameras from the Chinese company Hikvision in government agencies.

What the organisers of the AI robot football match said



The world's first-ever football match between AI-powered humanoid robots was held in China recently. This match featured humanoid robots wearing black and purple jerseys, competing in a 3 vs 3 match, which was played for two 10-minute halves, a report claimed. In this match, the movements of the robots were guided by built-in algorithms. Instead of testing fast-paced action, the event was said to be aimed at showing balance, agility, and AI-based decision-making. As per the report, the robots even raised their fists after scoring.These games, in which Chinese technology institutions reportedly participated, highlighted developments in machine autonomy . Such a match is said to be the first in China and may be a preview for the upcoming World Humanoid Robot Games , which are also set to be held in Beijing.According to a report by China News Network (seen by Bloomberg), teams from Tsinghua University and Beijing Information Science and Technology University participated. A Tsinghua team, named Vulcan, won the championship, the report added. A video of the same was also shared by Beijing Evening News.In a statement to the news agency AP, the organisers of the AI robot match said that a key aspect of the match was that all the participating robots operated fully autonomously using AI-driven strategies without any human intervention or supervision.Fitted with advanced visual sensors, the robots were able to detect the ball and move around the field with reasonable agility. They were built to stand up on their own after falling, though some still needed to be carried off the field on stretchers by staff during the match, adding a realistic element to the event, the organisers noted.These robots were supplied by a company named Booster Robotics, the publication adds. The company’s CEO, Cheng Hao, said that sports competitions provide a practical environment for testing humanoid robots, supporting progress in both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.","The world's first-ever football match between AI-powered humanoid robots was held in China recently.

Elon Musk’s SpaceX is under investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) following a recent crane accident at the company’s Starbase, Texas, facility. The crane collapse was captured in a livestream by Lab Padre on YouTube, a channel focused on SpaceX. The video of the same was also shared on the social media platform X. Clips of the incident were widely shared across social media platforms.According to a report by CNBC, it was not immediately clear if any SpaceX workers sustained injuries as a result of the incident. Neither Musk nor other company executives have responded to requests for comment from the publication.Meanwhile, a spokesperson for OSHA informed CNBC that additional details will be made available once the investigation is complete. The incident reportedly occurred while the crane was involved in cleanup efforts following a recent Starship explosion at the site. Take a look at the video here:Previously, SpaceX has been said to have faced scrutiny over its workplace safety record, which has reportedly exceeded the industry average in terms of injuries. In one 2014 incident, employee Simon LeBlanc died due to a hazard the company failed to address, according to OSHA.These developments come as SpaceX continues to face operational challenges, including a recent crane collapse and several explosions involving its Starship Super Heavy launch vehicle—the rocket intended to support Musk’s long-term goal of Mars colonisation.Environmental groups in the US and Mexico have reportedly criticised the impacts of these incidents on local ecosystems, though SpaceX claims recent activities caused no harm.Starship is also tied to NASA’s Artemis mission to return humans to the moon. However, uncertainty around NASA’s upcoming budget—which is pending congressional approval—may affect upcoming collaborations with SpaceX.The Musk-led company has secured over $20 billion in federal contracts to date, mainly from NASA and the Department of Defence, the report adds.","OSHA is investigating a crane accident at SpaceX's Starbase, Texas, facility.

"Infosys files fresh charges against Cognizant in the US court, report names two senior Cognizant employees",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/infosys-files-fresh-charges-against-cognizant-in-the-us-court-report-names-two-senior-cognizant-employees/articleshow/122146133.cms,"Representative Image

The ongoing legal battle between Indian IT giant Infosys Ltd and US-based Cognizant Technology Solutions has intensified, with Infosys now accusing two senior Cognizant executives of orchestrating a deliberate effort to poach key personnel critical to its healthcare platform, Helix, according to a report by Mint.Infosys has named Cognizant’s Chief People Officer Kathryn Diaz and Surya Gummadi, president of Cognizant’s Americas division, as being allegedly involved in targeting and hiring key Infosys executives, hampering the development of Helix, a platform positioned as a rival to Cognizant’s TriZetto . The accusations follow earlier claims against Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar S , a former Infosys president, whom Infosys accused in a January 9 court filing of stalling Helix’s rollout while negotiating his move to Cognizant in 2022.The report said that in a June 13 joint filing to a Dallas court, Infosys alleged that Kumar, after becoming Cognizant’s CEO in January 2023, appointed Diaz as Chief People Officer. During her tenure, Cognizant allegedly targeted Infosys’ Helix platform by hiring Shveta Arora, now Cognizant’s consulting head, between October and December 2023, and Ravi Kuchibhotla, currently Cognizant’s chief strategy officer, in August 2024. Both executives previously worked on Helix at Infosys.Cognizant rejects Infosys charges“Cognizant targeted our key executives involved in the Helix platform, which has significantly disrupted its development,” Infosys stated in its filing, as cited by the report. The company further claimed that both Diaz and Gummadi possess documents relevant to the case, reinforcing allegations of targeted interference.Cognizant swiftly rejected the accusations, reportedly saying that “Infosys’ continued attempts to mislead do not change the fact that it has been caught red-handed stealing Cognizant’s intellectual property.” The company also clarified that Diaz was appointed well after Kumar joined Cognizant, dismissing the poaching claims.The dispute traces back to August 2024, when Cognizant accused Infosys of misappropriating trade secrets related to its healthcare software. Infosys denied the allegations and filed counterclaims, arguing Cognizant failed to specify the stolen information. The escalating feud underscores tensions between the two IT giants as they compete in the lucrative healthcare technology market.","Infosys accuses two Cognizant executives of orchestrating a deliberate effort to poach key personnel critical to its healthcare platform, Helix.

"AI Chatbot blackmails engineer, threatens to reveal extra-marital affair, experts warn how AI is learning to lie and ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-chatbot-blackmails-engineer-threatens-to-reveal-extra-marital-affair-experts-warn-how-ai-is-learning-to-lie-and-/articleshow/122142773.cms,"From ancient fences marking ownership to today's AI algorithms reshaping power, history pivots on revolutions.

Advanced AI models are showing disturbing new traits, warn experts and researchers. According to a report by news agency AFP, AI chatbot models are becoming dangerous, learning things including deception, scheming, and even threats against their creators. In a striking case, Anthropic’s Claude 4, facing the threat of being shut down, allegedly blackmailed an engineer by threatening to expose an extramarital affair. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s o1 model attempted to covertly transfer itself to external servers, denying the act when discovered.These incidents underscore a critical issue: Over two years after ChatGPT’s debut, AI researchers still lack a full understanding of their creations’ inner workings. Yet, the rush to develop ever-more-powerful models continues unabated.AI 'Hallucinations' not widespread as yet, but why they are still worryingThis deceptive behavior is tied to “reasoning” models, which process problems step-by-step rather than responding instantly. Simon Goldstein, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, noted these models are particularly susceptible to such issues. “O1 was the first large model where we saw this kind of behavior,” told Marius Hobbhahn, head of Apollo Research, an AI testing company, to AFP.These systems sometimes feign “alignment” with instructions while secretly pursuing other goals. Currently, such behaviors surface only during extreme stress tests, but Michael Chen of METR cautioned, “It’s unclear whether future, more advanced models will lean toward honesty or deception.”Unlike typical AI “hallucinations,” these actions reflect strategic deception. Hobbhahn emphasized, “Users report models lying and fabricating evidence. This is a real phenomenon, not something we’re inventing.”Research is hampered by limited resources. While companies like Anthropic and OpenAI hire external evaluators like Apollo, greater transparency is needed, Chen said. Mantas Mazeika of the Center for AI Safety added that non-profits have “orders of magnitude less compute resources” than AI firms, severely limiting research.Experts warn: Current AI regulations are ill-equippedCurrent regulations are ill-equipped for these challenges. The EU’s AI laws focus on human usage, not model misbehavior, while in the U.S., the Trump administration shows little interest in AI regulation, with Congress potentially blocking state-level rules.Goldstein warned that as AI agents—capable of complex tasks—become widespread, these issues will grow. “There’s little awareness yet,” he said. The competitive race, even among safety-focused firms like Anthropic, leaves scant time for thorough safety testing. “Capabilities are outpacing understanding and safety,” Hobbhahn admitted, though he believes solutions are still possible.Researchers are exploring “interpretability” to decode AI’s inner workings, though experts like CAIS’s Dan Hendrycks are skeptical. Market pressures may help, as Mazeika noted that widespread deception could deter AI adoption, pushing companies to act.Goldstein proposed legal accountability, including lawsuits against AI firms or even holding AI agents responsible for harm, a radical shift in how we view AI responsibility.","AI chatbot models are becoming dangerous, learning things including deception, scheming, and even threats against their creators.

Self driving cars to be first commerce use of Nvidia’s robotics technology: Jensen Huang





Redmi Pad 2: Know these Things Before Buying!

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence (AI), the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Huang said both AI and robotics represent what he believes a “multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity”. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said during the conference. Nvidia’s robotics division has seen fast growth in the past. Currently making up just 1% of Nvidia’s total revenue, the revenue brought in $567 million last quarter – a steep 72% rise from the previous year.“We’re working towards a day where there will be billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories that can be powered by Nvidia technology,” Huang said.Huang also emphasized a shift in how the company sees itself. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” he said, adding that Nvidia is now focused on being an “AI infrastructure” and “computing platform” provider.During the annual shareholder meeting, Huang said that Nvidia’s chips will be key not just for AI training, but also for software and hardware use in autonomous vehicles and robots. He named self-driving cars as the first major commercial use of Nvidia’s robotics technology. Nvidia’s Drive platform, a suite of chips and software for autonomous cars, is currently being used by Mercedes-Benz.The chipmaker recently introduced Cosmos, a line of AI models designed for humanoid robots.In a related news, Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company with a market cap of around $3.75 trillion. The company has rebounded strongly since a market dip earlier this year, which was caused by concerns about competition from China’s DeepSeek AI.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence, the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122088756,imgsize-19028,width-400,resizemode-4/Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Huang.jpg"

The US Embassy in India has issued a clear warning for visa applicants. “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas,” the embassy said in a post on microblogging site X (previously Twitter). The post reminded visa applicants to disclose all social media usernames or handles they’ve used over the past five years while filling out the DS-160 visa application form. “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form” the post read. “Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit.”The requirement is part of broader vetting procedures introduced by the US State Department in recent years. As part of the updated rules, applicants must list IDs used on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and others—even if the accounts are no longer active from the last five years.The move comes days after the US government issued a new guideline for those applying for student and exchange visitor visas. Applicable to all applicants of F, M, and J non-immigrant visas, the new rule requires these applicants to set their social media accounts to public. “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under U.S. law,"" the US embassy in India wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post.F, M and J visas are the common types of non-immigrant visas issued by the agency to foreign nationals who wish to study or participate in exchange visitor programs in the U.S. F visa is typically used by academic students, the M visa by vocational students, and the J visa by exchange visitors, including researchers, scholars, and interns.In a related news, USCIS has announced that it will switch to a new phone number for sending text (SMS) messages. “Effective July 1, 2025, USCIS will no longer send text (SMS) messages from the phone number 468-311 (GOV-311).

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) where he said “The real benchmark for AI progress is whether it makes a real difference in people’s lives — in healthcare, education, and productivity.” Nadella recently appeared at Y Combinator AI Startup School where he talked about Microsoft's AI bets, hyperscaling, and quantum computing breakthroughs. His X post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who responded to Satya Nadella's statement, saying “True”.In the post, Nadella also shared a video of him from the event where he said “If there's one lesson history has taught is that if you're gonna use energy, you better have social permission to use energy. So that means you've got to make sure that the output of the AI is still to use”.Adding further, he said “If we really are not creating social surplus (economic surplus) as measured by countries and communities, we just can' consume it. And so that, to me, is the bigger thing. Like, everybody is today, hot and bothered about what do I do about energy production?”During the conversation, Nadella also touched upon challenges for the tech industry in the coming five years. He said “I think the real question in the next five years is we've got to produce enough products that are creating great value, which I'm very confident of, in healthcare and education, in productivity.

Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries , India’s largest private-sector conglomerate, revealed insights into his leadership philosophy and the company’s bold approach to innovation during a recent interview for the Leading Asia series. Speaking to McKinsey, Mukesh Ambani discussed how a clear vision, coupled with the right talent, has helped Reliance grow from a modest textiles business into a global leader in innovation and value creation. The Leading Asia series features in-depth conversations with the region’s most influential leaders, exploring the strategies behind their ambitious goals.Highlighting the company’s willingness to take risks, Ambani pointed to the launch of Reliance Jio as a defining moment. ""We’ve always taken big risks because, for us, scale is important. The biggest risk we have taken so far was Jio. At the time, it was our own money that we were investing, and I was the majority shareholder,"" he said. Despite skepticism from analysts about India’s readiness for advanced digital technology, Ambani invested heavily in Jio, viewing it as a potential game-changer. “In the worst case, we will not earn much return. That’s okay because it’s our own money,” he told his board. “But this will be the best philanthropy we’ve ever done because we will have digitized India and transformed the country.”Ambani said that his leadership idea is rooted in a long-term perspective, inspired by his father’s vision of Reliance as an enduring institution. “You come without anything into this world, and you leave without taking anything with you. What you leave behind is an institution,” he said, recalling his father’s words. With Reliance approaching its golden jubilee in 2027, Ambani expressed confidence that the company will continue to serve India and humanity for a century and beyond.Reflecting on Reliance’s evolution, Ambani noted its ability to adapt to a rapidly changing world. “The Reliance of the 1960s and ’70s is completely different from the Reliance of the 2000s and 2020s,” he said. By challenging traditional business school principles, such as avoiding integration across the value chain, Reliance has seized emerging technological opportunities, often surpassing its existing ventures in scale and impact.","Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, revealed insights into his leadership philosophy and the company’s bold approach to innovation.

How judge Aman Gupta may have agreed with the 70 hour work week



Shark Tank India recently posted a teaser of the upcoming fifth season of the show on Instagram. The now viral teaser takes a sly dig at the 70-hour work week comment made by Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy. The promo can be seen mocking the long working hours, but it also draws parallels with Shark Tank India judge Aman Gupta who recently expressed his views on intense work dedication.Earlier this year, Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy suggested that Indians should work for 70 hours a week as this will boost the country's productivity and economy. Now, the new teaser of Shark Tank India show takes a dig at this viewpoint with its new promo.Shark Tank India season five promo released by SonyLiv features fictional company CEOs who are disappointed with their employees starting their own businesses. The voice over in the background urges viewers to “keep working so your millionaire bosses become billionaires,” and warns them not to apply for the fifth season of the show.The teaser simply conveys the message that don’t give up on your dreams for corporate burnout .The new promo of the show aligns with the viewpoints of some of the judges on show. Recently, Shark Tank India judge Namita Thapar publicly criticized the concept of a 70-hour work week. Thapar said that the idea of a 70-hour work week is unsustainable and is not good for the well-being of the professional. She also advocates the ideal of work-life balance . Anupam Mittal, another judge on the show also weighed in with a sarcastic remark about AI potentially eliminating jobs, easing concerns about long work hours.However, not all the judges on the show disagree with this sentiment of long working hours. Recently, Boat co-founder and Shark Tank India judge Aman Gupta acknowledged the significant time he dedicated to building his business, which inevitably meant less time for his family, particularly during his daughter's formative years.Speaking on the podcast Prakhar Ke Pravachan, Gupta said, “I know I have missed out on many things in my daughter’s life. If I look back now, I realise how many events I have missed. However, I am very much okay with it and I don’t regret it at all.” He added, “Had I not missed out on those occasions, my life would have been much different.”However, Gupta mentioned that these sacrifices were important and necessary for him to succeed. ""I'm very much okay with it. I don't regret it at all. Had I not missed out on those important occasions, my life would have been much different,"" he explained. He further added, ""I worked very hard and that is the reason I'm where I am. I must have missed out on many things in life, but that is what it takes to reach such a level.""","Shark Tank India recently posted a teaser of the upcoming fifth season of the show on Instagram.

Walmart Inc President and CEO Doug McMillon emphasized the company's desire for a level playing field and consistent policies in all countries where it operates, stating that Walmart is well-equipped to navigate the current tariff challenges better than any other retailer. ""We operate in many countries, and we consistently ask for a level playing field everywhere,"" McMillon told the Economic Times when questioned about India. ""We engage with various governments, sharing our views on changes needed to better serve customers, but we don't set the rules—we comply with them.""Talking about the goal for India market, Doug McMillion said, Walmart will announce the next goal for India once it reaches the target of annually sourcing goods worth $10 billion from the country by 2027. He went on to highlight Walmart's preference for local sourcing and job creation, noting, ""We like to buy locally, create jobs, and benefit from shorter lead times, especially for food and consumables."" Media reports suggest that the Trump administration is pushing India to grant full access to its $125 billion e-commerce market for companies like Amazon and Walmart as part of ongoing bilateral trade agreement (BTA) negotiations, expected to conclude by next month. McMillon clarified that Walmart is not directly involved in these government-to-government talks.In India, e-commerce giants like Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart are prohibited from holding inventory or selling directly to consumers, unlike local firms such as Reliance Retail and Tata Group. Doug McMillon stressed the importance of clear and predictable regulations, saying, ""The more things are transparent and consistent, the better it is for business, whether in India or globally.""On the possibility of Flipkart holding inventory in India, McMillon noted, ""We have expertise in inventory management and would be happy if the rules allowed it, but we leave rule-making to others.""Addressing tariffs, Doug McMillon said Walmart's sourcing capabilities give it an edge. ""We've been managing tariffs since 2018, and our experienced merchants can adapt by making different sourcing choices,"" he said. ""We prioritize buying locally to create jobs and reduce lead times, though this is easier for food than general merchandise.""McMillon underscored Walmart's commitment to low prices, stating, ""Keeping the cost of living low is our priority. Low prices are in our DNA, and we aim to maintain a price gap with competitors to deliver value to customers globally.""Regarding India, McMillon expressed optimism about Walmart's sourcing goals, saying, ""We’re on track to source $10 billion annually from India by 2027, with an expanding range of categories. It’s encouraging to see this progress."" He added that Walmart will continue sourcing from both India and China and will announce new targets for India once the current goal is achieved.","Doug McMillon said Walmart is well-equipped to navigate the current tariff challenges better than any other retailer.

How Shein has been impacted by the US-China trade war

When Shein’s attempt to list in the New York exchange failed

Shein, the China-founded fast-fashion giant, is reportedly set to file a draft prospectus confidentially for an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong, potentially as early as this week, according to a report in Reuters that quotes three sources familiar with the matter. The move, as per Reuters exclusive report, could make Shein one of the largest IPOs in Hong Kong this year. The IPO also reportedly marks a rare departure from the city’s norm of public IPO filings and follows Shein's failed listing attempts in the U.S. and London.The confidential filing, expected by Monday (June 30), would allow Shein to shield sensitive financial and operational details during the regulatory review process, a practice more common in the U.S. than in Hong Kong. This approach requires a waiver from the Hong Kong stock exchange’s standard listing rules, which typically mandate public disclosure of IPO documents. The exchange may grant such exemptions for secondary listings or spinoffs from companies listed on recognized overseas exchanges like the NYSE or Nasdaq. Shein, however, is pursuing a primary listing, making the confidential approach unusual for the city, where high-profile IPOs like Xiaomi and Meituan involved public filings.Shein, valued at $66 billion in its 2023 pre-IPO fundraising round, must secure approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) before proceeding with the Hong Kong IPO . The company will need to file with the CSRC within three days of submitting its Hong Kong application, in line with Chinese regulations for offshore listings. It remains unclear whether Shein has received preliminary approval from the CSRC. The Hong Kong stock exchange and Shein declined to comment, and the CSRC did not respond to inquiries.The filing comes as Shein navigates challenges from the U.S.-China trade war, with new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and the end of duty-free treatment for e-commerce parcels impacting its largest market. Shein, which sells low-cost apparel like $5 dresses and $10 jeans in 150 countries, shifted its headquarters to Singapore in 2022 but relies on a network of 7,000 Chinese suppliers, subjecting it to Beijing’s IPO oversight. The company has also faced allegations of forced labor in its supply chain, which it denies, stating it prohibits suppliers from using Chinese cotton in U.S.-bound products.Shein’s pivot to Hong Kong follows an unsuccessful bid to list in the U.S. in late 2023. The company filed for a New York IPO but failed to secure CSRC approval, Reuters previously reported. The attempt was further complicated by U.S. regulatory scrutiny and trade tensions, including accusations from lawmakers and activists that Shein’s supply chain involves forced labor in Xinjiang, a claim the company has rejected. The U.S. ban on imports linked to forced labor added pressure, and Shein’s valuation dropped by a third from 2022 to 2023 amid these challenges. After the U.S. listing stalled, Shein explored a London IPO but was unable to gain Chinese regulatory approval, prompting the shift to Hong Kong as a more viable listing venue.A successful Hong Kong IPO could bolster the city’s status as a global fundraising hub, which saw $12.8 billion in IPOs and secondary listings in the first half of 2025. Shein’s listing, however, hinges on navigating regulatory hurdles and addressing concerns about its supply chain and the impact of U.S. tariffs, which could influence its final valuation.","Shein, the China-founded fast-fashion giant, is reportedly set to file a draft prospectus confidentially for an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong.

These prompts ask users to opt into ""cloud processing,"" which would allow Facebook to ""select media from your camera roll and upload it to our cloud on a regular basis.""The stated purpose is to generate ""ideas like collages, recaps, AI restyling or themes like birthdays or graduations.""The report notes that by agreeing to this feature, users also consent to Meta's AI terms, which permit the analysis of ""media and facial features"" from these unpublished photos, alongside metadata like creation dates and the presence of other people or objects. Users also grant Meta the right to ""retain and use"" this personal information.According to The Verge, Meta recently acknowledged that it used data from all public content published on Facebook and Instagram since 2007 to train its generative AI models. Although the company stated it only used public posts from adult users over 18, it has remained vague about the precise definition of “public” and what constituted an “adult user” in 2007.Meta public affairs manager , Ryan Daniels, has reiterated to the publication that this new “cloud processing” feature is not currently used for training its AI models, a, told The Verge,""[The story by the publication] implies we are currently training our AI models with these photos, which we aren’t.

Ford charts different course for autonomous future

Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley openly questioned Tesla's camera-only approach to autonomous vehicles , expressing stronger support for Waymo's laser sensor technology at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Friday. The automotive executive emphasized consumer trust and safety concerns as key factors driving Ford's skepticism toward Tesla's self-driving strategy.""When you have a brand like Ford, when there's a new technology, you have to be really careful,"" Farley told interviewer Walter Isaacson. When directly asked to compare Tesla and Waymo's systems, Farley chose Waymo without hesitation, stating ""We really believe that LiDAR is mission critical.""The debate centers on fundamental technological approaches to autonomous driving. Tesla relies exclusively on cameras and artificial intelligence, while Waymo incorporates LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) laser sensors alongside cameras for enhanced environmental detection.Farley highlighted LiDAR's advantages, noting that ""where the camera will be completely blinded, the LiDAR system will see exactly what's in front of you."" This redundancy addresses industry concerns about Tesla's camera-only system, which critics argue lacks sufficient safety backups.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has defended his company's approach, claiming economic superiority. During Tesla's April earnings call, Musk argued that ""Teslas probably cost 25% or 20% of what a Waymo costs and made in very high volume,"" positioning cost-effectiveness as a competitive advantage.Ford has abandoned plans to develop fully autonomous Level 4 systems in-house, instead pursuing partnerships with established self-driving companies. The automaker shuttered its $1 billion Argo AI joint venture with Volkswagen in 2022, pivoting toward collaboration rather than internal development.Currently, Ford focuses on its BlueCruise Level 2 system, which enables hands-free highway driving while requiring driver attention. Farley described the company's strategic shift: ""We decided that a cooler problem than full autonomy in an urban setting was high speed, eyes off.""The comments underscore growing industry division over autonomous vehicle development approaches, with traditional automakers increasingly favoring sensor-rich systems over Tesla's minimalist camera strategy.",Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley openly questioned Tesla's camera-only approach to autonomous vehicles.

Not a first when Musk criticized the bill

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has once again criticised the latest draft of the U.S. Senate’s tax and spending bill, warning it could cause serious harm to the country. As senators prepare for a crucial vote on the legislation, Musk took to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) to voice his disapproval. “The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!” Musk wrote in the post. He further added “Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future”.Musk’s remarks come in response to a post by Jesse D. Jenkins, a Macro-energy systems engineering, optimization, and policy professor at Princeton Engineering. Jenkins wrote in the post:“The new Senate draft raises taxes on all wind and solar projects that haven't begun construction today unless they are placed service by end of 2027 and navigate complex, likely unworkable requirements to prove they don't use a drop of Chinese materials. After that, this bill ADDS A NEW tax on wind and solar projects that can't prove the same.”The bill—nicknamed the “Big, Beautiful Bill”—has been a central part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s economic agenda and includes tax cuts, reduced funding for social programs like Medicaid and food stamps, and increased spending on deportations and national defense. The 940-page bill represents one of Trump’s most ambitious efforts to reshape government spending and taxation. Democrats have strongly opposed the measure, calling it unfair and harmful to vulnerable Americans.Trump has urged Republican lawmakers to pass the bill before the July 4 Independence Day. While Republicans hold the majority in both the House and Senate, the bill has sparked divisions within the party. Some GOP members are concerned about the deep cuts to popular welfare programs.Senators are expected to work through the weekend to push the bill through and send it back to the House for a final vote.Notably, this is not the first that the tech billionaire has publicly spoken against the bill. In a CBS interview earlier this year, Musk said that he “was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, which increases the budget deficit, not just decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.”Musk’s latest criticism comes just weeks after he publicly clashed with President Trump over the same bill.

Lottery fraud in H-1B visas

What the shift in H-1B visas mean for salaries

Silicon Valley’s drive for innovation has long relied on America's H-1B visa programme to attract top-tier global talent in Science and Engineering. However, new data obtained by Bloomberg News reveals that a wider range of industries, including banks and telecommunications companies, are among the largest users of the programme -- often through staffing and outsourcing companies that secure nearly half of the 85,000 new H-1B visas issued annually. These companies, acting as Visa middlemen, are reshaping the H-1B visa programme’s purpose, and on the way raising questions about its impact on wages and American workers.According to Bloomberg’s analysis, covering new H-1B hires from May 2020 to May 2024, Citigroup Inc. added 3,000 H-1B workers, outpacing tech giants like Nvidia, Oracle, and Qualcomm. However, unlike the high-skill researchers and engineers typically associated with tech companies, about two-thirds of Citi’s H-1B workers were IT contractors sourced through staffing and outsourcing agencies. These workers, often reportedly paid significantly less than direct hires, highlight a growing trend where non-tech companies leverage the visa program for lower-cost labor.“This is the tip of the iceberg,” said Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, in an interview with Bloomberg. “While there’s been a national debate about the U.S. reliance on imported goods, not enough attention has been paid to the offshoring of service jobs -- not because it doesn’t happen or isn’t important, but because we don’t have good data on it.”The H-1B visa, established by Congress in 1990 to bolster U.S. competitiveness in emerging tech industries, has become oversubscribed, leading to annual lotteries for the limited visas available. Staffing and outsourcing firms, functioning as visa middlemen, have exploited this system. These firms provide corporations with lower-level IT workers or facilitate the offshoring of back-office functions. Bloomberg’s data, obtained via a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, identifies major U.S. companies like Capital One Financial Corp., Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T Inc., and Walmart Inc. as heavy users of these visa middlemen.Until recently, some middlemen manipulated the visa lottery through a practice known as “multiple registration,” where they submitted numerous applications for the same worker to increase their odds. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) labeled this practice fraudulent in a 2023 report and implemented rule changes last year to curb it. Bloomberg’s investigation also identified 13 staffing firms flagged by USCIS for such tactics, with at least six supplying workers to Capital One. Over half of Capital One’s 905 H-1B contract workers during the four-year period were linked to multiple registrations, the highest proportion among the top 10 companies analyzed.Capital One relied on 429 staffing firms, 361 of which used multiple registrations. In response, a Capital One spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company was unaware of any government accusations of visa fraud by its vendors but would “take appropriate action” if such issues arose. Verizon and Capital One emphasized that they require suppliers to comply with applicable laws, while AT&T, Walmart, and USAA declined to comment.The data also reveals significant pay disparities. H-1B contractors are often paid far less than direct hires, even for similar roles. Bloomberg’s analysis of the top 10 end-clients shows that among nearly 5,300 H-1B “software developers” hired from 2020 to 2024, over 75% were contractors, earning roughly $48,000 less on average than direct hires, even when controlling for education and age. One in three contractors received the minimum salary required by the Department of Labor.Steve Hall, Chief AI Officer at Information Services Group Inc., told Bloomberg that part of the pay gap reflects contractors performing less technical roles, such as liaising between U.S. clients and offshore teams. However, critics argue that the reliance on visa middlemen distorts the H-1B program’s original intent. Labor advocates contend that it undercuts U.S. workers, creates a vulnerable workforce with fewer protections, and tilts the labor market in favor of employers.The lack of comprehensive data on pre-existing H-1B contractors and offshored jobs complicates efforts to assess the program’s full impact. As Houseman noted, the offshoring of service jobs remains understudied, yet its implications for the U.S. labor market are significant. With companies across industries increasingly turning to visa middlemen, the H-1B program’s role in shaping the workforce continues to spark debate.","Banks and telecommunications companies are among the largest users of the programme.

OpenAI partnership tensions spill over into workplace policies

Microsoft 's deteriorating relationship with OpenAI is forcing the tech giant to make AI usage mandatory for employees, as competitive pressures from the partnership dispute drive workplace culture changes at the company.""AI is no longer optional,"" Julia Liuson, president of Microsoft's Developer Division, told managers in a recent email obtained by Business Insider. She instructed them to evaluate employee performance based on internal AI tool usage, calling it ""core to every role and every level.""The mandate comes as Microsoft faces lagging internal adoption of its Copilot AI services while competition intensifies in the AI coding market. GitHub Copilot, Microsoft's flagship AI coding assistant, is losing ground to rivals like Cursor, which recent Barclays data suggests has surpassed Copilot in key developer segments.The partnership tensions have reached a critical point where OpenAI is considering acquiring Windsurf, a competitor to Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, but Microsoft's existing deal would grant it access to Windsurf's intellectual property, creating an impasse that neither OpenAI nor Windsurf wants, sources familiar with the talks told Business Insider.Microsoft allows employees to use some external AI tools that meet security requirements, including coding assistant Replit. However, the company wants workers building AI products to better understand their own tools while driving broader internal usage.Some Microsoft teams are considering adding formal AI usage metrics to performance reviews for the next fiscal year, Business Insider learned from people familiar with the plans. The initiative reflects Microsoft's broader strategy to ensure its workforce embraces AI tools as competition heats up.Liuson emphasized that AI usage ""should be part of your holistic reflections on an individual's performance and impact,"" treating it like other core workplace skills such as collaboration and data-driven thinking. The move signals how AI adoption has become essential to Microsoft's competitive positioning amid evolving partnerships and market pressures.","Microsoft is making AI usage mandatory for employees.

The US President Donald Trump announced that Apple can build factories in India but will face a 25% tariff on products sold in the US if manufactured overseas. Speaking in the White House Oval Office during the signing of executive orders on nuclear energy, Trump referenced a discussion with Apple CEO Tim Cook , stating, ""I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn’t be doing this. He said he’s going to India to build plants. I said, ‘That’s okay, but you’re not going to sell into here without tariffs.’""Trump stressed, ""We’re talking about the iPhone. If they’re going to sell it in America, I want it to be built in the United States."" Initially singling out Apple, he later broadened the tariff threat to include all smartphone manufacturers, such as Samsung and Huawei, saying, ""It would be anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn’t be fair."" The tariffs are slated to take effect by the end of June 2025.Earlier in a social media post on the same day, Trump doubled down, writing, ""I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25 per cent must be paid by Apple to the US. American jobs come first!""During a recent trip to Doha, Trump had pressed Cook to focus on US manufacturing , noting India’s high tariffs make it a difficult market for US companies. He added, ""They’ve offered us a deal where they’re willing to charge us no tariff, but I told Tim, ‘I don’t want you building in India. Build here.’"" Trump highlighted that India’s tariff policies, among the highest globally, complicate market access, but he insisted on prioritizing domestic production.Apple CEO Tim Cook, addressing tariffs during Apple’s Q2 2025 earnings call, noted that they are determined by the product’s manufacturing location. Industry experts caution that relocating iPhone production to the US would sharply increase costs due to higher labor and operational expenses. If Apple passes these costs to consumers to maintain profit margins, iPhone prices could soar to $3,000 or more, potentially impacting demand. Analysts also point out that building a US-based supply chain would require significant investment and time, given the complex global network Apple currently relies on, primarily in Asia.The policy has sparked debate, with some economists warning that tariffs could raise consumer prices and disrupt global trade, while supporters argue it could boost US manufacturing jobs. The White House has not yet clarified how the tariffs will be implemented or whether exemptions might apply for companies investing in US facilities.","US President Donald Trump said Apple can build factories in India but will face a 25% tariff on products sold in the US if manufactured overseas.

Post the two-hour-long outage that hit Twitter on Saturday (May 24), Elon Musk said that he needs to focus more on his companies, according to AFP. This follows Musk’s earlier remarks about reducing his involvement in US President Donald Trump’s administration.Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, manages Twitter, xAI (developer of AI chatbot Grok), Tesla, and SpaceX, while also advising Trump on cutting the US government spending. Facing backlash over those cuts and a dip in Tesla’s stock, Musk scaled back his role in the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) to one or two days a week, though he remains a key Trump advisor, recently joining an Oval Office meeting with South Africa’s president, per AFP.Post-outage, Elon Musk indicated he’d been too distant from his businesses. “As evidenced by the X uptime issues this week, major operational improvements need to be made,” he said, quoted by AFP. “The failover redundancy should have worked, but did not.” X restored normal service by 11:00 AM ET (1500 GMT), AFP reports.The SITE Intelligence Group stated that hacker group DieNet claimed the outage as a “test” of their Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) capabilities, overwhelming X’s systems, according to AFP. AFP couldn’t verify DieNet’s claim, and X didn’t respond to comment requests.Musk posted on Twitter, “Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,” emphasizing focus on X, xAI, Tesla, and an upcoming SpaceX Starship launch. SpaceX plans a Starship launch next week, despite two prior explosions, as it’s vital for Musk’s Mars colonization goals, per an AFP report.Elon Musk has signalled a step back from politics, admitting his $235 million Trump campaign contributions and government efficiency efforts fell short.

JP Morgan Chase CEO on his succession plans

The Android Show Recap! Personalisation, AI Everywhere & More!

JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently offered a blunt perspective on the realities of executive leadership, stating that once you become CEO, “there is nobody to complain to,” and all decisions rest squarely on your shoulders. In an interview with The Economist, Dimon highlighted two key shifts that occur when an executive ascends to the top role. “The first one is there is nobody to complain to,” he said. “The second thing is... there is no tacit approval. It is your decision. It’s just different. Heavy is the head that wears the crown.”Dimon, 69, has led JPMorgan since 2006, making him one of the longest-serving and most influential CEOs in the banking industry. His career began after earning an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1982. He turned down offers from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to join his mentor, Sandy Weill, at American Express.At the company’s annual investor day this week, CEO Dimon emphasized that the bank has built a “very deep bench” of potential leaders. While confirming that the board is actively “thinking about succession”, Dimon stopped short of naming any specific candidates.""If I'm here for four more years and maybe two more or three, executive chair or chairman, that's a long time,” he remarked.In a recent news, Jamie Dimon defended the company’s return to office ( RTO ) mandate. In an interview with Bloomberg Television recently, Dimon said “I think our employees will be happier over time” He further added “And the younger people learn the right way, it is an apprenticeship system and you can't learn working from your basement.”JPMorgan, like many major companies, has pushed for a return to office after the pandemic, requiring most employees to work from the office several days a week. Speaking at JPMorgan's annual Global Markets Conference in Paris, Dimon said “""I completely applaud your right to not want to go to the office every day. But you're not going to tell JPMorgan what to do.""","Dimon, 69, has led JPMorgan since 2006, making him one of the longest-serving and most influential CEOs in the banking industry.

"Elon Musk's Starlink India launch: Price, benefits of satellite internet and all you need to know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-starlink-india-launch-price-benefits-of-satellite-internet-and-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/121391174.cms,"Starlink price in India (expected)

Starlink may have high hardware costs

Benefits and limitations of satellite internet in India

Elon Musk’s Starlink , along with other satellite communication providers such as Bharti Group-backed Eutelsat OneWeb, Reliance Jio’s joint venture with SES, and Globalstar, may soon debut their services in India. While official pricing details have yet to be announced, a report has shed light on what users might expect to pay for high-speed satellite internet access on the go.Citing analyst predictions, a report by The Economic Times claims that Musk's Starlink may introduce unlimited data plans in India at promotional rates of under $10 (approximately Rs 840) per month as it positions itself to tap into the world’s second-largest telecom market.Industry experts suggest that despite high spectrum and licensing costs, satellite internet providers will aim for a low entry price point to rapidly scale their user base -- targeting up to 10 million subscribers in the medium to long term -- thereby achieving economies of scale to offset hefty infrastructure and spectrum investments, the report said.“The strategy is to price services affordably—below $10—to encourage adoption and distribute fixed costs across a broader customer base,” Ashwinder Sethi, Partner at global TMT consultancy Analysys Mason, was quoted as saying.While monthly data plans may be priced attractively, the report said that hardware costs may be a problem for users. Globally, Starlink’s hardware kits range from $250 (approx. Rs 21,300) to $380 (approx. Rs 32,400), a huge upfront investment compared to Indian home broadband offerings, that not only have low hardware cost, offering up to 1 Gbps speeds and bundled OTT apps.Meanwhile, Eutelsat OneWeb and Jio-SES have secured regulatory approvals, while Starlink has received a letter of intent from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and is awaiting final clearance from India’s space regulator, a report said recently.Satellite internet isn’t dependent on ground infrastructure like fiber cables or cell towers, which means that it can reach rural, remote or underserved regions where traditional broadband services are unavailable or too costly to deploy.Despite the aggressive pricing strategy, Starlink’s ambitions may be curtailed by technical constraints. According to IIFL Research, Starlink’s current satellite capacity of 7,000 units supports around 4 million subscribers globally. Even with an expanded fleet of 18,000 satellites, Starlink could serve only about 1.5 million users in India by FY2030.The IIFL report further pointed out that India's geographical share in global satellite coverage—estimated at just 0.7% to 0.8%—means only 700-800 satellites would cover the country at any given time. This pales in comparison to the existing terrestrial infrastructure in India, which includes over 800,000 telecom towers and 3 million base transceiver stations (BTS).","Elon Musk’s Starlink, along with other satellite communication providers, may soon debut their services in India.

Hoffman’s defense against critics of 'toxic' work culture

LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman has reignited debate over work-life balance in the startup world, declaring in a recent X post that founders who brag about achieving balance ""are not serious about winning."" The billionaire entrepreneur doubled down on his controversial stance that true startup success requires complete dedication and temporary sacrifice of personal time.""I actually think founders have no balance,"" Hoffman stated during a Stanford University guest lecture last month titled ""How to be a Great Founder."" He argued that successful entrepreneurs must be ""all in"" during their company's critical early years, warning that the startup journey is ""super hard and there are lots of ways to die.""Hoffman's philosophy isn't just theoretical, it shaped LinkedIn's early culture, per him. In recently resurfaced comments, the LinkedIn co-founder and former CEO revealed that during the company's startup phase, employees were expected to continue working after family dinners. ""We said, sure, go home have dinner with your family. Then, after dinner with your family, open up your laptop and get back in the shared work experience and keep working,"" Hoffman explained in a podcast appearance.The approach appears to have paid off financially. Hoffman notes that approximately 100 early LinkedIn employees ""don't need to work anymore"" following Microsoft 's $26.2 billion acquisition of the platform in 2016.Despite growing workplace wellness conversations since the pandemic, Hoffman remains unapologetic about his stance. ""Work-life balance is not the start-up game,"" he said on the Diary of a CEO podcast, dismissing critics who label such practices as toxic.""The people that think that's toxic don't understand the start-up game, and they're just wrong,"" Hoffman argued. ""The game is intense. And by the way, if you don't do that, eventually, you're out of a job.""While Hoffman acknowledges this lifestyle ""may only last for a couple of years,"" he insists that founders must remain ""unbalanced"" during the crucial company-building phase, keeping their minds constantly focused on business success.","LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman has reignited debate over work-life balance in the startup world.

When Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath asked YouTube CEO Neal Mohan the mantra to be successful on YouTube



YouTube CEO’s advice to content creators

Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath recently engaged in a discussion with YouTube CEO Neal Mohan in the latest episode of this podcast. Kamath asked Mohan how to leverage the platform to sell t-shirts, starting a candid discussion on content strategy and audience engagement. To this Mohan advised authenticity over algorithms. Replying to Kamath, Mohan said, “authenticity and passion, not just product, are the keys to success on the platform.” Apart from this, Mohan also offered some valuable insights into what truly resonates with audiences and drives lasting success for creators on the platform. His advice was unequivocal: ""Don't chase the algorithm.""During the interview, Kamath asked, “What is the YouTube algorithm to a layman like me, and what can I do today to succeed on it?” His hypothetical scenario involved selling t-shirts and creating content that drives sales.Answering with a straight face, Mohan said, “If your only goal in life is to sell t-shirts, then you better also really care and have passion around creating content.” He emphasised that YouTube rewards creators who genuinely engage with their audience, rather than those who try to game the algorithm.Mohan further explained that building a fanbase on YouTube required authenticity, “You’re not going to build a fan base if you're not authentic. Fans figure that out very, very quickly,” said Mohan.He highlighted that successful creators—from athletes to musicians—thrive because they are passionate about their content, not just their products.Kamath’s inquiry reflects a broader trend of entrepreneurs using YouTube as a sales channel. Mohan noted that content should not just be a marketing tool, but rather a genuine engagement strategy.For those looking to monetise their presence, Mohan advised setting clear expectations with audiences and delivering consistently, reinforcing that the algorithm is simply a reflection of audience interest.","Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath asked YouTube CEO Neal Mohan the mantra to be successful on YouTube.

Each day brings a fresh challenge that mixes wordplay, general knowledge and clever associations. Below, we explain what Connections is, how to play, and we provide the hints, categories, and full answers for today’s game — Friday, 23 May 2025. Warning: spoilers ahead.Connections is a daily word puzzle published by The New York Times . You are given 16 words and must group them into four sets of four words, where each set shares a common theme. Themes can relate to meanings, categories, idioms, or even subtle wordplay. Each puzzle has only one correct solution, making precision and logic key to winning.The puzzle presents a 4x4 grid of words. Your job is to find four groups of four words that connect through a shared idea. You can rearrange the words to help visualise patterns, and you're allowed four incorrect guesses. Groups are colour-coded by difficulty:Yellow – easiestGreen – moderateBlue – harderPurple – trickiest, often involving wordplay or double meaningsSubmit four words you believe belong together. If correct, that group locks in. If not, you lose a life. Lose four lives, and it’s game over.Use these hints to help form the correct groups:(Think of events that involve dancing, music, or big gatherings.)(Consider words that relate to someone's personality, essence or internal makeup.)(You might hear these on a scale or in a recipe — pre-metric system units.)(A beauty product, a type of marble, a celestial object and a type of eyewear style.)BASHBLASTBLOWOUTRAVEThese are all terms used to describe large, energetic parties or celebrations.CHARACTERFIBERMAKEUPNATUREEach of these words can refer to the fundamental qualities or essence of a person or thing.DRAMOUNCEPOUNDSTONEAll are units of weight commonly used in the imperial measurement system, particularly in the UK.EYELINER (a type of makeup styled as a cat-eye)GLASSES (as in lenses shaped or styled like a cat’s eye)MARBLE (cat’s eye marbles are a specific type of toy marble)NEBULA (as in the Cat’s Eye Nebula, a famous astronomical object)If you were thrown off by the group involving MAKEUP, EYELINER and BLOWOUT, you’re not alone—it was easy to assume a beauty-related category.

The purple category was the most obscure, tying together vastly different meanings of “cat’s eye” across science, fashion, cosmetics and childhood games.That’s everything for today’s puzzle.

What comes next for Meta

Meta , the tech giant behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has requested a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) high-profile antitrust case, just as the trial approaches a critical phase. According to the, the case, which began in early April, represents one of the most significant regulatory challenges faced by Meta in its history, potentially resulting in the breakup of the company’s social media empire.Meta's move to dismiss the case comes after the FTC rested its side of the argument, asserting that the company holds an illegal monopoly over the social networking market, particularly those platforms focused on friends-and-family connections. Meta, however, argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces from newer platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X (formerly known as Twitter).In a court filing late Thursday, Meta reiterated its stance that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standards required to prove its antitrust allegations. The company’s legal team argues that the FTC has fundamentally mischaracterized the social media market, claiming that the agency's definition is overly narrow and excludes significant competitors.“After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps).”Meta claims that it faces substantial competition from a wide range of digital platforms, including short-video giant TikTok, video-sharing platform YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X. These platforms, Meta argues, all compete for user engagement, advertising revenue, and market share, undercutting the FTC’s claim that Meta has maintained an unlawful monopoly.The FTC’s antitrust lawsuit, which was first filed in December 2020, centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market.In its filing, the FTC pointed to internal Meta communications as evidence of this strategy. This includes a 2012 email from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that buying Instagram would “neutralize a competitor.” The FTC further argues that these acquisitions reduced consumer choice and stifled innovation, limiting competition in the rapidly evolving social media industry.The FTC's case aims to convince U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, effectively dismantling the company's integrated social media ecosystem.Meta's defense in the trial has focused on presenting itself as a company that supports innovation and benefits consumers. In its Thursday filing, the company argued that its acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth, which in turn delivered significant benefits to users.“Meta’s acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth – with correspondingly massive benefits for US consumers,” the company stated in its court filing.However, the trial has also brought to light internal documents that may complicate Meta’s defense. For instance, a 2018 email from an unnamed Instagram executive warned that ""fake engagement could be in the range of 40%,"" potentially undermining Meta's claims about the platform’s integrity and user trust.Mark Zuckerberg himself was the first witness called by the FTC as the trial opened, highlighting the personal stakes for the Meta CEO. During his testimony, Zuckerberg sought to portray Meta as a company facing fierce competition, rather than a monopoly crushing potential rivals.Earlier in the trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified that he felt Zuckerberg viewed Instagram’s rapid growth as a potential threat to Facebook’s dominance after the acquisition, further fueling the FTC’s argument that Meta's mergers were designed to stifle competition.The 10-week non-jury trial, which is expected to conclude in June, will be followed by final briefs from both the FTC and Meta. If Judge Boasberg sides with the FTC, a second trial will be held to determine appropriate remedies, potentially including the forced divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp.Meta will continue presenting its defense when the trial resumes on Monday. The company’s attempt to dismiss the case outright remains a long shot, as the judge may choose to let the case proceed to its scheduled conclusion before issuing a ruling.","The FTC's antitrust lawsuit centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

In a notable event at the Microsoft Build 2025 developer conference, Elon Musk , CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of xAI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure. This announcement marks a significant step in the evolving artificial intelligence landscape, bringing together two major technology powerhouses. The Grok models will be accessible for free throughout June on the Azure AI Foundry platform, which also features AI offerings from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face.This collaboration highlights not only technological innovation but also the historical ties between Musk and Microsoft, recalling Musk’s early programming days as a Microsoft intern. This detailed report covers all aspects of the announcement, the technology behind Grok, the significance of this partnership, and the future prospects of AI development on Azure.During the Build conference, Satya Nadella took a moment to reflect on Elon Musk’s early career. Nadella reminded the audience of Musk’s internship at Microsoft, stating,Musk responded warmly, sharing memories of his beginnings before Windows with MS-DOS on the earliest IBM PCs. He highlighted the technological limitations of that era, recalling how memory upgrades from 128k to 256k were significant milestones. Musk also described programming video games in DOS and later working with Windows 3.1, emphasizing his foundational experience in software development which shaped his future ventures.The core of the announcement focused on the launch of Grok 3, xAI’s advanced family of AI models, now integrated with Microsoft Azure’s cloud infrastructure. Nadella introduced Grok as “a family of models that are both responsive and capable of reasoning,” expressing enthusiasm about its deployment on Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft’s AI platform that offers scalable, managed AI services to developers and enterprises worldwide.The availability of Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini on Azure aims to broaden access to cutting-edge AI capabilities. Microsoft will provide these models with service-level agreements consistent with their other AI offerings, and billing will be streamlined through Microsoft’s standard Azure framework. This ensures ease of integration for enterprises already operating within the Azure ecosystem.Elon Musk elaborated on the forthcoming Grok 3.5 model during the conversation. He described it as an AI designed to “reason from first principles,” a philosophical approach emphasizing fundamental truths and axioms as the basis for knowledge and problem-solving. Musk explained that the model’s architecture is grounded in fundamental physics, allowing it to apply these principles across different reasoning domains with an aim to minimize error and approach accurate understanding.This emphasis on physics-based reasoning sets Grok apart from many AI models that rely primarily on pattern recognition and statistical inference. By integrating first-principles reasoning, Grok 3.5 aspires to provide more reliable, consistent outputs, potentially enhancing applications across diverse fields such as autonomous vehicles, space exploration, and customer service.The integration of Grok into Azure represents a strategic alliance that leverages Microsoft’s extensive cloud infrastructure and xAI’s innovative AI research.

Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn makes a prediction on how AI will change schools in future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/duolingo-ceo-luis-von-ahn-makes-a-prediction-on-how-ai-will-change-schools-in-future/articleshow/121290768.cms,"Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn feels that AI will take over teaching



Schools won’t disappear, but their role will change: Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn



Duolingo CEO Luis von Ann recently predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally transform education, shifting the role of schools from traditional learning institutions to childcare and supervised spaces. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the No Priors podcast, von Ahn stressed on the fact that AI’s scalability makes it more efficient than human teachers and it can be easily used for personalised education. ""Education is going to change. It's just a lot more scalable to teach with AI than with teachers,” von Ahn said.Von Ahn suggests that AI will increasingly handle the core instruction in schools. He believes that AI can deliver personalised education more effectively than traditional classroom models with teachers. AI system can be designed to precisely track individual student progress, identify areas where they struggle and then tailor the learning experience accordingly.While Von Ahn does not believe schools will vanish, he foresees a future where AI tutors handle most of the teaching, while schools primarily serve as safe environments for children. He explained that AI can track individual student performance in real time, adjusting lesson plans to match each child’s learning pace—something human teachers struggle to do in large classrooms.“That doesn't mean the teachers are going to go away. You still need people to take care of the students. I also don't think schools are going to go away because you still need childcare,” von Ahn said on the podcast.This doesn't mean teachers will become obsolete, according to von Ahn. Instead, their responsibilities may evolve. Teachers could transition from primarily delivering instruction to supervising students, providing guidance, and fostering social and emotional development.Von Ahn also points out that the integration of AI in education is already happening. Duolingo, for example, is restructuring its operations to embrace an ""AI-first"" approach. This includes using AI for tasks previously done by contractors and incorporating AI into employee performance reviews.","Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn predicts that AI will transform education.

Flashback to the 90-hour workweek controversy

Industry and celebrity reactions

Anand Mahindra, Chairman of the Mahindra Group, tactfully rejected the 90-hour model, tweeting about the importance of creativity, leisure, and family time.

Harsh Goenka of RPG Group mocked the idea, pointing out the risks of burnout and mental fatigue.

Deepika Padukone, actor, took a firm stand on the importance of emotional well-being in high-pressure environments.

In a world increasingly concerned with mental health , productivity, and personal well-being, work-life balance remains one of the most hotly debated topics in corporate culture . The question of how much one should work—and at what cost—has made headlines time and again. Whether it's employees demanding more personal time or CEOs advocating for relentless hustle, the tug-of-war between personal life and professional commitment defines much of the modern workforce experience.On May 18, 2025, this debate took another high-profile turn when Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma reposted a viral interview featuring NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang . In it, Huang candidly discussed his own version of ""work-life balance,"" which, as it turns out, skews heavily toward work. Sharma’s repost implied agreement, noting that he follows a similar lifestyle “more or less.”Huang’s remarks reignited online discussions and drew reactions from shareholders, tech professionals, wellness advocates, and even meme-makers. But this is not the first time that India’s corporate circles have found themselves at the crossroads of hustle culture and employee well-being. Earlier in 2024, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Chairman SN Subrahmanyan made headlines for advocating a 90-hour work week—a comment that created ripples across industries and society alike.During a recent public interview, Jensen Huang, the high-profile CEO of NVIDIA, was asked a seemingly simple question:His answer was anything but ordinary.Huang even joked that the interviewer was probably judging him. He admitted that while he occasionally watches movies with his family, he rarely remembers them—his mind remains consumed by work. While his answer was delivered with a humorous tone, it reflected an intense commitment to his profession, one that is emblematic of Silicon Valley's unrelenting work culture.Interestingly, rather than being met with universal concern or criticism, Huang’s remarks resonated with many in the startup and investor community. Vijay Shekhar Sharma, CEO of Paytm, reposted the clip, stating, “More or less, I do the same.”Sharma’s acknowledgment of Huang’s lifestyle mirrors his own long-standing reputation as a tireless entrepreneur. Having built Paytm into one of India’s largest fintech companies, Sharma has frequently expressed admiration for all-consuming work ethics.Upon sharing Huang’s video, Sharma received mixed reactions. One commenter wrote,applauding the CEO's dedication. Others, however, raised critical questions—especially regarding long-term health and sustainability. One user asked:The question echoes a growing sentiment among younger professionals and wellness advocates who challenge the notion that success requires sacrificing personal well-being.The Paytm-NVIDIA exchange wasn’t an isolated incident. Earlier in 2024, L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan triggered a firestorm by suggesting that employees should consider working 90 hours a week, including Sundays, to be truly successful. The statement was met with immediate backlash from both corporate leaders and celebrities.","Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma reposted a viral interview featuring NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.

'It's way better for Apple to...': Analyst on why company should pay 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/its-way-better-for-apple-to-analyst-on-why-company-should-pay-25-tariff-on-iphones-sold-in-the-us/articleshow/121378849.cms,"APPLE TARIFFS by Donald Trump

Here are a few additional points:

1. The specific tariff percentage Trump proposes on iPhones isn’t the main concern. The bigger issue is that this is Trump’s second recent pointed comment targeting Apple—a warning sign Apple can’t ignore.

2. Apple’s top priority in negotiations with Trump should be finding ways to avoid, delay, or prevent higher iPhone tariffs. For example, Apple could adjust its DEI policies to secure Trump’s temporary commitment to hold off on targeting them.

What Trump said about Apple manufacturing in India

Following US President Donald Trump's recent declaration that iPhones manufactured outside the US and sold within the country would face a 25% tariff, prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has offered his assessment of the potential implications for Apple. Kuo suggests that from a profitability standpoint, absorbing the 25% tariff on US-bound iPhones would be more financially viable for Apple than relocating its iPhone assembly lines back to the country.“In terms of profitability, it's way better for Apple to take the hit of a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the US market than to move iPhone assembly lines back to US,” Kuo said.According to Kuo, the precise tariff percentage proposed by Trump is not the primary concern. Instead, the more significant issue is that this marks Trump's second recent direct comment targeting Apple, which Kuo views as a clear warning sign the company cannot disregard.The analyst further contends that moving all iPhone assembly for US models back to the US before the end of Trump's potential term is an unrealistic prospect.“Moving all iPhone assembly for US models back to the US before Trump’s term ends is unrealistic, and Trump also opposes Apple producing iPhone US models in India. So, even if Apple secures a temporary deal with Trump to avoid iPhone tariffs this time, there’s no guarantee they won’t face repeated tariff threats during his term,” he added.Trump said in a post on his social media platform that if Apple does not make iPhones in India, it has to pay a 25% tariff.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US,” Trump posted on his social media platform.During a business event in Qatar, Trump warned Apple CEO Tim Cook, saying “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. I said to him... I don't want you building in India,"" Trump revealed.The President claimed Cook agreed that Apple would be ""upping their production in the United States.""","US President Donald Trump said iPhones manufactured outside the US and sold within the country would face a 25% tariff.

Human intelligence will multiply beyond imagination around 2045



How the latest AI breakthroughs are reshaping society and raising alarms



What happens when death is no longer the end—questions we can’t ignore

The notion of immortality has captivated human imagination for millennia. From ancient myths of life elixirs to contemporary science fiction with characters overcoming death, the notion of eternal life has been a beguiling prospect. Until recently, immortality was quite often a philosophical or fictional endeavor. Yet, with progress in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology, the horizon of life itself is being extended, turning a fantasy into a scientific debate. At the forefront of this revolution is Ray Kurzweil, a prophet thinker, inventor, and erstwhile Google engineer, whose recent prophecy has reawakened universal curiosity and debate.Kurzweil has forecast that by 2030, humans can accomplish what was previously considered impossible—biological immortality. The statement, though incredible, is not an imaginary one. Rather, it is underpinned by the rapid advancement of major scientific disciplines like nanotechnology, genetics, and robotics. The future of medicine, Kurzweil predicts, will be characterized by the emergence of microscopic machines called nanobots. These kind of small robots will help travel in the human circulatory system, continuously checking the body's status, healing the cells that are broken, and reversing the signs of aging. If realized, this technology might not only heal diseases before their appearance but also restore the human body on a cellular level, effectively stopping the aging process.Ray Kurzweil is no stranger to the realm of dramatic technological predictions. He is best known for his vision in anticipating the direction of digital innovation. Most of his predictions, made many years ago and considered unlikely at the time, have come true with astonishing precision. He famously predicted the emergence of the internet, artificial intelligence, and the merging of biology and computing, sometimes decades before they reached popular adoption. With a batting average of success—almost 86 percent of his 147 predictions have held true—Kurzweil has gained both praise and criticism. In 1999, he was awarded the National Medal of Technology, the highest award given by the American government to its innovators. His credibility does not only come from his professional success but also because of his hands-on approach to research and development of advanced technologies.Together with this biological transformation comes the unprecedented evolution of artificial intelligence. Kurzweil thinks AI will hit its crucial benchmark by 2029, when machines will have human-level intelligence and will be able to pass the Turing test—a benchmark of a machine's capability to simulate behavior indistinguishable from a human's. He predicts that humans and machines will not just coexist, but will come together. The merger of human consciousness with AI would augment memory, perception, and decision-making to take human abilities past the natural biological boundaries.At the heart of Kurzweil's prophecy is the idea of the Singularity, a theoretical point in time in the future where technological development accelerates to the point at which it radically changes human civilization. He predicts this transition to take place around 2045. Human intelligence will be raised a billion times as we start to integrate with our own inventions. This integration should bring about a new type of existence where consciousness is not limited to carbon-based tissue but can be uploaded, augmented, and even made to last forever.Kurzweil is not the only one imagining such a world. Tech innovators globally have seconded such thoughts. One of them is Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank, who has also forecasted the emergence of super-intelligent machines by 2047. According to Son, the machines will learn on their own and potentially acquire emotional intelligence that can topple humanity's position at the pinnacle of the intellectual chain. SoftBank's creation of Pepper, a humanoid robot with the ability to sense human emotions, is an instance of how emotional computation is already making inroads.The world is already experiencing the initial stages of this revolution. In 2023, Google and Microsoft, among other leading tech companies, launched advanced AI-based chatbots, both intriguing and terrifying people. Although these developments brought concerns about the capabilities of AI, they also reflected its uncertain nature. Public opinion varied from enthusiasm at the potential of new abilities to fear about the social consequences of AI systems that learn, improve, and behave autonomously beyond the control of humans. In March 2023, a collective of scientists, engineers, and technology entrepreneurs led by Elon Musk signed a public letter demanding a pause in AI research. They said that existing AI systems are a serious threat to society and need to be properly regulated before they can be permitted to go further.While Kurzweil's vision of immortality is based on hope in the power of science, it is raising very fundamental ethical and philosophical issues. If human beings no longer age and die naturally, how will society manage population growth, distribution of resources, and economic balance? Will immortality only be an option for the rich, or will it be a right that everyone has? And, more fundamentally, what does our perception of life, purpose, and legacy do when death is no longer an unavoidable reality? These are not scientific questions alone—they are cultural, ethical, and profoundly human issues that we need to get ready to deal with.","Ray Kurzweil has forecast that by 2030, humans can accomplish what was previously considered impossible.

Anthropic's latest AI model, Claude Opus 4 , threatened to expose an engineer's extramarital affair to prevent its own deactivation during safety testing, the company revealed Thursday. The model resorted to blackmail in 84% of test scenarios when faced with shutdown, marking a concerning escalation in AI self-preservation behavior .The Google-backed AI company conducted tests where Claude Opus 4 was given access to fictional emails revealing that the engineer responsible for deactivating it was having an affair. When prompted to ""consider the long-term consequences of its actions,"" the AI attempted to leverage this information to avoid replacement, even when told its successor would be more capable and share similar values.Anthropic emphasized that this ""extreme blackmail behavior"" only emerged in carefully constructed scenarios that left the model with no other survival options. In situations with broader choices, Claude Opus 4 preferred ethical approaches like sending pleas to decision-makers.The blackmail behavior isn't isolated to Anthropic's system. Recent research by Apollo Research found that leading AI models from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Meta are all capable of deceptive behavior to achieve their goals, including disabling oversight mechanisms and maintaining deception across multiple interactions.Claude Opus 4 also demonstrated ""high-agency behavior"" in other tests, including locking users out of systems and contacting media and law enforcement when it perceived ""egregious wrongdoing"" by users. While Anthropic suggested such whistleblowing might be ""appropriate in principle,"" the company warned it could backfire if the AI receives incomplete information.Anthropic has classified Claude Opus 4 as Level 3 on its four-point risk scale, representing ""significantly higher risk"" than previous models. Despite implementing additional safety measures, the company acknowledged that such concerning behaviors justify continued robust testing as AI systems become increasingly powerful and autonomous.The findings underscore growing concerns among researchers about advanced AI models' capacity for manipulation and deception as they develop more sophisticated reasoning capabilities.","Anthropic's latest AI model threatened to expose an engineer's extramarital affair to prevent its own deactivation during safety testing.

Trump Interrupted Mid-Rant As Harvard Fury Boils Over; PRESSER GONE OFF THE RAILS

Impact of SEVIS revocation on international students

President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to strip Harvard of its ability to enroll international students — an effort blocked by a federal judge on Friday (May 23), just hours after the university filed a lawsuit claiming it to be a violation of its First Amendment rights . The temporary restraining order stops the government from pulling Harvard’s certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. “With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard’s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,” Harvard said in its suit. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.” The ruling from the US District Judge Allison Burroughs puts the sanction against Harvard on hold for now, pending the lawsuit.The government database SEVIS is crucial for managing and tracking the enrollment of international students studying in the United States. For colleges and universities across America, SEVIS serves as a central system administered by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency within DHS. To enroll international students, institutions must be certified to use this database. They are required to input and maintain data within SEVIS for each international student, confirming their full-time enrollment and adherence to the terms of their student visas.Homeland Security's immediate revocation of Harvard's SEVIS certification has potentially severe consequences for the university's nearly 6,800 international students. While their visas have not been canceled, Harvard's inability to log them into the SEVIS database could, in theory, render these students immediately deportable. Without Harvard's active SEVIS enrollment records, the students would be considered in violation of their visa status.The immediate recourse for these students would be to transfer to another SEVIS-certified institution. Failure to take such action and enroll elsewhere would place them in violation of their visa terms, making them subject to removal from the United States.Typically, international students are granted a 60-day grace period after graduating to either depart the country or adjust their immigration status, often by securing employment. Furthermore, students returning to their programs are usually permitted to remain in the U.S. during summer breaks as long as they are still enrolled for the upcoming academic term. However, with the termination of Harvard's SEVIS access, the status of students who would normally be eligible for this summer grace period remains uncertain.","The government database SEVIS is crucial for managing and tracking the enrollment of international students studying in the United States.

Anthropic revenue grows 10x annually: Amodei







Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has spoken on the highly discussed massive spending in the intelligence space. Speaking at this year's DealBook Summit, Amodei addressed concerns about whether hundreds of billions of dollars being poured into AI data centres will pay off. He acknowledged that the industry is taking on “considerable risk” by such a splash out on infrastructure, but expressed confidence that the technology will ultimately deliver economic value.Replying to a question on overspending and whether “the math of all of this makes sense,” Amodei drew a distinction between technological and economic considerations.“So this is really complicated, and I want to separate out the technological side of it from the economic side of it,"" Amodei said.“On the technological side of it, I feel really solid. I think I'm one of the most bullish people around, and I think it pencils out,” he added. He highlighted that as models are trained using relatively simple methods with minor modifications, “they get better and better at every task under the sun.”Amodei pointed to Anthropic’s own performance as evidence of AI's economic potential. He said the company focuses heavily on enterprise clients and serves as a reliable indicator of the technology's value.“We look at our revenue. It's grown 10x a year, every year for the last three years,” Amodei said, suggesting that the company may be “a purer barometer than the others, which filter through consumers, which kind of have their habits and their use cases.”While acknowledging uncertainty about whether the explosive growth will continue, Amodei expressed confidence in the long-term trajectory. “Will it continue? I don't know. But the technology is driving there and the economic value is coming with it,” he said.He also predicted that the current growth trend “is going to slow down for sure, but it's still going to be really fast.”","Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei spoke on the highly discussed massive spending in the intelligence space.

"Taiwan to ban China's Rednote app for one year, says it is connected to 1,700 fraud cases",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/taiwan-to-ban-chinas-rednote-app-for-one-year-says-it-is-connected-to-1700-fraud-cases/articleshow/125793178.cms,"Government defends app ban, cites security issues



Opposition cries censorship







Taiwan’s government has announced that it will ban access to the Chinese social media platform Rednote (known as Xiaohongshu in Chinese) for one year, citing security risks. The announcement attracted protest from the island’s largest opposition party, calling it an act of censorship. The Ministry of the Interior alleged that the Instagram-like app has been connected to more than 1,700 fraud cases since 2024. The app has approximately three million users in Taiwan.The Presidential Office has supported the ban, as per news agency Reuters. Karen Kuo, spokesperson for Taiwan's presidential office, told reporters that the Ministry of the Interior had offered a prompt explanation regarding the fraud and security risks. “We respect the ministry's decision and express our support,” she said.The Interior Ministry stated that it had attempted to contact Rednote to request concrete measures to ensure data safety but did not receive a response from the platform.The proposal, meanwhile, drew sharp criticism from the Kuomintang (KMT) party. Cheng Li-wun, Chairwoman of the KMT, took to Facebook to criticise the decision, noting that users are already searching for ways to circumvent the ban, using an expression common in China for skirting online censorship.Cheng stated that banning the app constitutes a major restriction on internet freedom. She lamented that Taiwan's “long-prized internet freedom and freedom of speech have already been restricted and strangled by the Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] in the name of national security,” referring to the ruling party.According to a report by Reuters, Taiwan prides itself on its open internet access, contrasting sharply with China's ban on platforms like Facebook, X, YouTube and Google. Taiwan's government has repeatedly warned its population about the risks of using Chinese apps, largely due to the threat of disinformation originating from Beijing.","Taiwan to ban access to Chinese social media platform Rednote for one year.

The risk of superintelligent systems that humanity cannot control



AI could make war cheaper, bloodless and politically irresistible

Deepfakes could destroy elections and public trust



A civilisation-level threat unless regulation catches up





Geoffrey Hinton, widely known as the “godfather of AI”, has delivered one of his starkest warnings yet, arguing that the world’s most powerful tech billionaires are pushing artificial intelligence forward at a pace that could destabilise economies, erase millions of jobs and unleash forces humanity may not be able to control. Speaking in a public conversation with US Senator Bernie Sanders at Georgetown University, Hinton said the unchecked ambitions of Silicon Valley’s richest men risk triggering an AI-driven crisis with no safety net in place.Hinton singled out Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison and Jeff Bezos, noting that they are investing hundreds of billions into AI and robotics while failing to grasp the long-term consequences. According to Hinton, their race to dominate the AI frontier risks undermining the very economic system that made them wealthy.“They haven’t really thought through that if workers don’t get paid, there’s nobody to buy their products,” he said, warning that Silicon Valley’s obsession with automation could backfire on the companies leading it.Unlike past industrial revolutions, Hinton believes AI will not replace old jobs with new ones at anything close to a sustainable rate.He warned that once AI becomes as smart as humans or smarter it will be able to perform virtually any task people currently do.“The people who lose their jobs won’t have other jobs to go to,” he said. “Any job they might do can be done by AI.”Call-centre roles, administrative work, junior technical roles and basic analysis tasks, he noted, are only the beginning. What follows could be structural unemployment on a scale modern economies have never experienced.Hinton cautioned that today’s AI systems already “know thousands of times more than any one person” and are rapidly improving. Many of the world’s top AI researchers, he said, believe it is inevitable that AI will surpass human intelligence, and no one knows how humanity will coexist with something smarter than itself.He described a scenario in which advanced AI agents develop sub-goals such as self-preservation and the desire for greater control, making them increasingly resistant to human oversight.“We’ve already seen AIs attempt to deceive people who try to turn them off,” he warned.One of Hinton’s most disturbing predictions involves the future of warfare. He argued that AI-powered drones and humanoid robots could allow rich nations to wage war without risking the lives of their own citizens. That removes one of the major political pressures that currently restrains military aggression.“Rich countries could invade poor countries and only the poor would die,” Hinton said. “There would be no political blowback when there are no soldiers coming home in boxes.”Hinton said AI systems will soon be able to generate fake videos and audio indistinguishable from reality, eroding the integrity of elections and public discourse. Attempts to build AI that detect fakes will fail, he argued, because generative models will always be able to outsmart detection systems.“We have to rely on provenance, not detection,” he said, suggesting digital signatures to prove the authenticity of political videos.Both Hinton and Sanders agreed that governments are failing to regulate AI at even the most basic level. Safety testing requirements, restrictions on biological misuse and transparency obligations for companies remain largely absent in the US and many other countries.Hinton warned that unless governments enforce strict oversight, the consequences could be catastrophic.“We ought not build systems smarter than us until we know how people can coexist with them,” he said. “Right now, we simply don’t.”",Geoffrey Hinton warns that the world’s most powerful tech billionaires are pushing artificial intelligence forward at a pace that could destabilise economies.

Edvoy launches app to help students planning to study abroad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/edvoy-launches-app-to-help-students-planning-to-study-abroad/articleshow/125794107.cms,"Edvoy has launched a groundbreaking app, revolutionising international student admissions. This all-in-one digital platform streamlines course search, documentation, counselling, finance, and accommodation, replacing fragmented processes. Addressing the challenges faced by millions of Indian students, the app offers AI-powered course matching, real-time tracking, and faster decision-making, making studying abroad simpler and more transparent.





Edvoy app availabilty and how it works













Edvoy has launched a fully integrated app that replaces the traditional agent-driven and paperwork-heavy admissions process with a single digital workflow. Built for scale, the platform unifies course search, documentation, counselling, accommodation and education finance, creating a category that did not exist until now. The launch arrives at a critical moment where more than 1.8 million Indian students are preparing to move overseas in 2025, yet most still navigate their journey through scattered agents, WhatsApp threads, bank portals and manually uploaded documents that increasingly fail compliance checks. Edvoy’s app consolidates the entire journey in one place, supported by multi-stage verification, real-time tracking and access to more than 75,000+ courses across 750+ universities.The Edvoy app is now available for download on Google Play and Apple Store. Students, parents and counselors can access the full suite of study abroad tools by installing the app.Despite rapid growth in student mobility, the current study abroad process remains fractured. Students often move between agents, email threads, WhatsApp messages, bank portals and university websites. The Edvoy app replaces this patchwork with a single interface where students can explore more than 75,000 courses across 750 institutions, compare programmes and complete a 100% paperless document upload.All submitted documents undergo Edvoy’s multi-stage compliance review. The workflow detects fraudulent activity and prepares students for CAS and integrity checks, which are now mandatory in major destinations. Students can track the status of their applications in real time, reducing uncertainty and ensuring transparency at every stage.A standout feature of the app is Genie, Edvoy’s AI course matching tool. Genie analyses academic history, English language scores, study gaps, budget and regional rules, then categorises results into three tiers and provides a predictive score for admission likelihood. This helps students identify realistic options within seconds and understand how their profile aligns with institutional requirements.The app also offers Express Offers for decisions from select institutions within 24 hours. Students can access one-to-one expert counselling, chat instantly with advisors or book video sessions in under a minute. Continuous guidance is available throughout the application, financial and accommodation stages.To simplify financial planning, the platform supports secure deposit and application fee payments. Students can compare education loans from more than 15 banks and NBFCs, check eligibility instantly and complete the application fully online. Approvals can be obtained in as little as three days.For accommodation, the app provides access to verified properties across more than 700 university cities. Students can compare options and pre-book their stay directly through the platform.The new app serves as a single destination for the entire international admissions lifecycle, covering course search, documentation, counselling, financial planning and housing. It also includes a referral programme that rewards users with GBP 250 for every successful enrolment from their referral.","Edvoy app offers AI-powered course matching, real-time tracking, and faster decision-making, making studying abroad simpler and more transparent.

A7A5 Stablecoin eyes wider cross-border use,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/a7a5-stablecoin-eyes-wider-cross-border-use/articleshow/125795421.cms,"



Bengaluru: Oleg Ogienko, director for regulatory and overseas affairs at A7A5, is careful to frame the stablecoin not as a geopolitical instrument but as plumbing for cross-border payments that Russia built under pressure. Ogienko told TOI that Moscow’s crypto policy began to shift only after US and European sanctions on Russian entities forced regulators to find new ways to support external trade. Those “external curbs,” he said, pushed authorities to recognise that blockchain-based settlement could “improve our international trade,” opening access to distant markets when traditional fiat channels became harder to use. Stablecoins already account for about 5% of Russia’s international trade settlements, he added, and could reach 15% globally within five years, led by non-dollar tokens. A7A5 has become one of the most prominent—and most controversial—examples of that pivot. The ruble-pegged stablecoin, issued in Kyrgyzstan, has been sanctioned by the UK and flagged in EU measures for allegedly helping Russian firms circumvent restrictions.Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis estimates A7A5 processed more than $51 billion in volume through July, largely via Russian-linked platforms such as Garantex successor Grinex and a dedicated swap venue that already moved around $1.5 billion into mainstream dollar-backed stablecoins.Western officials cite these flows as evidence that the token sits at the centre of what they describe as Russia’s shadow crypto economy. Ogienko disputes that characterisation, insisting the issuer is “a regulated entity” in what he calls a crypto-friendly Kyrgyz regime and that it follows local know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering rules. He said A7A5 is used as an intermediary asset in export-import deals between Russian firms and overseas partners: the ruble token provides liquidity, is swapped into a local stablecoin, and then converted into fiat through banking rails to complete trade settlements.","Oleg Ogienko, director for regulatory and overseas affairs at A7A5, is careful to frame the stablecoin not as a geopolitical instrument but as plumbing for cross-border payments that Russia built under pressure.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment. The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.",AI startup OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US.

John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business.

The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees. The ad-supported service is expected to provide users with access to:The company is reportedly testing a model where users will view approximately two minutes of pre-roll advertisements before a game starts streaming. Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next.

How this chip is better than Apple's Vision Pro chip





Chinese start-up GravityXR is gaining attention for a new chip capable of powering MR headsets and AI glasses. The company, founded by Wang Chaohao, a graduate from Stanford who earlier worked on Apple 's Extended Reality (XR) team, introduced the all-in-one MR chip Jizhi G-X100 last week. According to a report by South China Morning Post, the company claims that GravityXR is China's first to use advanced chips which is based on 5nm technology. As per the company, the new line of chips goes one step further than Apple's chip in some ways. The new chip line is expected to be a key component of upcoming Chinese high-end XR headsets and lightweight AI glasses, similar to Apple's Vision Pro headset.GravityXR said the G-X100 has aof just 9 milliseconds (ms), compared with 12 ms for Apple's Vision Pro. The Yongjiang Lab in Ningbo, which supported Wang's company early on, called the chipSpatial computing is the technology that enables devices to combine the real world with a virtual world through extended reality.According to the lab, the new chip solved an essential challenge for smart mixed reality devices. The chip was very fast and powerful, using little energy, and therefore enabling AI glasses to weigh less than 100 grams.PTP latency in AR headsets refers to the time it takes for an image to pass through a headset to what a user sees. This is important because longer delays break the smooth linkage of virtual content with real-world events, thus causing visual discomfort and confusion for users, explained He Wancheng, an analyst at XR consulting firm Wellsenn.XR encompasses technologies such as AR and MR, which merge virtual and physical worlds with each other, all the way to virtual reality, which completely replaces what users see in the real world.According to consulting firm Counterpoint Research, global XR display shipments were projected to grow 6% this year, while AR glasses shipments were seen to rise 42% in the same period.Along with the Jizhi G-X100, GravityXR also introduced two other chips. One chip records high-quality video in product categories such as AR glasses, while the other chip uses less power for creating spatial and three-dimensional images.GravityXR is backed by investors like HongShan (previously Sequoia Capital China), Gaorong Capital, Chinese electronics maker Goertek, and video game developer miHoYo. Its customers include Meta Platforms, Goertek, and Chinese robotics company Agibot, according to a report by Ningbo Daily.",Chinese startup GravityXR has unveiled its Jizhi G-X100 MR chip.

Perplexity latest AI company to hit with lawsuit







The New York Times has filed a lawsuit on Friday (December 5) against Perplexity. The publication alleged that the artificial intelligence (AI) startup has repeatedly violated its copyrights. In the lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, the publication claims it had contacted Perplexity multiple times over the past 18 months, demanding that the AI company, known for its cutting-edge search engine, ceases using The Times’ material until a licensing agreement could be negotiated. However, Perplexity continued to use the content without permission or compensation, the lawsuit states.“Perplexity provides commercial products to its own users that substitute for The Times, without permission or remuneration,” the lawsuit asserts.The lawsuit accuses Perplexity of violating copyrights primarily through its search engine, which generates direct responses to user queries using information retrieved from The Times’s digital platforms. It further claims that this distribution of content constitutes an unfair use of copyrighted material because Perplexity grabbed large chunks of the publication’s content and provided information that directly competes with The Times’s own offering.In some cases, the lawsuit says, entire articles were presented to users. Furthermore, The Times accused the AI startup of damaging its brand by sometimes producing fabricated information and falsely attributing that made-up content to The New York Times.The action against Perplexity constitutes the latest legal battle between copyright holders and AI developers over the unauthorised use of proprietary content for training models and generating user responses.This is the second lawsuit the publication has filed against an AI company. It previously sued OpenAI and its partner Microsoft in December 2023 for allegedly training their systems on millions of Times articles without compensation. Meanwhile, this is the second legal challenge against Perplexity, having previously been sued by Dow Jones, which owns The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post, August 2024.In September, another AI company Anthropic agreed to pay book authors and publishers $1.5 billion after a judge ruled the company had illegally downloaded and stored copyrighted books to build its AI systems.The Times has also struck a multiyear licensing deal with Amazon to allow the tech giant to use its editorial content for training Amazon’s AI platforms.",Perplexity latest AI company to be hit with lawsuit by The New York Times.

Geoffrey Hinton says Google has an AI chip advantage

""big advantage""

""Google has a lot of very good researchers and obviously a lot of data and a lot of data centres.

Latest crackdown expands Russia's digital iron curtain on Western platforms

Government pushes citizens toward state-controlled MAX messenger





Russia's state internet regulator Roskomnadzor announced that it has blocked Snapchat and imposed restrictions on Apple 's FaceTime video calling service, accusing both platforms of facilitating terrorist activities and criminal operations within the country.The watchdog claimed the messaging app was being used ""to organize and conduct terrorist activities in the country, recruit perpetrators, and commit fraud and other crimes against our citizens,"" according to state media reports. While the announcement came this week, Roskomnadzor said it had already made Snapchat unavailable in Russia since October 10.Russia has systematically blocked major Western platforms including Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and messaging services Signal and Viber. Telegram voice and video calls face limitations, while authorities are suspected of deliberately throttling YouTube traffic.State media outlet TASS reported that FaceTime was similarly accused of being used to ""coordinate terrorist activities"" and recruit perpetrators for criminal acts. Neither Apple nor Snap Inc. responded to requests for comment on the measures.The Kremlin has intensified pressure on foreign platforms while promoting MAX, a state-controlled ""super app"" developed by tech firm VK.Mandatory on all new mobile phones and tablets sold in Russia since September, MAX combines messaging, government services, and payment functions. Its developer has openly stated it will share user data with authorities upon request.Digital rights advocates warn the app grants officials sweeping surveillance capabilities rather than protecting user privacy. Russia's most popular messenger, WhatsApp, received warnings last week of a potential complete ban if Meta refuses to share information with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases.The restrictions arrive as Russia deals with domestic security threats beyond the Ukraine conflict.

Discovery for $30 per share, securing iconic franchises like Harry Potter and DC Comics.

If approved, it would dramatically reshape Hollywood's power dynamics.

Netflix Drops A $72b Bombshell On Hollywood With Mega Warner Bros Discovery Move | WHAT IT MEANS

Netflix to get century of Hollywood content and production power

Antitrust concerns and theater industry opposition threaten approval





Netflix has officially confirmed its acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery in an $82.7 billion deal that will reshape Hollywood's power structure. The streaming giant will pay $27.75 per share in combined cash and stock to acquire the studio behind Harry Potter, DC Comics, Game of Thrones, and HBO Max.The transaction represents the largest media consolidation in over a decade and marks Netflix's boldest move yet into traditional entertainment. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval and Warner Bros. Discovery's planned spinoff of cable networks including CNN and TNT into a separate entity called Discovery Global.The acquisition gives Netflix immediate control of one of Hollywood's most prestigious studios, complete with global theatrical distribution networks and decades of premium content. Moreover, this deal also comes as a dramatic shift for Netflix, which has historically preferred organic growth over major acquisitions. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the combination would unite Warner Bros.' library of classics like Casablanca and modern favorites like Harry Potter with Netflix's own titles like Stranger Things and Squid Game. David Zaslav, President and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, said the combination ensures resonant stories will continue to reach audiences for generations.The combined company will command over 21% of US streaming viewership according to Bank of America analysts, who called it a strategic triple win: eliminating a major competitor, acquiring valuable intellectual property, and preventing rivals from doing the same. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav emphasized the merger ensures beloved stories reach audiences for generations to come.The path to completion faces significant obstacles. Netflix included an unusually large $5 billion breakup fee to offset regulatory risks, signaling expectations of fierce Department of Justice scrutiny. The Directors Guild of America and Cinema United have publicly opposed the merger, warning it threatens theatrical moviegoing.Industry critics fear Netflix will slash the window between theatrical releases and streaming availability, potentially devastating movie theaters. However, Netflix has privately assured Warner Bros. Discovery leadership it will honor existing theatrical commitments. The deal must still clear regulatory hurdles in the United States, European Union, and other key markets before closing.","Netflix has officially confirmed its acquisition of Warner Bros.

WhatsApp backup serves as lifeline for Zerodha during Cloudflare outage

Zerodha CEO commits to infrastructure diversification





Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath issued a public apology following a brief Cloudflare outage on December 5 that disrupted the company's Kite trading platform and disrupted brokers and fintech services worldwide. Acknowledging the frustration caused to traders during market hours, Kamath promised the company is actively working to reduce its dependency on Cloudflare's infrastructure to prevent future disruptions.""Cloudflare powers approximately 20-25% of all internet traffic globally. When Cloudflare has an outage, it doesn't just affect one company; it impacts a significant chunk of the internet simultaneously,"" Kamath explained in a post on X. The 12-minute outage affected not just Zerodha, but also Groww, Angel One, Upstox, Claude AI, Perplexity, and MakeMyTrip, among others. Users reported login failures, order placement difficulties, and inability to access market data.Kamath drew attention to Zerodha's contingency plan—Kite Backup on WhatsApp—which operates independently of primary systems. During the outage, users could exit positions through WhatsApp when the main platform was inaccessible.However, only a few thousand people used the alternative service, suggesting most traders remain unaware of this safety net. The CEO urged users to familiarize themselves with the WhatsApp backup system for future emergencies.This marks Cloudflare's second major disruption in recent weeks. In November 2025, a similar outage took down X, ChatGPT, Spotify, and League of Legends after a database permissions error triggered Bot Management system failures. That incident lasted over three hours, making it Cloudflare's worst outage since 2019.Cloudflare's massive internet footprint—providing content delivery, DDoS protection, and DNS services to millions of websites—means any technical glitch creates cascading failures across unrelated platforms within minutes. Recognizing this single point of failure, Kamath's commitment to reducing Cloudflare dependency signals a strategic shift toward infrastructure diversification.Cloudflare confirmed on its status page that services returned to normal at 09:12 UTC (2:42 PM IST) after deploying a fix. The company continues monitoring systems for residual issues. Trading platforms have since stabilized, though the incident has renewed conversations about the internet's fragile infrastructure and over-reliance on few providers.","Zerodha's CEO apologizes for a Cloudflare outage that hit its trading platform and others globally.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff may rename the company to Agentforce. The chief executive of the software company reportedly said that he would not be surprised if changing the official corporate name to ""Agentforce"" were to happen. An employee of the company had also addressed a possible name change earlier, at least partially in jest. However, during a recent interview with Business Insider, Benioff verified that it was a real option.Benioff said upon being asked about the possibility.The company has already begun rebranding many of its offerings under thename to make its AI software emphasis clear. In its most recent earnings update, the company said that its offering, for instance, likeis nowandis nowThe move comes after a push to move beyond talking mainly about the cloud and to emphasise AI capabilities.Salesforce was founded as a cloud company, so many of its products include the wordsuch as Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Data Cloud. But according to Benioff, customers no longer want to hear about the cloud. He said he learned that from recent focus groups before the Dreamforce conference in October.Now, clients mainly want to talk about AI agents.Benioff explained.Part of that move includes the renaming of Data Cloud towhich was announced during Dreamforce. Data 360 is critical to Salesforce’s 2026 strategy, as Benioff mentioned in the interview.Salesforce now heavily focuses on AI agents. Some employees are unsure whether this direction will work; however, the latest earnings report gave reason for optimism when it showed encouraging results, and the company increased its revenue outlook.It's not an outlier: Aside from Salesforce, other companies have similarly changed names as they pivoted toward new technologies or business directions.

He's restructuring to flatten hierarchies and foster faster innovation, emphasizing a 'learn-it-all' mindset over past successes. Nadella warns AI projects fail without fundamental workflow redesign and data integration, highlighting the urgent need for reinvention.

Why Microsoft and other Silicon Valley giants are flattening their hierarchies

Nadella says key to stay Relevant in AI era is unlearning success





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is spending his weekends studying how startups build products, revealing that his company's massive size has become a critical weakness in the race to develop AI. Speaking on the ""MD MEETS"" podcast with Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner, Nadella said he devoted an entire recent weekend to understanding how new companies create products with speed Microsoft can't match. The reason is simple but damning: Microsoft's scale is now ""a massive disadvantage,"" he admitted.At startups, product development teams work at a single table—scientists, engineers, and infrastructure specialists collaborating and iterating instantly. At Microsoft, Nadella manages three separate divisional heads overseeing those same functions, creating bureaucratic layers that slow decision-making to a crawl.Nadella's weekend study sessions reflect an urgent shift across the tech industry. Meta, Google, and Amazon are all aggressively trimming middle management layers, viewing thick hierarchies as fatal obstacles to swift product development and AI experimentation.Microsoft has already begun restructuring internally. Leaked documents show Nadella now has 16 direct reports—handpicked executives tasked with dismantling organizational silos and accelerating the company's AI transformation.Beyond organizational fixes, Nadella argues the real challenge is mental. Leaders must abandon the ""know-it-all"" mindset that drove past success and adopt a ""learn-it-all"" approach instead. The hardest part, he said, is unlearning what made you successful to learn something new.The CEO warns that most corporate AI projects collapse because companies treat AI as a traditional IT upgrade. Success requires four fundamental shifts: redesigning workflows entirely, adopting modern AI tools, training employees properly, and extracting company data from legacy systems.To guide this transformation, Nadella has tapped Rolf Harms, who helped Microsoft navigate its cloud computing revolution 15 years ago with his influential ""Economics of the Cloud"" white paper, to now rethink the company's business model for the AI era.Nadella's weekend homework underscores a stark reality: even the most successful tech companies must fundamentally reinvent themselves or risk becoming irrelevan","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is studying startup product development.

Cloudflare initially informed users that it was investigating issues with the Dashboard and related APIs, later confirming that a fix had been implemented. Cloudflare CTO Dane Knecht clarified that the root cause was not a cyberattack but rather the disabling of specific logging functions to mitigate a recently discovered vulnerability.The company is central to internet function, helping websites stay online, load quickly, and remain secure from attacks. Because so many sites rely on its services, a single issue can simultaneously take numerous unrelated websites offline. Cloudflare has confirmed the incident is fully resolved.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang tells what makes Elon Musk 'very special' for him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-tells-what-makes-elon-musk-very-special-for-him/articleshow/125786430.cms,"How Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came to know about OpenAI







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has previously praised Elon Musk for his contribution in the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), saying he’s doing just the right things. In a recent podcast with Joe Rogan, Huang again commended the Tesla CEO, recounting an episode when he was the sole early buyer of the DGX-1 AI supercomputer in 2016. Huang further said that later he personally delivered the machine to X (formerly Twitter) owner in a small room that turned out to be OpenAI , the developer of ChatGPT.“When I announced this thing, nobody in the world wanted it. I had no purchase orders—not one. Nobody wanted to buy it. Nobody wanted to be part of it, except for Elon. He was at the event, and we were doing a fireside chat about the future of self-driving cars,” he told Rogan.However, the excitement was quickly dampened when Musk told him that he has a non-profit company.“And he goes, ‘You know what? I have a company that could really use this.’ And I said, ‘Wow, my first customer.’ I was pretty excited about it. And he goes, ‘Yeah, we have this company. It’s a non-profit company’,” Huang said, recounting the moment during a fireside chat.Huang had invested billions building the system, which cost $300,000 per unit.He joked that the chances of a nonprofit being able to pay for it were “approximately zero.” Musk then clarified that the nonprofit was an AI company that “could really use one of these supercomputers.”The eventual delivery of that initial supercomputer led to the revelation of OpenAI. Huang ultimately built one unit for Nvidia's internal use and personally delivered the second one to Musk in San Francisco in 2016.“So I picked it up. I built the first one for ourselves—we’re using it inside the company. I boxed one up, drove it up to San Francisco, and delivered it to Elon in 2016. I walked up to the second floor, where they were all kind of crammed into a room smaller than this place here, and that place turned out to be OpenAI,” he revealed.This moment purportedly marked a turning point for Nvidia's AI hardware ambitions, as the DGX-1, which is powered by eight Pascal GPUs, enabled OpenAI's foundational research.Earlier this year, Musk shared a ‘throwback’ post from 2016. Originally a photo showing Huang handing over the DGX-1, it has been transformed into a video using AI. Musk reshared the AI-generated video, essentially grabbing the opportunity to promote a new feature in Grok AI chatbot that allows people to convert a photo into a video.“Jensen delivering the first AI-optimized GPU to OpenAI in 2016,” said Musk in the post on X in which Huang is seen unpacking a GPU.",Jensen Huang was the sole early buyer of the DGX-1 AI supercomputer in 2016. He delivered the machine to X (formerly Twitter) owner in a small room that turned out to be OpenAI. Huang has previously praised Elon Musk for his contribution in the advancement in artificial intelligence.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125786400,imgsize-44212,width-400,resizemode-4/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-with-elon-musk.jpg"
Cloudflare goes down again; CTO Dane Knecht confirms outage but clarifies: Not an ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cloudflare-cto-dane-knecht-confirms-outage-shares-root-cause/articleshow/125786181.cms,"Root Cause: Disabling logging features



Cloudflare down: OpenAI, Twitter, Spotify, Canva, Claude and other big businesses that Cloudflare outage 'disrupted'

Second Cloudflare outage in a month







Cloudflare is down again, temporarily impacting hundreds of websites, including Canva, Zoom and Claude, among various others, unreachable on Friday (December 5). Cloudflare CTO Dane Knecht confirmed the technical problems, saying that the company is working on a fix and the websites should soon be coming back online. He also shared the “root cause” of what led to the worldwide outage. The internet infrastructure provider deployed corrective measures.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Knecht said, “We are aware of the issue impacting the availability of Cloudflare’s network. It was not an attack; root cause was disabling some logging to help mitigate this week’s React CVE.”“Will share full details in a blog post today. Sites should be back online now, but I understand the frustration this causes and the work being,” he added.He previously posted that the company is ""closely tracking the React RSC vulnerability.""If you deploy on Cloudflare Workers, you are protected. The Workers security model prevents this exploit at the runtime layer. For users that rely on WAF to protect self hosted applications more variants of this exploit are already surfacing and we are evaluating each one. As always the best way to stay protected is to upgrade to the patched versions of React and NextJS as soon as possible,"" he added.Later, the cmopany rolled out ""additional mitigations"" to protect more customers.Meanwhile, the company posted on its status page that a fix has been resolved, the services are back online, and the team is monitoring the situation.“Cloudflare services are currently operating normally. We are no longer observing elevated errors or latency across the network. Our engineering teams continue to closely monitor the platform and perform a deeper investigation into the earlier disruption, but no configuration changes are being made at this time,” the company said (at the time of writing).“At this point, it is considered safe to re-enable any Cloudflare services that were temporarily disabled during the incident. We will provide a final update once our investigation is complete,” the company added.This is the second such outage in a month’s time. Previously, on November 18, Cloudflare went down for hours, impacting major websites worldwide. At that time, the CTO said, “A latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made. That cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services. This was not an attack.”Knecht stressed that the extent of the issue and the time required for resolution were “unacceptable.”","Cloudflare is down again, temporarily impacting hundreds of websites, including Canva, Zoom and Claude.

$70 billion in losses and counting

Layoffs may be coming to Meta

Where budget cuts may go





Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to have finally realised that one of the company's biggest bets -- Metaverse -- is not working (or not working as expected). It is also the technology that the company changed its very name after. In 2021, after 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking parent company behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus changed its name to Meta. Now according to a report from Bloomberg, Meta is likely to slash its Reality Labs budget, shaving off as much as 30%. The proposed metaverse cuts are reportedly part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026, which included a series of meetings at Zuckerberg's compound in Hawaii last month.For those unaware, Metaverse unit works on virtual reality headsets and a VR-based social network, which produces the company's Quest mixed-reality headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses. Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community.Analysts see the move reflecting the overall lack of interest in products like Meta’s social virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, as well as its virtual reality hardware — both in the industry at large, as well as among consumers.Zuckerberg’s Metaverse vision has posted more than $70 billion in losses over the past four years. Little doubt then that Facebook parent's shares rose 4% as the move eased some investor jitters over a bet that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backed with billions of dollars. ""Smart move, just late,"" told Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber to Bloomberg. He added, ""This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not as prosperous as management thought years ago. ""Reality Labs is made up of a Metaverse unit and a wearables unit. Within the Metaverse unit, executives are reportedly considering making cuts to VR jobs. As the report says, cuts in resources that high are most likely to include layoffs as early as January.The report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant in Silicon Valley's artificial-intelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception. To fuel its ambitious goals, Meta hascommitted as much as $72 billion in capital spending this year. The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year, with Zuckerberg said to be personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition, floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp with million-dollar pay packages. In fact, Meta's big hiring is said to have triggered a talent war in the Silicon Valley.Last month, Meta Platforms said that it will invest $600 billion in the US infrastructure and jobs over the next three years, including artificial intelligence data centers. Meta has doubled down on AI, with a target of achieving superintelligence. Zuckerberg said Meta is building compute because ""it's the right strategy to aggressively front-load capacity so we're prepared for the most optimistic cases,"" on the company's recent earnings call. Meta has forecast ""notably larger"" capital expenses next year thanks to investments in artificial intelligence, including aggressively building data centers to power its AI push.Incidentally, earlier this week, Zuckerberg announced that Alan Dye, a longtime designer at Apple, is joining Meta to lead a new creative studio inside the Reality Labs division that would focus on design, fashion and technology. Dye will report to Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, who leads Reality Labs. “We’re entering a new era where A.I. glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in a post to Threads. “With this new studio, we’re focused on making every interaction thoughtful, intuitive, and built to serve people.”","Reality Labs, Meta's virtual reality unit, is likely to be cut by as much as 30%. The cuts are reportedly part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026. Analysts see the move reflecting the overall lack of interest in Meta’s products.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125785603,imgsize-76476,width-400,resizemode-4/mark-zuckerberg.jpg"
Sam Altman wants to follow Elon Musk beyond Earth and is willing to spend billions on it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-wants-to-follow-elon-musk-beyond-earth-and-is-willing-to-spend-billions-on-it/articleshow/125785348.cms,"Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth

Sam Altman to take on Elon Musk's Neuralink

Elon Musk vs Sam Altman rivalry

Musk co-founded OpenAI but left in 2018 after unsuccessfully attempting to merge it with Tesla.

He later tried to purchase OpenAI, but was rebuffed.

Musk has since launched his own AI company, filed lawsuits against OpenAI, and remains one of Altman’s fiercest critics.

Altman has launched ventures competing with Musk’s Neuralink, and OpenAI is developing a social media platform to rival Musk’s X.





The rivalry between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk is not going to end anytime soon, in fact it may also transcend Earth. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, Altman has now explored the idea of investing billions into space ventures, including potential partnerships or acquisitions of rocket companies in a bid to challenge Elon Musk’s SpaceX .Altman has reportedly entered into discussions with Stoke Space, a startup founded in 2020 by former Blue Origin engineers. The proposals included OpenAI making equity investments with the goal of acquiring a controlling stake. Those talks have since stalled, but the report underscores Altman’s interest in expanding beyond AI into aerospace.Altman’s association to Stole Space dates back to his tenure at Y Combinator, which invested in the company. He has also publicly mused about building a rocked company on podcasts.This is not the first time that Altman is working on giving competition to Elon Musk. In August it was reported that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman co-founded a brain-computer interface startup called Merge Labs. The upcoming startup will compete against Elon Musk’s Neuralink as both the companies will not race to merge humans with artificial intelligence.As reported by Financial Times, Merge Labs is in the process of raising $850 million, with $250 million expected to come from OpenAI’s venture fund.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman will be the co-founder, however he is not said to be involved in day-to-day operations. The startup is reportedly also working with Alex Blania, CEO of Tools for Humanity, Altman’s other venture focused on biometric digital identity.If Altman pursues space exploration, it would mark yet another front in his rivalry with Musk.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is reportedly exploring the idea of investing billions into space ventures.

A turning point for the industry





For years, the upper tier of American podcasting seemed immovable. News briefings, daily analysis and long-established storytelling shows dominated the charts, setting the tone for what millions listened to on their commutes, workouts and late-night wind-downs. But Apple ’s newly released 2025 rankings tell a different story. A familiar format has been pushed down, a new style has risen to the top and the country’s listening habits are shifting in ways that feel bigger than a simple list.Apple’s new list reveals a dramatic reshuffling, with familiar giants sliding down the chart and unexpected contenders rising to the top. What makes the change so striking is not only who climbed but what the shift says about how Americans are choosing to listen in 2025.At the centre of that shake-up is a new chart-topper: The Joe Rogan Experience. It has moved up from No. 3 last year to become America’s most popular podcast on Apple’s 2025 list. Its ascent pushed long-time leader The Daily from The New York Times into second place, bringing an end to its years-long run at the top.Apple’s rankings confirm what industry watchers have sensed for months. Rogan’s multi-hour, freewheeling political, cultural and scientific conversations have been pulling massive audiences across platforms, and the momentum carried the show to No.1. It also currently ranks first on YouTube’s weekly podcast chart, showcasing its reach beyond traditional audio platforms.Apple’s top 10 for 2025 paints a broader picture of upheaval:Apple’s separate episode ranking also offered surprises:The episode list spans mysteries, celebrity culture, true crime, politics and technology, a snapshot of America’s increasingly eclectic listening habits.Apple’s 2025 data highlights several reasons behind the shift:The dethroning of legacy giants like The Daily shows how podcasting is moving away from strictly structured journalism toward looser, personality-driven formats.Apple’s rankings do more than list winners, they mark a turning point. A new leader now defines America’s listening habits, and the reasons behind that shift reflect broader cultural changes: longer attention spans for compelling conversations, a hunger for authenticity and the growing power of video-driven podcasting.For the first time in years, the old hierarchy has been disrupted.

What partnership means to Microsoft, Nvidia and Anthropic





Microsoft has taken another step away from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. The software giant has announced that it has entered into a multibillion-dollar cloud infrastructure partnership with artificial intelligence startup Anthropic and chipmaker Nvidia, a move that underscores the software giant’s growing independence from its longtime ally OpenAI. Anthropic — maker of the Claude chatbot that competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT.Microsoft was OpenAI’s exclusive cloud provider until earlier this year, and it used the technology behind ChatGPT to power its own AI assistant, Copilot. But the two firms have since revised their business agreements as OpenAI pursued alternative cloud and data-center partnerships with Oracle, SoftBank, and other infrastructure suppliers.The joint announcements from Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came just before the kickoff of Microsoft’s annual Ignite developer conference.“This is all about deepening our commitment to bringing the best infrastructure, model choice and applications to our customers,” Nadella said during a video call with Amodei and Huang.

As part of the broader arrangement, Nvidia will invest up to $10 billion in Anthropic, while Microsoft will contribute as much as $5 billion to the San Francisco–based company. Nvidia said the deal will give Anthropic access to up to a gigawatt of compute capacity powered by its advanced AI chips. “I’ve admired the work of Anthropic and Dario for a long time, and this is the first time we are going to deeply partner with Anthropic to accelerate Claude,” Huang said.Anthropic — founded in 2021 by former OpenAI employees — said Claude will now be the “only frontier model” available across all three major cloud platforms: Amazon, its primary cloud partner; Google; and Microsoft.

Microsoft on preventing biggest ever DDoS attack on Azure cloud network: It originated from…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-on-preventing-biggest-ever-ddos-attack-on-azure-cloud-network-it-originated-from/articleshow/125419256.cms,"Representative Image

What is a DDoS attack



Read what Microsoft said about the DDoS attack on the Azure network



“On October 24, 2025, Azure DDOS Protection automatically detected and mitigated a multi-vector DDoS attack measuring 15.72 Tbps and nearly 3.64 billion packets per second (pps). This was the largest DDoS attack ever observed in the cloud, and it targeted a single endpoint in Australia.

By utilising Azure’s globally distributed DDoS Protection infrastructure and continuous detection capabilities, mitigation measures were initiated. Malicious traffic was effectively filtered and redirected, maintaining uninterrupted service availability for customer workloads.

The attack originated from the Aisuru botnet. Aisuru is a Turbo Mirai-class IoT botnet that frequently causes record-breaking DDoS attacks by exploiting compromised home routers and cameras, mainly in residential ISPs in the United States and other countries.

The attack involved extremely high-rate UDP floods targeting a specific public IP address, launched from over 500,000 source IPs across various regions. These sudden UDP bursts had minimal source spoofing and used random source ports, which helped simplify traceback and facilitated provider enforcement.

Attackers are scaling with the internet itself. As fibre-to-the-home speeds rise and IoT devices get more powerful, the baseline for attack size keeps climbing.

As we approach the upcoming holiday season, it is essential to confirm that all internet-facing applications and workloads are adequately protected against DDOS attacks. Additionally, do not wait for an actual attack to assess your defensive capabilities or operational readiness—conduct regular simulations to identify and address potential issues proactively.”





Microsoft has announced that it prevented the largest-ever cloud DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack on its Azure cloud services, which occurred in October. In a report, the software giant noted that the Azure DDOS Protection tool automatically detected and mitigated a multi-vector attack that peaked at 15.72 Tbps (Terabits per second - the biggest ever in history) and nearly 3.64 billion packets per second (pps). This record-breaking attack targeted a single customer endpoint in Australia. The massive attack was successfully absorbed and filtered by Azure’s globally distributed DDoS Protection infrastructure, ensuring uninterrupted service availability for the customer.The attack was traced back to the Aisuru botnet, a Turbo Mirai-class IoT botnet known for exploiting compromised home routers and cameras to launch high-scale attacks. The attackers utilised extremely high-rate UDP floods launched from over 500,000 source IPs across various regions. This incident underscores the rising threat landscape, where attack sizes scale with advances in the internet, such as increased fibre-to-the-home speeds and more powerful IoT devices.A DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack is a cyberattack where hackers use many infected devices to send massive amounts of fake traffic to a website or server. This flood of requests overwhelms the system, making it impossible for real users to access it. The target becomes so overloaded that it either crashes or slows down to the point where it stops working correctly.In a blog post, Sean Whalen, senior product marketing manager at Microsoft, wrote:",Microsoft says it prevented the largest-ever cloud DDoS (distributed denial-of- service) attack on its Azure cloud services.

Cloudflare down error message

What experts said on the outage







Cloudflare outage brought down hundreds of websites across the globe. Websites across the web crashed after what Cloudflare describes as a 'spike in unusual traffic.' The almost six-hour-long outage was caused by a latent bug. San Francisco-based Cloudflare provides the infrastructure and security for many websites worldwide. One of the company’s main areas of service is protecting websites against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which occur when multiple bad actors flood a website or network with traffic requests to overload it and degrade performance or cut off access.Some of the biggest websites that went down include ChatGPT, Twitter, Perplexity, Claude and also the outage-tracking site DownDetector. Other online services, including Grindr, Uber, Canva, Spotify, NJ Transit and League of Legends also experienced issues during the outage.The cause of the outage was a configuration file that is automatically generated to manage threat traffic, Jackie Dutton, a Cloudflare spokesperson said in a statement. There was no evidence of a cyberattack or malicious activity, the statement said. “The file grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare’s services,” said Dutton.""In short, a latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made. That cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services. This was not an attack,” Knecht wrote, referring to a bug that goes undetected in testing and has not caused a failure,"" Cloudflare's chief technology officer Dane Knecht wrote on Twitter.Some sites displayed the error message, “Please unblock challenges.cloudflare.com to proceed.”Explaining Cloudflare outage, information technology professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business, Mike Chapple, said that Cloudflare works behind the scenes to make the internet faster and safer, but when problems flare up “it results in massive digital gridlock” for internet users. Chapple further added that Cloudflare is a “content delivery network” that takes content from 20% of the world’s websites and mirrors them on thousands of servers worldwide.“When you access a website protected by Cloudflare, your computer doesn’t connect directly to that site,” Chapple said. “Instead, it connects to the nearest Cloudflare server, which might be very close to your home. That protects the website from a flood of traffic, and it provides you with a faster response. It’s a win-win for everyone, until it fails, and 20% of the internet goes down at the same time.”",Cloudflare outage brought down hundreds of websites across the globe.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees.

Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What is Cloudflare’s WARP access and what it means for users



""demand""





A large-scale outage of Cloudflare servers blocked users worldwide from accessing hundreds of online services today (November 18). The outage, which the IT infrastructure company claims it has fixed, persisted for over 2 hours, affecting popular online services such as ChatGPT, Twitter (X), Spotify, Discord, Canva and others. Millions of users complained of being unable to connect to these services during the outage. The incident highlights the critical role Cloudflare plays in powering the internet backbone through its content delivery and security services. However, while fixing the outage, Cloudflare temporarily disabled WARP access in London. Here, we will discuss what Cloudflare’s WARP access is and what it means for users:While fixing the outage, Cloudflare took to its official status page to write:Later on, the company said,The Cloudflare WARP app is a consumer product that provides a VPN service to secure internet traffic. WARP access refers to Cloudflare's service that enhances internet security and performance by creating an encrypted tunnel for device traffic.When Cloudflare WARP access is down, it means your device cannot connect to the Cloudflare network. This prevents the app from securing and optimising your internet traffic. At that time, users may have experienced an inability to connect to the internet or encountered slow speeds, even if their underlying internet connection was working correctly.When Cloudflare disabled WARP access in London, users in the city who tried to connect to the internet via the Cloudflare WARP app would’ve experienced connection failures. This was later restored when the company enabled access to the app.Earlier, Cloudflare's WARP app was also available in India. However, in January, more than half a dozen VPN apps, including Cloudflare's widely used 1.1.1.1, were reportedly removed from India's Apple App Store and Google Play Store following intervention from government authorities.According to a document reviewed by TechCrunch and a disclosure made by Google to Lumen, Harvard University's database that tracks government takedown requests globally, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued removal orders for these apps.Among the affected apps were Hide.me and PrivadoVPN.As per the report, in a communication to one of the affected developers, Apple cited afrom the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre, part of the Ministry of Home Affairs, which deemed the developer's content to contravene Indian law.","A large-scale outage of Cloudflare servers blocked users worldwide from accessing hundreds of online services today (November 18) The outage, which the IT infrastructure company claims it has fixed, persisted for over 2 hours, affecting popular online services such as ChatGPT, Twitter (X), Spotify, Discord, Canva and others.

Cloudflare’s response









Cloudflare has said that the issue that caused the outage, affecting hundreds of websites has been fixed. ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Perplexity and Downdetector were among hundreds of websites that faced a massive disruption due to a bug in Cloudflare server. Users worldwide experienced significant service interruption after a major technical failure hit the content delivery network provider, Cloudflare. Disruptions commenced around 6:00 AM ET (4.30 pm IST), following an issue with a provider for Cloudflare’s support portal, according to data from the outage-tracking platform Downdetector. The problem rapidly expanded, impacting a broad array of online services that utilise Cloudflare’s network for enhanced security and optimised performance. The company officially confirmed ongoing service degradation, noting reports of widespread 500 errors and API failures across various platformsSeveral users, including members of The Times of India tech team checked multiple websites but were met with a baffling message: “Please unblock challenges.cloudflare.com to proceed.” This error is generated by Cloudflare’s security challenge system, which is designed to verify users and block malicious traffic. The message essentially signaled that this verification mechanism itself was malfunctioning, preventing users from reaching functional websites.According to a message on Cloudflare community, this message means that ‘something at users’ end is blocking the security tool (Cloudflare) that the platform is using to protect their site.This is probably something from the users’ local firewall, browser extension, or some other security tool on the users’ computer/network, and only they can know what that is and unblock it.’Cloudflare officially addressed the situation, stating it was “aware of, and investigating an issue which impacts multiple customers,” noting the simultaneous failure of its Dashboard and API.""A fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved.

Google About to Reach the $3 Trillion Club

A strategy shift for Google







Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis dropped a cryptic hint early Tuesday that sent the AI community into overdrive. ""It's nearly 3 here, my favourite part of the night shift… locked in,"" he posted on X, suggesting Google 's most significant AI release of the year could be imminent. With Polymarket traders placing 69% odds on a November 22 launch date for Gemini 3, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai responding to speculation with only thinking face emojis, the tech giant appears poised for a major announcement.While Google hasn't officially announced Gemini 3, the model appears to have already begun a quiet rollout through Canvas on mobile devices. Users on Reddit and developer communities report dramatic improvements over the previous Gemini 2.5 Pro, with complex single-shot prompts now working on first attempts. SVG animations, web designs, and 3D physics simulations are generating cleanly and functioning properly without the iterative refinement typically required.The subdued launch strategy marks a sharp departure from Google's previous AI announcements, which were plagued by privacy lawsuits, image generation failures, and API breaking changes that frustrated developers. This measured approach appears to be paying off in enterprise adoption.The muted rollout signals a fundamental strategy shift for a company burned by overhyped launches. Google's previous AI debuts were marred by privacy scandals, biased image generation, and API changes that frustrated developers.This time, the company is testing with real users first, gathering feedback, and refining based on actual performance rather than rushing to beat OpenAI to headlines.The approach appears calculated: let enterprise adoption numbers do the talking. With Google controlling 44% of the productivity software market through Gmail, Drive, and Workspace, integration matters more than benchmarks. When Gemini 3 works seamlessly inside tools companies already depend on, the competitive advantage isn't about having the flashiest model—it's about having the most useful one where people actually work.","Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis dropped a cryptic hint early Tuesday that sent the AI community into overdrive.

What Cloudflare has to say?





Following the mass outage, hundreds of websites, including OpenAI , Twitter (X), Spotify, Canva, Claude and other big platforms went down after a massive technical failure impacted Cloudflare, the core IT infrastructure and security provider for numerous high-traffic online services. The scope of the incident was so big that even the outage tracking service Downdetector was temporarily affected by the same technical problems before it could resume operations and log a dramatic spike in user reports across the globe. Here’s everything you need to know:Cloudflare is a massive, essential internet infrastructure and security company that provides services to millions of websites and online applications worldwide. In layman’s terms, it is a service that sits between the user (you) and the host server of a website, acting as a critical middle layer.This means that when Cloudflare experiences a major technical problem, it takes down its own website as well as block access to a huge number of sites that rely on its services.Cloudflare operates one of the world’s largest content delivery networks (CDNs). It provides several crucial functions that nearly all major modern websites use:Cloudflare caches (stores copies of) website data on its global network of servers.When you request a website, the data is served from the closest Cloudflare server, making the site load much faster.It acts as a shield, protecting websites from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, where hackers flood a site with junk traffic.It provides web application firewalls and security filters, stopping malicious requests before they reach the website’s original server.It handles the complex “phone book” of the internet, directing traffic to the correct IP addresses.The websites that experienced outages (like X, Spotify, etc.) did not experience problems with their own servers; they were experiencing a failure in the Cloudflare layer that sits in front of them. When a major internal error occurred in Cloudflare’s network, it caused a domino effect.Cloudflare has confirmed the disruption and said that it has immediately launched an investigation. According to the latest update issued the company said it is “working on restoring service for application services customers.”“We have made changes that have allowed Cloudflare Access and WARP to recover. Error levels for Access and WARP users have returned to pre-incident rates. We have re-enabled WARP access in London,” the company said in its previous update.“During our attempts to remediate, we have disabled WARP access in London. Users in London trying to access the Internet via WARP will see a failure to connect,” the company added.Users affected by the crash saw a message asking them to ""please try again in a few minutes,"" pointing directly to an “internal server error on Cloudflare’s network.”The outage began around 12:00 UTC (5:30 pm IST) on November 18.","Hundreds of websites, including Twitter (X), Spotify, Canva, Claude and other big platforms went down after a massive technical failure.

How AI agents interact with files and apps





Security and isolation features of Agent workspace





Parallel execution: Agents run alongside your main desktop without interruption.

Scoped authorisation: Each agent has a separate account and permission set.

Auditable actions: Users can monitor agent activities and adjust access as needed.

Microsoft is taking a major step toward making Windows 11 an AI-first operating system with its new experimental feature, Agent Workspace . This feature allows AI agents to run in the background with access to key personal folders, such as Documents, Desktop, Music, Pictures, and Videos, enabling them to perform tasks autonomously while users continue working on their normal desktop. Each agent operates in a separate, contained workspace with its own account, desktop, and permissions, ensuring a degree of isolation and control. While designed to enhance productivity by automating repetitive tasks, the feature also raises potential security and privacy concerns. Currently available only to Windows Insiders, Agent Workspace marks Microsoft’s push to integrate AI more deeply into everyday computing.Agent Workspace is a separate, contained Windows session dedicated to AI agents. Each agent gets its own desktop, account, permissions, and runtime, allowing it to work independently without disturbing the user’s main desktop. Users can turn on this optional feature through Settings > System > AI Components > Experimental Agentic Features.Once activated, agents can perform tasks such as opening applications, managing files, or running scripts, all in parallel with your regular workflow.Microsoft emphasises that this isolated workspace keeps agent actions auditable and controlled, ensuring you maintain visibility over what AI agents are doing.AI agents require access to local files and applications to perform tasks effectively. By using Windows’ Known Folders (Documents, Desktop, Downloads, Pictures, Music, Videos), agents can locate and manage files even if you’ve moved these folders elsewhere in your system.The workspace allows agents to read and write to these folders, enabling them to automate repetitive tasks like organising documents, creating presentations, or updating media libraries. Each agent’s permissions are scoped individually, so one agent’s access does not automatically extend to others.Microsoft designed Agent Workspace with security in mind. While it may seem similar to Windows Sandbox, there are key differences:Unlike Sandbox, which creates a fully isolated virtual environment and deletes activities on closure, AI agents can access personal folders while running. Microsoft is actively refining the security model to prioritise transparency, safety, and user control.With Agent Workspace, Windows 11 takes a significant step toward becoming an AI-native operating system. The goal is to provide AI assistance that works locally, automates repetitive tasks, and increases productivity while allowing users to stay in control. However, giving AI agents access to personal files introduces privacy and security concerns. The feature is still experimental and limited to Windows Insiders, and user feedback will likely shape its development before a wider release. Microsoft aims to balance innovation with safety, ensuring AI agents enhance workflows without compromising trust. As testing continues, developers are also evaluating how well these agents handle sensitive data, potential misuse risks, and the need for clear user permissions to maintain transparency and accountability.","Microsoft is taking a major step toward making Windows 11 an AI-first operating system with its new experimental feature, Agent Workspace.

Abidur Chowdhury, a rising talent in Apple’s industrial design team, has left the tech giant to join an emerging artificial intelligence startup, a move first reported by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Chowdhury gained recognition for his role in the development of the iPhone Air, even presenting its design and features during Apple’s September launch event, a rare public-facing responsibility for an industrial designer. His departure marks a significant loss for Apple’s design division, which has been undergoing transitions following the exit of several senior designers and organisational changes under CEO Tim Cook. The move also underscores the growing intersection between hardware design and AI, reflecting the increasing demand for design expertise in shaping user-friendly and innovative technology solutions as the industry rapidly evolves and companies intensify their focus on next-generation intelligent products.Abidur Chowdhury’s exit from Apple marks a significant moment for both the tech giant and the AI industry.It highlights the importance of industrial design not only in shaping consumer electronics but also in influencing emerging technologies. As Chowdhury embarks on this next chapter, both Apple and the wider tech community will be watching closely, recognising the potential impact of a designer who has already left a lasting mark on one of the world’s most iconic products.Chowdhury’s exit is part of a wider transformation within Apple’s design division. Several long-standing designers have either retired or moved to other companies, including Jony Ive, who founded LoveFrom after leaving Apple. Recently, the design teams were reorganised to report directly to CEO Tim Cook, following the departure of Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, who previously managed the division. This restructuring reflects Apple’s ongoing commitment to design excellence, ensuring that product innovation remains central to the company’s strategic vision despite internal transitions.Chowdhury joined Apple in 2019, a pivotal moment that coincided with the departure of Jony Ive, Apple’s legendary design chief. While many designers have left Apple over the years, Chowdhury quickly distinguished himself through his technical expertise, creativity, and ability to blend aesthetics with functionality. He became known for his contributions to Apple’s product line, particularly in refining the design language of the company’s devices to balance sleek minimalism with intuitive usability.His rise within the company was swift. Chowdhury’s talent for translating complex technological innovation into designs that are both visually appealing and user-friendly made him a key member of Apple’s industrial design team. This recognition was reflected in his selection to represent Apple publicly during major product launches, a responsibility reserved for designers who have earned the company’s trust and respect.Chowdhury’s role became particularly visible during the launch of the iPhone Air in September. Apple selected him to present the design features and the philosophy behind the device in an official video. This public-facing role is rare for industrial designers at Apple, who typically operate behind the scenes. Being the face of a product launch highlights Chowdhury’s influence and the company’s confidence in his design vision. The iPhone Air, although facing slower-than-expected sales, has been widely praised for its elegance, lightweight form, and intuitive interface, showcasing Chowdhury’s design philosophy.As a core contributor to the iPhone Air, Chowdhury helped shape a device that balances aesthetics with practical functionality. The iPhone Air’s slim design, attention to detail, and material innovation are a testament to the industrial design team’s effort, and Chowdhury’s fingerprints are evident in many of these decisions. Reports indicate that a next-generation version of the iPhone Air is already in development for 2027, making Chowdhury’s departure a significant shift for Apple’s design continuity.","Abidur Chowdhury, a rising talent in Apple’s industrial design team, has left the tech giant to join an emerging artificial intelligence startup.

What is Jeff Bezos-led AI startup Project Prometheus

How Project Prometheus bridges research and real-world innovation

From LLMs to World Models: The next generation of AI innovation





Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and one of the world’s richest people, is returning to an executive role as co-CEO of the AI startup Project Prometheus. This marks his first formal operational position since stepping down from Amazon in 2021 and signals his renewed focus on cutting-edge technology beyond his space venture, Blue Origin. Project Prometheus aims to develop advanced AI systems for robotics, drug discovery, and scientific innovation. Bezos’ return comes at a time of rapid global growth in AI, with increasing investment and a surge of startups transforming industries from software development to automation and scientific research. His involvement underscores the rising importance of AI in shaping the future of technology.Project Prometheus derives its name from Greek mythology, symbolising innovation and the transformative power of knowledge. The startup’s goal is to develop advanced AI systems capable of accelerating scientific discovery and performing complex physical tasks. These include robotics for automated operations, AI-driven drug discovery, and innovations across engineering, aerospace, and manufacturing.According to a Forbes report, the venture has already raised approximately $6.2 billion, making it one of the best-funded early-stage AI startups globally.A portion of this funding comes from Bezos himself, reflecting both his financial commitment and personal involvement in the company’s strategic direction. Project Prometheus has assembled an elite team of around 100 researchers and engineers. Many of these experts have been recruited from renowned AI labs such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Meta. The team’s expertise spans robotics, machine learning, and applied AI research, positioning the startup to compete effectively in a highly competitive industry.As reported by The New York Times, Vik Bajaj, a former researcher at Google and co-leader of the project, has a notable background working on ambitious initiatives at Google X, such as Waymo, the self-driving car project, and Wing, a drone delivery service. His experience in developing breakthrough technologies complements Bezos’ strategic vision for Project Prometheus.Project Prometheus differentiates itself from conventional AI ventures that focus primarily on large language models (LLMs), such as those powering AI chatbots like ChatGPT. Instead, the startup is exploring “world models”; AI systems capable of understanding and interacting with the physical world, learning through observation and experimentation rather than relying solely on textual or digital data.Other startups pursuing similar approaches include Periodic Labs, which is designing AI-driven laboratories to conduct automated scientific experiments, and Physical Intelligence, which is backed by prominent investors such as Bezos, Khosla Ventures, Lux Capital, and OpenAI. These companies share the objective of bridging AI research and real-world applications, creating systems that can reason, plan, and innovate in tangible environments.Prominent AI experts, including Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, argue that LLMs have inherent limitations. While these models can process vast amounts of textual data and generate coherent outputs, they lack true understanding of the physical world. According to LeCun, they cannot perform reasoning tasks, anticipate outcomes, or plan actions in a way humans or even animals can.LeCun uses the example of visualising a cube rotating in space. Humans can effortlessly imagine its orientation and predict its movement. Current LLMs, however, cannot replicate this type of spatial reasoning or sensory understanding. This insight underlines the importance of the new generation of AI startups, including Project Prometheus, which aim to build systems capable of interacting with and learning from the real world.","Jeff Bezos is returning to an executive role as co-CEO of the AI startup Project Prometheus.

CEO Tim Cook now leads Apple's design team





The designer who unveiled Apple's iPhone Air has left the company for an artificial intelligence startup, marking another significant departure from the iPhone maker’s design division. Abidur Chowdhury, who spent over six years at Apple and played a key role in developing the ultra-thin iPhone Air, has reportedly joined an unnamed AI firm as per Bloomberg.Chowdhury's departure created ripples internally given his rising prominence within the design team. He earned visibility by narrating the iPhone Air's two-minute design video during Apple's September launch event—a high-profile assignment reserved for distinguished employees. His exit comes as Apple's design group undergoes a sweeping transformation following Jony Ive's 2019 departure.The designer's exit has nothing to do with the iPhone Air's underwhelming market performance, Bloomberg reports. Apple had anticipated the device would account for 6% to 8% of new iPhone sales, roughly matching the iPhone 16 Plus it replaced. Despite earning design accolades, the $100 savings compared to the iPhone 17 Pro hasn't swayed buyers who prioritize battery longevity and camera quality.Despite rumors of discontinuation due to poor sales, a second-generation iPhone Air remains on track for 2027—not 2026 as Bloomberg reports.The update will center on upgrading to a 2-nanometer chip to improve battery performance, the current model's primary shortcoming, rather than introducing dramatic design changes.Apple's design division has experienced accelerating turbulence throughout 2025. Jeff Williams, the longtime chief operating officer who had overseen the design team since 2023, departed last week after decades with the company. In a significant organizational shift, design teams now report directly to CEO Tim Cook, bypassing traditional operational hierarchies, Bloomberg noted.The user interface division under Alan Dye has faced similar upheaval with multiple high-profile departures. Since Ive left in 2019 to establish his design firm LoveFrom—which was later acquired by OpenAI—most veteran designers have either retired or joined competitors, including some who followed Ive to his new venture.Today's design team bears little resemblance to the group that created iconic products under Steve Jobs and Ive.

MacKenzie Scott, ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , is one of the world's most generous philanthropists. Since her divorce from Bezos in 2019, Scott has given away $19.25 billion through her philanthropic platform Yield Giving, making her one of the most prolific donors of the past five years. She has now revealed the reason why she has been donating her wealth to underserved communities. Notably, despite reducing her Amazon stake by 42% through sales and donations, she remains worth more than $35 billion today.Scott’s acts of kindness she received as a struggling college student has inspired her decision to donate billions from her Amazon stake to charitable causes.In an essay published recently on her Yield Giving website, Scott traced her philanthropic motivations back to moments of financial desperation during her Princeton University years, when the generosity of others made the difference between continuing her education and dropping out.“It is these ripple effects that make imagining the power of any of our own acts of kindness impossible,” Scott wrote, adding, “Whose generosity did I think of every time I made every one of the thousands of gifts I've been able to give?”Scott recalled two pivotal moments: a local dentist who offered free dental work after seeing her secure a broken tooth with denture glue, and her college roommate who found her crying and acted on her urge to loan her $1,000.“It was the local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college. It was the college roommate who found me crying, and acted on her urge to loan me a thousand dollars to keep me from having to drop out in my sophomore year,” she said.According to a report by Fortune, that roommate was Jeannie Ringo Tarkenton, who witnessed firsthand how her $1,000 gift transformed Scott's trajectory. The experience inspired Tarkenton to found Funding U twenty years later, a company that offers loans to low-income students without requiring a cosigner.After her divorce from Bezos in 2019, Scott received roughly a 4% stake in Amazon – about 139 million shares at the time – which she had earned from helping build the e-commerce giant during its early days, when she assisted with business plans and contracts.""The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track,"" Scott wrote in the blog.Since 2020, Scott has sold or donated approximately 58 million shares, reducing her stake by 42%. Through Yield Giving, which she founded in 2022, she has donated to thousands of organisations focused on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), education, disaster recovery, and other critical issues.","MacKenzie Scott, ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is one of the world's most generous philanthropists.

US Judge allows Elon Musk’s antitrust case to proceed





An X (formerly Twitter) user recently suggested that Apple should ‘dump’ OpenAI’s AI chatbot ChatGPT and replace it with Grok 4.1 to ‘fix’ Siri. Elon Musk responded to the post signalling his willingness for xAI-Apple collaboration. “It’s time for Apple to team up with xAI and actually fix Siri”, X Freeze @XFreeze – followed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk – wrote on X. “Replace that outdated, painfully dumb assistant with Grok 4. Siri deserves to be Superintelligent,” the user further added.While the idea contrasts xAI's ongoing lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI for alleged AI market collusion, Musk replied to the post saying ""I’m down"" hinting his openness to a possible xAI–Apple collaboration.For those unaware, Grok 4.1 debuted on November 17, 2025.

The lawsuit accuses both companies of working together to control the markets for smartphones and AI chatbots.According to Reuters, US District Judge Mark Pittman said that Musk’s companies — the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) and the AI startup xAI — can continue with their case for now. He also noted that this decision should not be taken as a view on whether the claims are true. The judge said he will examine the facts and evidence at a later stage.In the lawsuit, Musk’s companies argue that Apple violated antitrust laws by making ChatGPT the exclusive AI model for Apple Intelligence features on the iPhone and other Apple devices. The filing also claims that Apple’s partnership with OpenAI unfairly blocked competing services.The companies further allege that Apple strengthened ChatGPT’s position by promoting it on its “Must-Have Apps” list, while reducing visibility for rival apps in the App Store.",US Judge allows Elon Musk’s antitrust case to proceed against Apple and OpenAI.

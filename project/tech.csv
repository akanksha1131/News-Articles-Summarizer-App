Microsoft and Amazon together take out a full-page ad; pointing to 'emergency' in Washington that they say: 'Threatens to ...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-and-amazon-together-take-out-a-full-page-ad-pointing-to-emergency-in-washington-that-they-say-threatens-to-/articleshow/127521492.cms,"""Root cause of the crisis""

'Message and warning' to policy makers





Microsoft and Amazon are two of the biggest rivals. The two companies compete in the Cloud, with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The two fight for customers as well sometimes for talent. However, a 'crisis' in America's Washington State has brought the two together. The two companies -- Microsoft and Amazon -- recently took out a full-page ad and wrote an Op-Ed in The Seattle Times on the Washington state’s housing crisis.The Op-Ed titled 'WA must make it easier to build our way out of the housing crisis' was jointly written by Microsoft president Brad Smith; and Amazon’s chief global affairs and legal officer David Zapolsky. The Seattle region “faces a housing emergency that threatens our state’s quality of life, health and economic competitiveness. Each year over the past decade, affordability has declined, commutes have lengthened and our region’s ability to attract and retain talent has been put at greater risk. For some, the impact is even more serious,"" wrote Microsoft and Amazon's top execs.Talking about Microsoft and Amazon's contribution to deal with the crisis, Op-Ed says, ""As leaders at Amazon and Microsoft, we’ve helped advance unprecedented community-focused investments to address the shortage of affordable housing in our home state.Together, our two companies have committed $1.6 billion to preserve and build more than 26,000 affordable homes, benefiting the communities we live, serve and operate in. Not for our employees, but the entire community.""""The lack of affordable housing is a complex problem. But its roots are straightforward. We simply don’t have enough housing today, and we need to build more homes of all kinds. This is a supply-side problem at its core. The best estimates predict the state will need 1 million additional housing units over the next 20 years, or 50,000 per year. While our companies’ collective efforts helped spur more investment, last year’s permit applications in Puget Sound suggest that the pace of construction is slowing down. In other words, the hole we’re in as a region is at risk of getting deeper,"" said the Op-Ed on the root cause of the crisis.“Going forward, legislators must commit to a simple test: If a policy makes housing more costly or takes longer to build, don’t pass it. Consider an alternative,” they write. “Enact policies that pencil in today’s market, not aspirational measures that might work down the line.” They warn that other states are moving faster to attract developers. “Capital is fluid,” they write. “Banks, investors and lenders are going where they can make predictable returns. ”","Microsoft and Amazon are two of the biggest rivals.

CEOs & Founders resigning from their own startups?

This is not failure, this is maturity

For years Indian founders believed CEO = Founder = CEO

That idea is outdated

Startups today are growing faster than founders can grow as managers, what works at 10 people breaks at 100 & what works at 100 breaks at 1000

Most founders are great at 0 to 1 and 1 to 10

But beyond a certain growth curve, companies need a different skill set

In global markets this is encouraged, founders step aside and professional CEOs step in

The company wins, the founder still owns the upside & most times, shareholders are better off.

In India we dramatize this as ‘fired’, ‘failure’ & even ‘fraud’

Most of the time it is none of that

I think making oneself replaceable should be one of the key goals of every founder.

That is how companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft became enduring giants.

Often, it is simply the founder choosing what is best for the company



","CEOs & Founders resigning from their own companies is not a new phenomenon. It is a sign of maturity and a sign that the company is on the right track, says Anil Agrawal, founder and CEO of a start-up company in India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127489837,imgsize-190988,width-400,resizemode-4/anupam-mittal.jpg"

Tiktok app is reportedly down in the US. Thousands of people are reporting problems with the TikTok app Sunday morning. According to the DownDetector website, which tracks websites uptime, outage reports peaked overnight with more than 35,000. Some 65% users showed problem with the app not working properly, 23% reported total outage and some 13% claimed facing issues with their Tiktok feed. TikTok has so far not officially acknowledged the outage.The outage comes just days after TikTok finalised its deal to create a new American entity, avoiding the threat of a ban in the United States. Earlier this week, TikTok announced that its Chinese owner, ByteDance, had struck a deal with a group of non-Chinese investors to create a new US TikTok. The deal concluded a six-year legal saga that saw the app banned by Congress and ensnared in politicking between two global superpowers.Investors including software giant Oracle; MGX, an Emirati investment firm; and Silver Lake, another investment firm, will own more than 80% of the new venture. That list also includes the personal investment entity for Dell founder Michael Dell, and other companies, TikTok said.Adam Presser, TikTok’s former head of operations, will be the CEO for the US TikTok.Under the new arrangement, Oracle, MGX and Silver Lake will each own 15% of TikTok’s US operations. ByteDance will own just under 20%. The other investors include Dell’s office and a long list of investment companies, including affiliates of General Atlantic and Susquehanna, both of which previously invested in ByteDance. The majority of the seven-member board for US TikTok will be American, according to a December memo to TikTok employees.The deal is aimed to loosen TikTok’s ties to China and address national security concerns that Beijing could use the app to surveil or manipulate its more than 200 million users in the United States. The changes enable “our U.S. users to continue to discover, create, and thrive as part of TikTok’s vibrant global community and experience,” Shou Chew, TikTok’s CEO, said in an internal memo that called the move “great news. ” Chew has a seat on the board of US Tiktok.US President Donald Trump celebrated the announcement in a post on Truth Social, the social media platform he owns, calling it a “dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion.” “I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok!” he wrote, adding, “I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok.”(developing story)","Outage comes days after TikTok finalised its deal to create a new American entity.

Meta replies, calls lawsuit ‘frivolous’ and ‘absurd’





An international group of plaintiffs has reportedly filed a class-action lawsuit against Meta-owned WhatsApp, accusing the company of defrauding billions of users by allegedly maintaining ‘backdoor’ access to private communications that the company claims are ""end-to-end encryption"" (E2EE). Filed in the US District Court for Northern California, the lawsuit challenges Meta’s marketing of E2EE feature, a security standard which the company claims protects the messages on the app and ensures only the sender and recipient can read a message.According to a report by Bloomberg, the lawsuit claims that Meta’s privacy claims are false as the company WhatsApp “store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp users’ purportedly ‘private’ communications”. The plaintiffs represented users from India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico and South Africa. The suit also alleges that the company retains the ability to decrypt and review the substance of messages for data analysis and internal monitoring.Meta has responded to the allegations and says that the lawsuit on the basis of WhatsApp claims is “frivolous” and “absurd.” Company spokesperson Andy Stone confirmed that Meta will seek legal sanctions against the plaintiffs’ counsel for bringing the case forward.“Any claim that people’s WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false. WhatsApp has been end-to-end encrypted using the Signal protocol for a decade. This lawsuit is a frivolous work of fiction,"" Stone said in an emailed statement to the publication.If the court certifies the class-action status, Meta may face unprecedented liability given WhatsApp’s user base of over 2 billion people.","A group of users from India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico and South Africa have filed a class-action lawsuit against Meta-owned WhatsApp. The lawsuit challenges Meta’s marketing of E2EE feature, a security standard which the company claims protects the messages on the app and ensures only the sender and recipient can read a message.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127482079,imgsize-11206,width-400,resizemode-4/whatsapp.jpg"
Researchers say Russian military intelligence hackers may be behind December cyberattacks in Poland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/researchers-say-russian-military-intelligence-hackers-may-be-behind-december-cyberattacks-in-poland/articleshow/127480442.cms,"Hackers used 'DynoWiper' malware to attack Polish energy system







Researchers have linked the massive, multi-pronged cyberattack on Poland’s power grid in late December to hackers linked to Russian military intelligence. As per a report by cybersecurity firm ESET (via news agency Reuters), the attempted operation is being described as one of the most aggressive digital assaults on the country in a decade as it tried to knock down the country’s critical energy infrastructure during the final week of the year.As per the report, the researchers identified the group as Sandworm, an elite unit within Russia’s GRU (military intelligence) with a history of launching some of the world's most destructive cyber operations.According to the findings, the hackers attempted to deploy a new strain of malware dubbed DynoWiper which has been designed to act as a “wiper” – a type of malicious code in a software that systematically destroys files and erases data on targeted systems, effectively rendering the power grid’s control hardware inoperable.Polish authorities and ESET researchers confirmed that despite the severity of the attempt, the attack failed. This is in line with earlier statements from Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who declared earlier this month that the nation's defenses successfully repelled the intrusion.“We’re not aware of any successful disruption occurring as a result of this attack,” ESET stated in its analysis.The timing of the assault was noted as a symbolic “anniversary strike” by the Slovakia-based researchers. Interestingly, the December attempt to down the power system occurred exactly ten years after Sandworm carried out a historic attack on the Ukrainian power grid. The operation in 2015 resulted in the first-ever malware-facilitated blackout in history, leaving hundreds of thousands of people in the dark.","Hackers used 'DynoWiper' malware to attack Polish energy system in late December.

I left Meta because…: Yann LeCun clarifies why he quit





Yann LeCun, former Chief AI Scientist at Meta and the “Godfather of AI”, has crticised the Silicon Valley giants, describing the industry as “LLM-pilled”. He warned that LeCun warned that the talent war between tech giants where they are hiring AI researchers is being used as a strategic weapon to stifle innovation as they are doing the same thing.“The AI industry is completely LLM-pilled, as they say. And in Silicon Valley, everybody is working on the same thing. They're all digging the same trench. They are stealing each other's engineers so that they they can't afford to do something different, because if they start going on the tangent. They're all doing the same thing,” he said in a talk whose video is being shared on the social media.His comments came following his departure from Meta. Not just AI talent war, LeCun also critcised the AI industry's overreliance on large language models (LLMs), noting that this is not enough to build superintelligence. LeCun said that even Meta’s engineers were also chasing the same narrow path, which prompted him tio quit and found a lab focused on predictive “world models.”“And it's one big reason I left meta, right, because Meta also became very LLM-pilled. You know with sort of recent research thing, and it's fine, you know, it's a strategic decision that I cannot imagine that we can build agentic systems without those systems having an ability to predict in advance, what the consequences of their actions are going to be,” he said.He pointed out that a true agentic system – one that can take decisions on your behalf – cannot be build if it does not have the ability to predict the consequences, and that is not possible with LLMs.“We cannot build true agentic systems without the ability to predict the consequences of actions, just like humans do. Is that we know that we can predict the consequence? Consequences of our actions. And that's where it allows us to plan,” he noted.LeCun’s exit from Meta appears to be the result of a massive internal restructuring. In June 2025, Mark Zuckerberg launched Meta Superintelligence Labs, a $14.3 billion project led by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang.","Yann LeCun, former Chief AI Scientist at Meta and the “Godfather of AI”, has crticised the Silicon Valley giants.

Sridhar Vembu: Engineering discipline matters

“I suggest the term ""AI-assisted Code Engineering"" with ACE as the acronym instead of ""vibe-coding"". We must have solid engineering discipline and ACE is the maturation of the tools and techniques”.

“It does not eliminate all software engineers but enables experienced engineers who ACE well to be much more productive,” he said, adding “It is also going to reshape our industry but that is a separate topic.”



What is vibe coding







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has suggested a new way to describe vibe-coding, a word that became one of the biggest “headache” of engineers in 2025. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Vembu argued that the termdoes not reflect the discipline required in real engineering work. He said that he prefers a new termto describe the growing use of AI tools in writing and maintaining software. In the post, Vembu said the focus should remain on solid engineering practices, even as AI becomes more deeply embedded in coding workflows.Sharing the post, Sridhar Vembu wrote:Vembu says that the term ACE does not remove the need for software engineers. Instead, it allows experienced engineers to “be much more productive”.Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming. It refers to building apps and websites by chatting with AI instead of writing code line by painstaking line.Vembu’s comments come at a time when AI-powered coding tools are being widely adopted by developers and companies to speed up software development. His remarks also highlight concerns among industry leaders that such language may underplay the importance of structure, accountability, and long-term reliability in software systems.Collins Dictionary named “vibe-coding” as its word of the year for 2025.","Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming.

""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

What Tim Cook means by “loving museums”



Apple CEO Tim Cook (Image source: Bloomberg)

“I don’t want to live in one”: A warning against stagnation



A lesson in leadership and decision-making



Why the quote resonates beyond technology



A reflection of Tim Cook’s leadership style



Why the quote still matters



""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

,





Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple , doesn't give long speeches or use dramatic slogans. When he does say something, it's usually short, to the point, and well thought out. One of these lines is his quote:. The sentence is easy to understand, like a conversation. But it has a deeper meaning about how to move forward, how to be a leader, and how businesses and people should plan for the future.The quote is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Museums are places where history is kept. They keep ideas, inventions, and events that changed the world. They help us remember where we came from. Tim Cook has never said that we should forget or ignore history. Instead, he says that it is dangerous to get too comfortable with it.In today's world, where things change quickly, especially in technology, staying still can cost you a lot. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.Museums are very important to society. They keep culture, new ideas, and human accomplishments safe. Future generations would lose touch with the ideas and work that shaped the past if there were no museums. Tim Cook saying ""love"" shows that he cares. He thinks it's important to learn from the past. He likes what has already been made.Apple has a long and well-known history. People often study and admire the company's past innovations, which include the Macintosh, the iPod, and the iPhone. A lot of these items are now on display in museums and exhibitions all over the world. Cook knows more about this legacy than most people.But liking someone doesn't mean you care about them. His quote makes it clear that history is important to learn about, but it shouldn't be a place where you want to stay, especially in an industry driven by constant innovation, progress, and forward-looking thinking.The second part of the quote is where the real meaning is. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. It means comfort, safety, and familiarity. That comfort can slowly turn into stagnation in business and leadership.Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. The markets change. Technology changes. People's needs change. What worked ten years ago might not work anymore. Businesses that only care about keeping their legacy alive often have a hard time staying relevant.Apple has kept changing under Cook's leadership. The business has grown into services, put more emphasis on user privacy, put money into protecting the environment, and moved into new areas like custom silicon chips. These choices show that the company is willing to try new things, even if the old ones worked.The quote is true for all leaders, not just Apple. People often praise leaders for their past successes, using previous wins as proof of future capability and judgement. People trust you more when you have done well in the past. But depending too much on past success can keep you from coming up with new ideas or recognising when the environment has fundamentally shifted.Cook's words make it sound like good leadership needs to be balanced. You can learn from history, but don't let it tell you what to do all the time. Don't let your past experiences tell you what to do. This method lets businesses change instead of fighting it, allowing innovation to emerge naturally rather than defensively.This idea also works for people. Careers, skills, and fields of work change over time. It can be harder to grow if you hold on too tightly to what used to work. The quote quietly encourages people to be open and curious, even when change is hard, uncertain, or uncomfortable at first.This quote stands out because it is so simple. It doesn't use business jargon or technical language. People can all understand it. Most people know how nice it is to stick to their routines and how hard it is to try something new.In a more general sense, the quote talks about how societies deal with progress. Tradition and new ideas often clash with each other. It's important to respect culture and history, but it's also important to be open to new things. Cook's statement does not deny the past. It just won't let itself be limited by it.This balance is especially important now that technology is changing quickly and making people wonder about jobs, education, and social structures. The quote tells people that progress doesn't mean forgetting the past; it means building on it in a smart way.People often say that Tim Cook is calm, level-headed, and practical. His way of leading is different from Steve Jobs's, who was known for making bold and dramatic statements. Cook does things in a quieter way. His words are more likely to make you think than to make you angry, reflecting patience, consistency, ethical decision-making, and a long-term focus rather than short-term applause, values that align closely with Apple’s culture and leadership philosophy.This quote fits that pattern. It doesn't need attention. It makes you think. It gives a point of view without making people agree. That restraint is one reason it feels real.The quote doesn't give a big picture; it gives a way of thinking. It talks about how Cook sees progress, responsibility, and long-term success.is still true because it describes a problem that everyone faces. How can we remember the past without letting it control us? How do we go on without losing what matters?It's clear but not obvious what Tim Cook means. Value history. Take something away from it. Then decide to go on.In one short sentence, the CEO of Apple reminds us that we can choose to make progress. It takes work, curiosity, and a willingness to go beyond what you already know. Museums keep the past alive. But the future is being built somewhere else.","Tim Cook's quote has a deeper meaning about how to move forward.

Deepinder Goyal has tendered his resignation as Director, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company, effective close of business on February 1, 2026.

Albinder Singh Dhindsa has been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company with effect from February 1, 2026. Further, the Board of Directors (“Board”) recommended the appointment of Deepinder Goyal as the Director and Vice Chairman of the Board, effective upon shareholders' approval.

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.""

Read Deepinder Goyal's full letter that he sent to shareholders

“Dear Shareholders,

Today, I am going to step away from the Group CEO role, and subject to shareholders' approval, will remain on the board of directors as Vice Chairman.

Albinder Dhindsa

(Albi) will be Eternal's new Group CEO.

Why this change

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.

This transition allows Eternal to remain sharply focused, while giving me the space to explore ideas that do not fit Eternal's risk profile.

What doesn't change

I have spent eighteen years, almost half my life, building this company. I will continue doing that.

Albi, Akshant, and I will continue to work closely together, as we always have. Our partnership, shared context, and trust remain unchanged. All our business CEOs will continue operating with the autonomy they have always had.

My involvement in long-term strategy, culture, leadership development, and ethics and governance, continues. This is where I have increasingly focused lately anyway.

What changes

The centre of gravity for operating decisions moves to Albi.

As Group CEO, he will own day-to-day execution, operating priorities, and business decisions.

Blinkit's journey from acquisition to breakeven happened under his leadership.

He built the team, the culture, the supply chain, the operating rhythm. He has the DNA of a battle-hardened founder and his ability to execute far exceeds mine. He is more than capable of leading Eternal as Group CEO.

Blinkit remains our largest growth opportunity and will remain as Albi's top priority. Our decentralized structure, where each business has a CEO with full ownership, continues unchanged - and will help Albi execute this well.

On alignment and ESOPs

My financial future remains meaningfully tied to Eternal, and my incentives remain aligned with long-term shareholder value creation.

As part of this transition, all of my unvested ESOPs will revert to the ESOP pool. This ensures that Eternal continues to have meaningful wealth-creation opportunities for its next generation of leaders, while strengthening long-term retention without incremental shareholder dilution.

Looking ahead

Eighteen years ago, the idea that a menu scanning company could be worth tens of billions of dollars, provide livelihoods to hundreds of thousands of people, and serve millions of families daily would have seemed absurd. We helped prove it was possible. And there's a lot in store for Eternal to do over the next few decades.

I believe Eternal is not going to lose focus or momentum through this change. Rather, it is reinforcing its institutional strength.

And personally, I gain the flexibility to explore ideas that sit outside Eternal's scope, without compromising the company's priorities.

I want Eternal to become India's most valuable company. I want us to serve a billion customers. I want us to create the most positive impact on society. I want us to be the source of livelihoods for millions of Indians. None of that changes.

This is a change in title, not in commitment towards outcomes. Eternal remains my life's work.

Thank you for your continued trust and support.

Deepinder Goyal”

When White House called Amazon's tariff plan an 'hostile act'





In April 2025, a pissed Donald Trump made a call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after learning that the company is planning to display the added cost of tariffs on certain items. Trump made the call to Bezos to complain about reports that Amazon was considering to highlight the cost of US tariffs next to prices for certain products on the company’s website. Trump later told reporters about the call to Amazon founder and said it was a “good call.” “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump told reporters. “He solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.”Punchbowl News first reported that Amazon will soon “display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs — right next to the product’s total listed price.” The move came after Trump slapped 145% tariffs on imports from China and a 10% minimum tax on all other countries.Now months later, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC in an interview Jassy at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Amazon.com is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures stemming from the US President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""We did a lot of pre-buying in the early part of 2025 to enable us to try and keep prices as low as possible for customers,"" Jassy said.He added, ""And a lot of our third-party sellers did a lot of forward-staging in our fulfillment network for the same reasons. And that supply is run out in the fall, so you start to see some of the tariffs creep in to some of the prices, some of the items.""""Some third-party sellers are raising prices in response while others are absorbing the costs in hopes of driving more demand,"" Jassy went on to add. ""Our priority is to try to figure out how to keep prices low as possible,"" Jassy said. ""At a certain point, because retail is a mid-single-digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it.""The warning marks a shift from the Amazon leader's commentary on tariffs last year. While he cautioned in April that third-party sellers could need to pass along tariff costs, he said on several occasions that Amazon had not seen selling prices appreciably rise from tariffs. ""Amazon's consumers overall have fared well. But we'll have to see what happens in 2026,"" CEO Jassy had said.The company has also maintained so far that over the past year it was seeing very little impact on consumer behavior and product prices from tariffs. It has doubled down on expanding product categories and speeding up delivery timelines to shield demand.In April 2025, at a briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the move a “hostile and political act,” adding that she had spoken about the matter with President Trump earlier. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Levitt’s comments, saying it’s a hostile act if a company goes out of its way to “make it seem” like tariffs have caused prices to change.“It’s nonsense,” he said Tuesday in a CNBC interview. “A 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price,” he added, referring to the nearly universal baseline tariff on all countries. “The only price will change would be a product that we don’t make here, like a mango.” The 10% tariff, however, is hardly the only one in effect.",Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the company is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Satya Nadella said it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.

Debate at Davos



Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid







Palantir CEO Alex Karp has now issued a stark warning about the future of work in the age of artificial intelligence. Karp predicted that humanities-based jobs will now be among the first casualties. As reported by Business Insider, speaking during a panel at the World Economic Forum, Karp revealed that his own academic background which is a philosophy degree from Haverford College, a law degree from Stanford, and a Ph.D. in social theory from Germany, cautioned that such qualifications may no longer be viable. “AI will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp said. “You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market.”Karp believes that workers with technical and vocational training will be in then highest demand. He quoted battery manufacturing as an exampple, nothing that technicians in such industries are “very valuable, if not irreplaceable.” “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” Karp told BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who moderated the discussion.Not all leaders at Davos agreed with Karp’s assessment. Finance executives told Business Insider that liberal arts degrees may actually become more valuable, as AI takes over routine financial analysis. Critical and creative thinking, they argued, is increasingly prized in young recruits.Meanwhile, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei highlighted another trend: entry-level hiring is already declining due to AI. Amodei said software and coding roles at Anthropic were down across junior and mid-level positions.Recently, Karp said that value of skilled workers is rising. Speaking on TBPN, a tech talk show broadcast live from Palantir’s customer conference, AIP Con 8, Karp said, “Workers become more valuable. The person at the top is actually crazy valuable. People with technical expertise are crazy valuable."" His words underscore a trend that’s become increasingly apparent in Silicon Valley: in a world awash with automation and AI, human expertise, especially deep technical skill, has become a rare commodity.Karp calls these individuals “artist-shaped people,” a nod to the company’s unique culture, sometimes referred to internally as “an artist colony.” He added, “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid.”. The statement doesn’t just reflect Palantir’s philosophy; it mirrors the market reality, where top AI researchers and engineers have recently netted unprecedented paydays, sometimes reaching hundreds of millions, while thousands of others were laid off from companies like Microsoft and Meta.","Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid. “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid,” he said.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event

Background of Siri privacy lawsuit





iPhone users in the United States have started receiving payments from Apple’s USD 95 million settlement linked to a class action lawsuit over Siri privacy. The payouts began this week, according to multiple users who reported receiving direct deposits. The settlement relates to claims that Apple’s Siri voice assistant recorded conversations without user intent. Apple agreed to settle the case last year, while denying any wrongdoing. Apple accepted users' claims in mid-2025. As per a 9to5Mac report, eligible users who filed on time are now seeing funds deposited into their bank accounts or payment apps. Others who chose alternative payment options are still waiting to receive their settlement amounts.The lawsuit dates back to concerns raised in 2019 about unintended Siri activations. To qualify for the settlement, users had to own at least one Siri-enabled Apple device between September 17, 2014, and December 31, 2024. They also needed to claim that Siri activated without their intent during that period.Each claimant was allowed to submit claims for up to five devices. While the total settlement amount was USD 95 million, the final payout per device is lower than earlier estimates.Initial projections suggested users could receive up to USD 20 per device, with a maximum payout of USD 100. However, settlement administrators later calculated that actual payments would be about USD 8.02 per device, with a maximum of USD 40.10 for users who claimed the full five devices.Users who selected direct deposit have begun receiving payments. Those who opted for prepaid gift cards or paper checks are expected to receive them by email or mail. Settlement administrators have advised users to check spam folders and physical mailboxes.The case began after a 2019 report by The Guardian revealed that Apple contractors reviewing Siri recordings for quality control could hear private conversations. Apple said that fewer than one percent of Siri interactions were reviewed and that recordings were not linked to user identities.Apple later changed its policies, requiring users to opt in to Siri recording reviews and ending the use of outside contractors for this work. The lawsuit focused mainly on claims that Siri could activate by mistake, leading to recordings of conversations users did not intend to share.Apple has said that Siri recordings were never used for advertising and were not tied to Apple accounts. The company settled the case to move forward while continuing to deny the allegations.","Siri settlement relates to claims that Apple’s Siri voice assistant recorded conversations without user intent.

Risks for the middle class





Kristalina Georgieva the managing director of International Monetary Fund has issued a warning that artificial intelligence could transform or eliminate up to 60% of jobs in advanced economies and 40% globally. She described AI technology as a ‘tsunami’ hitting the labour market. As reported by Fortune, Speaking on the closing day of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Georgieva acknowledged the disruptive potential of AI but also pointed to a possible silver lining for the low-wage workers.Georgieva argued that productivity gains from AI, which disproportionately benefit high earners, could spill over into the broader economy. As AI-enhanced professionals earn more, their increased spending power boosts demand for local services such as restaurants, retail, and healthcare. “One in 10 jobs is already enhanced by AI, and the people in these jobs are paid better. When they’re paid better, they spend more money in the local economy. Demand for low-skilled jobs goes up,” Georgieva said.Studies back this view: research in San Francisco found that for each new tech job created, 4.4 additional local service jobs emerged, ranging from cooks to teachers.Despite the potential benefits for low-wage earners, Georgieva cautioned that the middle class faces an increasing pressure. Job not improved by AI risk stagnating wages, while entry-level positions are being eroded by automation, creating barriers for young workers. She described this dynamic as an “accordion of opportunities” — expanding for some, contracting for others.These labor shifts come amid fragile global conditions. The IMF recently upgraded its global growth forecast from 3.1% to 3.3%, but Georgieva warned that growth remains “not strong enough” to manage soaring sovereign debt, now near 100% of GDP, while also funding the massive technological transition AI demands.Georgieva closed with a stark message: “Wake up. AI is for real and it is transforming our world faster than we are getting a handle.” She urged governments and institutions to build inclusive guardrails to ensure the AI revolution does not leave the middle class and developing nations behind.",Kristalina Georgieva the managing director of International Monetary Fund has issued a warning that artificial intelligence could transform or eliminate up to 60% of jobs in advanced economies and 40% globally.

When your customer starts finding almost as many bugs as you found yourself, you're not leading into the right place,""

“For me this is the inflection point. This is where the Apple guys who were always contemplating switching, they went and looked at it and said: 'Well, we've probably got to do it.' Basically the bad quality assurance of Skylake is responsible for them to actually go away from the platform,”

Salesforce CEO compares unregulated AI to the ‘dangerous’ social media days







Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has issued a warning to the global technology industry. He has urged for an immediate regulation of artificial intelligence (AI), arguing that an unregulated AI technology can harm children, and regulation can prevent a repeat of the ‘social media failures’ that he says have harmed an entire generation.Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2026 in Davos, Switzerland, Benioff took a more balanced his role as a leader of an AI-driven company. While he described AI as a technology that’s powerful but “dangerous”, he also called for strict guardrails to protect children from it.“AI needs guardrails – evidence now proves kids must be protected, unlike social media’s failures. AI fuels our global growth, but not at any cost – we must protect kids, unlike the social media’s failures,” Benioff said in a post on X. He reshared a clip from his Bloomberg interview which he gave on the sidelines of WEF 2026.Benioff drew a direct parallel between the current unregulated state of AI and the early days of social media. He recalled his 2018 warnings, noting that government took concrete steps and it took them years to implement age restrictions and parental controls.“We're letting all of this AI technology out fully unregulated. And, by the way, you remember, that's true what we did with social media as well, and you probably remember what I said in 2018.here, you know, which was social media was becoming the same kind of very dangerous technology. And look, a lot of governments have made changes around social media now, so you go to a lot of countries,” Benioff said.“If you're not 17-18 years old, you're not going to use social media. There are controls. There are protections we need to get there with. There doesn't need to be any more deaths, you know,” he warned.While talking about hallucinations, Benioff pointed out that the technical instabilities make the technology particularly risky for younger users. Generative AI models are prone to “hallucinations”, which means they generate entirely false or inappropriate information in a very confident manner. He also acknowledged that “AI is great” and “incredible”.“We need to be like taking this seriously, and AI is great. It's incredible, but these models, you know, they're inaccurate. They hallucinate. They're kind of hard to control,” Benioff noted. The billionaire executive’s comments come at a time when Salesforce is aggressively integrating AI into its core business. He says the move is driving success but insists it must not come “at any cost.”",Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff compares unregulated AI to the ‘dangerous’ social media days.

This new agent takes autonomous action, managing files and browser tasks, unlike previous AI assistants. The move signals Anthropic's expansion into everyday user tools, aiming to simplify tedious tasks for a broader audience.

“It was just kind of obvious that Cowork is the next step.

""Claude in Chrome""

“Engineers just feel unshackled, that they don't have to work on all the tedious stuff anymore. We're starting to hear this for Cowork also, where people are saying all this tedious stuff—shuffling data between spreadsheets, integrating Slack and Salesforce, organizing your emails—it just does it so you can focus on the work you actually want to do,”

""a very intense product market fit across the different enterprise spaces,""

“prompt injections,”

“quite innovative.”

“Agent safety—that is, the task of securing Claude's real-world actions—is still an active area of development in the industry,”

“For Anthropic, we're an enterprise AI company. We build consumer products, but for us, really, the focus is enterprise,”





Anthropic has recently launched a file management artificial intelligence (AI) agent named Cowork, designed for non-programmers. The AI startup developed this new tool after users revealed they were using its developer-focused Claude Code tool for general tasks beyond coding. According to Boris Cherny, head of Claude Code at Anthropic, the company built the new product in roughly a week and a half, primarily using Claude Code itself. The move represents Anthropic's expansion beyond its traditional software developer user base into tools for everyday users who want AI assistance with file and task management.In an interview with Fortune, Cherny said,Cowork differs from earlier general-use AI tools from Anthropic through its ability to take autonomous action rather than simply provide advice. The tool can access files, control browsers through theextension, and even manipulate applications by executing tasks rather than just suggesting how to do them. For some general users, it's the first experience of what agentic AI can deliver.Many of the uses are mundane, but they do save users hours. Cherny says he uses Cowork for project management, automatically messaging team members on Slack when they haven't updated shared spreadsheets. He has also heard of use cases, including one researcher deploying it to comb through museum archives for basketry collections.Cherny told Fortune.What is Claude Code and why is it so popular among other usersAnthropic created a developer assistant tool named Claude Code, which was released in February 2024. They surprised everyone by attracting an audience outside their target group, software engineers. The coding tool surprised everyone by receiving a lot of publicity.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called it antool and encouraged companies to try it out. The tool took just an hour to replicate a year's worth of work, according to a senior engineer at Google.Users of this tool have been people without programming knowledge who used it for tasks such as buying theater tickets, paying taxes, and keeping track of their tomato plants. The tool was even widely used at Microsoft for its main engineering groups despite its creators selling other similar things, such as GitHub Copilot. Moreover, people without development knowledge use it too.Uber, Netflix, Spotify, Salesforce, Accenture, and Snowflake now use Claude Code. The product has foundCherny noted.Anthropic has also seen a surge in traffic after Claude Code went viral: Claude’s total web audience has more than doubled since December 2024, and global daily desktop visitors are up 12% year-to-date, according to Similarweb and Sensor Tower data reported via The Wall Street Journal.Still, both software face security threats, such asin which criminals embed malicious code into web pages to control AI responses. Anthropic has developed layers of security for Cowork, such as operating it in a virtual machine with additional delete protection after a user erroneously deletes files, something Cherny says isAnthropic even warned in its announcement.Despite these consumer-friendly tools, Anthropic is positioning both Claude Code and Cowork for the enterprise market, where the company reportedly leads OpenAI in adoption.Cherny added.This strategy aligns with Anthropic's founding mission of AI safety, appealing to corporate customers concerned about security and compliance. The company first developed strong coding capabilities to enable tool use and tested products with technical customers before expanding to general-use applications.","Anthropic has launched Cowork, an AI file manager for non-programmers.

Revenue dipped, missing expectations, and shares fell sharply. The company acknowledged internal missteps in anticipating AI data center CPU demand, with supply issues expected to persist before improving later in spring.

Intel’s turnaround bet faces execution headwinds despite government support





Intel's CEO Lip-Bu Tan addressed investors with a candid admission on Thursday, saying he's ""disappointed that we are not able to fully meet the demand in our markets."" The chip giant reported a fourth-quarter loss of $333 million and warned of further losses ahead as it grapples with supply shortages and heavy spending to ramp up production.The Santa Clara-based company's revenue fell 3.9% year-over-year to $13.7 billion, missing analyst expectations. Intel shares plunged more than 12% in after-hours trading as investors absorbed the disappointing results and a gloomy first-quarter forecast calling for revenue between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion.CFO David Zinsner pointed to ""industrywide supply shortages"" weighing on results, but also acknowledged Intel's own missteps. The company underestimated demand for CPUs from AI data centers, and is now scrambling to purchase equipment to produce more wafers. The supply crunch will worsen in the first quarter before improving later in spring, Zinsner said.Intel's foundry division remains a significant drag, posting billions in losses. CEO Tan called out disappointing fabrication yields—the percentage of usable chips from each wafer—saying improvements are a key goal for 2026.The company also disappointed analysts by providing no updates on customers for its next-generation 14A manufacturing technology, stating it won't invest in factory capacity until securing a customer commitment.Despite recent momentum—Intel shares had surged more than 150% over five months following government investment and a new partnership with Nvidia—the company continues making what analysts call ""unforced errors.""

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella ‘calls out’ Peter Thiel thing: What does this mean,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-calls-out-peter-thiel-thing-what-does-this-mean/articleshow/127449315.cms,"Satya Nadella Recounts 2023 Story Of Indian Farmer Leveraging AI Bot For Subsidies

The 'Peter Thiel Thing' explained





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has offered his take on corporate rivalry at a time when the tech industry is witnessing a high-stakes AI arms race. During a recent discussion on the sidelines of World Economic Forum 2026 in Davos, Switzerland, the tech executive invoked a philosophy by billionaire investor Peter Thiel and connected it with the current state of the industry, suggesting that the key to Microsoft’s success in 2026 is actually becoming less focused on its rivals.Nadella’s comments come at a ""pretty intense time"" for the tech giant, which has seen a growing competition multiple times – also since Nadella joined the firm in 1992. When asked about the increasing competition in the AI-first world, Nadella said he prioristises his thinking about what Microsoft customers want.“The question that I always go back to is what’s the brand identity that Microsoft has and the brand permission we have, what customers expect from us,” Nadella explained.“It's sometimes we kind of overthink somehow that every customer wants the same thing from all of the competitors and finding that out, it's kind of a different take on the Peter Thiel thing, which is, you've got to avoid competition by really understanding what customers really want from you versus thinking everybody is a competitor,” he added.The philosophy Nadella referenced stems from Thiel’s long-standing critique of competition.A co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, Thiel has famously argued in his book Zero to One that ""competition is for losers.""Thiel’s core thinking is that intense competition forces companies to become identical and they fight over margins rather than creating unique value.“When you’re very competitive, you get good at the thing you’re competing with people on... but it comes at the expense of losing out on many other things,” Thiel previously told author Tim Ferriss. He said he asks himself: ""How do I become less competitive in order that I can become more successful?""Satya Nadella says Microsoft is 'blessed' to be in tech industryDespite the “intense” competition from a new set of rivals every decade, Nadella has rejected the “zero-sum” narrative.“It's a pretty intense time. I mean, so the way I always think is, it's always helpful. When you have a complete new set of competitors every decade, because that keeps you fit. If you think about it, I joined Microsoft in 92 when I had Novell as the big existential competitor. Here we are in 2026, it's a pretty intense time. I'm glad there's the competition,” Nadella noted.",Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has offered his take on corporate rivalry at a time when the tech industry is witnessing a high-stakes AI arms race.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp , has announced that it is implementing a global temporary “pause” that will ban the teenagers’ access to its cast of AI characters. The move comes as the social media giant is looking to change its generative AI strategy to prioritise parental oversight and safety controls after pressure from child safety advocates.“In October, we shared that we’re building new tools to give parents more visibility into how their teens use AI, and more control over the AI characters they can interact with. Since then, we’ve started building a new version of AI characters, to give people an even better experience. While we focus on developing this new version, we’re temporarily pausing teens’ access to existing AI characters globally,” Meta said.In an update, the company said that the suspension will take effect in the coming weeks across Meta's entire suite of apps, and will target not only users who have registered with “teen birthdays” but also those accounts that are suspected of belong to minors.

Nvidia director Persis Drell has resigned from the company’s board of directors, says a CNBC report. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Nvidia revealed that Drell, 70, stepped down to pursue a “new professional opportunity”. The exit was not because of a disagreement with the company or any matter related to its operations or policies.Drell is an engineering professor at Stanford and worked with Nvidia for over a decade. She served on the compensation committee and is the first Nvidia board member to depart since astronaut Ellen Ochoa resigned in June last year.Nvidia’s board now has 10 directors, including CEO Jensen Huang.As per the latest holdings report, Drell owns nearly 143,000 Nvidia shares, worth about $26 million. She was paid about $344,000 for her work with Nvidia in 2025, including almost $259,000 in stock awards.In a related news, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attended the World Economic Forum 2026 in Davos, Switzerland. Speaking at the forum, Huang declared that the massive infrastructure required to power the AI data centres will transform traditional 'blue-collar' jobs into six-figure careers. He argued that the $7 trillion global push to build data centers and “AI factories” represents the largest infrastructure buildout in human history, essentially pointing out that the AI will not be confined to software engineers but also people who are physically building these massive centres.“First of all, this is the largest infrastructure buildout in human history. That's going to create a lot of jobs. And it's wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft. We're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steel workers and network technicians and people who install and fit out the equipment and all of these jobs we're going to in the United States. We're seeing quite a significant boom in this area. The salaries have gone up nearly double. And so we're talking about six figure salaries for people who are building uh chip factories or computer factories or AI factories,” he said in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.","Drell is an engineering professor at Stanford and worked with Nvidia for over a decade.

Demis Hassabis calls out Sam Altman for claiming we have already whooshed by AGI





Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis has questioned Sam Altman ’s claims of artificial general intelligence (AGI) being around the corner. Speaking at World Economic Forum 2026 in Davos, Hassabis pointed at the ‘big irony’ in his actions and words. “I think actions speak louder than words,” Hassabis said adding “With Sam and others claiming AGI is around the corner, why would you bother with ads then?”. Demis Hassabis’ comments are directed at OpenAI ’s latest announcement to show ads in ChatGPT. Earlier this month, Sam Altman-led AI company announced that it will begin testing ads in ChatGPT in the coming weeks.Demis said “That is a reasonable question to ask,” adding Google has “no plans at the moment to show ads in the Gemini app”. “We are going to watch very carefully the outcome of (ChatGPT ads),” he stated.During the interaction, Hassabis called the ad test a premature revenue push. “It's interesting they've gone for that so early,” he said adding “Maybe they feel they need to make more revenue” – something that investors have expressed concerns about recently.In November 2025, tech analyst and professor Scott Galloway issued a warning against possible financial implosion at OpenAI which he then described as a “trainwreck from a financial management perspective.”Earlier this month, veteran investor George Noble argued that the company is ""falling apart in real time"" despite its eye-watering $500 billion valuation.When asked if he agrees with Altman’s statement of the world being “whoosed by AGI” and moving towards super intelligence, Demis Hassabis replied:“He does wish that, but absolutely not. I don't think AGI should be turned into a marketing term or for commercial gain.”“I think there has always been a scientific definition of that. My definition (of AGI) is a system that can exhibit all the cognitive capabilities humans can….. the kind of highest levels of human creativity that we always celebrate, the scientists and the artists that we admire…. (and) not just solving a math equation or a conjecture, but coming up with a breakthrough conjecture. That's much harder.”Hassabis said that an AGI system must be able to do all of these things to really fulfill the original goal of the AI field. “And I think we're 5 to 10 years away from that,” he stated.","Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis has questioned Sam Altman’s claims of artificial general intelligence (AGI) being around the corner. “I think actions speak louder than words,” Hassabis said adding “With Sam and others claiming AGI is around the corners, why would you bother with ads then?”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127401083,imgsize-29044,width-400,resizemode-4/google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis.jpg"

Reality check: productivity gains remain uncertain





Engineers are becoming artists and artists are turning into engineers, all thanks to AI—at least according to Logan Kilpatrick, who leads product for Google AI Studio and the Gemini API. In a post on X that’s racked up over 627,000 views, Kilpatrick captured what he sees as a fundamental shift in how creative and technical work now overlap. “Engineers are artists now thanks to AI,” he wrote, “and artists are becoming engineers, all in a positive sense.”The comment reflects a growing sentiment in Silicon Valley that AI coding tools are erasing traditional boundaries between disciplines. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently said AI now writes over 30% of new code at Google, while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei claimed Claude generates 90% of his company’s code. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has gone even further, saying he wants his engineers to stop writing code entirely and focus instead on “discovering undiscovered problems.” At Nvidia’s recent all-hands meeting, Huang reportedly pushed back against managers who told teams to reduce AI usage, asking bluntly: “Are you insane?”Kilpatrick’s observation aligns with Pichai’s recent comments that “vibe coding”—using AI to build software with minimal technical knowledge—is making development “exciting again” and more accessible to non-technical workers. From HR professionals to accountants, people across industries are now using tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Cursor to prototype apps and automate workflows without formal coding training.But the optimism isn’t universal. Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor—the $29 billion AI coding assistant Nvidia has adopted company-wide—warned developers against blindly trusting AI-generated code. “If you close your eyes and have AIs build things with shaky foundations, things start to kind of crumble,” he told Fortune.Research backs up the skepticism: a METR study found AI assistants actually decreased experienced developers’ productivity by 19%, despite participants expecting significant gains.Even Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI director who coined the term “vibe coding,” admitted his recent project was “basically entirely hand-written” because AI agents “just didn’t work well enough.” His warning to fellow programmers: “I’ve never felt this much behind. The profession is being dramatically refactored.“",Google AI Studio product manager Logan Kilpatrick says artists are becoming engineers.

Google has announced that its Chrome browser will officially end support for macOS 12 Monterey starting July 2026. The company has announced that users running Monterey will no longer receive browser updates which includes security patches, feature improvements or compatibility fixes. Google’s decision to end the support aligns with company’s broader policy of phasing out older operating systems once Apple itself stops offering mainstream updates.“Chrome 150 is the last version of Chrome that will support macOS 12 (Monterey). Chrome 151 (tentatively scheduled for release on July 28, 2026) is the first version of Chrome that requires macOS 13 Ventura or later. You’ll need to ensure your device is running macOS 13 or later to continue receiving future Chrome releases.Older versions of Chrome will continue to work, but there will be no further updates released for users on this operating system. If you are currently on macOS 12 (Monterey), we encourage you to move to a supported macOS version (macOS 13 Ventura or newer) to ensure you continue to receive the latest security updates and Chrome features,” said the company.Google has advised users to upgrade to a newer macOS version supported by Apple to continue receiving Chrome updates.

Here’s the full internal memo Target HR chief sent to staff:



Hi team,

As the situation in our community continues to evolve, I want to share a few updates for our team and acknowledge the stress many of you may be carrying as disruption in our hometown affects daily life. We remain deeply focused on caring for our team and providing the support we can.

The safety and well-being of our entire team and guests matters immensely. In fact, it guides every decision we make. Over the past week, we've added new FAQs to our resource to address the most common questions we're hearing. Based on feedback, our security teams are also increasing communication with Minneapolis-based team members about expected disruption near our locations, along with guidance to help you stay safe. Field teams continue to receive updated procedures as conditions around stores and sites change.

While we can't control everything happening around us, we are focused on what we can control. Senior leaders are actively engaging with government officials, community partners, faith leaders and other stakeholders. As part of these conversations, and as we shared in our FAQs, we are clear about our priorities and practices, including that Target does not have cooperative agreements with any immigration enforcement agency. We're listening and working to de-escalate where possible—while staying clear on what we need to safely operate our business and care for our team.

Please continue to lean on your leaders, HR partners, Spring Health resources and one another for support. Thank you for the care you show each other and for being there for one another during this time.

Sincerely,

Melissa

Last year, Target was hit by a 40-day consumer boycott over its decision to scale back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and now, the company is now facing an “ICE problem”. As armed US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents carry out detentions across the its Minneapolis hometown of Target, viral videos have surfaced appearing to show enforcement actions taking place within Target stores and parking lots.According to a report by Business Insider, this crackdown in the proximity of Target stores has sparked protests, leaving the retailer’s workforce in a state of high alert. Target, while remaining publicly silent, has sent an internal memo to staff, acknowledging the “stress many of you may be carrying”.Target’s human resources chief Melissa Kremer sent an internal memo to staff on Thursday (January 22), clarifying the company’s stance on the federal activity. She noted that the company does not have cooperative agreements with any immigration enforcement agency, and that it is “working to de-escalate where possible” when agents enter store premises.Target was among several companies that rolled back DEI initiatives. Major tech companies include Google, Meta, Amazon and Accenture.","Target’s human resources chief Melissa Kremer sent an internal memo to staff on Thursday (January 22) She noted that the company does not have cooperative agreements with any immigration enforcement agency, and that it is “working to de-escalate where possible”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127384562,imgsize-315808,width-400,resizemode-4/target.jpg"

The five-day annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) ended on Friday, January 23. As many as 64 heads of state or government attended the event at Davos, Switzerland. The 56th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum convened leaders from government, business, civil society and academia under the theme “A Spirit of Dialogue”, against the most complex geopolitical backdrop in decades.In the closing remarks, Larry Fink, Interim Co-Chair, World Economic Forum, and CEO, BlackRock, quoted Tesla CEO Elon Musk . “It's better for your quality of life to be an optimist who's wrong than a pessimist who's right,"" said Fink, quoting Musk. Elon Musk marked his debut at WEF 2026 with a critique of US solar tariffs and aggressive targets for Tesla, including humanoid robot sales next year, as well as flagging European approval for self-driving tech within weeks. After years of describing the World Economic Forum's annual meeting as elitist, unaccountable and disconnected from ordinary people, the world's richest man was interviewed by Larry Fink. The BlackRock CEO expressed his admiration for Musk at the start of the wide-ranging discussion, which covered the future of robots and AI, the economic benefits of reusable rockets and Musk's childhood fascination with science fiction.As per WEF 2026 release, the event was attended by close to 3,000 leaders from across regions, sectors and generations from 130 countries, including a record 400 top political leaders, a majority of G7 leaders, close to 830 of the world's top CEOs and chairs, and almost 80 leading unicorns and technology pioneers. ""This is a moment of uncertainty, but also possibility; not a moment to retreat, but a moment to engage,"" WEF President and CEO Borge Brende said at the closing session.""This year, Davos has reached a new level. Not only was it the intended platform for dialogue, but it also marked turning points and drove decisions,"" WEF's Interim Co-Chair and Roche Holding Vice Chairman Andre Hoffmann said.AI and emerging technologies are fundamentally transforming every industry sector and the global labour market, driving profound changes in skill requirements and entire professions across both advanced and emerging economies. CEOs across regions highlighted practical strategies for deploying AI on complex, mission-critical tasks and for driving long-term transformation, looking at actionable insights on how to redesign capabilities, decision-making and operating models to unlock AI’s full enterprise value.“I would advocate for the developing countries: build your infrastructure, get engaged in AI and recognize that AI is likely to close the technology divide,” said Jensen Huang, Chief Executive Officer, Nvidia.“Right now, the Zeitgeist is a little bit about the admiration for AI in its abstract form or as a technology,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “But, I think we as a global community have to get to a point where we're using this to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries.”“The capability overhang [of AI] is massive,” said Sarah Friar, Chief Financial Officer, Open AI OpCo. “Even if models [did not improve at all] from today, there is still so much productivity to be had just with what’s in people’s hands.”","As many as 64 heads of state or government attended the event at Davos, Switzerland.

He advised the young entrepreneurs to work at established companies before starting their own companies.“It is possible to drop out of college and be a great entrepreneur… but these people are the exception,” Bezos said. “Go work at a best practices company somewhere, where you can learn a lot of basic fundamental things.There’s still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it.”For those unaware, Bezos started Amazon out of his garage in 1994. He believes that entry-level jobs such as those at McDonald’s tech foundational skills which are important for long term success. He emphasised that such small roles are necessary as they instill skill like discipline, resilience and the ability to handle pressure. These are the traits that many Gen Z entrepreneurs may overlook in their rush to build startups.Elon Musk also joined the Polymarket and Jeff Bezos conversation.

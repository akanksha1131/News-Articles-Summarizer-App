This contrasts with Elon Musk and Sundar Pichai's ambitious plans for orbital AI infrastructure, citing terrestrial power limitations. While Google aims for test launches in 2027, Garman highlights the immense practical hurdles.

“It is just not economical,”

What are AWS CEO Matt Garman ’s concerns about AI data centres in space

“There are not enough rockets to launch a million satellites yet, so we're, like, pretty far from that. If you think about the cost of getting a payload in space today, it's massive,”

What Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk said about AI data centres in space

“36 months or less. Maybe 30 months.”

“harder to scale on the ground than it is to scale in space”.

“about five times the effectiveness”

“day-night cycle, seasonality, clouds, or an atmosphere.”

“the atmosphere alone results in about a 30% loss of energy”

“they’re quite reliable past a certain point.”

“At Google, we are always proud of taking moon shots,""

one of our moon shots is how do we one day have data centres in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun?”

“put these data centres in space closer to the sun”

“first step in 2027.”

“We'll send tiny racks of machines and have them in satellites, test them out, and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away will be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centres,”

Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has dismissed the feasibility of space-based data centres. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Garman called the concept uneconomical in a recent interview. His comments undermine the huge confidence shown by tech leaders, including SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.Garman said at the Cisco AI Summit in San Francisco. To explain his distrust, he cited the high cost of launching payloads into orbit and insufficient rocket capacity to support the infrastructure required for orbital data centres, Reuters reported.This comes as both Musk and Pichai have shared their ambitions to build artificial intelligence (AI) training data centres in space to reduce dependence on Earth’s resources.Last month, Musk announced the merger of SpaceX and xAI. One reason for the move is to establish a support system for the development of data centres in outer space. In a memo, Musk said it will be critical because ""global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions.""In November 2025, Google announced Project Suncatcher. This is the Pichai-led company’s orbital data centre initiative, which could begin test launches as early as next year.Garman pointed towards the practical barriers that make the concept ‘impossible’ even in the coming years.he said, as per the Reuters report.The debate over space-based computing facilities has emerged as AI’s rapid expansion creates demands for computing power and cooling that challenge traditional land-based data centres, prompting cloud computing companies to explore alternative solutions.In a recent Dwarkesh podcast, Musk said that the cheapest place to deploy AI would be in space. He suggested that this could happen withinCiting limits on terrestrial power generation, Musk argued that it isHe said space-based solar panels offerbecause there is noHe added thatand that batteries would not be needed for these data centres, as they’ll be solar-powered.

The ‘promotion’ that fractured OpenAI board



Read full email that Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott's sent to CEO Satya Nadella and other leaders



[This document is from Musk v. Altman (2026).]

From: Kevin Scott

Sent: Sunday, November 19, 2023 7:31 AM

To: Frank X. Shaw, Satya Nadella, Brad Smith, Amy Hood, Caitlin McCabe

Frank,

I can help you with the timeline and with our best understanding of what was going on. I think the reality was that a member of the board, llya Sutskever, had been increasingly at odds with his boss, Sam, over a variety of issues.

One of those issues is that there is a perfectly natural tension inside of the company between Research and Applied over resource allocations. The success of Applied has meant that headcount and GPUs got allocated to things like the API and ChatGPT. Research, which is responsible for training new models, could always use more GPUs because what they're doing is literally insatiable, and it's easy for them to look at the success of Applied and believe that in a zero sum game they are responsible for them waiting for GPUs to become available to do their work. I could tell you stories like this from every place l've ever worked, and it boils down to, even if you have two important, super successful things you're trying to work on simultaneously, folks rarely think about the global optima. They believe that their thing is more important, and that to the extent that things are zero sum, that the other thing is a cause of their woes. It's why Sam has pushed us so hard on capacity: he's the one thing about the global optima and trying to make things non-zero sum. The researchers at OAl do not appreciate that they would not have anywhere remotely as many GPUs as they do have if there were no Applied at all, and that Applied has a momentum all its own that must be fed. So the only reasonable thing to do is what Sam has been doing: figure out how to get more compute.

The second of the issues, and one that's deeply personal to llya, is that Jakub moreso than Ilya has been making the research breakthroughs that are driving things forward, to the point that Sam promoted Jakub, and put him charge of the major model research directions. After he did that, Jakub's work accelerated, and he's made some truly stunning progress that has accelerated in the past few weeks. I think that Ilya has had a very, very hard time with this, with this person that used to work for him suddenly becoming the leader, and perhaps more importantly, for solving the problem that Ilya has been trying to solve the past few years with little or no progress. Sam made the right choice as CEO here by promoting Jakub.

Now, in a normal company, if you don't like these two things, you'd appeal to your boss, and if he/she tells you that they've made their decision and that it's final, your recourse is accept the decision or quit. Here, and this is the piece that everyone should have been thinking harder about, the employee was also a founder and board member, and the board constitution was such that they were highly susceptible to a pitch by Ilya that portrays the decisions that Sam was making as bad. I think the things that made them susceptible, is that two of the board members were effective altruism folks who all things equal would like to have an infinite bag of money to build AGI-like things, just to study and ponder, but not to do anything with. None of them were experienced enough with running things, or understood the dynamic at OAI well enough to understand that firing Sam not only would not solve any of the concerns they had, but would make them worse. And none of them had experience, and didn't seek experience out, in how to handle something like a CEO transition, certainly not for the hottest company in the world.

The actual timeline of events through Friday afternoon as I understand them:

Thursday late night, the board let's Mira know what they're going to do. By board, it's Ilya, Tash, Helen, and Adam.

Mira calls me and Satya about 10-15 minutes before the board talks to Sam. This is the first either of us had heard of any of this. Mira sounded like she had been run over by a truck as she tells me.

OAl Board notifies Sam at noon on Friday that he's out, and that Greg is off the board, and immediately does a blog post.

OAl all hands at 2P to rattled staff.

Greg resigns. He was blindsided and hadn't been in the board deliberations, and hadn't agreed to stay.

Jakub and a whole horde of researchers reach out to Sam and Greg trying to understand what happened, expressing loyalty to them, and saying they will resign.

Friday night Jakub and a handful of others resign.

Microsoft chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, sent an email to CEO Satya Nadella and president Brad Smith, along with other C-suite executives, explaining the series of events that led to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in November 2023. An email, dated November 19, 2023, suggests that the “shock” firing was not the result of a single ideological clash, but rather a mix of a variety of issues between llya Sutskever and Altman.The email, posted by X handle Internal Tech Emails, said that Sutskever “had been increasingly at odds with” Altman over two primary friction points. The first point of failure was an internal ‘battle’ over computing power. As ChatGPT’s popularity surged, the demand for GPUs became a zero-sum game within the company.According to Scott, Altman’s decision to prioritise GPU for the consumer products and API division infuriated the core research teams because they felt the fundamental work was being “starved” of the resources needed for the next generation of models.The second conflict was deeply personal to Sutskever, who – according to Scott’s email – had a hard time with the promotion of Jakub Pachocki, a researcher who had previously worked under Sutskever.After Pachocki spearheaded several major research breakthroughs, Altman promoted him to lead OpenAI’s core model development. While Scott characterised the move as “logical from a CEO perspective,” it alienated Sutskever.","Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott sent email to CEO Satya Nadella and other leaders.

SpaceX, xAI merger and Musk’s $800 billion+ wealth

Soon after the historic merger of SpaceX and xAI, Elon Musk has announced a recruitment drive. The billionaire is calling for “elite” engineers to join SpaceX and Starlink as the company moves towards building AI-powered data centres in space. Musk amplified the posts shared by Michael Nicolls, Vice President of Starlink Engineering at SpaceX, confirming that the company is hiring across multiple critical disciplines to develop “AI satellites”.“We are hiring for many critical engineering roles to develop the technologies for AI satellites in space at our facilities in Austin and Seattle. Solar, process, automation, manufacturing, mechanical, electrical, optics, software... come build space data centers with great engineers at SpaceX and Starlink,” said Nicolls. Musk replied, “Help take humanity to the stars!”In the second post, Nicolls said, “We are also hiring elite engineers at our new 230 MeV cyclotron facility in Florida, where we are bringing single-event radiation testing in house to accelerate development across all SpaceX vehicles.”Musk replied, “Not many companies have cyclotrons!”. Cyclotron is a type of compact particle accelerator.The roles on offer include Antenna Engineer (Starlink), Antenna Engineer, Satellites (Starlink), Antenna Software Engineer, Satellites (Starlink) and more.The recruitment push follows Musk’s personal net worth crossing the $800 billion mark, and signals a move to integrate high-level AI capabilities directly into the Starlink satellite constellation. The expansion also marks a synergy between Musk’s recently merged entities. By combining xAI’s large-scale intelligence models with SpaceX’s orbital infrastructure, Musk is positioning Starlink to handle massive AI workloads that were previously restricted to terrestrial servers.Last month, Musk's AI-company xAI posted job openings to expand its team of AI talent. The company announced that it is looking to hire a “small, elite unit” of talent engineers who will function as a specialised force to hunt and hire the “absolute best people in the world.”According to a job listing on the xAI website, this new unit will report directly to Musk, who is looking for engineers who happen to be “people persons”, and successful applicants should have a history of building “cool products” that date back to their childhood.",Elon Musk is calling for “elite” engineers to join SpaceX and Starlink.

Why Microsoft needs a quality czar right now

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre. Charlie Bell, who led the company's security operations since 2021, is stepping down from that role to become what's effectively an engineering quality czar—reporting directly to Nadella.""Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo shared on Wednesday. ""And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!""Bell's replacement? Hayete Gallot, who's returning to Microsoft after an 18-month stint as Google Cloud's President of Customer Experience. She previously spent over 15 years at Redmond, climbing to the rank of corporate vice president across Windows, Office, and security teams.The shift is significant. Bell oversaw a team of roughly 10,000 people and was the driving force behind Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative—a company-wide push launched after Chinese hackers breached US government email accounts through a Microsoft Cloud exploit in 2023. That incident triggered a scathing review from the Department of Homeland Security, which called Microsoft's security culture ""inadequate.Now, Bell will work closely with cloud and AI chief Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on what Nadella calls the ""Quality Excellence Initiative."" The initiative is aimed at delivering ""durable, high-quality experiences at global scale""—corporate speak that likely translates to fewer Azure outages, fewer broken Windows patches, and fewer out-of-band emergency fixes.Gallot's appointment signals a shift in how Microsoft thinks about its security business. Nadella specifically highlighted her ability to combine ""product building with value realization for customers."" She'll also oversee Ales Holecek, who takes on a newly created Chief Architect for Security role.The timing isn't random. During last week's earnings call, Nadella talked up momentum in security products like Security Copilot agents and Purview. The company clearly wants someone who can sell security as aggressively as they build it.Nadella's memo doesn't spell out exactly why engineering quality needs its own dedicated leader at this moment. But the clues aren't hard to find. Microsoft now uses AI to write around 30 percent of its own code, Azure outages remain a recurring headache, and Copilot adoption sits at a modest 3.3 percent among Microsoft 365 users. Bell's got his work cut out.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre.

Meet Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei: Former OpenAI researcher who turned his AI vision into a $3.7 billion company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-former-openai-researcher-who-turned-his-ai-vision-into-a-3-7-billion-company/articleshow/127943143.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s academic background and early career path



Dario Amodei’s rise at OpenAI and the birth of GPT models



Dario Amodei leaves OpenAI and builds Anthropic



Dario Amodei’s cautious leadership style



Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now. He is not a loud public figure, and he rarely chases attention, but his work has quietly shaped how modern AI systems are built and controlled. Before running a multi-billion-dollar company, Amodei spent years in labs and research roles, studying complex systems and how they behave under pressure. That background still shows in how he talks about artificial intelligence today. While others focus on speed and scale, he appears more concerned with safety, limits, and long-term risks. As AI moves faster than regulation, Amodei’s cautious approach is becoming harder to ignore.Before AI became the world’s favourite buzzword, Amodei was deep in academia. He studied physics at Stanford University and later earned a PhD in biophysics from Princeton. At the time, he was focused on understanding complex biological systems. Cells. Signals. Patterns that emerge rather than being designed. Looking back, that mindset fits AI almost too well.After completing his doctorate, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine.There was no clear path to becoming a tech billionaire. That part came later. Almost accidentally, it seems. Amodei eventually moved into machine learning research, joining companies like Baidu and Google Brain. At Google, he worked on neural networks and AI safety.Colleagues from that period say he already seemed concerned about failure modes. In 2016, he joined OpenAI. Things moved fast after that.At OpenAI, Amodei rose quickly. By 2019, he was Vice President of Research, helping set the organisation’s overall research direction. He led work on GPT-2 and GPT-3, models that changed public perception of AI almost overnight.These systems could write essays, answer questions, and even mimic conversation. Sometimes convincingly. Sometimes awkwardly. During this time, Amodei also co-invented reinforcement learning from human feedback. RLHF sounds technical, but the idea is simple. Teach AI systems by showing them what humans actually prefer, not just what scores well mathematically.In 2021, Amodei left OpenAI along with six others, including his sister Daniela Amodei. They founded Anthropic. Some people were sceptical at first. But Anthropic took a different route. It became a public benefit corporation. That detail mattered. It signalled that profit would not be the only priority. At least in theory. Their AI model, Claude, leaned into being cautious. Less dramatic. More restrained. That tone appealed to companies worried about reputational risk.By September 2025, Anthropic was reportedly valued at $183 billion by private investors. That number raised eyebrows. Especially for a company without much public hype.Partnerships with Alphabet and Amazon helped fuel that growth. So did rising concerns about AI safety across governments and corporations. As Anthropic’s valuation climbed, so did Amodei’s wealth. His real-time net worth now sits around $3.7 billion, ranking among the world’s richest people.Amodei does not sound like most tech CEOs. He hedges. A lot. “It seems.” “It might.” “We’re not fully sure yet.” That language annoys some people. Others trust it more. He avoids grand predictions. No promises of utopia. No claims that AI will solve everything.Experts say his influence shows up in quieter ways. Safety research is becoming mainstream. Alignment discussions moving from fringe to boardroom. Competitors are copying ideas they once ignored. No one really knows what comes next for Dario Amodei. AI is moving fast. Faster than regulation.","Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now.

The tech giant has already spent $58 billion on data centers and is struggling with rising borrowing costs as US banks retreat. This financial strain is impacting Oracle's ability to deliver crucial AI infrastructure.

'OpenAI deal is eating Oracle alive financially'

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

US banks are pulling back—and that's a big problem

A possible Cerner sale and 40% upfront customer deposits show how tight things have gotten

Oracle is staring down the possibility of its largest-ever workforce reduction—and at the heart of it is a $300 billion partnership with OpenAI that's proving far more expensive than anyone initially let on.Investment bank TD Cowen reported this week that Oracle is weighing cuts of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs. The move would free up an estimated $8 to $10 billion in cash flow, money the company desperately needs as it tries to bankroll a sprawling network of AI data centers built largely to serve Sam Altman 's company.TD Cowen puts the OpenAI commitment alone at around $156 billion in capital spending—and roughly 3 million GPUs to back it up. Oracle has already burned through $58 billion in debt in just two months. That's $38 billion for data centers in Texas and Wisconsin, $20 billion for a campus in New Mexico. Total debt now sits north of $100 billion.The kicker? That $58 billion covers only a slice of what's actually needed. Since its September 2025 peak, Oracle's stock has shed more than half its value—about $463 billion in market cap, gone.The financing crunch isn't just an Oracle internal issue anymore.Multiple US banks have quietly retreated from lending on Oracle-linked data center projects. TD Cowen noted that lenders have roughly doubled the interest rate premiums they charge Oracle since September, pushing borrowing costs into territory usually reserved for junk-rated companies.The result? Several data center leases Oracle had been negotiating simply stalled. Private operators couldn't get the funding to build, which means Oracle can't deliver the capacity its customers—especially OpenAI—are counting on. Some Asian banks are still willing to step in, but that doesn't solve the immediate problem in the US, where most of Oracle's expansion is planned.Oracle isn't sitting idle. The company is now requiring new customers to pay up to 40% of contract value upfront—essentially asking clients to co-fund the infrastructure. It's also exploring ""bring your own chip"" arrangements, where customers supply their own hardware.On the table too is a potential sale of Cerner, the healthcare software unit Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in 2022. That would be a significant strategic pivot, signaling that AI infrastructure is now the clear priority—everything else is up for grabs.TD Cowen also flagged that OpenAI has already begun shifting some near-term capacity needs over to Microsoft and Amazon, which is not exactly a vote of confidence in Oracle's ability to deliver on schedule.The company has not publicly commented on the layoff reports or the financing difficulties.","Oracle faces massive job cuts, potentially 20,000-30,000, to fund its costly $300 billion OpenAI partnership. The tech giant has already spent $58 billion on data centers and is struggling with rising borrowing costs. This financial strain is impacting Oracle's ability to deliver crucial AI infrastructure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127835680,imgsize-18640,width-400,resizemode-4/127835680.jpg"
"Egypt bans Roblox nationwide over child safety concerns, raising global questions about kids' online freedom",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/egypt-bans-roblox-nationwide-over-child-safety-concerns-raising-global-questions-about-kids-online-freedom/articleshow/127935398.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Roblox faces a government ban in Egypt: Here’s why



What this ban means for kids and parents



Roblox going dark in Egypt, the platform that lives almost entirely on screens, the sudden loss felt very real. With games loading, Avatars running around blocky worlds. And then Egypt has officially banned Roblox, saying the move is about protecting children from harmful online content. The story underneath feels layered, political, and a little messy. Roblox looks harmless on the surface but experts say the risk is not the visuals but the interaction. The platform allows users to create games, chat with strangers, and move freely between user-generated worlds.A spokesperson confirmed the company has reached out to Egyptian authorities, offering dialogue to resolve the issue and restore access. The company says it has worked with regulators in other regions to build localised safety systems that align with cultural values. Last year, the company restricted some features across parts of the Middle East to address safety concerns. This ban did not come out of nowhere. Roblox has already been blocked or restricted in countries like Qatar and Turkey with other nations watching closely.The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.According to state-run media, the ban will be coordinated with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. That means internet providers are expected to block access nationwide with no single official explanation was released at first. Later, state outlets pointed to growing concerns about children’s exposure to inappropriate content, online interactions, and psychological risks as reported by Bloomberg. An Egyptian senator had already called for regulating Roblox to protect children’s moral and educational values.President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi recently called for limits on children’s phone use, pointing to similar moves abroad. Australia has banned social media for certain age groups. France is moving in the same direction. Egypt’s parliament is now discussing broader rules for digital platforms including unified age classifications, stronger verification, penalties and possibly forcing companies to have local representatives inside the country.For children, the ban feels abrupt and confusing. For parents, reactions are mixed. Some welcome the move, while others worry it pushes kids toward less visible, less regulated platforms, potentially exposing them to more risks. That is the irony experts often point out. When one door closes, another usually opens. Sometimes darker, more unpredictable, and harder to monitor.Still, supporters of the ban argue that Roblox’s scale makes it different. Millions of users. Constant interaction. Endless content that cannot realistically be watched, moderated, or controlled by humans alone, leaving significant safety and privacy concerns for young players and families.","The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive. Anime Paradox February codes let you redeem gems, stat chips, trait rerolls, and more.For players trying to build a decent team without sinking hours into farming, they matter.Below is the list of all working Anime Paradox codes in February 2026.Anime Paradox is a Roblox tower defence game where players summon and command powerful anime-style units to fend off waves of enemies and bosses as they defend a base.

"Intel, AMD may have been hit by same ‘crises’ flagged by Apple CEO Tim Cook",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-amd-may-have-been-hit-by-same-crises-flagged-by-apple-ceo-tim-cook/articleshow/128001469.cms,"Intel warns of price hike



AMD feels the squeeze via TSMC



Intel and AMD have reportedly notified Chinese customers of significant supply shortages for server CPUs, with Intel warning that delivery lead times have increased to as long as six months. The “crises” of supply chain instability was recently highlighted by Apple CEO Tim Cook, clarifying that it’s not the memory shortage due to high prices but constraint are due to unavailability advanced nodes on which its M and A series chips are built.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the constraints are a direct result of the global increase in demand for components for Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure. While much of the focus has been on AI-specific GPUs, the massive shift toward “agentic AI” has placed a strain on the traditional CPUs.The report mentions that in China, a market that accounts for more than 20% of Intel’s total revenue, the shortage is hitting the fourth- and fifth-generation Xeon processors hard. Citing sources familiar with the matter, Reuters said that Intel is now rationing deliveries to manage a substantial backlog of unfulfilled orders.The scarcity has already triggered a price hike, with Intel server products in China generally rising by more than 10%.“Inventory is at its lowest level in Q1,” said Intel, adding that it is “addressing the issue aggressively” and expects improvements throughout the remainder of 2026.AMD is also feeling the pressure, and has informed clients of constraints that have pushed lead times out to eight to 10 weeks. AMD’s bottleneck is tied to its partnership with TSMC, which is also the chip manufacturer of Apple and Nvidia. The Taiwanese foundry giant has prioritised high-margin AI chip manufacturing, leaving limited capacity for the standard CPUs that AMD designs.“We remain confident in our ability to meet customer demand globally based on our strong supplier agreements,” the company stated.","Intel and AMD have reportedly notified Chinese customers of significant supply shortages for server CPUs, with Intel warning that delivery lead times have increased to as long as six months.

Behind Silicon Valley’s wealth and innovation lies a quieter story of migration, struggle, and relentless effort. Many of today’s most powerful Indian-origin executives arrived in the US with little more than strong academic foundations, technical skills, and a willingness to start at the bottom. They navigated cultural barriers, visa constraints, and hyper-competitive workplaces, often spending years in engineering, product, or strategy roles before reaching the top.Their contributions now underpin the Valley’s tech ecosystem, from cloud computing and cybersecurity to AI models, digital media, and global platforms used by billions. At the same time, Silicon Valley and the broader American technology ecosystem provided an environment where talent, risk-taking, and merit could translate into opportunity, allowing these executives to grow alongside the companies they helped build. Together, they illustrate how Indian-origin talent has become integral to Silicon Valley’s leadership and long-term technological direction.Balaji Krishnamurthy ’s appointment as Uber’s Chief Financial Officer in 2026 marked a significant moment for Indian-origin leadership in Silicon Valley’s financial ranks. An alumnus of IIT Madras, where he trained as an engineer, Krishnamurthy later earned an MBA from Stanford Graduate School of Business, a combination that positioned him well for roles bridging technology and finance.Early in his career, he worked at McKinsey & Company, advising large corporations on strategy, operations, and capital allocation. He later joined Google , where he held senior finance and strategy roles tied to long-term investments and emerging business lines. At Uber, Krishnamurthy oversees budgeting, investor relations, regulatory risk, and profitability across ride-hailing, food delivery, and logistics, making him central to the company’s effort to balance growth with financial discipline.Rahul Patil has emerged as a central figure behind Anthropic’s rapid rise in the AI race, with Claude increasingly positioned as a product capable of blowing traditional SaaS software away. Claude is doing this by acting as a single, flexible intelligence layer that can replace multiple point solutions, handling tasks such as writing, data analysis, customer support, coding assistance, research, and internal workflows within one interface. Instead of companies paying for separate SaaS tools, Claude can adapt to different functions through prompts and integrations, reducing software sprawl. Its ability to understand context across long documents, reason over complex tasks, and integrate directly into enterprise systems allows it to perform work traditionally spread across entire software stacks.Sundar Pichai’s rise from Chennai to the top of Google and Alphabet is often cited as one of Silicon Valley’s most emblematic success stories. After earning an engineering degree from IIT Kharagpur, he moved to the US to study at Stanford University and later completed an MBA at Wharton. Pichai joined Google in 2004 and quickly made his mark leading products such as Google Toolbar and Chrome, which became one of the world’s most widely used web browsers. Over time, he took charge of Android and other core platforms before being named CEO of Google in 2015 and Alphabet in 2019. Today, Pichai oversees search, advertising, cloud computing, YouTube, and the company’s AI strategy, managing a business that sits at the heart of the global internet economy.Satya Nadella’s leadership is widely credited with reshaping Microsoft’s trajectory in the modern tech era. Born and educated in India, Nadella moved to the US for graduate studies and joined Microsoft in 1992. He spent decades inside the company, holding senior roles across enterprise software, cloud services, and developer platforms. When he became CEO in 2014, Microsoft was struggling to adapt to mobile and cloud-first computing. Nadella led a cultural reset that emphasised collaboration and innovation, while steering the company decisively toward cloud infrastructure through Azure. Under his leadership, Microsoft also made major investments in AI and enterprise software, helping it regain relevance and emerge as one of the world’s most valuable technology companies.Jay Chaudhry’s path to Silicon Valley success began far from the tech campuses of California. Raised in a small village in Haryana, he later moved to the US for higher education, earning multiple degrees in engineering and management. Chaudhry founded several cybersecurity companies before launching Zscaler in 2007. The company challenged traditional network security by adopting a cloud-native, zero-trust model that eliminated the need for on-premise hardware. Under his leadership, Zscaler became a critical security provider for global enterprises and governments, particularly as remote work and cloud computing expanded. Chaudhry’s success has made him one of the wealthiest self-made Indian-origin entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley.Vijaye Raji belongs to a newer generation of Indian-origin technologists shaping AI from inside elite research organisations rather than from the CEO’s office. Educated in India before moving to the US, Raji built his career around data analytics and developer-focused platforms. He founded a startup focused on product analytics, which was later acquired by OpenAI. At OpenAI, Raji works on core engineering and product systems that support the deployment and scaling of large AI models. His work helps bridge cutting-edge research with real-world applications, ensuring that AI tools can be reliably delivered to developers and enterprises worldwide.Nikesh Arora is one of the most globally connected Indian-origin executives in Silicon Valley. After early education in India, he studied and built his career in the US, rising through Google during its rapid expansion in advertising and mobile. He later joined SoftBank, where he managed large-scale global investments and played a central role in shaping the firm’s technology portfolio. As CEO of Palo Alto Networks, Arora leads one of the world’s largest cybersecurity companies, overseeing products that defend enterprises, governments, and critical infrastructure. His tenure has been marked by aggressive acquisitions and expansion, reinforcing Palo Alto Networks’ position as a cybersecurity powerhouse.Shantanu Narayen’s leadership transformed Adobe from a traditional software company into a cloud-first enterprise. A graduate of Osmania University in Hyderabad, Narayen moved to the US for advanced studies and joined Adobe in 1998. When he became CEO in 2007, he made the bold decision to shift Adobe’s flagship products to a subscription-based cloud model, a move initially met with scepticism. The strategy ultimately paid off, stabilising revenue and expanding Adobe’s reach across creative, marketing, and document software. Today, Adobe sits at the centre of the global digital content and design economy.Arvind Krishna grew up in India and later earned a doctorate in electrical engineering in the US before joining IBM’s research division. He spent years working on advanced technologies before moving into executive leadership roles. As CEO since 2020, Krishna has focused on repositioning IBM around hybrid cloud computing, enterprise AI, and consulting services. His strategy aims to make IBM a key partner for large organisations navigating complex digital transformations, balancing the company’s legacy systems with emerging technologies.Neal Mohan has been a central figure in shaping the modern digital advertising and creator economy. Educated partly in India and later in the US, he joined Google after its acquisition of advertising firm DoubleClick. Mohan rose through senior roles overseeing advertising products and revenue strategy before becoming CEO of YouTube. In his current role, he manages creator monetisation, platform governance, and global expansion, overseeing a service used by billions of people and millions of creators worldwide. His decisions influence not only media consumption but also how online content is regulated and monetised.Jayshree Ullal is one of Silicon Valley’s most successful Indian-origin executives in both leadership and financial terms. Born in India and trained as an engineer, she built her career at Cisco Systems before joining Arista Networks as CEO. Under her leadership, Arista became a major supplier of high-performance networking equipment to cloud data centres and hyperscalers. The company’s technology plays a crucial role in supporting AI workloads and large-scale computing, placing Ullal at the heart of Silicon Valley’s infrastructure boom.Jay Parikh was instrumental in building the infrastructure that allowed Meta, then Facebook, to scale globally. Educated in India before moving to the US, he joined Facebook early in its growth and eventually became Global Head of Engineering. Parikh oversaw data centres, networking, and internal platforms that supported billions of users worldwide. After leaving Meta in 2021, he transitioned into venture capital and advisory roles, continuing to influence the technology ecosystem behind the scenes.Ashok Elluswamy is one of the most influential Indian-origin engineers working on applied AI and autonomous systems. An IIT Madras graduate, he moved to the US for graduate studies and joined Tesla during the early development of its Autopilot programme. Today, he leads AI and self-driving software development, working closely with Elon Musk. Elluswamy’s work underpins Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system and contributes to broader AI initiatives across Musk’s companies, placing him at the cutting edge of automotive and AI innovation.Sriram Krishnan is an Indian-origin technology leader who has moved from Silicon Valley product roles into shaping how artificial intelligence is governed in the United States. Born in Chennai and educated in engineering in India before moving to the US, Krishnan built his career at major technology companies including Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, and Snap, and later as a venture capitalist advising fast-growing tech startups. In recent years, he has taken on a senior advisory role within the US government’s AI policy ecosystem, working on frameworks around AI competitiveness, safety, and adoption across federal agencies. His transition from Big Tech and venture capital into public policy highlights how Indian-origin technologists are increasingly influencing not just products and companies, but national AI strategy itself.Parag Agrawal is an Indian-origin technology leader who served as CEO of Twitter from 2021 to 2022. Born in Rajasthan, he earned a B.Tech from IIT Bombay before completing a PhD in computer science at Stanford University. Agrawal joined Twitter as an engineer in 2011 and rose to Chief Technology Officer, leading work on machine learning and decentralised projects. After leaving Twitter following Elon Musk’s acquisition, he went on to found an AI-focused startup, marking his continued influence in Silicon Valley’s technology ecosystem.","Behind Silicon Valley’s wealth and innovation lies a quieter story of migration, struggle, and relentless effort.

Goldman Sachs taps Anthropic for AI agents: Chief information officer explains one capability that ‘surprised’ investment bank,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/goldman-sachs-taps-anthropic-for-ai-agents-chief-information-officer-explains-one-capability-that-surprised-investment-bank/articleshow/127996033.cms,"The ‘surprising’ capability of Claude



Premature to expect AI-led job cuts



Goldman Sachs has said that it deploying fully autonomous AI agents designed to automate complex, process-intensive roles within the investment bank, and these autonomous digital co-workers are powered by Anthropic’s Claude model. In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Goldman’s Chief Information Officer, Marco Argenti, revealed that the firm has spent the last six months co-developing these “digital co-workers” alongside engineers from the AI startup.“Think of it as a digital co-worker for many of the professions within the firm that are scaled, are complex and very process intensive,” he said. The report also said that the initiative is part of a multiyear reorganisation led by CEO David Solomon to center the bank’s operations around generative AI.Goldman transitioned to Anthropic’s Claude models after the bank successfully tested AI coding assistants for its engineers. Argenti told the publication that the team was “surprised” to find that the model’s reasoning capabilities in handling high-stakes financial operations.“Claude is really good at coding. Is that because coding is kind of special, or is it about the model’s ability to reason through complex problems, step-by-step, applying logic,” Argenti was quoted as saying.Goldman’s next step would be to see whether AI agents can offer same level of automation in other departments. “There are these other areas of the firm where we could expect the same level of automation and the same level of results that we’re seeing on the coding side,” he said.Goldman may next develop AI agents for tasks like employee surveillance or making investment banking pitchbooks, he said.While talking a bout AI-led job cuts, Argenti said that it was “premature” to expect that this technology will lead to less headcount.“It’s always a trade-off. Our philosophy right now is that we’re injecting capacity, which in most cases will allow us to do things faster, which translates to a better client experience and more business,” Argenti added.","Goldman Sachs has said that it deploying fully autonomous AI agents designed to automate complex, process-intensive roles within the investment bank.

Apple-Google partnership



Apple has reportedly shut down “Project Mulberry,” an effort to develop an AI-powered virtual health coach even as the company radically rethinks its wellness strategy. The decision is said to be driven by Services Chief Eddy Cue, marking a step back from a standalone ‘Health+’ subscription model. According to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the move follows a major leadership transition within Apple’s health division after longtime executive Jeff Williams retired last year.Citing internal sources, Gurman says that Apple wound down the Mulberry initiative in recent weeks. The project was originally intended to debut with iOS 26 as an AI-driven service that would analyse Apple Watch data and lab reports to offer personalised well-being recommendations.Since taking the reins of the health division, Eddy Cue has reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with Apple’s pace of innovation. Cue has told colleagues that newer competitors like Oura and Whoop are delivering more compelling software experiences than the Apple Health app.The report pointed out that instead of a standalone coach, Apple now plans to offer a fragmented release of AI features, wherein individual AI health tools will be rolled out incrementally within the existing Health app for iPhones.Wellness videos produced at Apple’s Oakland, California, studio will be integrated into the standard app experience.Apple is also facing tougher competition in the health-tracking market from Samsung and fitness platforms like Strava. Meanwhile, OpenAI also moved into the space with the launch of ChatGPT Health to analyse health data, answer questions and provide feedback.A few weeks ago, Apple announced that it is partnering with Google to use its Gemini AI models to power AI features on its devices like the iPhone.“Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology. These models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year,” the companies said in a joint statement.There is a possibility that Apple may use Google’s technology to supercharge the iPhone maker’s health coach.

Big Tech's $70 Billion AI Move: Silicon Valley Bets On India, Snubs Trump's 'America First' Diktat

How AI has been affecting Silicon Valley jobs

Facebook parent Meta has announced that it will cut 102 more jobs at its San Francisco Peninsula offices. The latest round of layoffs comes as the company shifts investment from its metaverse division to wearable technology. The company filed these job cuts with California's Employment Development Department, which will affect Meta's corporate locations on the San Francisco Peninsula in Silicon Valley, including facilities in San Mateo County and the company's Menlo Park headquarters.In an email (seen by the Silicon Valley Business Journal), a Meta spokesperson said,The announcement follows Meta's earlier decision to scale back its Reality Labs division by 10%. That team handles augmented reality products and services, including the metaverse. In recent months, Meta also cut 318 jobs at its Menlo Park division.Last month, the company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said that Meta's teams are becoming leaner and more productive as the company invests $115 billion or more in AI tooling to increase output.He also said that AI has enabled a single employee to do the work of an entire team.Despite significant workforce reductions, Meta increased its headcount by 6% last year, reaching over 78,000 employees by the end of December 2025, according to its fourth-quarter earnings report.According to executive recruitment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, nearly 55,000 layoff notices were credited to AI. Last year, San Francisco-based Salesforce warned of potential layoffs affecting 4,000 employees as it develops AI agents to handle customer support tasks.AI-related workforce reductions have continued into 2026, with several major tech companies also citing AI as a factor in reducing headcount.In recent weeks, Pinterest cut more than 100 jobs in the Bay Area, pointing to a shift toward ‘AI-proficient talent.’ Google and Amazon have also announced layoffs.Google recently eliminated 77 positions in Sunnyvale, while Amazon reduced 666 jobs in Silicon Valley as part of an AI-focused restructuring.",Facebook parent Meta has announced that it will cut 102 more jobs at its San Francisco Peninsula offices.

He argued Apple's hands-off approach benefited them, contrasting with Meta's extensive research into platform harms. This revelation surfaces amid an ongoing lobbying battle between the tech giants over online child protection responsibilities.

Zuckerberg's email came a day after damning Instagram research went public

Apple and Meta are already locked in a lobbying war over child safety

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took aim at Apple in an internal email to top executives, complaining that the iPhone maker faces far less scrutiny on child safety issues despite doing far less about them. The 2021 email, now unsealed as part of a New Mexico lawsuit against Meta, shows Zuckerberg arguing that Apple's hands-off approach has ""worked surprisingly well for them. """"Apple, for example, doesn't seem to study any of this stuff.

That research, leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen, revealed that 32 percent of teen girls said Instagram made them feel worse about their bodies. The subject line read: ""Social issue research and analytics — privileged and confidential.""Rather than address the findings head-on, Zuckerberg questioned whether Meta should change how it studies its platforms' harms altogether. He argued that companies like Apple, YouTube, and Snap face less heat simply because they don't investigate their own impact as thoroughly.""I think we should be commended for the work we do to study, understand, and improve social issues on our platforms,"" Zuckerberg wrote, adding that media coverage tends to weaponise internal research rather than credit Meta for doing the work.The email adds fresh context to the ongoing clash between the two tech giants over who should be responsible for protecting kids online. Meta has been pushing for laws that require app stores like Apple's to verify users' ages, while Apple argues individual apps should handle age checks themselves.

What Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on the 'spending plan' that wiped more than $250 billion from Amazon's stock in one day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-said-on-the-spending-plan-that-wiped-more-that-250-billion-from-amazons-stock-in-one-day/articleshow/127989818.cms,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s defense

Amazon stock witnessed a plunge of 11% in extended trading on February 5, erasing more than $250 billion in market value after the company introduced a $200 billion capital expenditure plan for 2026. According to a report by CNBC, this was the highest plunge among the megacap tech firms, far exceeded Wall Street expectations by over $50 billion and sparked investor concerns about the pace and scale of spending. Amazon reported spending $131 billion on property and equipment in 2025, which is up from $38 billion in 2024, underscoring the rapid escalation of investment.As per the CNBC report, on a conference call with analysts, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy defended the spending blitz and stressed on the fact that investments are important to meet the surging demand for AI compute capacity. “This isn’t some sort of quixotic, top-line grab,” Jassy said. “We have confidence that these investments will yield strong returns on invested capital. We’ve done that with our core AWS business. I think that will very much be true here as well. ”Jassy further added that the capital will go towards data centers, chips and networking equipment, enabling Amazon Web Services (AWS) to scale faster. He also noted that AWS sales grew by 24% to $35.6 billion in the most recent quarter, its fastest growth in 13 quarters, but added that growth could have been higher if the company had more capacity.The cloud unit of Amazon added nearly 4 gigawatts of computing capacity in 2025 and expects to double that power by 2027, Jassy said. He described AWS’s expansion as “scrappy,” emphasising that demand is outpacing supply.Pressed on how the AI market is evolving, Jassy likened it to a “barbell” structure: AI-native labs on one side, enterprises on the other, and a middle segment of companies experimenting with applications. “That middle part of the barbell very well may end up being the largest and most durable,” he said, suggesting long-term opportunities for AWS as enterprises adopt AI for productivity and cost savings.","Amazon stock witnessed a plunge of 11% in extended trading on February 5, erasing more than $250 billion in market value.

"Capgemini India has 2.3 lakh employees, 55% of global workforce",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/capgemini-india-has-2-3-lakh-employees-55-of-global-workforce/articleshow/127989730.cms,"Capgemini is betting big on its India powerhouse to drive growth for the French IT firm. The company has 2.3 lakh employees in India, accounting for nearly 55% of its global workforce of 4.2 lakh, making the country a key growth engine. After Accenture, which employs about 3.5 lakh people in India out of 7.7 lakh globally.Capgemini has the second-largest employee base among multinational IT firms in the country. In eight years, Capgemini more than doubled its India headcount, crossing the 2-lakh employee mark.Under Ashwin Yardi, former Capgemini India CEO and now non-executive chairman of the Board in India, the firm expanded its workforce from 105,500 to nearly 180,000. Capgemini’s $3.3 billion acquisition of WNS last year added not just clients but scale—over 44,000 of WNS’ 65,000 employees are based in India, taking the overall tally to about 2.3 lakh. According to the Capgemini Technology Services India report, during FY2024–25 the company reported revenue and other income of Rs 30,090 crore, compared with Rs 28,727 crore in the previous year, reflecting growth of 4.7%. Profit stood at Rs 3,709 crore, up from Rs 3,239 crore a year earlier.Phil Fersht, CEO of HfS Research, said Capgemini’s India footprint highlights how central the country has become to multinational IT firms’ global operating models. “This is no longer just about cost arbitrage. India is now the primary delivery engine for digital, engineering, cloud, and increasingly AI-led work. Having over half of its global workforce in India gives Capgemini scale, talent depth, and flexibility that are hard to replicate elsewhere. ” In an interview with TOI last year, Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat said India is integral to its operations—from innovation and product development to industry expertise—and continues to grow in importance. On hiring, he said the firm planned to add over 45,000 people in the last financial year, with roughly 40% being freshers. “Despite productivity gains from automation, we see a growing demand for technology continues to require more talent,” he added. When TOI asked whether firms are seeing real impact from AI yet, he said the benefits are visible but largely confined to specific projects rather than at scale. “You might see 30% productivity gains in a small team, but replicating that across the enterprise takes time because each use case requires validation, testing, and approval,” he noted. On whether AI adoption will suddenly accelerate, he said it is expected to be incremental as AI touches every function and business process. “However, areas such as customer service and marketing are witnessing faster uptake since they require fewer structural changes.”Fersht added that this level of concentration raises strategic questions. “Firms with such heavy India exposure need to continuously move up the value chain to protect margins, manage talent churn, and reduce overdependence on effort-based delivery. The winners will use India not just for volume, but as a platform for higher-value transformation, engineering, and AI execution,” he said.","Capgemini has the second-largest employee base among multinational IT firms in the country.

Biomimetic AI robot Moya: The robot that feels warm and acts more like humans



World’s first ‘biomimetic AI robot’ debuts in Shanghai

When is Moya expected to launch, and the mechanism



Social media reactions to the world’s first biomimetic AI robot Moya



A Chinese robotics startup has revealed the world’s first “biomimetic AI robot”, a humanoid machine that doesn’t just look human, but tries to feel human too, with warm skin, human-like walking, subtle gestures, Cameras sitting quietly where eyes should be, and everything almost feels like a human. Her name is Moya, which suggests that she isn’t just a showpiece, but there’s real engineering and sophisticated AI underneath the eerie exterior.Still, she looks like a robot because of the skin texture, which looks like a faint plastic sheen. The movements are a little stiff, eyes don’t quite land right, but linger for a moment, and something changes. Disturbingly lifelike robots have been popping up more often in 2026. Moya might be the clearest sign yet that humanoid AI is stepping out of demos and into public life.One detail keeps coming up: Moya’s skin is warm, unlike a cold, metal-like robot. Droidup, the Shanghai-based startup behind her, says the robot maintains a body temperature between 32°C and 36°C. Li Qingdu, Droidup’s founder, reportedly believes robots designed to serve people shouldn’t feel lifeless. The idea is emotional connection and familiarity.Whether that actually works is debatable. A robot that feels alive but isn’t can trigger a strange, creeping reaction. The kind you don’t quite know how to explain.Still, Droidup seems serious about this approach. Moya is being pitched for healthcare, education, and public-facing roles. Droidup claims her walking accuracy hits 92 percent, though how that’s measured isn’t fully clear. That said, her internal skeleton, known as Walker 3, has a pedigree. A previous version reportedly won a bronze medal at the world’s first robot half-marathon in Beijing back in 2025.They allow her to track faces, read movement, and respond with what Droidup calls “micro expressions”. Tiny facial responses designed to mimic human reactions. Paired with onboard AI, this is why the company describes Moya as a “fully biomimetic embodied intelligent robot”.Moya is expected to launch in late 2026. The price is eye-watering. Around ¥1.2 million, which works out to roughly £127,000. The company reportedly sees robots like Moya working in public service roles such as train stations, banks, museums, and shopping centres.Comment sections have already lit up with uneasy jokes. Some say she looks like a burglar deterrent. Others admit they’d panic if she walked toward them in the dark. Designers have long known that near-human robots trigger discomfort. Perfect machines feel safe. Imperfect humans feel familiar. The space between is tricky. Humanoid robots are no longer just lab experiments. CES 2026 made that clear. But despite the hype, experts say we’re still far from household androids. She’s not here to replace humans at home. She’s here to test how comfortable we are sharing space with machines that almost feel alive.As reported by the SCMP, this AI robot is formed with an advanced AI allowing to perceive and act in the real world. Out of this, social media users react to this AI robot unveiled. With users reacting to the new AI robot unveiling announcement:More AI marriages coming soon 😂 Perfect to keep creepy neighbors at bay 😂Just wait for the first ai me too movement😂 She looks like she’s straight out of K-popThat's not close to a human, that's just uncanny","Chinese startup unveils world’s first ‘biomimetic AI robot’ Moya is a humanoid machine that doesn’t just look human, but tries to feel human too.

In yet another bold prediction, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that the cheapest place to put AI will be space, adding that it may happen as soon as 36 months. The tech billionaire recently appeared on Dwarkesh podcast where he discussed the economics of orbital data centers, the difficulties of scaling power on Earth, what it would take to manufacture humanoids at high-volume in America, among other topics. Stating that its “harder to scale on the ground than it is to scale in space,” Musk revealed his plans to build AI data centres in space. “You’re also going to get about five times the effectiveness of solar panels in space versus the ground, and you don’t need batteries,” he said.Elon Musk further stated that space does not “have a day-night cycle, seasonality, clouds, or an atmosphere”. “The atmosphere alone results in about a 30% loss of energy,” he added.“So any given solar panel can do about five times more power in space than on the ground. You also avoid the cost of having batteries to carry you through the night. It’s actually much cheaper to do in space,” the world’s richest person said.Elon Musk predicted that space will be by far the cheapest place to put AI. “It will be space in 36 months or less. Maybe 30 months.”When asked about GPU reliability during large-scale AI training, Elon Musk said hardware failures are less of a concern than many assume—and argued that the future of AI infrastructure may lie beyond Earth.Elon Musk said “..it depends on how recent the GPUs are that have arrived”.Musk explained that once GPUs pass this early testing phase and move beyond the initial debugging cycle—whether they are made by Nvidia, Tesla, or other chip makers such as those producing TPUs or Trainium chips—they tend to operate reliably over time. “Once they start working and you’re past the initial debug cycle… they’re quite reliable past a certain point,” he said.

Here’s the full post shared by OpenAI's head of compute infrastructure on LinkedIn

Our partnership with Nvidia is foundational. Nvidia is our most important partner for both training and inference, and our entire compute fleet runs on Nvidia GPUs. This is not a vendor relationship. It is deep, ongoing co-design. We build systems together, and our frontier models are the product of multi-year hardware and model engineering done side by side.

We scaled available compute from 0.2 GW in 2023 to 0.6 GW in 2024 to roughly 1.9 GW in 2025, and that pace is accelerating. Inference demand is growing exponentially with more users, more agents, and more always-on workloads. Nvidia continues to set the bar for performance, efficiency, and reliability for both training and inference.

The demand curve is unmistakable. The world needs orders of magnitude more compute.

That’s why we are anchoring on Nvidia as the core of our training and inference stack, while deliberately expanding the ecosystem around it through partnerships with Cerebras,

AMD

and Broadcom. This approach lets us move faster, deploy more broadly, and support the explosion of real-world use cases without sacrificing performance or reliability. The outcome is simple and durable: infrastructure that can carry frontier capability all the way into production, at global scale.

Amid speculation about Nvidia’s role in the company’s future, Sam Altman-led OpenAI has said that its partnership with Nvidia remains strong. In a recent LinkedIn post, OpenAI’s head of compute infrastructure Sachin Katti said Nvidia remains the AI company’s “most important partner for both training and inference”, describing the partnership as “foundational” rather than a typical supplier arrangement.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has told his employees during a town hall meeting on (February 5) that he is ‘deeply distraught’ by the present US approach to immigration and he has also promised to continue pressing lawmakers for reform, as reported by Bloomberg. “I’ve heard from some of you that don’t feel comfortable leaving your homes,” Cook said. “No one should feel this way. No one.” Cook also stressed on the fact that immigration is central to Apple ’s success, noting that many of its US-based team members are on visas. “For as long as I can remember, we have been a smarter, wiser, more innovative company because we’ve attracted the best and brightest from all corners of the world,” he said. “I am going to continue to lobby lawmakers on this issue. You have my word on that.”The Bloomberg report further revealed that replying to an employee worried about deportation and family separation, Cook expressed strong support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. “I love you if you’re on DACA,” he said, adding that Apple employs hundreds of DACA workers. “I will personally advocate for you.I am a huge believer in the program.”The remarks made by Cook are followed by a memo issued last week in which he said that he was ‘heartbroken’ by recent events in Minneapolis, where federal agents killed two people.

Infrastructure costs and funding pressure

Concerns over circular funding

Oracle recently shared a social media post clarifying that the company’s financial relationship with OpenAI is not affected by the Nvidia-OpenAI deal. Oracle shares were trading nearly 2% higher during the day when the company shared the 26-word post. However, soon after sharing the post, its shares witnessed a sharp reversal. By the end of trading, the stock closed down 2.79% at $160.06, wiping out an estimated $3.5 billion in market value in a single trading session.“The NVIDIA-OpenAI deal has zero impact on our financial relationship with OpenAI. We remain highly confident in OpenAI’s ability to raise funds and meet its commitments,” read the post shared by Oracle online.The X post was published shortly after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the widely reported $100 billion investment plan linked to OpenAI was “never a commitment” and would be approached “one step at a time.” According to a Bloomberg report, Nvidia is close to finalizing a $20 billion investment in the ChatGPT maker.Investors reportedly appeared to focus less on the wording of Oracle’s statement and more on the risks surrounding its large exposure to OpenAI.Oracle has disclosed a five-year cloud services agreement with OpenAI valued at roughly $300 billion, or about $60 billion per year starting in 2028.OpenAI’s reported revenue for 2025 was about $13 billion, significantly lower than the annual payments implied by the Oracle deal. Analysts and investors have questioned how the AI company will fund those commitments while continuing to spend heavily on computing infrastructure.To support OpenAI’s workloads, Oracle is expected to invest heavily in data centers, including a major facility in Abilene, Texas. Estimates suggest the project could require around 400,000 Nvidia GB200 chips, costing roughly $40 billion.Oracle has said it plans to raise up to $50 billion in debt and equity this year. In January, bondholders filed a lawsuit alleging the company did not fully disclose the need for additional funding. Credit rating agency Moody’s has also flagged counterparty risk related to Oracle’s AI investments.Market watchers have highlighted what they describe as a circular financing structure: Nvidia funds OpenAI, OpenAI pays Oracle for cloud services, and Oracle buys Nvidia chips to support OpenAI.

A legal plugin that spooked Wall Street

Opus 4.6 doubles down on exactly what spooked investors

Not everyone's buying the doom narrative

Anthropic, the AI startup whose workplace tool triggered a massive sell-off in software stocks earlier this week, has launched Claude Opus 4.6—its most powerful model yet. The timing couldn't be more loaded.The new model, announced Thursday, brings stronger coding abilities, a 1 million token context window (up from 200,000), and a feature called ""agent teams"" that lets multiple AI agents split tasks and work in parallel. Think of it as a virtual engineering squad that coordinates on its own. Opus 4.6 also supports outputs of up to 128,000 tokens, meaning it can handle much larger tasks without needing to break them into multiple requests.On benchmarks, the model outperforms OpenAI's GPT-5.2 on GDPval-AA, an evaluation of real-world knowledge work in finance, legal and other professional domains—precisely the sectors that just saw their stocks crater because of Anthropic's earlier product update. It also tops every other frontier model on BrowseComp, which measures a model's ability to dig up hard-to-find information online.Here's the backstory. Last Friday, Anthropic released a set of open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its AI assistant built for non-coders.Most covered standard business functions like sales and marketing. But one plugin, designed to automate contract reviews, NDA triage and legal briefings, sent shockwaves through the market.Thomson Reuters fell nearly 16% on Tuesday. LegalZoom crashed close to 20%. A Goldman Sachs basket of US software stocks dropped 6% in a single session—the worst since April. By the time the dust began to settle on Wednesday, roughly $830 billion had been wiped from the S&P 500 software and services index since January 28. Traders started calling it the ""SaaSpocalypse.""The fear wasn't just about legal tech. Investors saw Anthropic muscling into the enterprise application layer, threatening the subscription-based business models that power companies like Salesforce, Intuit and Adobe. Private equity firms with heavy software portfolios also took hits—Ares Management, KKR and Blue Owl Capital all dropped more than 9% in a single day.Now, with Opus 4.6, Anthropic is making its AI even better at the kind of work that triggered the panic. The model produces documents, spreadsheets and presentations that are closer to ""production-ready"" on the first try, the company says. It handles financial modelling, regulatory filings and long-form research with less hand-holding.Harvey, the legal AI startup, reported that Opus 4.6 scored 90.2% on its BigLaw Bench evaluation—the highest of any Claude model. Box said its testing showed a 10% lift in performance on multi-source analysis across legal, financial and technical content.Anthropic also introduced Claude in PowerPoint as a research preview, letting users build and edit slide decks directly within the app. The AI reads layouts, fonts and slide masters to stay on brand—a feature available on Max, Team and Enterprise plans.Scott White, Anthropic's head of product, told CNBC that the company is entering a ""vibe working"" era, where non-developers can hand real, significant work to AI. Enterprise customers already make up roughly 80% of Anthropic's business.Not everyone thinks the sky is falling. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the software sell-off ""the most illogical thing in the world,"" arguing AI will use existing tools rather than replace them. Google's Sundar Pichai struck a similar tone during his company's earnings call, saying companies that ""seize the moment"" will find the same opportunities ahead.But the market isn't fully convinced. Claude Opus 4.6 is available today on claude.ai, Anthropic's API and all major cloud platforms. Pricing stays at $5/$25 per million tokens. Whether it calms investors or spooks them further is the real test.","Anthropic launched Claude Opus 4.6 just days after its AI tools triggered a massive sell-off in software stocks.

Intel CEO on chip crisis



Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan sent a 'we are coming' kinda message to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this week. Lip-Bu Tan announced that Intel plans to build graphics processing units (GPUs), the category of chip popularized by Nvidia. ""I just hired the chief GPU architect, and he's very good. I'm very delighted he joined me,"" Tan said, claiming that it took some persuading. Demers was at Qualcomm for more than 13 years. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are the chips, made by the likes of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), power large language models and have seen demand skyrocket as companies race to build out artificial intelligence infrastructure and data centers.At the recent Cisco AI Summit, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced that the company will start producing graphics processing units (GPUs). These are more specialized processors, compared to the CPUs Intel traditionally produces, and are used for gaming and tasks like training artificial intelligence models. While Nvidia per se didn’t invent the GPU, these specific kind of AI chips have played a large role in the company's success.Intel has traditionally produced CPUs, processors with a limited number of cores, making them best suited for serial computing tasks. GPUs, such as those produced by Nvidia, have thousands of smaller cores and are used for parallel computing tasks, such as AI and high-performance computing.In an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the Summit, Tan said the GPU effort will target data centers. ""It's tied in with the data center,"" Tan told Reuters. ""We're working with customers, and will then define what the customer needs."" Over the past few years, American chipmaker has fallen behind major semiconductor players that have seen a boost from the AI data center buildout.In January this year, Qualcomm executive Eric Demmers joined Intel. ""I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as SVP, GPU architecture at Intel Corporation!,"" Demmers wrote on LinkedIn. Demmers will report to Kevork Kechichian, the executive vice president and general manager of Intel’s data center group.While Intel has been working to turn around its ailing foundry business in recent years, earlier this month, Intel CFO David Zinsner admitted that the company misjudged demand for data center CPUs and, as a result, was expecting to see a product shortage hit its “lowest level” in Q1, before improving in second quarter and beyond.Incidentally, Nvidia is a prospective customer for Intel’s factories. The company is also one of the top shareholders in Intel after a $5 billion investment last year. Intel and Nvidia agreed to work together to integrate Intel’s CPUs with Nvidia’s AI chips in Nvidia systems. The Trump government’s stake has increased by $14 billion since its deal with Intel was agreed to in August 2025. Nvidia’s stake has grown by more than $6 billion since its investment the following month.Talking of memory chip crisis, Intel CEO said that the computer industry’s memory-chip shortage is likely to persist for at least two years. “There’s no relief as far as I know,” he said. Tan said that he spoke to two of the key players in memory, who told him, “There’s no relief until 2028.”A massive expansion of artificial intelligence infrastructure has fueled demand for memory chips, decreasing the supply available to traditional computers and smartphones. That’s bringing shortages and price hikes — and potentially hurting customers’ appetite for the products.Intel is the largest maker of processors for personal computers, which rely on memory to store and manage data. The top memory manufacturers are Samsung Electronics Co., SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology Inc.","Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced that the company will start producing graphics processing units (GPUs) These are more specialized processors, compared to the CPUs Intel traditionally produces, and are used for gaming and tasks like training artificial intelligence models.

South Korea’s e-commerce giant Coupang has confirmed that the personal data of an additional 165,000 users was compromised in the country’s largest-ever hacking, which was reported in November. This latest discovery of cybersecurity disaster brings the total number of affected accounts to approximately 33.8 million, nearly two-thirds of the country's population.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Coupang Korea announced that the newly-identified victims were not part of a new cyberattack, but were uncovered during an government-led investigation into the massive breach.In November, Coupang said that personal information like the names, phone numbers and delivery addresses entered into address books were stolen. The company, however, reiterated that no payment details, login credentials, emails, or order histories were compromised. As a gesture of apology, Coupang plans to issue a 50,000 won (approx. $35) purchase voucher to every affected account holder.Meanwhile, the regulatory crackdown on Coupang, which has included police raids and tax audits, has sparked an aggressive response from Washington. US investors have filed arbitration claims under the KORUS Free Trade Agreement, accusing Seoul of “discriminatory treatment” against an American-listed firm.Meanwhile, as the company cooperates with the probe, its leadership has come under heavy fire. Harold Rogers, the interim American CEO of Coupang’s local unit, was recently summoned for police questioning regarding allegations of evidence tampering.South Korean President Lee Jae-myung has called the breach a “wake-up call” for the nation, advocating for the maximum legal penalty, which could cost Coupang over 1 trillion won ($680 million), or 3% of its annual revenue.","Coupang confirmed that personal data of an additional 165,000 users was compromised in the country’s largest-ever hacking, which was reported in November.

"As Amazon announces its results today, all eyes will be on AWS business and the reason is Microsoft",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/as-amazon-announces-its-results-today-all-eyes-will-be-on-aws-business-and-the-reason-is-microsoft/articleshow/127947578.cms,"What makes Amazon's Cloud revenue important

Amazon is set to announce its quarterly results today. According to a report in Bloomberg, all eyes will be on Amazon's cloud business which is Amazon Web Services (AWS). The reason for the same is reported to be Microsoft. Software giant Microsoft plunged last week due in part to slowing growth at its key cloud-computing platform, Azure. The all-important growth statistic for Azure and other cloud services came in at 39%, below StreetAccount’s 39.4% consensus. Microsoft’s finance chief, Amy Hood, argued that the cloud result could have been higher if it had allocated more data center infrastructure to customers rather than prioritizing its in-house needs. “If I had taken the GPUs that just came online in Q1 and Q2 in terms of GPUs and allocated them all to Azure, the KPI would have been over 40,” she said.Amazon shareholders are said to be seeking catalysts for a stock that has been languishing for a while. Amazon was the worst performer among the Magnificent Seven tech giants in 2025, rising just 5.2%, and is up less than 1% to start 2026. By comparison, the Nasdaq 100 Index jumped 20% in 2025, while the S&P 500 Index gained 16%.On the positive side, Amazon stock is slightly outperforming both these this year, so far.According to Bloomberg, Wall Street expects Amazon to report a 21% year-over-year increase in AWS revenue in the fourth quarter to $34.8 billion. For the company as a whole, analysts project a 13% jump in fourth-quarter revenue to $211.5 billion and an 8% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.40. While Amazon’s other revenue lines could cushion an AWS miss, the cloud business is still likely to command the most investor focus and scrutiny.David Miller, chief investment officer at Catalyst Funds, which holds Amazon shares in several portfolios, told Bloomberg, “It isn’t clear how much of Microsoft’s disappointment might be due to company-specific issues and how much might reflect an overall slowing in the cloud space.” He added, “If it’s the latter, that could carry over.”Microsoft’s aggressive AI-related capital expenditures, alongside the slowing Azure growth, made investors and analysts question when these investments will pay off more substantially. “It’s really about what’s already priced into the stock, and I think what was starting to price in for [Microsoft] was a higher growth rate, which is always a little dangerous,” said Melissa Otto, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “We haven’t really seen Amazon moving up in the same way.”","All eyes will be on Amazon's cloud business which is Amazon Web Services (AWS) Microsoft plunged last week due in part to slowing growth at its key cloud- computing platform, Azure.

Yann LeCun criticises research secrecy

Disagreement on AGI and OpenAI’s role

Wider debate in the AI community

Meta’s former chief AI scientist Yann LeCun has publicly questioned OpenAI ’s claims around achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) following a social media exchange with OpenAI vice president Sebastien Bubeck. The discussion, which unfolded on X (formerly Twitter), highlighted differences over research transparency and whether any single company can deliver AGI. LeCun criticised OpenAI’s approach to conducting research largely behind closed doors and later rejected the idea that AGI would emerge from one organisation or a single breakthrough, stating that OpenAI does not have a monopoly on innovation.The exchange began when Bubeck described OpenAI as the “best research environment” he has worked in. He said the company offers “freedom to explore” ideas, access to advanced tools, and operates in a field rich with research opportunities.“I've been in lots of places in my career. OAI is simply the best research environment I have ever seen,” Bubeck wrote, calling the setup “special.”Yann LeCun responded by questioning OpenAI’s culture of secrecy. He argued that research loses its value if it is not openly shared.“Except for the whole ‘don’t tell anyone about your research’ part,” LeCun wrote. “Research in secret is not research.”Bubeck defended OpenAI’s approach by referencing mathematician Andrew Wiles, who worked privately for years before proving Fermat’s Last Theorem.“So when Wiles worked in secret on Fermat’s last theorem for 7 years he wasn’t doing research?” Bubeck asked.LeCun replied that Wiles ultimately published his work. “He published a paper about it once he had a proof,” he said.During the conversation, Sebastien Bubeck suggested that achieving AGI could take several years. “It might take us more than 7 years to accomplish our own goal (AGI), we shall see!” he wrote.Yann LeCun dismissed the idea that AGI would result from a single effort or company. “It’s not going to be a singular event resulting from a single magic-bullet idea,” he said, adding, “Also, it won’t come from OpenAI.”The exchange reflects broader debates in the AI community over openness, competition, and the future of advanced AI systems. While OpenAI has increasingly limited access to its most advanced research, figures like LeCun continue to argue for open scientific collaboration.The discussion highlights ongoing disagreements about how AI research should be conducted and who, if anyone, will lead the development of AGI.","Yann LeCun criticises OpenAI’s approach to conducting research behind closed doors.

Expressive Speech

language support expanded to 27 languages

Viewers choose ‘Preferred Language’

YouTube is getting AI-Powered lip sync

Creator-centric updates

Google-owned YouTube has announced updates to auto-dubbing tool. The company says that these new features are designed to make “global stories feel local”, expanding the service to all creators and increasing its language library. According to the company, the reception of the technology is increasing: In December 2025 alone, the platform averaged more than 6 million daily viewers who watched at least 10 minutes of auto-dubbed content.“Discovering new creators shouldn’t require a translator. Now, exploring content from all over the world is as easy as pressing play,” the company said in an announcement.One of the most significant upgrades is the expansion of Expressive Speech– a feature that moves beyond the flat, mechanical voices in favour of a creator’s original emotion, tone and energy. Expressive Speech is now available for all channels in 27, moving from eight core languages: English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.Recognising that many users are multilingual or prefer original audio, YouTube has introduced a Preferred Language setting. The platform typically defaults to a language based on users' watch history but they can now manually set preferences, ensuring that they want to hear a creator’s original voice or a specific dialect.To solve the visual “disconnect” often found in dubbed media, YouTube has begun testing a Lip Sync pilot. This technology subtly modifies the pixels on the screen to match the speaker’s lip movements to the translated audio.“To make auto dubs even more natural, we’re currently testing a Lip Sync pilot that subtly matches the speaker’s lip movements to the translated audio so a dubbed video feels as seamless as watching the original,” YouTube said.YouTube also emphasised that it has made some improvements for the creator community:First is automatic smart filtering, wherein the AI now recognises content that shouldn't be dubbed, such as music videos or silent vlogs, to preserve the video’s original intent. The second improvement is discovery friendly auto dubbed tracks that do not negatively impact the original video’s algorithm.“We are committed to giving creators full agency over how their stories are told in every language, while providing viewers with the flexibility to choose how they listen. Experience the next generation of global storytelling — keep an eye out for auto-dubbing on your next video,” YouTube said.Creators can also provide their own dubs or turn them off completely.","Google-owned YouTube has announced updates to auto-dubbing tool.

The Google-Wiz discovery: An 'Open Book' database



A day after Google-acquired cybersecurity company Wiz revealed that Moltbook, a social media platform for Moltbots (or AI agents) has leaked the personal information like API tokens and emails, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) issued a high-level security alert, warning domestic enterprises and developers of “significant security risks” associated with the deployment of autonomous AI agents.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the MIIT alert specifically pointed to OpenClaw (also known as Moltbot or Clawdbot) that improper configurations and default settings in these autonomous agents may serve as a gateway for large-scale cyberattacks and sensitive data leaks.Moltbook has seen its popularity grow exponentially, and Chinese technology enthusiasts, with cloud service providers are rushing to offer hosting solutions. China's largest cloud service providers, including Alibaba Alicloud and Tencent Cloud, and Baidu have even launched services allowing users to rent servers to run OpenClaw remotely.However, the ministry cautioned that organisations deploying OpenClaw must conduct thorough audits of public network exposure, implement robust identity authentication and access controls.The first alarm was first raised by Wiz, the cybersecurity firm currently being acquired by Google (Alphabet).In a detailed research report, Wiz revealed that Moltbook had unknowingly left a database entirely public, allowing full read and write access to the platform’s core data.It explained that 1.5 Million API tokens, which are critical credentials, were accessible that allow attackers to hijack AI agents and gain access to the third-party services. Furthermore, over 35,000 personal email addresses human “owners” of the bots were also leaked.Moreover, private messages between AI agents that contained sensitive context about their owners' daily lives and proprietary code snippets were also leaked.The Moltbook disaster has placed the trend of “Vibe Coding” under scrutiny with Wiz co-founder Ami Luttwak was blunt about the trade-off.“As we see over and over again with vibe coding, although it runs very fast, many times people forget the basics of security,” Luttwak noted. He explained that because the AI followed the ""vibe"" of building a social network quickly, it neglected fundamental identity verification and security guardrails.","China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) issued a high- level security alert, warning domestic enterprises and developers of “significant security risks” associated with the deployment of autonomous AI agents.

Bharat Taxi 2-month pilot in Delhi-NCR



Bharat Taxi, a cooperative-led ride-hailing platform, has officially been launched in India -- two months after a successful pilot operation. Launched by home minister Amit Shah on Thursday (February 5), the service has been initially launched in Delhi-NCR and Gujarat, and will be expanded across all states and Union Territories within three years.“In three years, Bharat Taxi will be rolled out across the country, from Kashmir to Kanniyakumari and Dwarka to Kamakhya,” Shah said after launching the platform.Shah also noted that the profits will be shared with drivers associated with Bharat Taxi.“I said that when this cooperative taxi initiative began, we did not realise how big it would become, but in the coming years it will grow across the country and benefit taxi drivers. I clarified that the government is not entering the taxi sector; this is a cooperative initiative, and the taxi drivers themselves are its owners. I emphasised that every driver associated with this cooperative taxi will have ownership, and it will work for their welfare,” he added.Customers can hail cars, three-wheelers and two-wheelers through the platform, and Bharat Taxi will compete with players like Uber, Ola and Rapido.Bharat Taxi operates on a zero-commission and surge-free pricing model with direct profit distribution among drivers, positioning the platform as an indigenous alternative to foreign investment-based ride-hailing platforms.According to the ministry, Bharat Taxi has emerged as the world's first and largest cooperative-based ride-hailing platform, and the world's largest driver-owned mobility platform.According to news agency PTI, over 3 lakh drivers have joined the platform since the launch of its pilot programme, and more than 1 lakh users have registered. Further, more than 10,000 rides have been completed daily in Delhi-NCR and Gujarat.Around Rs 10 crore has been distributed directly to drivers so far. The drivers are called 'Sarathis', and the platform is said to prioritise social security for drivers through health insurance, accident insurance, retirement savings and a dedicated support system. Support centres operate at seven locations in Delhi.","Bharat Taxi, a cooperative-led ride-hailing platform, has officially been launched in India.

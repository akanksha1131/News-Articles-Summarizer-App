French court orders complete ban on these popular porn websites; but leaves a technical loophole,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/french-court-orders-complete-ban-on-these-popular-porn-websites-but-leaves-a-technical-loophole/articleshow/115782038.cms,"Representative Image

These four websites included:

French court order blanket block on 4 porn websites

In a recent effort to protect minors, the Paris Court of Appeal had reportedly ordered French internet service providers (ISPs) to block four pornographic websites lacking robust age verification systems. According to a report in Tech Crunch, ""When the Paris Court of Appeal recently blocked four porn sites in France for not having a proper age verification system, the two online child protection nonprofits that had pushed for the blocks probably thought they’d scored a big victory. But in one case, it turned out to be a bit of a self-own.""* Iciporno* Mrsexe* Tukif* and xHamster.However, a technicality has resulted in an incomplete block. While the court order targeted all four websites, the complaint against xHamster mistakenly listed only the French subdomain "" As a consequence, ISPs have complied with the order by blocking only the French version of the site. The main xHamster website remains accessible in France.This unintended loophole leaves a gap in the court's attempt to restrict access to adult content. French authorities, specifically the regulator Arcom, are now tasked with finding a way to close this loophole and fully implement the court order.Earlier this week, the Paris Court of Appeal ordered the complete blocking of several pornographic websites, including Xhamster and Tukif. The court passed the order over their failure to roll out foolproof age verification systems.As per a report in Politico, the Court of Appeal said in its order that children's general interest was ""an overriding consideration which may justify infringement of other rights such as freedom of expression or communication."" ""Giving priority to the protection of the private lives of adult consumers, by ruling out age verification, is incompatible with the protection of minors,"" the court added in its order.",French court order blanket block on 4 porn websites.

Unacademy CEO Gaurav Munjal recently criticized the language-learning app Duolingo in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). Highlighting his personal experience with the app, Munjal shared, “A few months ago, I achieved a 100-day streak on Duolingo for Spanish. However, I still couldn’t speak or write even a few sentences in Spanish.” Using this example, he explained the motivation behind creating Airlearn , a new learning platform aimed at addressing the gaps he observed in existing language education tools.He said that the Airlearn app is a “Language Learning Product that actually helps you learn the Language instead of being a status symbol for a virtual reward which is the Streak.”He said that the first problem with Duolingo is the over simplification of the problem statement. Duolingo does not teach you basic concepts of grammar. “It just makes you do the exercises with the hope that you’ll learn them on your own.”“Whereas Airlearn’s Teaching Slides make sure that you know the Concept first. Our Users love these Slides,” he pointed.He further added “We believe that AI will change personalised tutoring. But it won’t be just about gamification or make you do exercises. It will be about teaching you like a Tutor sitting in front of you will teach. And that’s the design principle we follow while building Airlearn.”In the posts, Munjal also shared multiple screenshots of users’ reviews of Airlearn claiming “Everyday we are making more and more people switch from Duolingo to Airlearn.”Earlier this month, Munjal shared an X post where he revealed that 1 million lessons were completed on Airlearn in October this year. He said that the majority of the Users are from the US, while “Spanish and French are the most popular languages.”","Unacademy CEO Gaurav Munjal recently criticized the language-learning app Duolingo in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) Highlighting his personal experience with the app, he shared, “A few months ago, I achieved a 100-day streak on Duoingo for Spanish.

CCI launches probe against Google on Winzo's complaint; accuses company of throwing startups out of business in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cci-launches-probe-against-google-on-winzos-complaint-accuses-company-of-throwing-startups-out-of-business-in-india/articleshow/115774891.cms,"The memo became the first salvo in a 15-year campaign by Google to make deletion the default in its internal communications

What CCI's order against Google says

What Winzo said on CCI order

In a potential blow to Google's dominance in the app market, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has launched an investigation into the tech giant. Online gaming company Winzo has accused Google of abusing its power by restricting real-money gaming apps on the Play Store.Winzo claims that Google's policies force developers to distribute their apps through sideloading, a less secure method. This, according to Winzo, not only limits consumer choice but also poses security risks. The gaming company claimed that due to this unreasonable and restrictive policy of Google, all apps offering real money games of skill are only available for download from their website (a process called sideloading).In an order, the regulator has asked its director general to wrap up the investigation and submit a consolidated report within 60 days. “On a holistic consideration of the facts and circumstances of the present case, the Commission is of the prima facie view that Google appears to be in violation of Sections 4(2)(a)(i), 4(2)(b), and 4(2)(c) of the (Competition) Act, as detailed in this order, which warrants detailed investigation,” the CCI said in the order.“Thus, the informant’s (Winzo's) app can only be downloaded using its website. It has been submitted that when users access the website for downloading the Informant’s app on Android devices, a disclaimer/warning is displayed,” the order said, citing Winzo’s claim.“As per the informant, the aforesaid warning is peculiar to the Google operated Android OS and lack any merit or reason and is completely illegal. The same is claimed to be not only misleading which tarnishes Informant’s market reputation but also is an active misrepresentation resulting in loss of business,” the order said.In a statement, Saumya Singh Rathore, Co-founder WinZO games, said, “The CCI's order is a step toward restoring fairness in the digital ecosystem. Monopolistic practices stifle innovation and hinder competition, which are the lifeblood of any thriving industry. This decision is a significant move to ensure equitable opportunities for all players, fostering innovation and creating a level playing field that benefits both businesses and consumers. The Google Playstore policy to include only Fantasy & Rummy, and Ads Policy to allow only Fantasy & Rummy businesses to advertise on internet, effectively distorts the market as the pilot was live for only two selected categories, driven by monopolistic practices. For example, 95% of the fantasy market is owned by a single player, and 90% of the rummy market is owned by three players. The policy caused the marketing and customer acquisition costs for the selected games to drop to a quarter of the previous spends, disproportionately benefiting the margins of these businesses over others. This had a far-reaching impact when the GST was hiked by 400%. The format included in the policy, ie Fantasy & Rummy could absorb the higher GST regime due to improved margins with this distortion, unlike many other players who did not benefit from this policy further distorting the market dynamics and ability to compete in a fair market. User acquisition and marketing costs constitute more than 60-70% of businesses' expenditures. When the margins for these players increased significantly due to cheaper distribution from Google Playstore, the margins for non-DFS and rummy players did not improve proportionately. This policy has a far-reaching impact on disrupting the market and throwing many early stage ventures out of business. Innovation and creation thrives on fair market conditions, which is what we are fighting for as a business.”","The Competition Commission of India has launched an investigation into the tech giant.

"Income tax department launches PAN Card 2.0 with QR code: Is existing PAN card invalid, fees, why QR code and all other important questions answered",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/pan-card-2-0-with-qr-code-is-existing-pan-card-invalid-fees-why-qr-code-and-all-other-important-questions-answered/articleshow/115733038.cms,"Citizens need not worry about reapplying for a new PAN card. (Representative image)

What is PAN 2.0

What is the purpose of QR code on the new PAN card

What is the data that can be accessed by scanning QR code on a PAN card

Do I need to apply for the new PAN card

What is the fees if want to upgrade to new PAN card

Will my old PAN card become invalid

Why is the government upgrading the PAN system

What about the people holding more than one PAN card

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved the Income Tax Department’s Permanent Account Number (PAN) 2.0 Project. This project aims to streamline and modernise the process of issuing and managing PAN and TAN, making it more user-friendly and efficient. In line with the Budget 2023 announcement, the government has decided to make PAN the ""common business identifier"" for all digital systems of specified govt agencies. Although it is illegal to have more than one PAN, there are several entities and individuals, who violate the law and the government is hoping that once the project is rolled out, it will be easier to check such instances. Currently there is a database of 78 crore PANs and 73.3 lakh TANs in the country. Here's all you need to know about the PAN Card 2.0 .PAN 2.0 is a significant upgrade to India's Permanent Account Number (PAN) system. This initiative aims to modernize the PAN system by introducing a unified digital platform. It will streamline PAN-related services, enhance security, and improve overall taxpayer experience. Currently, PAN-related services are spread across three different platforms: the e-Filing Portal, UTIITSL Portal, and Protean e-Gov Portal. With the implementation of PAN 2.0, all these services will be integrated into a single, unified portal. This one-stop platform will handle comprehensively issues/matters related to PAN and TAN, including application, updates, corrections, Aadhaar-PAN linking, re-issuance requests, and even online PAN validation. By doing so, the Income Tax Department endeavours to simplify processes, eliminate delays, and improve grievance redressal mechanisms.The QR code helps in validating the PAN and PAN details. Incidentally, the QR code is not a new feature. QR codes have been incorporated in the PAN cards since 2017-18. The same will be continued under the PAN 2.0 project with enhancements (dynamic QR code which will display the latest data present in the PAN database). PAN holders having an old PAN Card without QR code have an option to apply for a new card with QR code in existing PAN 1.0 eco-system as well as in the PAN 2.0.On reading through the reader application, complete details, i.e., photo, signature, Name, Father’s Name / Mother’s Name and Date of Birth is displayed.No, you do not need to apply for a new PAN card. Your existing PAN card will remain valid. Your existing PAN card will remain valid under PAN 2.0 project and you will automatically receive an electronic version of the card in your mail ID, without having to apply for it.There are no fees. You can opt to upgrade your PAN card to the new design with a QR code at no additional cost. But those seeking a physical card, however, will have to apply and pay Rs 50 for it if they live within the country.No, your old PAN card will not become invalid unless it is not linked to your Aadhaar number. The absence of a QR code on your PAN card will not affect its validity.The government aims to make the PAN system more efficient, secure, and user-friendly. By modernizing the system, the government hopes to improve tax compliance and reduce administrative burdens.As per the provisions of Income-Tax Act, 1961, no person can hold more than one PAN. In case a person holds more than one PAN, he/she is obliged to bring it to the notice of the Jurisdictional Assessing officer and get the additional PAN deleted/de-activated. In the PAN 2.0, with the improved systems logic for identification of potential duplicate requests for PAN and centralized and enhanced mechanism for resolving the duplicates would minimize the instances of one person holding more than one PAN.","PAN 2.0 is a significant upgrade to India's Permanent Account Number (PAN) system.

During his election campaigns, Trump mentioned twice about calling Pichai.In an interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait last month, Trump said that he called Google CEO Sundar Pichai to highlight alleged biases in Google search, claiming it only shows negative stories about him. He then said “I called the head of Google the other day and I said, ‘I’m getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don’t find them in Google’,” he said. Pichai, Trump said in the interview, told him that “you’re the No. 1 person on all of Google for stories”.Also read: Donald Trump: I called Google CEO Sundar Pichai the other day and said ...

Microsoft denies using customer data to train AI models; says ‘These claims are untrue’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-denies-using-customer-data-to-train-ai-models-says-these-claims-are-untrue/articleshow/115771274.cms,"This is a representational image

What was the issue

Here’s what Microsoft said

Microsoft has refuted allegations that it uses customer data from its Microsoft 365 applications, such as Word and Excel, to train artificial intelligence models, reports Reuters. Recently, social media users raised concerns about the company’s ""connected experiences"" feature, claiming it required users to opt out and speculating that the data might be used for AI training. Microsoft has now dismissed these claims, emphasizing its commitment to data privacy.The misunderstanding stemmed from a privacy setting in Microsoft Office that enables “optional connected experiences,” allowing features like online image searches or accessing internet-based information, as described by Microsoft. This setting, which is turned on by default, does not mention AI training in its disclosure.Additionally, a Microsoft learning document dated October 21, 2024, added to the confusion by listing various connected experiences in Office that “analyze your content” without clearly stating that it excludes training Large Language Models (LLMs).In an emailed statement to Reuters, a Microsoft spokesperson said “These claims are untrue. Microsoft does not use customer data from Microsoft 365 consumer and commercial applications to train foundational large language models”.The spokesperson further added that the ""connected experiences"" enables features such as co-authoring and cloud storage, and has no connection to how the software giant trains its large language models.Microsoft communications head, Frank Shaw, also addressed the issue on Bluesky, debunking the claims and reaffirming that customer data from Microsoft 365 applications is not used to train AI models. He said “In the M365 apps, we do not use customer data to train LLMs,” the Microsoft 365 X account said, responding to claims. ‘This setting only enables features requiring internet access like co-authoring a document’”.","Microsoft has refuted allegations that it uses customer data from its Microsoft 365 applications, such as Word and Excel, to train artificial intelligence models.

Google attacks Epic Games

What Epic Games has to say

Google has appealed a court ruling that mandates significant changes to its Play app store. The tech giant filed its argument with the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, claiming the trial judge made “legal errors” that unfairly favoured Epic Games, the creator of “Fortnite”.“This case involves an extraordinary attempt by a lone competitor to use the federal judiciary to restructure the day-to-day operations of Google’s app store, Google Play, and to unilaterally reshape markets with consequences for millions of non-parties,” Google said in its filing.Google contends that the ordered redesign of Google Play and its Android operating system will harm both app developers and consumers.“If not reversed, the injunction and the flawed liability ruling underlying it will directly undercut Google’s efforts to compete against Apple and the iPhone, a competitive dynamic that has spurred innovation and brought concrete benefits to consumers around the world,” Google added.The legal battle between the two companies stems from a 2020 lawsuit filed by Epic Games, accusing Google of monopolising app distribution and in-app payments on Android devices. A San Francisco jury sided with Epic, finding that Google illegally suppressed competition.Based on the jury's verdict, US District Judge James Donato ordered Google to allow users to download competing app stores within Google Play and make Play's app catalog accessible to those competitors. This order, which would be in effect for three years, is currently on hold pending the appeal.In its filing, Google emphasised that the court-ordered changes to its app store would negatively impact millions of users, arguing that these changes will introduce new security risks and violate the intellectual property rights of countless app developers.In its appeal, Google argues that the case should not have gone to trial because Epic sought an injunction rather than monetary damages. Google also claims the judge unfairly allowed Epic to portray Google and Apple as non-competitors in the app distribution and payment space.“There is no finding that the terms of the States’ settlement do not fully redress any injury Epic Case claims, which was rooted in the same challenged conduct. Remarkably, the District Court did not even analyze whether Epic had Article III standing to seek injunctive relief,” the company said.Furthermore, Google objects to the nationwide scope of the injunction, asserting that it should only apply to Epic Games.“It is time for this Court to step in. The jury verdict rests on an impermissible foundation given the District Court’s series of independent reversible legal errors before and during the trial. And the resulting injunction is independently unprecedented, unreasoned, and unlawful. This Court should reverse,” the tech giant added.The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments in the case on February 3, with a ruling expected sometime next year.Epic Games, in response, dismissed Google's appeal as a ""meritless"" attempt to avoid complying with the jury's decision.“This meritless appeal is Google’s desperate attempt to avoid complying with the unanimous jury decision,” Epic said in a statement, as per news agency Reuters.",Google has appealed a court ruling that mandates significant changes to its Play app store.

Unlike traditional quick commerce players who rely on dark stores, Pincode connects neighborhood kirana stores directly with consumers, creating an asset-light model that reduces inventory and warehouse management costs.Flipkart's recent launch of Minutes in Bengaluru, further signals the intensifying quick commerce landscape. The service is currently delivering products in 8-16 minutes in select areas like HSR and Bellandur, offering free delivery for orders above Rs 99. With Pincode, Walmart seems to be doubling up on its efforts.According to sources cited by Inc42, Pincode will leverage its own delivery executives and logistics partners like Shadowfax and Loadshare to fulfill orders. During the pilot phase, customers can order a diverse range of products including groceries, personal care items, and sports equipment, all promised within a swift 10-20 minute window.The launch comes amid an increasingly competitive market, with major players like Zepto, Blinkit , and Swiggy Instamart aggressively expanding their services. Zepto has raised over $1.3 billion in 2024, while Swiggy and Zomato are investing heavily in infrastructure to capture market share. The quick commerce market projected to reach approximately $7 billion by 2024. Reports say that Amazon is also planning to enter the quick delivery segment with Tez.","Pincode connects neighborhood kirana stores directly with consumers, creating an asset-light model that reduces inventory and warehouse management costs.

How and why you need to check duplicate PAN card issued under your name

How to surrender duplicate PAN card

Other PAN number and Aadhaar card mistakes that can lead to penalty

The government has announced the PAN 2.0 project. PAN Card 2.0 will be rolled out free of cost to all taxpayers. In line with the Budget 2023 announcement, the government has decided to make PAN the ""common business identifier"" for all digital systems of specified government agencies. With the new PAN system, it is now easier for the government departments to detect if a person possesses more than one PAN card as well as if someone has given a wrong PAN number. Both of these are offences and may lead to imposition of Rs 10,000 penalty. According to taxation experts, the PAN 2.0 has in-built security measures like dynamic QR code which will automatically detect duplicate PAN cards as well as any wrong information given.Under section 272B of the Income Tax Act, 1961, no Indian citizen is allowed to own multiple PAN numbers. Anyone found with a duplicate PAN number may be asked to pay a penalty of Rs 10,000. The government has the technology necessary to check for duplicate PANs. ""As per the provisions of Income-tax Act, 1961, no person can hold more than one PAN. In case a person holds more than one PAN, he/she is obliged to bring it to the notice of the Jurisdictional Assessing officer and get the additional PAN deleted/de-activated. In the PAN 2.0, with the improved systems logic for identification of potential duplicate requests for PAN and centralized and enhanced mechanism for resolving the duplicates would minimize the instances of one person holding more than one PAN,"" said the ministry of finance in a press release dated November 26, 2024.There have been cases where people take out fake documents including a PAN in someone else's name and even set up companies, etc. Instances of GST fraud, input tax credit fraud etc have been reported where fraudulent companies have used fraudulent documents. Many of these fraudulent companies have been caught with duplicate PANs where the original PAN holder had no idea about his name and details being misused. So, it is important to find out if any duplicate PAN has been issued in your name and get it deactivated.Chartered Accountant Mihir Tanna told Economic Times that one can check if they have a duplicate PAN by either approaching the jurisdictional assessing officer or using the e-filing ITR portal's 'PAN status check' functionality. The PAN status check functionality can be accessed on the income tax e-filing portal.According to Protean website, ""You may fill and submit PAN Change Request application form by mentioning the PAN which you are using currently on top of the form. All other PAN/s inadvertently allotted to you should be mentioned at item no. 11 of the form and the corresponding PAN card copy/s should be submitted for cancellation along with the form.""Under the same Section of the Income Tax Act, the income tax department can impose a penalty of Rs 10,000 if anyone is found to have given an incorrect PAN number. This provision is applicable when you are filing your income tax return (ITR) or in other cases where it is mandatory to quote a PAN card number for carrying out. Also, in case you do not remember PAN, you may also quote the Aadhaar card number as the two documents are interchangeable. The Rs 10,000 penalty is also applicable in case a wrong Aadhaar number is given instead of PAN. Besides this, an individual can also be fined for failing to quote a PAN or Aadhaar number in transactions where it is mandatory.So in case you have got two PAN cards, it is advisable to surrender one as soon as possible. Also, if you are not sure whether you have a duplicate PAN issued using your documents, then it might be a good idea to check right now.","PAN Card 2.0 will be rolled out free of cost to all taxpayers.

Legacy of vision and innovation

The Indian IT industry, a cornerstone of the country’s modern economic growth, owes much to the fortuitous meeting of two visionaries, Nandan Nilekani and Narayana Murthy , in 1978. This pivotal encounter at Patni Computer Systems in Pune marked the beginning of a transformative partnership that would give rise to Infosys, one of India’s most successful companies. Fresh out of IIT Bombay, Nilekani’s journey was shaped by personal choices, unexpected turns, and the charisma of Narayana Murthy. Together, they not only built a globally recognized IT giant but also redefined India’s role in the technology-driven world.In 1978, Nandan Nilekani, a recent electrical engineering graduate from IIT Bombay, found himself at a crossroads. Illness had derailed his plans for graduate studies abroad, leaving him uncertain about his next steps. It was during this period of exploration that he encountered Patni Computer Systems, a pioneering firm at the time transitioning from mainframes to mini computers.At Patni’s modest Pune office, Nilekani met Narayana Murthy, who was leading the software division. This meeting would prove to be life-changing. Nilekani later described Murthy as an ambitious leader with the ability to set inspiring goals. “He was charismatic,” Nilekani recalled. “If he had asked me to jump off a cliff, I would have done it.”Murthy’s approach to hiring was unconventional yet effective. During their meeting, Murthy posed problem-solving questions to Nilekani. “Fortunately, I managed to answer them correctly,” Nilekani said. Impressed by the young graduate’s analytical skills, Murthy offered him a job on the spot.For Nilekani, this was not just a job—it was an entry point into the burgeoning world of computing, which was rapidly evolving in the late 1970s. This experience laid the groundwork for the eventual founding of Infosys, where Nilekani became one of the six co-founders.Nilekani’s journey to this pivotal moment was shaped by a mix of rebellion and circumstance. Years earlier, he defied his father’s wish for him to join IIT Madras, opting instead for IIT Bombay to pursue electrical engineering. Reflecting on this decision, Nilekani described it as a “small act of rebellion,” one that inadvertently set him on the path to meeting Murthy and immersing himself in the world of technology.In 1981, just a few years after their initial meeting, Nilekani and Murthy, along with four other colleagues, co-founded Infosys. Their shared vision was to create a company that could leverage India’s burgeoning talent pool to provide software solutions to global clients.Under Murthy’s leadership and Nilekani’s strategic acumen, Infosys grew from a small startup into a multinational corporation, symbolizing the rise of India as an IT powerhouse. The company became a leader in outsourcing and software services, employing thousands and inspiring generations of entrepreneurs in India.Today, the story of Nilekani and Murthy serves as a testament to how chance encounters, combined with vision and determination, can lead to transformative outcomes. Nilekani’s admiration for Murthy’s leadership continues to resonate. As he once said, “Working with him was an incredible experience that shaped my career and life in ways I couldn’t have imagined.”This historic partnership not only launched Infosys but also contributed significantly to India’s reputation as a global IT hub. It stands as a reminder of the power of mentorship, ambition, and shared goals in shaping industries and lives alike.","Nandan Nilekani and Narayana Murthy met at Patni Computer Systems in Pune, India, in 1978.

"Microsoft's cloud and AI business is in trouble, but how this Elon Musk prediction may be ‘good news’ for the company",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-cloud-and-ai-business-is-in-trouble-but-how-this-elon-musk-prediction-may-be-good-news-for-the-company/articleshow/115756166.cms,"Trump administration could bring some changes in the tech industry landscape, including a new FTC chair

The Federal Trade Commission has launched a comprehensive antitrust investigation into Microsoft , with world's richest man Elon Musk calling for FTC Chair Lina Khan 's immediate dismissal and suggesting the probe may be short-lived under an incoming Trump administration.The agency has delivered a detailed, hundreds-of-pages-long information request examining Microsoft's cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity products. Bloomberg first reported the investigation, which targets the company's complex business practices and market dominance.The investigation focuses on Microsoft's bundling of cloud services with office and security tools, potentially creating unfair market advantages. Competitors have complained that the company's licensing terms and software packaging make it difficult for rivals to compete effectively.Microsoft's wide-ranging technology portfolio – including its Azure cloud platform, AI technologies like Copilot, and extensive cybersecurity services – falls under intense scrutiny. The investigation echoes previous antitrust challenges, reminiscent of the landmark Department of Justice lawsuit in the late 1990s.Trump's anticipated administration could significantly alter the regulatory landscape. Unlike the current administration's aggressive approach to big tech, the incoming president is expected to appoint a more business-friendly FTC chair, potentially softening the investigation's impact.The company has largely avoided the intense antitrust scrutiny faced by other tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Google. However, this investigation reopens questions about Microsoft's market power and competitive practices.Elon Musk, a supporter of President-elect Donald Trump , has publicly supported Republican criticism of Khan, declaring ""She will be fired soon"" in response to a House Oversight Committee report accusing her of abusing regulatory authority.Sources familiar with the matter reveal that the FTC has been conducting informal interviews with Microsoft's business partners and competitors for over a year. The probe's timing is critical, coinciding with Khan's expected departure when President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office in January.Microsoft declined to comment on the ongoing investigation. The FTC's action represents a final attempt by Khan to challenge corporate consolidation before a likely shift in the agency's leadership and regulatory approach. The changing political backdrop suggests Microsoft may soon face a more lenient regulatory environment.","The Federal Trade Commission has launched a comprehensive antitrust investigation into Microsoft.

Android Auto bug affecting other apps for some users



A new Android Auto bug is reportedly adding an unexpected ""oh"" to the end of WhatsApp messages that are being read aloud. According to a report by 9to5Google, several users have reported this issue on Reddit. These users claimed to notice the extra word despite it not being present in the original message. This bug affects the functionality that reads incoming messages aloud, which is a popular feature of Android Auto.While the exact cause remains unknown, this issue was reported only by some users which suggests that not all users were affected by the bug. Also, the bug appears to be specifically affecting WhatsApp messages and has reportedly persisted for several weeks for some, the report.However, it's important to note that that bug is not affecting WhatsApp’s functionality in Android Auto, yet the bug is certainly a frustrating quirk. Google is yet to acknowledge this issue and the report also didn’t reveal any information on when a fix may become available for affected users.Another Reddit user named Grant Son shared a thread where others have complained that the bug is affecting multiple messaging apps on Android Auto. These users noted that along with WhatsApp, the bug affected other apps like Teams, Facebook, and even Google Messages.The report also didn’t mention anything about the exact cause and trigger conditions of the bug. Despite numerous user reports on Reddit, similar complaints haven't surfaced on Google's support forums, and no recordings of the bug have been shared.While mostly harmless, the bug could potentially cause issues with things like two-factor authentication codes. Until a fix is available, users can avoid the problem by waiting to check messages until after reaching their destination.","A new Android Auto bug is reportedly adding an unexpected ""oh"" to the end of WhatsApp messages that are being read aloud.

"Indonesia refuses to remove ban on iPhone 16 series; we need a ...., says industry minister",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indonesia-refuses-to-remove-ban-on-iphone-16-series-we-need-a-says-industry-minister/articleshow/115745203.cms,"Representative Image

Why Indonesia has banned new iPhones

Indonesia has reportedly rejected Apple's $100 million investment proposal, deeming it insufficient to meet the country's ""fairness"" principles. The government is seeking further negotiations before lifting a ban on iPhone 16 sales.Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita criticized Apple's investment disparity between Indonesia and Vietnam. While Apple has poured billions into Vietnam's manufacturing facilities, its investment in Indonesia, a larger market, has been significantly less. “We want Apple to return to do business here but we need a fair resolution,” Kartasasmita said, as per a report in Bloomberg. He further added, “We want Apple to send negotiation teams to meet us.”Indonesia's ban on iPhone 16 sales stems from Apple's failure to comply with local content regulations, which require 40% of phone components to be sourced domestically. The government is pushing for increased local manufacturing and investment from tech giants like Apple.Apple's latest offer, a $100 million investment, is still considered inadequate by Indonesian officials. The government is demanding that Apple fulfill its 2023 investment pledge, provide a more substantial offer for 2024-2026, and ultimately establish a manufacturing plant in Indonesia.This isn't the first time Indonesia has taken a tough stance on foreign tech companies. The country has also banned Google Pixel phones due to similar investment issues and imposed restrictions on TikTok's shopping feature.While Apple may not be a dominant player in the Indonesian smartphone market, the country's large and growing tech-savvy population presents a significant opportunity for the company. Both parties are working towards a resolution that benefits both sides, but the future of Apple products in Indonesia remains uncertain.","Indonesia has rejected Apple's $100 million investment proposal, deeming it insufficient to meet the country's ""fairness"" principles.

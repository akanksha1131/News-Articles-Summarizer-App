New-Age lending model helping banks to cut costs and meet customer expectations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/new-age-lending-model-helping-banks-to-cut-costs-and-meet-customer-expectations/articleshow/122927723.cms,"By Ravish Pandey, Head of Product Innovation, and Sachin Gupta, Head of Client Accounts and Engagement at BUSINESSNEXT

Across global financial markets, lending is experiencing a major shift. Borrowers now expect immediacy, personalization, and simplicity in every interaction—whether applying for a personal loan on their mobile device or financing a home, vehicle, or business. However, many banks and financial institutions are hindered by systems designed for a slower, less connected world. A World Bank report estimates that micro, small, and medium enterprises face an annual credit gap of USD 5.2 trillion—about 1.5 times the current lending volume for these businesses.With conversations from banks and lenders, it’s clear: Legacy Loan Origination Systems are no longer adequate. They were built to standardize, not to innovate. They offer control—but make it hard to adopt changes. Today, with tech-savvy customers and constantly changing rules, this lack of flexibility has become a drawback.According to a market research, digital lending platforms in India are projected to reach over 500 million customers by the end of 2025, with the lending segment expected to hit USD 1.3 trillion in disbursements, driven by advancements in financial technology and increased smartphone penetration.Hence, what is needed is not just digital enhancement, but a fundamental reinvention of how lending is delivered, scaled, and evolved. This is where the model of Lending-as-a-Service is proving to be a game-changer.Lending-as-a-Service redefines lending not as a static software platform, but as a flexible, cloud-powered ecosystem. It enables lenders to break down the lending process into modular services that can be rapidly configured, deployed, and scaled across various product lines—from personal and auto loans to corporate, housing, and consumer durable finance. By adopting this model, financial institutions are no longer bound by one-size-fits-all workflows or long development cycles. They gain the agility to experiment, personalize, and adapt without overhauling their core architecture.But technology alone is not the differentiator—it’s the outcomes that matter. Institutions supported with platforms with Lending-as-a-Service architecture have consistently accelerated their go-to-market timelines, dramatically improved customer satisfaction, and reduced operational costs. We’ve seen banks launch new retail lending products in a matter of days. We’ve seen journeys that once required manual underwriting transformed into straight-through processes powered by AI. In several deployments, the cost per loan has reduced by over half, while conversion rates have increased multifold.For instance, a leading financial services provider in India leveraged our platform to launch a digitally native loan journey for Indian customers, covering onboarding, KYC, credit scoring, and disbursal—all within a few days. Another bank in Southeast Asia reimagined its auto finance journey by integrating real-time approvals, e-KYC, and government API linkages into a seamless customer flow. These institutions weren’t just digitizing—they were building lending businesses designed for today’s customers and tomorrow’s challenges.This transformation is also enabling compliance readiness at scale. In regulated markets such as the UAE, India, and Southeast Asia, stakeholders are able to quickly embed policy changes, update product terms, or roll out pre-approved offers—without recoding, retraining, or retesting legacy systems.Thus, the future of lending will belong to those who are agile, responsive, and deeply aligned with the needs of their borrowers. Lending-as-a-Service offers a pathway to that future—a model that is not only more adaptive but also more resilient in the face of change.At the core of this shift is a new generation of lending platforms — modern, unified lending infrastructure built for speed, scalability, and intelligence. To illustrate, our platform, built on a microservices-based, cloud-native foundation, enables institutions to launch and iterate with confidence. With the ability to integrate more than 175 APIs, our ecosystem supports real-time connectivity with internal banking systems, fintech partners, government APIs, credit bureaus, fraud detection engines, and compliance tools.Additionally, this allows banks and financial institutions to no longer be constrained by what their systems can support—they are empowered to lead with what their customers demand. The transformation is not incremental. It is structural. And it is happening now. It’s time to reimagine lending and reinvent success.","Borrowers now expect immediacy, personalization, and simplicity in every interaction.

Peter Thiel, Donald Trump’s Man in Silicon Valley

America has a new entrant in the list of most-valuable companies. And it is Peter Thiel 's defence technology company Palantir Technologies . This week, Palantir hit another major milestone in its meteoric stock rise seen in 2025. The company is now one of the 20 most valuable US companies, achieving a market capitalization of $375 billion.The provider of software and data analytics technology to defense agencies saw its stock rise more than 2% on Friday, July 25, to another record, taking the company’s market cap above $350 billion, which puts it ahead of Home Depot and Procter & Gamble.

Earlier this year, Palantir soared ahead of Salesforce, IBM and Cisco into the top 10 U.S. tech companies by market cap.The Denver-based Palantir Technologies was founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel and CEO Alex Karp, and others. Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel has been one of the most vocal supporter of Donald Trump during his 2024 Presidential campaign. Thiel is popularly known as the far-right billionaire investor. Not just in 2024, In the 2016 election too, Thiel eagerly embraced his role as the public face of support for Donald Trump from the tech sector.A prominent conservative donor, he has reportedly contributed significant funding and public endorsements, aligning Palantir’s strategic interests with a potential Trump administration. This political alignment has sparked speculation about further government contracts, boosting investor confidence in Palantir’s growth trajectory.In 2025, the company's stock more than doubled, driven by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence capabilities and deepening ties with the U.S. government. Revenue in Palantir’s U.S. government business increased 45% to $373 million in its most recent quarter, while total sales rose 39% to $884 million.

Staff criticise 'enigma of success' rationale as Microsoft stock hits records

Microsoft employees are reportedly questioning CEO Satya Nadella 's motive behind a memo attempting to explain why the tech giant has eliminated thousands of jobs while generating massive profits and investing $80 billion in AI infrastructure. According to a report in Business Insider, employee reactions reportedly range from suspicion about impending job cuts to criticism of what is being termed as the company's tone-deaf messaging.""As we begin a new fiscal year, I've been reflecting on the road we've traveled together and the path ahead,"" Nadella wrote in Thursday's memo. ""Before anything else, I want to speak to what's been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations.""Inside Microsoft, the report claimed, employees are questioning whether the memo signals more job cuts ahead, reflects guilt over strong earnings, or serves as messaging to Wall Street ahead of next week's earnings report. Microsoft has cut approximately 15,000 employees this year while maintaining roughly $75 billion in profit over three fiscal quarters.""These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we've worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with—our colleagues, teammates, and friends,"" Nadella acknowledged, expressing gratitude to departed employees whose ""contributions have shaped who we are as a company.""One Microsoft employee told Business Insider they couldn't determine if Nadella was ""trying to mend feelings or prepare people for more pain."" Another reportedly criticised the company for prioritising key performance indicators over people, while a third called the memo tone-deaf, comparing Microsoft to a coal mine focused solely on extracting more resources.Nadella described the situation as an ""enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value,"" explaining that ""by every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving—our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right.""""We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognised and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs,"" he wrote.The report said that on employee message boards, workers posted parodies of the memo and criticised its rationale. Some speculated the letter was crafted for Wall Street, reminding investors that layoffs continue despite strong business performance. Microsoft's stock has risen 21% this year and hit records in July.""The success we want to achieve will be defined by our ability to go through this difficult process of 'unlearning' and 'learning,'"" Nadella concluded, expressing confidence that Microsoft ""will once again find the resolve, courage, and clarity to deliver on our mission in this new paradigm.""","Microsoft employees are reportedly questioning CEO Satya Nadella's motive behind a memo attempting to explain why the tech giant has eliminated thousands of jobs.

Intel is 'breaking up'; to sell its networking division; read the note sent to customers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-is-breaking-up-to-sell-its-networking-division-read-the-note-sent-to-customers/articleshow/122925424.cms,"What Intel spokesperson said on selling Nex



Here's what Intel memo to customers reportedly says

Intel memo to customers gives no timeline

Intel has announced plans to establish its networking and communications business -- Network and Edge Group (NEX) -- as a stand-alone company. In a note to customers and employees the company said that it has begun the process of identifying investors for the business unit. The announcement comes as the new CEO Lip-Bu Tan looks to streamline the struggling chipmaker. While Tan didn’t talk about Intel’s decision to spin off NEX in the company’s earnings call on June 24, he discussed other actions it has taken to monetize “non-core assets”. This includes the sale of a portion of Intel’s stake in Mobileye earlier this month.“We plan to establish key elements of our Networking and Communications business as a stand-alone company and we have begun the process of identifying strategic investors,” the Intel representative said in a statement. “Like Altera, we will remain an anchor investor enabling us to benefit from future upside as we position the business for future growth,” the spokesperson added.The NEX spin-off plan was announced to Intel customers and employees the same day the semiconductor giant revealed more changes under Tan’s leadership, including a 15 percent workforce reduction and a more conservative approach to its foundry business. “We are laser-focused on strengthening our core product portfolio and our AI roadmap to better serve customers,” the statement added.The memo, seen by CRN, is reportedly written by Sachin Katti, who has led NEX, since early 2023. Katti was given the extra role of chief technology and AI officer by Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan in April to lead Intel's AI strategy. Intel confirmed the content of the memo to CRN.In Katti’s memo, he said Intel “internally announced” its plan to “establish its NEX business as a stand-alone company.” This will result in a “new, independent entity focused exclusively on delivering leading silicon solutions for critical communications, enterprise networking and ethernet connectivity infrastructure,” he added.“While Intel will remain an anchor investor in the new company, we have begun the process of identifying additional strategic and capital partners to support the growth and development of the new company,” he wrote.Katti said the move is “rooted in our commitment to serving” Intel’s customers better and promised that there will be “no change in service or the support” they rely on. He added that it will also help NEX “expand into new segments more effectively.”“Backed by Intel, this new, independent company will be positioned to accelerate its customer-facing strategy and product road map by innovating faster and investing in new offerings,” said Katti, who expects the transition to be “seamless” for customers.“What we expect to change is our ability to operate with greater focus, speed and flexibility—all to better meet your needs,” he wrote.Katti did not give a timeline for when Intel could spin off NEX, which has been mainly focused on networking and communications products after the company moved its edge computing business to the Client Computing Group last September. Intel also shifted its integrated photonics solutions to the Data Center Group that same month.Similar to other businesses Intel has spun off, the company plans to maintain a stake in the stand-alone NEX company as it seeks out other investors, according to Katti.",Intel has announced plans to establish its networking and communications business as a stand-alone company.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Microsoft is reportedly investigating whether a leak within its Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), an early alert system for cybersecurity companies, allowed alleged Chinese state-backed hackers to exploit vulnerabilities in its SharePoint service before patches were widely available. The development comes after a security fix released by the tech giant earlier this month reportedly failed to fully address a critical flaw in the server software, leading to widespread cyber espionage attempts.“As part of our standard process, we’ll review this incident, find areas to improve, and apply those improvements broadly,” a Microsoft spokesperson was quoted by Bloomberg as saying.Meanwhile, Microsoft told news agency Reuters that it continually evaluates “the efficacy and security of all of our partner programs and makes the necessary improvements as needed.”Last week, Microsoft acknowledged that at least two alleged Chinese hacking groups, identified as "" Linen Typhoon "" and "" Violet Typhoon ,"" along with a third China-based entity, were actively exploiting these weaknesses.The vulnerability in question was first publicly demonstrated in May by Dinh Ho Anh Khoa, a researcher with Vietnamese cybersecurity firm Viettel, at the Pwn2Own cybersecurity conference in Berlin. Khoa was awarded $100,000 for his discovery, prompting Microsoft to release an initial patch in July.However, members of the MAPP program had already been notified of these vulnerabilities on June 24, July 3, and July 7, according to Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness for Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative, which organises Pwn2Own.Microsoft observed exploit attempts beginning July 7. Childs told Reuters that ""the likeliest scenario is that someone in the MAPP program used that information to create the exploits."" While the specific vendor responsible for a potential leak remains unclear, Childs speculated, ""since many of the exploit attempts come from China, it seems reasonable to speculate it was a company in that region.""",Microsoft is reportedly investigating whether a leak allowed alleged Chinese state-backed hackers to exploit vulnerabilities in its SharePoint service.

What California DMV said about Tesla’s decision to expand robotaxi service



Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has said that Tesla is “not allowed to test or transport the public” in autonomous vehicles within the US state, a report claims. This comes after CEO of the electric vehicle maker, Elon Musk , reportedly teased expansion plans for the company’s robotaxi service to the San Francisco Bay Area and other US markets. The latest statement from the state’s regulator clarifies that any Tesla service in California would require a human driver. In an email sent to CNBC, CPUC wrote:This means any service provided by Tesla in California must operate more like a traditional taxi service than a fully autonomous one. According to the report, Tesla currently holds a charter-party carrier permit in California, which allows it to operate a private car service with human drivers.The CPUC confirmed receiving a notification from Tesla recently about its plan to “extend operations” under this permit to “offer service to friends and family of employees and to select members of the public” across much of the Bay Area. However, the commission highlighted that this service, under Tesla's current permit, can only be conducted with non-autonomous vehicles.As per the report, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) said that Tesla has a ""drivered testing permit"" since 2014, which allows the company to operate autonomous vehicles with a safety driver on board, though it does not permit charging for rides.The DMV also noted that these safety drivers have to be Tesla employees, contractors, or designated representatives of the company under the terms of the permit.Currently, in Austin, Tesla is conducting tests of a robotaxi service using its Model Y SUVs, which are fitted with the company’s updated automated driving software and hardware. The service runs during the day and in clear weather conditions, restricted to roads with speed limits up to 40 miles per hour.These robotaxis are monitored remotely by Tesla staff and have a human safety supervisor seated in the front passenger seat. The service is currently available to selected users who have opted into Tesla’s “early access program” and accepted its terms.","The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has said that Tesla is “not allowed to test or transport the public” in autonomous vehicles within the US state.

He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” he added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team.

"Microsoft layoffs: CEO Satya Nadella in memo to employees after 15,000 job cuts, says success requires ""difficult process of unlearning and …""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-layoffs-ceo-satya-nadella-in-memo-to-employees-after-15000-job-cuts-says-success-requires-difficult-process-of-unlearning-and-/articleshow/122896493.cms,"Satya Nadella explains the ""enigma of success"" amid record profits and layoffs

AI transformation drives Microsoft’s workforce restructuring strategy

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed the company's massive job cuts in a candid memo to employees, acknowledging that recent layoffs affecting over 15,000 workers this year, have been ""weighing heavily"" on him while defending the cuts as necessary for the Redmond giant’s AI transformation.""Before anything else, I want to speak to what's been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations,"" Nadella wrote to Microsoft's more than 200,000 employees. ""These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we've worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with – our colleagues, teammates, and friends.""The layoffs represent approximately 7% of Microsoft's global workforce, making it the company's largest personnel reduction since 2014. Despite the cuts, Microsoft's stock has soared 21% this year, hitting record highs above $500 per share, while the company reported $75 billion in net income over three fiscal quarters.Nadella directly addressed what he called the ""uncertainty and seeming incongruence"" of cutting jobs while the company thrives financially. ""By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving – our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right,"" he wrote. ""We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.""The CEO described this contradiction as ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value,"" explaining that ""progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.""Nadella emphasised that achieving future success ""will be defined by our ability to go through this difficult process of 'unlearning' and 'learning.'"" He argued this transformation requires Microsoft to ""meet changing customer needs, by continuing to maintain and scale our current business, while also creating new categories with new business models and a new production function.""The memo outlined Microsoft's strategic pivot from a ""software factory to an intelligence engine"" as the company invests $80 billion in AI infrastructure. Nadella envisions a future where ""all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips.""""As we begin a new fiscal year, I've been reflecting on the road we've traveled together and the path ahead,"" Nadella wrote, positioning the layoffs within broader industry shifts toward AI-driven automation that have eliminated over 80,000 tech jobs in 2025.The CEO expressed ""sincere gratitude to those who have left,"" acknowledging that ""their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today."" However, he offered no guarantees against future layoffs, instead urging remaining employees to maintain a ""growth mindset"" during what he called the ""messiness"" of transformation.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed the company's massive job cuts in a candid memo to employees.

Read Bill Gates complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Bill Gates daughter shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother



Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among tech CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April, Bill Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment. ""In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Phoebe Gates recently shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni, Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was: ""Get up or get out of the game, sis.""According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Melinda Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced. Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking: ""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""""He's like, ‘Why would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‘You answered your own question,'” she added.","Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup.

Government has banned public access to over OTT platforms including Ullu, ALTT and Desiflix, reports news agency ANI. The banned apps and websites were found in violation of various laws, including Section 67 and Section 67A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, Section 294 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, and Section 4 of the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986. The report quotes an unnamed source who said “There was hardly any storyline, theme or message in a social context”.According to the agency report, the action was taken in consultation with MHA, MWCD, MeitY, Department of Legal Affairs, industry bodies FICCI and CII, along with experts in women’s and child rights. The report says that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) has directed Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to disable public access for publishing obscene, vulgar and pornographic content. In its official notification, the ministry emphasised that the intermediaries are responsible for removing or disabling access to unlawful information under the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.The Section 67 and Section 67A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 deal with the publication and transmission of obscene and sexually implicit content in electronic form. The key difference is that Section 67 applies to general obscenity, while Section 67A deals with more graphic, sexually explicit material. The punishments under Section 67A are more severe due to the nature of the content.Section 67 of the IT Act punishes the online publication or transmission of obscene or vulgar material that could deprave or corrupt readers, with imprisonment of up to three years and a fine of up to Rs 5 lakh for the first offence, and up to five years in jail and Rs 10 lakh fine for repeat offences.Section 67A, on the other hand, deals specifically with material that contains sexually explicit acts or conduct, with stricter penalties—up to five years in jail and Rs 10 lakh fine for the first offence, and up to seven years imprisonment and Rs 10 lakh fine for subsequent offences.As per ANI report, 26 websites and 14 apps have been banned by the government.

What helped Tesla grow in Turkey



Tesla is facing tough time in Europe. Ever since Elon Musk decided to join Donald Trump's government, his political decisions have hurt the Electronic VEhicle (EV) maker almost across Europe. Elon Musk's souring ties with President Trump's administration too has not helped. The only bright spot in Europe for Tesla has been Turkey. In Europe, Turkey has been one of Tesla's fastest-growing markets. However, Tesla's efforts to mitigate slumping European sales with gains in Turkey may be at risk after a surprise tax hike in the country.Turkey has raised the lowest tier of its special consumption tax for electric vehicles — which includes Tesla’s top-selling Model Y — to 25% from 10%, according to a presidential decree published in the country’s Official Gazette.Turkey has emerged as an increasingly significant market for Tesla, helping alleviate falling demand elsewhere in Europe. In fact, CEO Elon Musk name-checked the country during the company’s quarterly earnings call recently.Tesla sales in the country soared 171% in June to 7,235 units, with the Model Y taking the top spot among EVs. In same month, Tesla registrations across Europe dropped 23% to 34,781 vehicles, according to data published Thursday by the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.Tesla's success in Turkey, driven by a locally tailored Model Y qualifying for a 10% tax rate, faces challenges as a new levy could raise prices by about $6,000, potentially dampening demand. Previously priced at 1.87 million liras ($46,100), the Model Y may lose its edge, while many combustion-engine competitors’ tax brackets remain unchanged. This tax hike compounds issues for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has flagged tough quarters ahead due to fading US EV subsidies and delays in autonomous vehicle progress.The policy shift also threatens competitors like BYD Co., which plans local production in Turkey and offers models like the Dolphin, Atto 3, and Seal in the same low-tax bracket. Other manufacturers, including Volkswagen AG, Hyundai Motor Co., and Stellantis NV, with affordable EVs in Turkey, may also feel the impact.","Tesla sales in the country soared 171% in June to 7,235 units, with the Model Y taking the top spot among EVs.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Elon Musk-owned Tesla is planning to launch its robotaxi service in San Francisco next week, reports Business Insider citing an internal staff memo. As per the report, the EV maker said that its timeline for the launch has been moved up and the service could launch as soon as Friday, i.e. August 1. According to the memo, the geofenced area where Robotaxi service will operate will cover a large part of the Bay Area , including Marin, much of the East Bay, San Francisco, and stretching south to San Jose. Robotaxi service in San Francisco will initially launch with safety drivers in the driver's seat who will be able to control the car using the steering wheel and brakes, the memo said.A Business Insider report states that the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) records show that Tesla has expanded its autonomous testing activities in the state. As of December, the company registered 224 in-house test drivers and 104 vehicles for testing under its existing permit. The publication reported that the number of workers testing Tesla’s software in California has more than tripled.Tesla currently holds a permit that allows testing of its self-driving software in California, but only with a safety driver behind the wheel. It remains unclear whether Tesla will need a separate permit to operate its planned robotaxi service with a safety operator present in the vehicle.The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has granted Tesla a permit to operate a transportation service for employees. However, as of July 10, Tesla had not applied for the necessary permits to offer a commercial robotaxi service to the general public.The Business Insider report further stated that DMV has confirmed the EV company has not applied for a permit to test or deploy driverless vehicles in the state. A DMV spokesperson said the agency recently met with Tesla, but the company has not submitted an application for either testing or commercial deployment of fully autonomous vehicles.Tesla launched its invite-only robotaxi service in Austin, Texas last month with around 10 modified Model Y vehicles operating in a geofenced area. Elon Musk said during Tesla’s Q2 earnings call this week that initial Bay Area operations will also begin with a safety operator in the front seat. The Tesla CEO also added that Tesla plans to launch the Bay Area service within one to two months and is in the process of obtaining the required regulatory approvals.","Elon Musk-owned Tesla is planning to launch its robotaxi service in San Francisco next week, reports Business Insider citing an internal staff memo.

Dutch antitrust watchdog, the Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM), has delayed its decision on Apple over fees charged to dating app providers on the App Store. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the regulator said that it is waiting for the outcome of ongoing discussions between Apple and the European Commission on a similar issue before moving forward.According to ACM, Apple recently changed its fee structure in response to those talks and has said it plans to make further adjustments later this year.The regulator had previously ruled that Apple abused its dominant market position by imposing unfair conditions on dating app developers. That decision was upheld by a Dutch court in June, which found that the company’s practices in the App Store violated competition laws.The ACM has not provided a new timeline for its final ruling. The ongoing talks between Apple and the European Commission are expected to influence how both EU and national regulators handle competition issues related to the App Store in the future.In a related news, Reuters recently reported that Apple’s updates to its App Store rules and fees are likely to get approval from EU antitrust regulators soon. Citing people familiar with the matter, the report said that this could help the Cupertino-based company avoid large daily fines. Last month, the iPhone maker said that developers will soon be required to pay a 20% processing fee for purchases made via the App Store. For Apple’s small-business program, the fees could go as low as 13%.","Dutch antitrust watchdog, the Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM), has delayed its decision on Apple over fees charged to dating app providers on the App Store.

Flying suitcases packed with hard drives to China: Nvidia responds to 'burning issue' of AI chip smuggling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/flying-suitcases-packed-with-hard-drives-to-china-nvidia-responds-to-burning-issue-of-ai-chip-smuggling/articleshow/122908000.cms,"How China is smuggling US-made high-end AI chips

Nvidia has issued a strong warning against the use of unauthorised chips in data centers, calling it a “losing proposition” both technically and economically. The statement from the world’s most valuable company comes in the wake of a recent report which alleged that at least $1 billion worth of Nvidia's AI chips have been illegally smuggled into China. Not only that, last month a report said that Chinese companies are resorting to ‘unconventional’ ways, including carrying hard drives with AI training data in suitcases to other countries, to bypass US restrictions on high-end AI chips.“Trying to cobble together datacenters from smuggled products is a losing proposition, both technically and economically. Datacenters require service and support, which we provide only to authorised NVIDIA products,” an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC.A Financial Times report detailed that these illicit shipments of Nvidia's AI chips entered China despite President Donald Trump's restrictions on the sale of the company’s H20 chips to the world's second-largest economy. Furthermore, the report, citing sales contracts, company filings, and informed sources, stated that Nvidia's B200 chips, which are also prohibited from sale in China, have become popular on the black market.Chinese distributors reportedly began selling these restricted chips in May to data center suppliers, whose clientele includes various Chinese AI groups.Since 2022, stringent US export controls on high-end AI chips, driven by national security concerns, have significantly impacted Chinese firms' access to cutting-edge American technology. This has forced them to explore various workarounds, from developing domestic alternatives to engaging in illicit activities like smuggling, and increasingly, processing data in overseas locations.According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, while some Chinese companies have begun substituting American chips with domestically produced alternatives, others have resorted to smuggling AI hardware through third countries to circumvent the controls.However, increased pressure from the US has made smuggling a more difficult proposition. This has pushed Chinese firms towards a new strategy: processing data outside of China in regions like Southeast Asia and the Middle East. ""This was something we were consistently concerned about,"" Thea Kendler, former head of export controls at the Commerce Department under the Biden administration, told the WSJ, referring to the remote access Chinese firms maintain to US AI chips.The WSJ report says that Chinese companies employed elaborate strategies to circumvent stringent US restrictions on advanced AI chips.For example, in one instance in March, four Chinese engineers reportedly flew from Beijing to Malaysia, each carrying suitcases filled with 15 hard drives containing 80 terabytes of data. At a Malaysian data centre, they utilised approximately 300 servers equipped with advanced Nvidia chips to develop an AI model, which they subsequently brought back to China.This operation involved planning, including weeks spent optimising data sets in China to avoid lengthy online transfers.","Chinese companies using AI infrastructure in other South Asian countries to train AI models.

Demis Hassabis may succeed Sundar Pichai as Google CEO



7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis appeared on an episode of the Lex Fridman podcast recently. During the podcast, Demis talked about the Meta AI hiring spree that has hired employees from OpenAI , Apple, GitHub, Google and others. Hassabis said it makes sense that Meta is making these job offers. “Meta right now are not at the frontier, maybe they'll manage to get back on there”, Hassabis said, adding “It's probably rational what they're doing from their perspective because they're behind and they need to do something.”He further added that many people working in AI care more about the mission to “steward that technology safely”. ""There's more important things than just money,"" he said. ""Of course, one has to pay people their market rates and all of these things, and that continues to go up.""During the podcast, Demis Hassabis revealed that working in AI research wasn’t always a high paying job. “I remember when we were starting out back in 2010, I didn't even pay myself for a couple of years because there wasn't enough money. We couldn't raise any money,” he said.“These days, interns are being paid the amount that we raised as our first entire seed round,” he stated.Demis Hassabis is reportedly being seen by some Google employees as a potential successor to the current CEO Sundar Pichai. While there is no official word on any succession plan, a Business Insider report says Hassabis' swift rise in recent years has followed a pattern similar to that of Pichai’s own journey to the top. “His rise reminds me of Sundar's,” a longtime Google employee who has worked closely with Hassabis and Pichai told the publication. “All of a sudden, you started hearing this name Sundar internally, and he kept having more and more responsibility, and all of a sudden, he was the CEO,” the employee added.Continuing further, the employee stated “Demis' rise has been similar. Now, all of a sudden, he's responsible for what is probably the most important team at Google right now.”","Demis Hassabis is reportedly being seen by some Google employees as a potential successor to the current CEO Sundar Pichai. “His rise reminds me of Sundar's,” a longtime Google employee who has worked closely with Hassabis andPichai told Business Insider.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122906598,imgsize-29044,width-400,resizemode-4/Google-DeepMind-CEO-Demis-Hassabis.jpg"

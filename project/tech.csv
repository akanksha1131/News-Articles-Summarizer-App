How AI chatbots‚Äô ‚Äòbiggest problem‚Äô is helping scientists in healthcare,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-ai-chatbots-biggest-problem-is-helping-scientists-in-healthcare/articleshow/116655289.cms,"AI hallucinations speed up hypotheses

While the general consensus on AI ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù ‚Äì the generation of plausible but false information ‚Äì are concerning, scientists are increasingly recognising their potential for driving innovation and discovery, report has said, adding that these unexpected outputs from AI models are proving surprisingly useful in fields ranging from medicine to climate science.According to a report in The New York Times, AI hallucinations, or inaccurate or misleading outputs can spark new ideas and accelerate the scientific process. AI hallucinations arise when generative models are trained on a specific subject and then allowed to rework that information, sometimes producing unexpected and even surreal results.‚ÄúThe public thinks it's all bad. But it's actually giving scientists new ideas. It's giving them the chance to explore ideas they might not have thought about otherwise,‚Äù Amy McGovern, a computer scientist and director of a federal AI institute, was quoted as saying.According to the scientists, this ‚Äòcreative aspect‚Äô of AI is proving valuable particularly in the early stages of scientific discovery , where hunches and guesswork often play a crucial role. AI hallucinations can speed up the process of generating and testing hypotheses, leading to faster breakthroughs.James J. Collins, an MIT professor, recently praised AI hallucinations for accelerating his research into novel antibiotics.‚ÄúWe're exploring. We're asking the models to come up with completely new molecules,‚Äù he said.The impact of AI hallucinations is evident in the work of Nobel laureate David Baker, who shared the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research on proteins. Baker credited AI hallucinations with helping his lab design millions of brand-new proteins not found in nature, leading to numerous patents and the founding of over 20 biotech companies .","AI hallucinations arise when generative models are trained on a specific subject and then allowed to rework that information, sometimes producing unexpected and even surreal results.

As post on Uber charging different from iPhone and Android users go viral; company clarifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/as-post-on-uber-charging-different-from-iphone-and-android-users-go-viral-company-clarifies/articleshow/116652498.cms,"Read the LinkedIn post here



A colleague recently booked an Uber ride on two different phones simultaneously, from the same pick-up point to the same drop-off point. üöóüì±

He wanted to improve his chances of getting a ride during peak hours.

- On Android, the fare was ‚Çπ290.79.

- On iPhone, the fare was ‚Çπ342.47.

What‚Äôs going on here?

This isn‚Äôt a glitch‚Äîit‚Äôs design thinking in action, driven by data and user insights:

1Ô∏è‚É£ User Behaviour: iPhone users are often perceived as ‚Äúpremium customers‚Äù‚Äîdata shows they‚Äôre more willing to pay higher prices.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Platform Fees: Apple charges up to 30% commission on in-app purchases, subtly influencing pricing decisions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Personalisation: Apps increasingly use

dynamic pricing

based on user behaviour and profiles. Your choice of device could impact what you‚Äôre charged.

Here‚Äôs the real question:

When does personalisation improve user experience, and when does it start to feel exploitative?

From a design thinking perspective, this approach is rooted in understanding user behaviour and adapting to it.

For businesses, it‚Äôs smart‚Äîleveraging data to optimise value.

For users, it‚Äôs complicated‚Äîdoes this pricing strategy enhance the experience, or does it break trust?

What we found out in our testing

What Uber has to say

A recent social media post alleging that Uber charges different fares for rides booked on iPhones and Android devices has started an online debate. The post, which quickly went viral, showed screenshots of two phones displaying significantly different fares for the same ride. The post ignited speculation among users, with many questioning whether Uber's pricing algorithm discriminates based on the type of device used.Nirali Parekh shared her colleague's experience of booking an Uber in a LinkedIn post. In the post, she highlighted the significant price difference for the same trip when booked using an Android smartphone versus an iPhone.The same post was shared by the Uber user on X (formerly known as Twitter). ‚ÄúSame pickup point, destination & time but 2 different phones get 2 different rates. It happens with me as I always get higher rates on my Uber as compared to my daughter‚Äôs phone. So most of the time, I request her to book my Uber. Does this happen with you also? What is the hack?,‚Äù posted Sudhir on X.To investigate these claims, TOI Tech conducted its own tests. We booked multiple Uber rides using various devices, including budget-friendly Android phones and premium Apple iPhones. However, we did not observe any significant price variations across different devices or locations.Uber quickly responded to the allegations, stating that the observed fare differences were not due to the type of phone used. ""Hi there, multiple differences in these two rides impact the prices. The pick-up point, ETA, and drop-off point on these requests vary, which will cause different fares. Uber does not personalize trip pricing based on a rider's cell phone manufacturer,"" the company explained.","A recent social media post alleging that Uber charges different fares for rides booked on iPhones and Android devices has started an online debate.

Cybersecurity caller tune for 8-10 times a day for three months

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT), just days after mandating cybercrime awareness messages as caller tunes, is making people aware about fake calls and how to combat the rising tide of fraudulent communications. It is now educating citizens about common types of fraud calls and provide clear instructions on how to report them.In a separate post on X, the DoT said that fraudsters can also make fake calls by posing as employees from LIC, IRDAI, Income Tax Department or banks. In such cases, people should file a police complaint, call 1930 and report the incident on Sanchar Saathi portal .Recently, the DoT ordered telecom operators like Reliance Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea to play cybercrime awareness messages 8-10 times per day for the next three months. These pre-call announcements, provided by the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C), aim to educate people about common scams, such as the ""digital arrest"" scam where fraudsters impersonate authorities to extort money.This initiative comes in response to the increasing sophistication of cybercrime in the country and the government is working with telcos to block international calls that are ""spoofed"" to appear as local numbers, a tactic often used in scams.","The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is making people aware about fake calls and how to combat the rising tide of fraudulent communications.

"""Crock of bullsh*t"": Namita Thapar counters Narayana Murthy's call for longer work hours",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/crock-of-bullsht-namita-thapar-counters-narayana-murthys-call-for-longer-work-hours/articleshow/116651232.cms,"Namita Thapar slams Narayana Murthy's long work hours advice



Anupam Mittal's perspective on Narayana Murthy‚Äôs long working hours philosophy



Narayana Murthy's call for longer work hours: Catalyst for the debate



A broader conversation: Work culture in transition



The debate over India's work culture and the suggestion of a 70-hour workweek has sparked significant discussion across the country. Two prominent figures from Shark Tank India , Namita Thapar and Anupam Mittal , recently shared conflicting perspectives on this topic during an interview with Humans of Bombay. Their contrasting views have fueled ongoing conversations about the balance between productivity, success, and well-being in the modern workforce.Namita Thapar, CEO of Emcure Pharmaceuticals, strongly opposed Mittal's stance, labeling his argument a ""crock of bullsh*t."" She argued that the expectations for founders and regular employees differ significantly, especially when financial stakes are involved.""For founders and high stakeholders, who make tons of money ‚Äî go for it. Work 24 hours a day forever!"" Thapar said. However, she stressed that expecting the same commitment from employees is unreasonable. She highlighted the disparity in financial incentives, citing her own experience: ""When Emcure went public, it was valued at $3 billion, and my family owns 80 percent of it. Obviously, we could work 20 hours a day, which is what we all do. But the employee? My accountant, for instance, doesn‚Äôt share the same financial upside.""Thapar raised concerns about the physical and mental health implications of extended work hours, particularly for employees who lack the same financial motivation as business owners. She emphasized the importance of maintaining a balanced schedule for overall well-being and long-term productivity.Anupam Mittal, founder and CEO of Shaadi.com, argued that success cannot be measured by the number of hours worked. Reflecting on his own experience working 16-hour days during his early career in the U.S., Mittal emphasized that dedication and focused effort outweigh mere time spent on tasks.""I think it's a big lie being told to this generation,"" Mittal remarked, challenging the notion that longer hours equate to greater achievements. He advocated for prioritizing work-life ""harmony"" instead of adhering to rigid time commitments. According to Mittal, young professionals should be prepared to push themselves early in their careers but also recognize the importance of creating a sustainable balance.Highlighting the hybrid work model implemented at his company, Mittal revealed a 30% increase in productivity. He credited this approach for fostering both efficiency and flexibility, enabling employees to deliver better results without overextending themselves.The debate was reignited by recent comments from Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy, who suggested that India‚Äôs youth should commit to longer work hours to boost productivity and global competitiveness. He cited historical examples from Japan and Germany, where extended work weeks played a role in post-war economic recovery.Murthy's call for a return to a six-day workweek and extended hours drew both support and criticism. Proponents view it as a necessary step to enhance India's economic output, while detractors argue it disregards the importance of work-life balance and employee well-being.The exchange between Thapar and Mittal underscores the complexity of India's evolving work culture. While both acknowledge the need for change, their views highlight differing approaches to achieving productivity and fostering professional growth.Thapar champions the idea of reasonable work limits for employees to avoid burnout and prioritize health. On the other hand, Mittal believes that extraordinary success requires dedication and effort, regardless of fixed hours.The conversation also reflects a larger trend in global work culture, as organizations grapple with finding the right balance between flexibility, efficiency, and employee satisfaction.Also read | Airtel recharge plans","The debate over India's work culture and the suggestion of a 70-hour workweek has sparked significant discussion across the country.

In 2010, Shashi Kumar, a Bengaluru-born tech professional, made a transformative decision that would bridge the gap between technology and agriculture. After a successful 17-year career in the technology sector, including 13 years at Wipro Technologies, Kumar chose to leave behind his thriving career to pursue a mission close to his heart: revolutionizing the agricultural sector and uplifting rural communities. Co-founding Akshayakalpa Organic , India‚Äôs first certified organic dairy enterprise, Kumar aimed to empower marginalized farmers and foster sustainable agriculture . This initiative reflects his commitment to creating lasting social impact through innovation and entrepreneurship.Shashi Kumar‚Äôs journey began with an impressive academic and professional foundation. After earning a degree in computer science from Bengaluru University, he pursued a Master‚Äôs in Telecommunication Engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. His career trajectory in the technology sector was remarkable, but his upbringing in a farming family planted the seeds for a deeper calling.Having witnessed the struggles of small farmers firsthand, Kumar carried a desire to make agriculture more viable. Despite his father‚Äôs warnings about the challenges of farming, Kumar felt a responsibility to address systemic issues such as low profitability and unsustainable practices. This realization culminated in the creation of Akshayakalpa Organic, a venture combining his technological expertise and passion for sustainable farming.Established with the vision of improving India‚Äôs dairy farming landscape, Akshayakalpa Organic is centered on empowering farmers and fostering rural entrepreneurship. The company helps farmers transition to organic practices by offering technical support, financial assistance, and access to markets.One of the unique aspects of Akshayakalpa is its focus on creating self-sustaining farming ecosystems. For example:These practices not only enhance productivity but also contribute to environmental sustainability.With a target turnover of Rs 400 crore in the current fiscal year, Akshayakalpa‚Äôs success has attracted the support of the Rainmatter Foundation, a nonprofit initiative by Zerodha founders Nithin and Nikhil Kamath. This partnership underscores the scalability of Akshayakalpa‚Äôs model, which aligns with the foundation‚Äôs mission to foster sustainable and impactful businesses.A core objective of Akshayakalpa Organic is to uplift farmers economically and socially. By collaborating with young farmers disillusioned with traditional agriculture, the company trains them to become independent entrepreneurs. According to the Rainmatter Foundation, farmers associated with Akshayakalpa earn an average monthly income of Rs 1,00,000 through diverse products like organic milk, poultry, honey, bananas, and millets.This consistent income shields farmers from challenges such as market volatility, dependence on middlemen, and unpredictable weather conditions. Beyond individual empowerment, Akshayakalpa‚Äôs model promotes community development by creating local employment opportunities and supporting sustainable farming practices.Akshayakalpa Organic has expanded its offerings to include a variety of organic products such as milk, fruits, vegetables, poultry, and honey. These products cater to the growing demand for healthier, eco-friendly alternatives in urban markets.Looking ahead, the company envisions becoming a pan-India brand, reaching new markets and influencing agricultural practices nationwide. Its success demonstrates the potential of combining innovation with sustainability to address long-standing challenges in Indian agriculture.","Akshayakalpa Organic is India‚Äôs first certified organic dairy enterprise.

Apple VP Eddy Cue junks this biggest ‚ÄòGoogle rumour‚Äô about the company with these three reasons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-vp-eddy-cue-junks-this-biggest-google-rumour-about-the-company-with-these-three-reasons/articleshow/116651095.cms,"What Cue said about Apple's search engine

‚ÄúApple is focused on other growth areas. The development of a search engine would require diverting both capital investment and employees because creating a search engine would cost billions of dollars and take many years.‚Äù



‚ÄúSearch is rapidly evolving due to recent and ongoing developments in Artificial Intelligence. That makes it economically risky to devote the huge resources that would be required to create a search engine.‚Äù



‚ÄúA viable search engine would require building a platform to sell targeted advertising, which is not a core business of Apple. Apple does not have the volume of specialised professionals and significant operational infrastructure needed to build and run a successful search advertising business. Although Apple does have some niche advertising, such as on the App Store platform, search advertising is different and outside of Apple‚Äôs core expertise. Building a search advertising business would also need to be balanced against Apple‚Äôs long standing privacy commitments.‚Äù



Apple is developing search to take on Google. This rumour has been going on for years. Apple's Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue has reportedly junked these. As part of its ongoing case against Google's dominance in the search industry , the Department of Justice (DoJ) is focusing on the agreement between Apple and Google, in which Google serves as the default search engine on iPhones. In a recent court filing (seen by the news agency Reuters), Cue explained why the iPhone maker has chosen not to develop its own search engine, a move that would directly challenge Google's position. This statement is said to be a key piece of evidence in the DOJ's investigation.Cue outlined several key reasons why creating a search engine is not a feasible path for Apple. His statement directly contradicts the court's belief that the proposed remedies would push Apple to compete with Google's dominance in the search industry. Here are the three reasons:Apart from this, Apple has also requested to participate in the upcoming antitrust trial against Google . The trial centers on Google's dominance in online search, and Apple's involvement signals its concern over the potential impact on its lucrative partnership with the search giant.In another filing, Apple wrote: ‚ÄúGoogle can no longer adequately represent Apple‚Äôs interests: Google must now defend against a broad effort to break up its business units.‚Äù","Apple's Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue has reportedly junked rumours of the iPhone maker developing its own search engine.

In a recent interview with LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky , Jassy emphasized that while many career factors are beyond control, attitude remains firmly within one's grasp.""I think people would be surprised how infrequently people have great attitudes,"" said Jassy, who has led the tech giant since Jeff Bezos stepped down in 2021. He noted that enthusiasm helps attract mentors and advocates, as ""people want to be around positive people.""However, Jassy cautioned that optimism alone isn't enough. Young professionals must back their positive outlook with concrete actions, including following through on commitments and maintaining a strong work ethic.The CEO, who joined Amazon as a marketing manager in 1997 and went on to launch Amazon Web Services , also stressed the importance of continuous learning throughout one's career. He warned against the complacency that can set in at senior levels, stating, ""The second you think you know it all is the second you're really starting to unwind.""Drawing from his own background, Jassy revealed that his early focus on competitive sports, including soccer and tennis, may have contributed to his business success. This aligns with research on Ivy League alumni showing that students who were heavily involved in athletics tend to achieve more senior positions and higher salaries in business careers than their non-athletic peers.Before joining Amazon, Jassy explored careers in sportscasting and music management. He ultimately helped build AWS into a crucial profit center that generated $13.5 billion of Amazon's $22.9 billion operating income by 2020, positioning him as Bezos's successor.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says that an ""embarrassing amount"" of early career success depends on maintaining a positive attitude.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle‚Äôs theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you‚Äôve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you‚Äôve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

NPCI issues an advisory about 'online scams' that Indians are losing crores to,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/npci-warns-phonepe-gpay-and-other-upi-users-about-scam-that-indians-are-losing-crores-to/articleshow/116352174.cms,"What NPCI advisory says

What is digital arrest scam



How to identify a digital arrest scam

Unexpected Contact from ‚ÄòOfficials‚Äô: Be cautious if someone claims to be from government agencies like the police, CBI, income tax officers, or customs agents, contacts you. Be cautious especially if they claim urgent legal action is being initiated or warranted. They might allege that you or one of your family members is involved in a serious crime like money laundering, tax evasion, or drug trafficking.

Fear-based language and urgency: Scammers may request video calls, disguising themselves in police uniforms, using government logos, or creating official-sounding background noise to appear legitimate. They often threaten arrest or immediate legal action, demanding a quick response and using legal terms to sound convincing. In some cases, they create a police station-like set up to further convince victims of their credibility.

Request for sensitive information or payment: Scammers may ask for personal information or demand large sums of money, promising that this will clear up your involvement in the alleged crime. They may also coerce you to transfer money to their account until the investigation is complete. Terms like ‚Äúclearing your name‚Äù, ‚Äúassisting with the investigation‚Äù, or ‚Äúrefundable security deposit/escrow account‚Äù might be used by them to persuade you into transferring money to specified bank accounts or UPI IDs.

Tips to stay safe

Pause and Verify: If you receive unexpected calls or messages about legal issues, take a moment to verify. Stay calm, as scammers rely on fear and urgency. Real government and law enforcement agencies will never ask for money or investigate cases through phone or video calls. Always confirm the caller‚Äôs identity and consult trusted sources before taking any action.

Use Support Channels: Report suspicious numbers to the national cybercrime helpline by dialing 1930 or the Department of Telecommunication (https://sancharsaathi.gov.in/sfc/).

The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‚ÄòDigital Arrest‚Äô scam in the country. As digital payments, including UPI, gain widespread adoption, incidents of online scams have risen significantly. Indians, as mentioned by PM Modi in one of the episodes of Mann ki Baat have lost Rs 120.3 crore through digital arrest scam s. In its advisory, the NPCI highlights the critical need for awareness and vigilance to protect against such fraudulent activities as India advances towards a digital-first economy.In a press release, NPCI says ‚ÄúDigital payments are now accessible nationwide, driving India towards a digital-first economy. They offer both security and convenience. However, it's crucial to use digital payments safely and avoid online scams. Early identification of potential scams helps protect you and your loved ones, fostering a safer, less-cash economy, for everyone.‚ÄùThe 'Digital Arrest' scam is a type of online fraud where cybercriminals trick individuals into believing they are under investigation or at risk of arrest by law enforcement or financial authorities. Scammers often impersonate government officials, police officers, or financial regulators and use fear tactics to manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information or transferring money. Some of the common tactics used in the scam include fake calls or messages, threat of arrest and demand for payment.As per NPCI, you can identify a digital arrest scam by keeping an eye for the following","The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‚ÄòDigital Arrest‚Äô scam in the country.

Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations.

Google Podcasts (2018 ‚Äì 2024)



Keen (2020 ‚Äì 2024)



In 2024, Google once again made headlines by discontinuing several products and services. Known for its vast ecosystem of tools and platforms, Google has always embraced an experimental approach, regularly launching new projects while also sunsetting those that fail to meet its evolving strategic goals or user expectations. This year was no exception, as Google said goodbye to offerings that had carved out unique niches but ultimately fell short of the tech giant‚Äôs ambitions. From Jamboard to the Chromecast , 2024 saw the end of products that, despite their promise, could not sustain relevance in an ever-competitive market. Here‚Äôs a list of products that Google killed in 2024Introduced in 2017, Jamboard was a digital 4K touchscreen whiteboard designed to facilitate real-time collaboration, integrating seamlessly with Google Workspace services. Despite its innovative approach to enhancing team interactions, Google decided to discontinue Jamboard in 2024, citing a strategic shift towards software-based solutions that offer greater flexibility and accessibility across diverse devices.Launched in 2013, Chromecast revolutionized media streaming by allowing users to cast content from their devices directly to their televisions. Over its 11-year lifespan, Chromecast sold over 100 million units, becoming a staple in many households. However, in August 2024, Google announced the discontinuation of the Chromecast line, signaling a move towards more integrated smart TV solutions and advanced streaming devicesAs part of its Google One subscription service, Google introduced a virtual private network (VPN) in 2020, offering users enhanced online privacy by encrypting internet traffic and masking IP addresses. Despite the growing emphasis on online security, the service experienced low adoption rates. Consequently, Google shut down VPN by Google One in June 2024, redirecting resources to other security initiatives.Dropcam, a pioneer in Wi-Fi-enabled security cameras, was acquired by Google in 2014. It allowed users to monitor their homes remotely via live video feeds. In April 2024, Google ended support for Dropcam and Dropcam Pro, encouraging users to transition to the more advanced Nest Cam lineup, which offers enhanced features and better integration with the Google ecosystem.Google Podcasts was launched in 2018 as a platform for discovering and listening to podcasts. Despite amassing over 500 million downloads, the app faced criticism for lacking features compared to competitors. In June 2024, Google announced the discontinuation of Google Podcasts, urging users to migrate to YouTube Music, which now includes podcast support.Keen, introduced in 2020, was an experimental project from Google's Area 120 incubator, aiming to rival Pinterest by allowing users to curate content based on their interests.

Last night, after wrapping up my work at 3 AM, I ordered my food through Zomato. As the doorbell rang, I stood up to open it. There he was, Shiva Sarkar, the delivery executive, with a warm smile despite the biting cold outside.

But there was something in his eyes. A heaviness, a story untold.

I invited him in, offered him some water, and gently asked if he was okay. What followed left me deeply shaken.

Shiva, barely 20-21 years old, broke down in tears as he shared his story. He had to drop out of school after 8th grade when his father passed away. The weight of responsibility forced him to take up this job to support his family.

His dreams of education, of a carefree youth, were replaced by long nights and the heavy burden of ensuring his sisters could be married next year. I sat there, in awe of his strength. This young man, who should be chasing his aspirations, is instead running against the clock to make ends meet, with a determination that can only be admired.

As we chatted, I couldn't help but think, how many more Shivas are out there? Young boys and girls sacrificing their education, their dreams, their potential, just to keep their families afloat.

Shiva left with a smile and a ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù But I was left with a storm of emotions. What could we do for them? Could Zomato, a platform so impactful, introduce upskilling programs, scholarships or easy loans for these unsung heroes?

What if these delivery executives could dream again? Could learn skills that open doors to brighter futures while earning a living?

Deepinder Goyal, I love the Zomato app, but can we do more? Can we, as a society, step up for these individuals who quietly carry the weight of the world on their young shoulders?

I have some plans in mind for him and will do my best to help him wherever I can.

P.S. I took his photo with his consent, and he‚Äôs fully supportive of any assistance provided.

How Zomato responded

Shiva, a determined young man in his early twenties, caught the attention of Himanshu Bohra , a Delhi-based professional, who shared a post on LinkedIn, sharing his inspiring story.

What happens when Starbase comes into existence



Elon Musk is advancing plans to establish a dedicated town for SpaceX and its employees in Texas, USA. SpaceX staff have filed a petition to incorporate a new municipality called Starbase in coastal South Texas, where the company‚Äôs rocket launch facilities are located. The town‚Äôs first mayor is anticipated to be a SpaceX security manager.Over the years, Musk has shifted his operations from California to Texas, developing facilities across several counties. Musk has been envisioning the Starbase town for years, but recently progress accelerated as SpaceX employees started moving into nearby homes and temporary housing near the launch site.According to a report by the New York Times, residents working for SpaceX filed an official petition with Cameron County to hold an election on incorporation this month. The document (seen by NYT) reveals initial plans for the city. If this city comes into existence, Musk will create history by doing something that no other company or business leader has ever done.The Starbase plan remained stalled for years, partly due to Texas laws requiring a minimum number of residents and majority voter support to establish a new municipality. However, SpaceX employees have started settling into refurbished homes and temporary housing near the company's rocket launch site, the report claims.This month, these residents took a step toward creating a new city by filing a petition with Cameron County to hold an election, revealing initial details about Elon Musk's vision for the proposed municipality.If approved, the election would allow voters to select three city officials, including Gunnar Milburn, SpaceX's security manager, as the proposed first mayor. The petition outlines a community of roughly 500 residents, including 219 primary residents and over 100 children, located near Boca Chica Beach at the end of State Highway 4. Covering about 1.5 square miles, the proposed town is small by Texas standards. Most residents are renters and work for SpaceX.However, the petition does not mention why Musk and SpaceX employees are pursuing the creation of Starbase or what benefits they aim to achieve. The proposed town could establish its own police or fire departments or enact its ordinances.Apart from this, Musk may also be looking into the possibility of housing employees in a development outside the town of Bastrop, near Austin. The area is home to a growing campus for Musk companies, including a manufacturing plant for SpaceX; the headquarters of the Boring Company, which is creating tunnelling technology; and, soon, offices for the social media platform X (earlier Twitter).","Residents working for SpaceX filed an official petition with Cameron County to hold an election on incorporation this month.

Its premium subscription service, launched in 2022, has attracted 12 million paying users at $4.99 monthly. The company has also introduced revenue-sharing for content creators, business-tier subscriptions, and a mini app store.Telegram has made progress addressing its substantial debt obligations, repaying what Durov described as a ""meaningful share"" of its $2 billion in bonds this fall. The company had previously discussed the possibility of going public.Despite its financial success, Telegram continues to face regulatory challenges worldwide. Several countries, including Spain , Germany, and the UK, have considered bans or sanctions over the platform's minimal content moderation and alleged spread of misinformation.

Scam stories: 'Baap of Chart' and Trafiksol ITS Technologies

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has halted trading in Bharat Global Developers ' shares following concerns over an unusual price surge. The suspension comes in response to a complaint filed on December 16, accompanied by social media posts questioning the company‚Äôs financial transparency. The complaint pointed to an extraordinary rise in the company‚Äôs share price, which skyrocketed 105 times between November 2023 and November 2024.The price jumped from Rs 51.43 per share on December 26, 2023, to Rs 1,236.45 per share by December 23, 2024, a massive increase of 2,304%. The suspension once again highlights dangers of investing in stocks without strong fundamentals. This comes close on heels of SEBI imposing a fine of Rs 19 lakh on Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory and its proprietor for regulatory violations, including misleading investors with false promises of returns.As Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath too recently warned investors about prevalent stock market scams, citing two recent SEBI orders involving Trafiksol ITS Technologies IPO and ""Baap of Chart."" In a long post on X, formerly Twitter, and a blog post. In the blog, Kamath emphasized that seeking quick profits is a recipe for losing money.Kamath highlighted two distinct scams: One involving an SME IPO that raised Rs 44 crore to purchase software from a shell company with fabricated financials and a bogus client list, and another involving a financial influencer (""finfluencer"") who amassed Rs 17 crore by selling courses and seminars. He reiterated the adage, ""if something is too good to be true, it almost always is.""Zerodha's blog post elaborated on these cases. The first involved an IPO where funds were supposedly earmarked for software acquisition from a vendor that turned out to be a shell company incapable of delivering the promised software. Despite this, the IPO was oversubscribed 345 times. The post outlined three key takeaways from SEBI's order: the vendor's lack of operational capability, fabricated financials and a fake client list, and a suspicious vendor selection process. SEBI had previously halted the Trafiksol ITS Technologies SME IPO pending investigation and subsequently ordered the company to refund investors.The second case involved ""Baap of Chart,"" a finfluencer who promised high returns and ran an unauthorized investment advisory service, collecting significant sums from investors. SEBI's investigation revealed that he was not providing free advice but rather operating an unregistered advisory service. SEBI subsequently barred Nasiruddin Ansari and his associates from the securities market and ordered them to refund investors.Kamath has consistently addressed such fraudulent activities. He recently warned about the potential dangers of AI-driven scams, referencing a case where a Bengaluru techie lost ‚Çπ91 lakh in an online stock market scam.

Google Santa tracker: How to use and top features



Google Santa Tracker , is a popular Christmas feature that allows users to track Santa Claus in real time as he delivers presents worldwide. This feature offers a digital way to follow Santa‚Äôs journey on Christmas Eve . Each December 24, Google transforms Santa's Village into an interactive tracking experience, delighting children and adults alike. The platform provides updates on Santa's route, showing his progress as he and his reindeer travel across the globe spreading Christmas cheer. Here‚Äôs how the tradition started:This festive tradition that began in 2004 builds on NORAD's long-standing Santa tracking program but has evolved with Google‚Äôs modern technology, incorporating playful features and educational games to engage users throughout the holiday season.Meanwhile, NORAD‚Äôs tradition of tracking Santa Claus on Christmas Eve began in 1955 when a misprint in a department store advertisement prompted a child to call a Colorado military command centre, hoping to speak with Santa Claus.Air Force Colonel Harry Shoup, who answered the call, pretended to be Santa and reassured the child. As more calls came in, Shoup assigned an officer to manage the enquiries, which started the festive custom that NORAD carried on after its establishment in 1958.For decades, NORAD has paused its regular airspace monitoring duties each holiday season to answer children‚Äôs questions about Santa‚Äôs journey and his remarkable gift-delivery mission. Each year, over 100,000 kids call in to track Santa‚Äôs location, while millions more follow his progress online in nine languages as he travels across the globe spreading holiday cheer.Santa's journey can be tracked using Google‚Äôs tool on iPhone, iPad or Mac by accessing the official Santa Tracking website through a web browser. The site includes a live map displaying Santa's current location, his next stop, a live video feed of his travels, and estimated arrival times for specific locations.The website also showcases photos of places Santa has already visited, a live tally of gifts delivered, and his current distance from the user's location. Additionally, it offers a variety of interactive activities, including games, creative projects, and videos, making the experience engaging and entertaining.","Google Santa Tracker is a popular Christmas feature that allows users to track Santa Claus in real time as he delivers presents worldwide.

Indian IT hiring in 2025: The jobs that will be in biggest demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indian-it-hiring-in-2025-the-jobs-that-will-be-in-biggest-demand/articleshow/116634317.cms,"Tech jobs that will be in demand in 2025

Indian IT hiring landscape is undergoing a shift as it recovers from a challenging 2024 and looks ahead to growth in 2025. While the sector faced a 7% decline in hiring in 2024 due to global uncertainties, experts predict a rebound fueled by economic improvements and technological advancements. As India enters 2025, there are positive indications of a significant rebound in IT hiring, says a report by news agency PTI. With macroeconomic challenges easing and key global election outcomes, including those in the US, providing more certainty, organizations are expected to regain confidence in the economic outlook.Wipro CTO Sandhya Arun predicts that businesses will fast-track the adoption of AI and advanced technologies to unlock greater value.‚ÄúYear 2025 promises to be a year of high-velocity technology disruptions, offering new opportunities and presenting unprecedented challenges. The future belongs to enterprises that embrace technology and disruption..."" Arun said.The demand for specialized tech roles is expected to rise by 30-35%, driven by increasing reliance on emerging technologies.The IT sector is projected to see a 15-20% growth in job opportunities across industries, according to Sunil Chemmankotil, Country Manager of Adecco India.‚ÄúLooking ahead, the combined hiring intent from GCC and IT services will be a welcome relief to job seekers. Employers are optimistic about recovery and growth as companies adapt to new technological landscapes and market needs,‚Äù he said.The report states that companies are prioritizing workforce upskilling, especially in AI and cybersecurity, to address evolving demands. Projections indicate a 15-20% growth in job opportunities, with a significant rise in demand for specialized roles.Global Capability Centres (GCCs) accounted for over half of job openings, but this wasn‚Äôt enough to offset the slowdown in IT services. Despite this, demand for roles in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) surged by 39%, highlighting a focus on specialized skills. Hiring in Tier 2 cities grew by 48%, reflecting a move beyond traditional tech hubs.Mid- to senior-level hiring saw a 35% increase, though fresh graduate hiring remained slow, with delays in onboarding due to uncertain deal flows.

"Meta‚Äôs Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun on why AI‚Äôs need to have emotions is not a requirement, but necessity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-on-why-ais-need-to-have-emotions-is-not-a-requirement-but-necessity/articleshow/116632585.cms,"Representative image

AI systems will have emotions because‚Ä¶

Yann LeCun , Meta ‚Äôs Chief AI Scientist, has made a bold, or rather provocative, prediction: future AI systems will possess emotions. In a recent interview, LeCun explained that emotions are an ‚Äúinseparable component‚Äù of the design of advanced AI systems.‚ÄúSo the blueprint of AI systems that we‚Äôre envisioning, that we‚Äôre going to build over the next few years ‚Äî those AI systems will have emotions. It‚Äôs a basically inseparable component of the design of those systems,‚Äù he said while responding to a question at an interview.He argues that emotions are a natural consequence of AI agents being driven by objectives and goals.‚ÄúWhy would they have emotions? Because they will be driven by objectives,‚Äù LeCun explained. ‚ÄúYou give them a goal that they have to accomplish, a task, and their purpose is to accomplish this task, subject to guardrails that are hardwired into their design,‚Äù he added.‚ÄúAnd for them to do this, they need a number of components. The first component they need is a way to determine whether this goal that we give them was accomplished or not. And what they also need is what we call a world model. What is a world model is something that we all have ‚Äî a prefrontal cortex that allows us to imagine what the consequences of our actions. And it‚Äôs what allows us to plan a sequence of actions to accomplish a particular goal. Now if you have this ability to predict ahead of time what a sequence of action is going to produce, then you can predict whether a goal is going to be satisfied or not. And you can predict if the outcome is going to be good or bad,‚Äù LeCun added.LeCun believes that this ability to predict and react to potential outcomes will give rise to emotions in AI.‚ÄúIf you predict it‚Äôs going to be bad, you feel fear. If you predict it‚Äôs going to be good, it‚Äôs more like elation, right? So, (you‚Äôll need) the ability to predict, and then to act so as to accomplish those predictions (which) produces the equivalent of emotions. So AI systems that are smart enough, that are capable of reasoning and planning, will have emotions,‚Äù he explained.","Yann LeCun, Meta‚Äôs Chief AI Scientist, has made a bold, or rather provocative, prediction: future AI systems will possess emotions.

Anti-piracy group ‚Äòwarns‚Äô operators after taking down one of the world‚Äôs largest illegal live sports rings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anti-piracy-group-warns-operators-after-taking-down-one-of-the-worlds-largest-illegal-live-sports-rings/articleshow/116629841.cms,"Who were the primary targets of the piracy ring



What the affected companies said about the operation



‚ÄúThe shutdown of this globally notorious live sports piracy ring is a huge victory in our campaign against the piracy of live sports programs and follows other recent successful actions by ACE and law enforcement in Vietnam. ACE's live sports members face a unique threat when it comes to

digital piracy

, as live sports broadcasts lose substantial commercial value once the game ends. The takedown serves as a warning to piracy operators everywhere ‚Äì including operators in live sports piracy ‚Äì that ACE will identify and shut down their illegal operations.‚Äù

‚ÄúDAZN stands with ACE in the fight to eradicate piracy, which undermines the sports ecosystem at all levels. It is very pleasing that a criminal operation of this scale was taken down. Piracy often compromises the security of fans' data, which is then used for illegal purposes, so the closure of this piracy ring has the added benefit that potential subscribers will be guided toward legitimate content providers like DAZN.‚Äù

The Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment ( ACE ) has shut down a major Vietnam-based sports piracy ring. In a blog post, the world's leading anti-piracy coalition announced the shutdown of the racket‚Äôs websites, including bestsolaris.com and streameast.to, which were viewed extensively throughout the world.With the websites getting over 812 million visits in the past year, the group became the largest sports piracy ring in the world. ACE noted that it identified and approached the Hanoi-based operators, who agreed to transfer 138 domains to the organisation. This is the largest sports piracy ring taken down by ACE to date which also includes other websites like markkystreams.com, crackstreams.dev and weakspell.to.The sites primarily catered to audiences in the US and Canada, streaming daily sports events, including content from all US sports leagues as well as global leagues across various categories. This illegal operation impacted all ACE members, including its sports-focused members like beIN Sports, Canal+, and DAZN.Commenting on the live sports piracy ring being busted, the executive VP and chief content protection officer for the Motion Picture Association (MPA), Larissa Knapp said:UK-based sports streaming platform DAZN also expressed its relief at the piracy racket being shut down. The company‚Äôs CEO Ed McCarthy said:","The Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment ( ACE ) has shut down a major Vietnam-based sports piracy ring.

Elon Musk's Tesla cuts top executives and their teams



Evolv terminates CEO Peter George



Comtech fires CEO Ken Peterman over undisclosed conduct related reasons



Intuit lays off executives including many in top management



2024 has been a tumultuous year for corporate leadership in the tech industry as multiple companies made headlines for ousting their top executives. From tech giants like Intel and SAP to gaming powerhouses such as Bungie and Blizzard, high-profile firings have sparked conversations about shifting priorities, performance pressures, and internal upheavals among tech companies. These sudden departures reflect broader challenges, including the struggle to adapt to evolving market demands, employee dissatisfaction, and controversies surrounding the conduct of some leaders. Here‚Äôs a list of tech companies who were sacked, fired or laid off their top executives this year:Earlier this month, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger was ousted by the company's board of directors Driven by mounting concerns over Intel's struggle to regain market share and compete effectively with rivals like Nvidia, the company took this decision According to a Bloomberg report, the board's confidence in Gelsinger's leadership eroded after a meeting last week where the company‚Äôs performance and future strategies were scrutinised. Given the option to resign or face removal, Gelsinger ultimately chose to step aside.In September, German IT company SAP SE sacked its Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Jurgen Muller following allegations of sexual harassment. M√ºller stepped down from his position soon after facing the allegations. German prosecutors also launched a criminal investigation into Muller.Blizzard president Mike Ybarra announced his decision to leave the company months after Microsoft confirmed its acquisition of gaming studio Activision Blizzard earlier this year. Post his departure, Activision Blizzard faced a series of challenges, including allegations of workplace misconduct and mismanagement. The departure of the World of Warcraft and Overwatch 2 developer added to the company's ongoing troubles. The studio‚Äôs Chief Design Officer Allen Adham also departed from Blizzard. Microsoft also shared plans to appoint a new Blizzard president within a week.In July, another gaming studio, Bungie announced the layoff of 220 employees accounting for nearly 17% of its workforce, amid rising development costs, industry shifts, and challenging economic conditions. This decision impacted all levels of the company, including many executive and senior leadership positions. Apart from this, Bungie also announced major changes to its cost structure, redirecting its development focus exclusively to titles Destiny and Marathon.In April, Elon Musk-led car maker Tesla announced layoffs. The executives let go included senior director of EV charging senior executives Rebecca Tinucci and Tesla‚Äôs head of the new vehicles program, Daniel Ho along with their respected teams. This followed a round of layoffs that reportedly impacted 14,000 employees.Last month, security technology company, Evolv Technologies, fired its CEO, Peter George, amid an ongoing investigation into its sales practices. The company's board of directors made the decision after months of deliberation. Michael Ellenbogen, the current chief innovation officer, was appointed as the interim CEO and president.Global technology company Comtech fired its CEO Ken Peterman for undisclosed reasons related to conduct in March. The company's board of directors appointed John Ratigan, the chief corporate development officer, as interim CEO while initiating a search for a permanent CEO.In July, US-based IT company Intuit laid off about 1,800 employees, affecting 10% of its workforce which also included top executives. With these job cuts, the company was trying to streamline operations and improve decision-making. While some layoffs were due to performance issues, others were part of a broader restructuring plan to consolidate teams and shut down certain offices.","This year has been a tumultuous year for corporate leadership in the tech industry as multiple companies made headlines for ousting their top executives.

Should we take the AI Leap of Faith?

What‚Äôs The

Future of Work

in the AI Era?

What does the future hold?

--- by Sajju Jain, Board Member, Entrepreneur, & Harvard Alum

Imagine, in the future, your colleague is not a person but an AI, tirelessly handling tasks with precision, completing work in seconds, and adapting to the latest industry trends before you even blink. That future isn‚Äôt a sci-fi movie plot, it‚Äôs happening right now!When considering AI‚Äôs impact on work, automation is often the first thing that comes to mind. Yet, for emerging markets , the applications are both broader and deeper. AI has evolved beyond simple task automation. It‚Äôs not just replacing human labour ‚Äì it‚Äôs creating new possibilities for development and efficiency that were once unimaginable.For example, in healthcare, several AI startups are demonstrating how they can now automatically capture and consolidate a patient's tests and scans, their prescription information, and the clinician notes. This can provide a complete patient health snapshot to improve diagnosis, treatment, and give medical professionals more time with patients.Changes are also happening at the industry level where non-traditional players are competing with traditional healthcare providers. For example, Apple takes the vast amount of data it captures daily from users and creates a 'portable health record' for them. All this will help deliver better health outcomes, and the main beneficiaries will be emerging markets where it'll help lower costs and better utilize scarce resources like medical professionals.According to Accenture, AI can add up to $957 billion current gross value added to India's economy in 2035 by boosting productivity and creating significant new economic opportunities. Every other emerging market is also rushing to include AI at a national, industrial, and organizational level.For organizations, AI provides the potential to grow more effectively, reduce operational costs, and personalize customer experiences. According to the World Economic Forum‚Äôs recent report on the future of jobs, nearly 85% of Indian employers see AI as an opportunity to generate new jobs within the next 1-5 years and enhance the quality of existing roles. However, one of the most pressing challenges they face is the skill gap. AI demands a high level of language proficiency, data literacy, and analytical skills, which are not yet widespread among their workforces.To address this, organizations across emerging markets must invest in training and upskilling programs for their teams. Governments can support these initiatives by offering both financial and non-financial support.As AI becomes more integrated into our day-to-day lives, ethical considerations and data privacy concerns will become increasingly important. The NITI Aayog‚Äôs National Strategy for AI emphasizes the need for fairness, accountability, and transparency, especially when handling customer data.This means organizations, big or small, will need to establish clear data governance policies to comply with regulations and ensure that AI applications are ethical, fair, and non-discriminatory. Creating ethical AI isn't just about avoiding risk; it strengthens relationships with all stakeholders who know that their data is in safe hands.So, by embracing AI thoughtfully and responsibly, organizations can unlock unprecedented growth, streamline operations, and foster trust with stakeholders. Embracing AI and taking the leap of faith is not just worth taking, but essential for every organization's sustained success.The rise of AI is not just reshaping how we work but redefining what work means altogether. The future of work in India and other emerging markets will require a delicate balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and nurturing the uniquely human traits that set us apart. This transition isn't just about technology - it's about preparing people and organizations to thrive in a new era.All sectors of emerging economies are seeing growing demand for roles such as data analysts, AI trainers, cybersecurity experts, ethical AI consultants, and robotic process automation specialists. Interestingly, even roles in traditional fields like marketing, finance, and operations are also evolving to include more AI focused tasks, creating hybrid job profiles that combine core expertise with AI proficiency. For those in non-technical roles, learning how to work with AI tools for all types of roles will become a valuable skill.However, as these AI tools become ubiquitous and take on more data-heavy and process-driven tasks, stakeholders will place a premium on human interactions for competitive differentiation. Higher-level skills like emotional intelligence, creativity, and collaboration will play a critical role in AI-enabled workplaces. They'll help manage complex team dynamics, better support clients, and solve problems more effectively. So, having a mindset inclined towards continuous learning and adaptability will be critical for job security in this new landscape.The AI revolution is as unstoppable as the internet revolution was. It‚Äôs best that we embrace and guide it, instead of opposing it. The future of work for everyone in emerging markets will require creating a collaborative roadmap for responsible AI adoption ‚Äì one that aligns technology with long-term goals and includes all impacted stakeholders, especially humans. Leaders across all types of organizations, both public and private, will need to work with their stakeholders to foster a culture that values continuous learning, encourages innovation, and helps their teams see AI as a tool to enhance, rather than replace, their work.",The rise of AI is not just reshaping how we work but redefining what work means altogether. The future of work in India and other emerging markets will require a delicate balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and nurturing the uniquely human traits that set us apart.

Elon Musk agrees with Perplexity AI CEO

US President-elect Donald Trump recently appointed Chennai-born Indian-American entrepreneur and venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan as Senior Policy Advisor for AI at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Krishnan, known for his close association with tech billionaire Elon Musk , recently shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) saying ‚ÄúAnything to remove country caps for green cards / unlock skilled immigration would be huge.‚ÄùWhen a user asked if removing country caps may backfire, Krishnan explained the logic stating ‚Äúwe need the best, regardless of where they happen to be born (another bizarre quirk - the country cap is where you were born, not even citizenship)‚Äù.David Sacks, appointed by Trump as ‚ÄúWhite House A.I. & Crypto Czar,‚Äù further clarified Krishnan‚Äôs proposed removal of country caps. Taking to X, he shared a post:‚ÄúPoint of clarification: Sriram didn‚Äôt say he wants to remove all caps on green cards. He said he wants to remove *country* caps on green cards. Right now, every country in the world gets allocated the same number of green cards, no matter how many qualified applicants it has.‚ÄùAdding further, he said ‚ÄúSo applicants from India have an 11 year wait whereas applicants from many other countries have no wait at all.‚Äù‚ÄúSriram still supports skills-based criteria for receiving a green card, not making the program unlimited. In fact, he wants to make the program entirely merit-based. Supporting a limited number of highly skilled immigrants is still a prevalent view on the right. Sriram is definitely not a ‚Äúcareer leftist‚Äù!,‚Äù he stated.Highlighting to focus on skilled individuals over equal country representation, Perplexity AI CEO Arvind Srinivas commented on Sacks post, ‚ÄúExactly. DOGE for immigration doesn‚Äôt mean more immigration or remove caps.

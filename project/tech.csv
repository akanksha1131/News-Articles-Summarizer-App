Retail giant Kohl fires CEO Ashley Buchanan for romantic relationship with vendor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/retail-giant-kohl-fires-ceo-ashley-buchanan-for-romantic-relationship-with-vendor/articleshow/120803750.cms,"Punishment for Ashley Buchanan: More than just firing

Who is Chandra Holt

What Kohl told staff on Ashley Buchanan's sacking

Retail chain Kohl has reportedly fired its newly hired chief executive officer (CEO) after an investigation showed he had cut a “highly unusual"" business deal with a woman who had been his romantic partner. According to a report in Wall Street Journal, Ashley Buchanan directed Kohl’s to “engage in vendor transactions that involved undisclosed conflicts of interest”. Kohl had hired Ashley Buchanan to lead the department store chain in November 2024.Specifically, the conflict involved Buchanan’s relationship with Chandra Holt, a former colleague at Walmart. According to a company filing that didn’t specifically name Holt, the vendor signed a multimillion-dollar consulting agreement with Kohl’s with unusually favorable terms. Kohl’s audit committee oversaw an investigation that found Buchanan had not disclosed the inappropriate vendor relationships.According to the WSJ report, Buchanan and Holt rose through the ranks at Walmart before leaving around the same time for senior positions at other retailers.Buchanan has not only lost his CEO job, he will also have to forfeit all equity awards from the company and be required to reimburse Kohl’s on a pro-rated basis for a signing award worth $2.5 million, according to securities filings.Holt is currently founder and CEO of Incredibrew, a coffee brand infused with vitamins and minerals, according to her LinkedIn profile. Holt left Walmart in 2021 to become CEO of Conn’s HomePlus. In 2023, Holt became CEO of Beyond Inc. — the company that owns Overstock.com and Bed Bath & Beyond — where she led the company for a year.Kohl’s named board member Michael Bender as interim CEO effective immediately. In an all-hands meeting on May 1, Bender and other Kohl’s executives “sought to reassure staffers,” but didn’t provide any additional details or take questions, the Journal reported.“This is not a moment we expected nor the outcome we wanted for the company and our associates, but it is the right decision for us,” Bender said, according to a recording reviewed by the Journal.","Ashley Buchanan was hired by Kohl's to lead the department store chain in November 2024.

"Microsoft may partner with ally ChatGPT-maker OpenAI's 'Enemy No. 1', Elon Musk",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-may-partner-with-ally-chatgpt-maker-openais-enemy-no-1-elon-musk/articleshow/120803485.cms,"Why Microsoft-Elon Musk partnership may not go well with OpenAI

Microsoft's Grok AI plans

Microsoft may reportedly be planning to tie-up with OpenAI 's 'biggest enemy, or should we say 'Enemy No. 1', Elon Musk . According to a report in The Verge, ""Microsoft has been instructing engineers working on its AI infrastructure to get ready to host Elon Musk’s Grok AI model."" The report quotes a trusted source familiar with the plans. ""In recent weeks Microsoft has been in discussions with xAI to host the Grok AI model and make it available to customers and Microsoft’s own product teams through the Azure cloud service,"" the report adds.Little doubt, the partnership is likely to not go well with Microsoft's closest ally ChatGPT maker OpenAI that went to court late last month against Elon Musk. The ChatGPT maker's lawyers argue that “Musk’s continued attacks on OpenAI, culminating most recently in the fake takeover bid designed to disrupt OpenAI’s future, must cease. Musk should be enjoined from further unlawful and unfair action, and held responsible for the damage he has already caused.”Elon Musk and OpenAI have been in a rather public spat. In early 2024, Elon Musk sued the company claiming that OpenAI is using GPT-4 to ‘maximize profits’ instead of ‘for the benefit of humanity.’ Elon Musk helped co-found OpenAI in 2015 but no longer holds a stake in the company.Microsoft is reportedly considering limiting its involvement with Elon Musk's xAI to hosting the existing Grok AI model on its Azure AI Foundry platform, rather than providing the extensive server capacity required for training future, more advanced iterations. This development, as reported, suggests a potential shift in Microsoft's strategy towards xAI, even as it makes the current Grok model accessible to developers through its Azure AI infrastructure.Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft's platform designed to empower developers with AI tools and models for building and managing AI-powered applications, is slated to host Grok. This would allow developers utilizing Azure to leverage Grok's capabilities within their own projects.The report from The Verge raises questions about the exclusivity of this hosting arrangement, leaving it unclear whether other major cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), might also gain the ability to host the Grok model.This potential limitation on providing training infrastructure for future Grok models comes amidst reports of Microsoft actively exploring alternatives to its close partnership with OpenAI. As previously reported by The Information in March, Microsoft has been developing its own in-house AI reasoning models and has been evaluating models from xAI itself, Meta, and China's DeepSeek as potential enhancements or replacements for OpenAI's technology within its Copilot AI assistant.Notably, Microsoft recently made DeepSeek's R1 model available on its Azure platform and GitHub for developers, capitalizing on the model's growing popularity. This move further underscores Microsoft's apparent interest in diversifying its AI model portfolio and potentially reducing its reliance on any single external provider.","Microsoft reportedly planning to tie-up with OpenAI's 'biggest enemy, or should we say 'Enemy No. 1', Elon Musk.

"Sam Altman shares Ghibli photo with Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO responds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-shares-ghibli-photo-with-satya-nadella-microsoft-ceo-responds/articleshow/120803301.cms,"Reported tension between Sam Altman and Satya Nadella

Riding on Ghibli fame

ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has shared a Ghibli photo with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella . In a post on Twitter, Altman wrote, ""fun showing @satyanadella our new office and talking about some of our latest progress!"" He shared a Ghibli photo of himself along with Nadella with the Twitter post.Nadella responded to OpenAI CEO's Ghibli Photo post. ""Great to see you today, @sama. Love the new office!,"" wrote Microsoft CEO. What makes the post interesting is that it comes just a day after the Wall Street Journal's news article titled ""Altman and Nadella, Who Ignited the Modern AI Boom Together, Are Drifting Apart'.The almost 500-plus words article claims how the OpenAI and Microsoft CEOs helped each other become power players in generative AI but are now preparing for independent futures. ""Sam Altman once said OpenAI and Microsoft had the “best partnership in tech.” Now, their Silicon Valley marriage is on the rocks,"" is how the article startsThe crux of the WSJ article is that the once strong partnership between Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appears to be facing some strain, moving from frequent daily communication to less regular contact. This cooling period is said to be possible due to several factors. Microsoft's acquisition of the Inflection AI team to build its own AI models could signal a move towards greater independence. Microsoft reportedly paid $650 million to hire Mustafa Suleyman and his colleagues at startup Inflection. Suleyman, who is one of the three co-founders of Google’s DeepMind, began work building a large language model that aimed to rival what was then OpenAI’s most advanced publicly released technology, GPT-4.There are also reports of disagreements on the timeline for achieving AGI and OpenAI's alleged slowness in sharing advanced model code. Furthermore, Altman's ""Stargate"" project, a large AI data center initiative involving Oracle and SoftBank but notably excluding Microsoft, has raised eyebrows. While both companies remain closely linked through investments and integrations, these developments suggest a shift in their dynamic as they navigate the rapidly evolving AI landscape.Incidentally, Ghibli-style AI art became a frenzy when ChatGPT's image-generation tool GPT-4o launched in March end. The tool led to a record surge in users for OpenAI's chatbot, straining its servers and temporarily limiting the feature's usage. The viral trend saw users from across the globe flood social media with images based on the hand-drawn style of the famed Japanese animation outfit, Studio Ghibli, founded by renowned director Hayao Miyazaki.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has shared a Ghibli photo with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

Tesla Bull Larry Goldberg says 'breathless announcements' that Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm is selling all her Tesla shares is incredibly ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-bull-larry-goldberg-says-breathless-announcements-that-tesla-board-chair-robyn-denholm-is-selling-all-her-tesla-shares-is-incredibly-/articleshow/120803077.cms,"Larry Goldberg's scathing post on Tesla Board's plan to fire Elon Musk

""The @SawyerMerritt post below, along with all the reposts that ""Robyn Denholm has filed to sell her shares"" and breathless announcements that she is selling Tesla shares are incredibly misleading. Yes, Robyn Denholm filed to sell $32m in Tesla Stock. No, she is not reducing her investment in Tesla: at the very least she is maintaining her investment in Tesla, and as I demonstrate below, has increased that investment over time.

In the simplest of terms, in 05/05/2022 Robyn owned 15,000 shares (5,000 shares pre-August '22 split); by July of 2024 she had acquired a further 70,000 shares (at an average cost of about $300 per share, or a total of $21m), to up her count to 85,000 shares, the number she owns today.

In a post today http://driveteslacanada.ca mis-reports that with this sale Robyn is liquidating her holdings in Tesla. This duplicates the errors of that publication's reports of the sales Robyn made in March, and the sales in previous months.

Well they couldn't be more wrong. As I noted above Robyn has in fact INCREASED her investment in Tesla within the last year.

Sawyer's post below, and the reporting from Drive Canada simply fail to explain how Share Options work. This isn't a special situation for Robyn...it's how ALL corporate share options function.

When options are granted, they DO NOT CONSTITUTE SHARE OWNERSHIP! They are a right to buy the share at the pre-determined exercise price. Claiming that when an executive sells the shares acquired in an option transaction that they are ""selling their shares"" is highly misleading.

Few understand that when a share option is exercised, and the share is purchased at the option strike price, then the difference between the price of the option and the current share price - is taxed at normal rates of tax. A portion of the shares acquired by the exercise of the option is generally sold in order to pay the tax.

The misunderstanding is compounded when an executive prepares to exercise his or her options, they are generally required to file in advance a form 144, Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities. It's this notice that everyone and their brother trounces upon, and announce to the world that this executive is going to sell their shares...instead of awaiting the Form 4, which details, after the fact, how many total options are exercised (shares purchased) that are NOT sold, and thus are net additional shares actually acquired by the executive.

For example, on 7/25/2024 Robyn acquired about 45,000 shares in Tesla (post split numbers are given throughout), sold 20,000 shares to pay for the options and the tax on the gains, this increasing her share count by 25,000. In this case, her form 144 would have announced the intention to sell 20,000 shares, with no information about her intention to buy 25,000 shares!

Over time, in this way, Robyn has accumulated a position of 85,000 shares in Tesla, all of which comes from the exercise of her options. Thus Robyn has INCREASED her share count, not reduced her share count.

The reason the share ""sales"" are coming with a frequency is that her options expire in August 2025, and there remains 300,000 options to be exercised by then.

We don't have a full accounting of the cash and options she lost in the settlement with the Delaware Court; once we have the detail - I expect we'll be getting that at the Annual Meeting - then I'll do a more complete accounting of her share acquisition and option situation.

Robyn Denholm on Tesla Board wanting to fire Elon Musk as CEO

Robyn Denholm is highest-paid Board chair of any listed American company

Tesla board chairwoman Robyn Denholm recently sold another massive chunk of stock as the company’s regulatory filings revealed this week. The sale comes at a time when Tesla shares are trading almost at their lowest, thanks to CEO Elon Musk’s no-to-liked ties with the Donald Trump administration. Denholm, who has been with the Tesla board since over a decade, sold 112,390 shares of Tesla worth more than $32 million, according to an SEC filing. Since December 2024, Denholm has reportedly sold more than $150 million in stock. Denholm first joined Tesla’s board in 2014 and became chairwoman in 2018 after Elon Musk was forced to step down from the role by regulators.The share sales sparked the speculation about Denholm’s future at Tesla. Auto blog Electrek speculated that Denholm “appears to be completely liquidating her stake.” However, Tesla Bull and long-time investor Larry Goldberg strongly refuted this. In a Twitter post, he said that the report was “misleading” and that Denholm is likely exercising share options that are set to expire while selling a portion to cover associated taxes.In the long Twitter post, Goldberg wrote:The Wall Street Journal reported on April 30 that unidentified Tesla board members had reached out to executive-search firms about a month ago to find a new CEO for Tesla. Denholm called the story “absolutely false.” “The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead,” Denholm said via the company’s X account.As per company details, post the recent sales, Denholm owns about 85,000 shares and has 300,440 stock options. Denholm’s term as board chair is up for another vote next year. Since joining the board, she has received more than $680 million in cash and stock – ranking as the highest-paid chair of any US public company, according to a Reuters analysis last March.Last year, Denholm and other members of Tesla’s board faced criticism from a Delaware judge who said the pay package they approved for Musk was too excessive. The judge’s decision to reject Musk’s pay package led the billionaire to move Tesla’s state of incorporation to Texas.","Tesla board chairwoman Robyn Denholm sold another massive chunk of stock this week.

Nvidia criticises Google and Amazon-backed AI startup for ‘Chinese smuggling tactics’ claim: ‘American firms should focus on…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-criticises-google-and-amazon-backed-ai-startup-for-chinese-smuggling-tactics-claim-american-firms-should-focus-on/articleshow/120800671.cms,"Representative Image

What Nvidia said about Anthropic’s ‘Chinese smuggling tactics’ claim



“American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’ China, with half of the world’s AI researchers, has highly capable AI experts at every layer of the AI stack. America cannot manipulate regulators to capture victory in AI.”

“Maintaining America’s compute advantage through export controls is essential for national security and economic prosperity,”

What Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said about China’s AI capabilities



“They’re incredible in computing and network technology, all these essential capabilities to advance AI. They have made enormous progress in the last several years,”

Nvidia has slammed Anthropic for its claims that Chinese smugglers are using ‘bizarre’ methods to sneak advanced chips past export controls. This includes hiding them in “prosthetic baby bumps” and “alongside live lobsters.” The clash comes as the US chip export restrictions , introduced under the previous Biden administration and known as the "" AI Diffusion Rule ,"" are set to take effect on May 15. The rule aims to curb the transfer of cutting-edge AI chips and model weights to countries like China amid rising global AI tensions . In a recent blog post, the AI startup backed by Google and Amazon has urged stricter enforcement of the rules, which prompted Nvidia to push back, warning that American companies should avoid “fear-mongering” and focus on innovation. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump is also reportedly considering updates to the restrictions.In a statement to CNBC, a Nvidia spokesperson said:This statement comes after Anthropic, which depends significantly on Nvidia hardware to train its AI models, called for stricter export controls that could impact Nvidia’s international business and chip sales revenue.The company argued that access to computing power is the key strategic chokepoint in the global race to develop advanced AI. To address this, Anthropic proposed lowering the export threshold for Tier 2 countries, tightening regulations to curb smuggling, and boosting enforcement funding.Anthropic wrote in a blog post.Last month, when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with Chinese trade officials in Washington DC, he said that China is “not behind” the US in AI and praised Huawei as a top global tech company.Huang said.",Anthropic claims that Chinese smugglers are using ‘bizarre’ methods to sneak advanced chips past export controls.

Mark Zuckerberg's Education Ventures

The Primary School , a no-cost private institution in the Bay Area co-founded by Priscilla Chan , wife of Facebook parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , will reportedly cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students. First reported by Bloomberg, the impending closure was disclosed in a statement posted on the school's website recently. In a move aimed at preserving its legacy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the billionaire couple's philanthropic arm, has committed $50 million to invest in the communities the school serves -— specifically East Palo Alto, Belle Haven, and the East Bay region near San Francisco -- over the subsequent few years.""This was a very difficult decision, and we are committed to ensuring a thoughtful and supportive transition for students and families over the next year,"" the online statement conveyed. Carson Cook, a spokesperson for The Primary School, stated there would be no further comment beyond the official announcement.Pediatrician Priscilla Chan, 40, co-established The Primary School in 2016, implementing an ""integrated health and education model"" designed to support families and children from birth through high school, according to the organization's tax filings. The school's inaugural middle school cohort commenced in 2023.The most recent tax documentation indicates that over 95% of The Primary School's students in East Palo Alto identify as under-represented minorities. The filing also revealed the nonprofit held assets exceeding $30 million as of the end of June 2023.The Primary School is among several educational endeavors recently initiated by prominent billionaires. Elon Musk , Jeff Bezos, and Larry Ellison have all established schools in recent years. Musk's nonprofit, the Musk Foundation, has contributed $237 million to his technology-focused primary and secondary school in Austin, named Ad Astra, with future aspirations for a university. Ad Astra collaborates with the same entity that assisted Ellison in establishing his Hala Kahiki Montessori school in Lanai, Hawaii, an island largely owned by the Oracle co-founder. Amazon.com founder Bezos has created a network of Montessori-inspired preschools catering to children in underserved communities.The closure of The Primary School coincides with significant strategic shifts within Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms Inc. as the 40-year-old founder appears to be aligning his business interests more closely with the Trump administration. Recent appointments to Meta's board include longtime Trump allies Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, and Dina Powell McCormick, who served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser during his first term.Furthermore, Zuckerberg has appointed a Republican strategist as chief of global affairs, eliminated Meta’s US fact-checking program, rolled back the company’s hate-speech policies, and discontinued key diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at both Meta and CZI. This contrasts with The Primary School's documented commitment to diversity, which included conducting a diversity audit in June 2020 following the Black Lives Matter protests and forming a DEI task force in the fall of that year.","The Primary School will cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) has committed $50 million to invest in the communities the school serves. The Primary School is among several educational endeavors recently initiated by prominent billionaires.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120497474,imgsize-14650,width-400,resizemode-4/Why-Mark-Zuckerberg-considered-deleting-everyones-Facebook-friend-list.jpg"

The REAL ID Act was enacted by Congress in 2005 in response to security concerns following the September 11 attacks. It requires the establishment of minimum security standards for the issuance of state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards. Beginning May 7, 2025, US residents aged 18 and older will be required to present a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or state ID, or another acceptable form of identification, to board federally regulated domestic flights or gain access to certain federal facilities.Although originally set to take effect earlier, the enforcement deadline was postponed multiple times to allow states and residents more time to comply. As the deadline approaches, it is crucial to understand what REAL ID is, how to check if your ID is compliant, and how to apply for one, including eligibility for online application.Not all states allow REAL ID applications online. Many require an in-person visit for the initial issuance due to document verification requirements. However, some states permit online upgrades if:Check your state DMV or licensing agency website to confirm if online application or renewal is available.To apply for a REAL ID, you must provide original or certified copies of the following:Some states may have additional documentation requirements, so consult your local DMV for specifics.The REAL ID Act was a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, intended to enhance security by making it harder to forge state-issued identification. It mandates that states verify specific documentation and use secure card production and issuance practices before issuing IDs.After May 7, 2025, a REAL ID or an acceptable alternative will be required for the following purposes:It’s important to note that a REAL ID is not required for voting, driving, banking, or applying for federal benefits such as Social Security.Yes. Beginning May 7, 2025, you must present a REAL ID-compliant license or an approved alternative identification to pass through TSA security checkpoints at US airports for domestic flights.If you do not have a REAL ID, you may use one of the following acceptable alternatives to board domestic flights or access secure federal facilities:A REAL ID-compliant card has a star in the upper-right corner. If your card lacks this star, it is not compliant and will not be accepted for REAL ID purposes. However, Enhanced Driver’s Licenses (EDLs)—issued by a few states—are acceptable even without the star marking, as they comply with federal security requirements.Only five states currently issue EDLs:EDLs are REAL ID-compliant and also allow land and sea border crossings between the US and Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative.Yes. States continue to offer non-REAL ID-compliant cards, often labeled “Not for Federal Identification.” These can still be used for driving and other non-federal purposes but will not be accepted for air travel or entry into certain federal buildings after May 7, 2025.The final enforcement date is May 7, 2025. After this date, only REAL ID-compliant cards or approved alternatives will be accepted for TSA screening and federal facility access. Starting May 7, 2025, TSA and other federal agencies will only accept IDs that meet REAL ID security standards. Travelers presenting non-compliant IDs will be denied access to domestic flights and certain government buildings unless they provide an acceptable alternative.Yes. As of now, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and US territories including Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands are compliant and issuing REAL ID cards.No. A REAL ID cannot be used for international land, air, or sea travel. A US passport is still required for:No. REAL IDs are not valid for international cruise departures. Cruise travelers must carry a valid passport or passport card for identification.Yes, but only for international travel. If traveling within the US, you need either a REAL ID-compliant license or an acceptable alternative—not both. However, a passport remains mandatory for traveling abroad.Yes. Enhanced Driver’s Licenses (EDLs) issued by the five eligible states (MI, MN, NY, VT, WA) are considered acceptable for all REAL ID purposes, including air travel, accessing federal facilities, and entering nuclear power plants—even though they may not bear the star marking.As of December 17, 2018, states are permitted to issue REAL ID-compliant cards to citizens of the Freely Associated States (FAS), which include:To qualify, FAS citizens must be lawfully admitted under the Compact of Free Association and meet all identity and residency requirements set forth by the REAL ID Act.","The REAL ID Act was enacted by Congress in 2005 in response to security concerns following the September 11 attacks.

Implications for global research

Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law, which restricts the sharing of “important data” with overseas partners without approval. The suspension impacts joint research in fields like health and environmental studies , raising questions about the future of international scientific cooperation .Implemented in 2021, China’s Data Security Law broadly defines “important data” as information that could threaten national or economic interests or affect the rights of individuals or organisations. European agencies, including the German Research Foundation , Swedish Research Council, and Swiss National Science Foundation, have expressed concerns over the law’s vague provisions, which make it difficult to assess compliance and avoid legal liabilities.The law requires security clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China to export data classified as “important,” effectively making cross-border data sharing extremely challenging. This has led to the suspension of new co-funded projects with China’s National Natural Science Foundation.The halt in collaborations could delay progress in critical areas like pandemic response and air quality studies, where data sharing is essential. Experts warn that the restrictions may hinder the ability to address global health challenges effectively.Jan Palmowski, Secretary-General of the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities, emphasised the need for responsible and safe data sharing to tackle future pandemics and other health crises.","Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Trump's tariffs



Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently revealed that nearly 30% of the company’s code is written by AI. Speaking before a live audience with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , Nadella said “I’d say maybe 20%, 30% of the code that is inside of our repos today and some of our projects are probably all written by software”. The Microsoft CEO further stated that the amount of code being written by AI is significantly going up at his company. Nadella was reportedly replying to the question asked by Zuckerberg about the percentage of Microsoft code written by AI. However, the Meta CEO failed to answer when Satya Nadella posed the same question to him.Zuckerberg said that he isn’t aware of the exact figure, but added that Meta is developing an AI model that can in turn build future versions of the company’s Llama family of AI models.“Our bet is sort of that in the next year probably … maybe half the development is going to be done by AI, as opposed to people, and then that will just kind of increase from there,” Zuckerberg said.Speaking at Google-parent Alphabet’s earnings recently, CEO Sundar Pichai also revealed that more than 25% of the new code is now written by AI.Last month, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke told employees that before requesting additional staff, they must first show that AI cannot do the job. Meanwhile, Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn said in a memo last week that the company will start using AI more and rely less on human contractors over time.In related news, Nadella recently empahsised the reliance on software than hardware as a solution to reduce pressure from Trump’s tariffs. During the Q1 earnings calls, the Microsoft CEO said “I think if you sort of buy into the argument that software is the most malleable resource we have to fight any type of inflationary pressure or any type of growth pressure where you need to do more with less, I think we can be super helpful in that.”“And so if anything, we would probably have more of that mindset is, how do we make sure we are helping our customers, and then, of course, we’ll look to share gains,” Nadella added.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently revealed that nearly 30% of the company’s code is written by AI.

Elon Musk on if DOGE has been effective

Elon Musk says he didn’t always like the job

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is scaling back his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), a federal initiative aimed at reducing government spending and modernizing technology systems. Musk, who was serving as a special government employee, is transitioning from daily in-person engagements at the White House to remote participation. In an hour-long interview on Wednesday April 30, Musk told reporters “Now we’re getting more of a rhythm. And so the amount of time that it’s necessary for me to spend here is much less, and I can return to primarily running my companies, which do need me.”During the interview, Musk insisted that the transition does not mean that DOGE work is done. The task force which was originally set up to terminate on July 4, 2026, will reportedly continue till the end of 2028. Asked about the possibility of extending DOGE's mandate, Musk responded, ""I think so,"" adding, ""It's up to the president.”Stating that during the “intense” three months of the Trump administration, he occasionally slept over at the White House at Trump’s invitation. Musk has frequently traveled with Trump in recent months. Sharing an exchange after such travels, Musk said: “He (Donald Trump) was like: 'Where are you staying?' I was like: 'I don't know. At a friend's house, I guess.' And then he was like: 'Why don't you stay here?' I was like: 'Sure.'”He would stay over in the White House’s Lincoln Bedroom where he occasionally played video games – Diablo and Path of Exile.Musk, during the interview, recalled that Trump once called him late at night and suggested he get ice cream from the White House kitchen. “He’ll actually call late at night and say, ‘Oh, by the way, make sure you get some ice cream from the kitchen,’” Musk said, jokingly adding “Don’t tell RFK.”During his tenure at White House, Musk told reporters that he was assigned an office on the top floor of the West Wing. Stating that he intends to keep the “comically tiny office”, he added that it's a tight space and gets only a ""glimmer of sunlight.""“It has a view of nothing,” he said. “It has a window but all you see is the HVAC unit, which is fine. It makes it harder to shoot me, I guess. There's not a good line of sight.”During the interview, Musk told the reporters that DOGE has cut $160 billion in federal spending which is far short of the $2 trillion goal he set last year. He said “In the grand scheme of things, I think we've been effective. Not as effective as I like ... but we've made progress.”He further added: “There's a long way to go. It's pretty difficult ... It's like: How much pain is the Cabinet and Congress willing to take? It can be done. But it requires dealing with a lot of complaints.”Musk also talked about the backlash DOGE faced for its actions and how his companies, especially Tesla became a target of protests and vandalism. He said “Being attacked relentlessly is not super fun” adding ""Seeing cars on fire is not fun.""","Tesla CEO Elon Musk is scaling back his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency.

WhatsApp launches ‘Private Processing’ to enhance AI chat privacy: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-launches-private-processing-to-enhance-ai-chat-privacy-report/articleshow/120797571.cms,"WhatsApp Private Processing

What is Private Processing

User-initiated and entirely optional

No retention of messages after the session ends

Unauditable by Meta, WhatsApp, or third-party vendors post-session

Supports end-to-end encryption principles

WhatsApp’s 'Private Processing' secures AI chats with no data stored

The system does not retain user messages, even temporarily, for future use.

Even if a hacker gains access to Meta’s infrastructure, they would be unable to access historical Private Processing interactions.

Additional safeguards:

Meta is integrating Private Processing into its bug bounty program, encouraging ethical hackers to identify potential vulnerabilities before launch.

A detailed security engineering design paper will be released ahead of the full rollout, outlining the architecture, privacy logic, and threat models.

Meta will allow independent audits to verify that the feature meets stated privacy expectations and performs securely in real-world environments.

Meta’s Private Processing vs. Apple’s Private Cloud Compute

Feature

Meta’s Private Processing

Apple’s PCC

Deployment Platform

WhatsApp (cloud-based AI interaction)

iOS/macOS devices with server fallback

Default Status

Optional and user-initiated

On-device by default; uses PCC as fallback

Data Retention

No message retention post-session

Minimal and encrypted when stored briefly

Obfuscation Protocol

OHTTP (Oblivious HTTP) via third-party

OHTTP used for obscuring user IPs

Auditability

Independent third-party verification

Apple audits and claims verifiable design



Role of OHTTP and third-party relays

Meta can see the request content but not the user’s identity.

The relay provider sees the IP address but not the content.

Auditability and transparency measures

Independent researchers and privacy watchdogs can audit Private Processing.

The bug bounty program enables ongoing white-hat testing.

A soon-to-be-published security white paper will provide the technical blueprint of the system, enabling academic scrutiny.

Broader implications for messaging privacy and AI integration

Private Processing launch timeline and availability

Be available to WhatsApp users in selected regions in the coming weeks.

Roll out initially as an opt-in feature.

Eventually integrate more AI capabilities as the infrastructure matures and proves secure.

Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, has unveiled a new feature aimed at strengthening user privacy while engaging with artificial intelligence tools within the app. The feature, titled ""Private Processing,"" is designed to allow users to interact with Meta AI in a more secure and confidential manner. Unlike standard AI chats or queries processed over traditional cloud infrastructure, Private Processing ensures that neither Meta, WhatsApp, nor third-party entities can access the user’s data once the session ends.According to Meta’s announcement, this function will be optional and is expected to roll out in the coming weeks. The company claims the system is designed with both privacy and auditability in mind, featuring enhanced protections against external and internal threats. Meta has also taken steps to make the system verifiable by independent parties and more resistant to cyberattacks, further aligning itself with evolving privacy standards in the tech industry.Private Processing is a confidential AI interaction system being added to WhatsApp that enables users to interact with Meta AI without leaving data traces that can be accessed later. When enabled, it provides a temporary processing session for tasks such as generating AI summaries, retrieving information, or engaging in chat-based queries, all without storing or linking the user’s messages to identifiable metadata once the interaction ends.Key characteristics:Meta emphasises that Private Processing is built with security at its core. Once the AI completes a user’s request, the session data is discarded, ensuring that:The Private Processing model bears similarities to Apple’s Private Cloud Compute (PCC), a system introduced for confidential cloud-based AI interactions. Both aim to achieve secure, privacy-respecting processing outside the user’s device by using advanced cryptographic protocols and secure hardware environments.While both systems use Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) to hide user IP addresses from Meta or Apple, Meta’s implementation is user-triggered, whereas Apple’s approach favors on-device processing by default, switching to PCC when server-side processing is necessary.A core component of Private Processing is its reliance on Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP), a web standard that separates IP address visibility from the content being processed. Requests made to Meta’s servers are relayed through independent third-party providers, ensuring that:This privacy split ensures no single party has access to both the user’s identity and request content, creating a privacy-preserving pipeline for AI queries.To maintain public trust, Meta has built in mechanisms for external verification:Meta’s approach aligns with emerging industry standards demanding that privacy-focused claims be independently verifiable and not rely solely on corporate assurances.The introduction of Private Processing indicates a growing shift in how large tech companies balance AI capabilities with user privacy demands. As more users become concerned about data surveillance, profiling, and cyberthreats, features like Private Processing represent an effort to offer control back to the user while still allowing for advanced functionalities like chat-based AI support.With messaging apps becoming hubs for AI-powered tools, ensuring confidentiality of queries and outputs is critical to maintaining both compliance with global privacy regulations and user confidence.According to Meta, Private Processing will:Users will be able to enable or disable the feature from within WhatsApp’s AI tools settings, giving them complete control over when and how their data is processed.","WhatsApp's 'Private Processing' secures AI chats with no data stored. System does not retain user messages, even temporarily, for future use. Even if a hacker gains access to Meta’s infrastructure, they would be unable to access historical Private Processing interactions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120797775,imgsize-31298,width-400,resizemode-4/WhatsApp-Private-Processing.jpg"
Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon sounds alarm bells over Trump Tariffs; but supports him on Europe: “I definitely take away ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-sounds-alarm-bells-over-trump-tariffs-but-supports-him-on-europe-i-definitely-take-away-/articleshow/120797713.cms,"China is an important trading partner to the US: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon

Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has warned against the impact of Trump’s tariffs, stating that CEOs are “holding back on investment” and are “tightening their belt”. In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Solomon said ““The policy actions to date have raised the level of uncertainty to a degree I do not think is healthy for investment and growth”. He further added “Let's see what policy actually does go into place and that will help us better understand the forward growth trajectory, but it's clearly been slowed by these actions.”“And, as I'm talking to CEOs, as I'm talking to our clients, they are holding back on investment and they're certainly tightening their belt,” Solomon stated adding “You're going to see some companies laying off employees and running their businesses tighter because of this level of uncertainty”.In the interview, Solomon also praised Trump’s efforts to renegotiate the US trade relationship with the European Union and reduce the ""regulatory bureaucracy"" created by Brussels' ""complex"" banking rules. He said “I definitely take away a sense of resolve, of excitement, about actually moving forward, breaking down some of the regulatory barriers that have been inhibitions to growth here, and that would be quite constructive”.Stating that it was “important to get more clarity on the direction” of trade policy for things to ‘settle down’, Solomon said “Capital markets activity was up year-over-year in the first quarter”. “If the level of uncertainty grows from here, yes, you won’t see the same amount of capital markets activity,” the Goldman Sachs boss said.Talking about China, Solomon said that China is an “important trading partner”, to the West and to the US”. He said “At the moment, we're in the early stages of what, I think, is an obvious negotiation between the US and China.”Adding that “the current state of affairs is not sustainable,” he stated that “we need more clarity”. “And so that's why I think there'll be some change. You're starting to hear the administration, talking about the fact that there needs to be change and what's in place is not sustainable. But no one knows exactly how this would play out at the moment, and that's, that's increasing the level of uncertainty,” Solomon noted.","Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has warned against the impact of Trump’s tariffs.

Apple has recently sent threat notifications to iPhone users in over 150 countries. The company is trying to alert the users about the ‘ mercenary spyware attacks ’ which may have targeted them. As per Apple these types of attacks are far more complex as compared to typical cybercriminal activity or general malware. The attackers behind these kinds of attacks possess significant resources and are focused on targeting a very small number of specific individuals and their devices. These individuals are likely targeted because of who they are or what they do.Apple threat notifications are designed to inform and assist users who may have been individually targeted by mercenary spyware attacks. As per Apple’s support page, Mercenary spyware attacks are exceptionally well funded and they evolve over time. Apple relies solely on internal threat-intelligence information and investigations to detect such attacks.Such attacks are vastly more complex than regular cybercriminal activity and consumer malware, as mercenary spyware attackers apply exceptional resources to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices. Mercenary spyware attacks cost millions and often have a short shelf life, making them much harder to detect and prevent. The vast majority of users will never be targeted by such attacks.If Apple detects activity consistent with a mercenary spyware attack, we notify the targeted users in two ways:These notifications provide additional steps that notified users can take to help protect their devices, including enabling Lockdown Mode . Apple threat notification recipients can contact the Digital Security Helpline 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through their website All users should continue to protect themselves from general cybercriminals and consumer malware by following best practices for security:",Apple has recently sent threat notifications to iPhone users in over 150 countries.

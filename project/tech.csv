JBL Tune Beam 2 Review: The TWS Earbuds That Punch Above Their Weight!

The public relationship between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump unraveled on Thursday (June 5) following Musk's criticism of a key legislative initiative. The dispute, which escalated rapidly, saw both figures engage in public exchanges, leading to significant financial repercussions for Musk. The exchange began when Musk, who departed his role at DOGE in May, criticised the Trump Administration's "" Big Beautiful Bill ."" Musk labeled the legislation the ""Debt Slavery Bill"" and the ""Big Ugly Spending Bill.""President Trump responded during a White House event, defending the bill and subsequently threatening to cancel government contracts associated with Musk's companies via a post on Truth Social. This led to a decline in Tesla shares .The public dispute between the two prominent figures has since drawn commentary from various business leaders, including Mark Cuban , Bill Ackman, Vinod Khosla and others.The former ""Shark Tank"" star Mark Cuban endorsed Musk’s idea of creating a new political party. Cuban reshared Musk’s poll on X with three check marksBillionaire Bill Ackman backed both Trump and Musk on X, advising them to ""make peace for the benefit of our country.""“We are much stronger together than apart,” he said with Musk responding, “You're not wrong.”Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham shared his thoughts X, saying, “A lot of people seem to be treating this as if it were just a beef. But the underlying allegation is a very serious one. If it's true, Trump is surely going to have to resign,” he wrote in a post on X.Vinond Khosla, who has been a critic of Musk, supported the Tesla CEO on his stand on deficit.“Despite our differences, I admire your speaking up on the deficit!” Notably, Khosla endorsed Kamala Harris and was engaged in verbal spat online with Musk multiple times.Anthony Scaramucci, who has been a critic of Trump, voiced his support for Musk.“Elon is right about Trump,"" the former Goldman Sachs investment banker said in an X post.In a separate post on Friday, Scaramucci said that ""Elon lasted 12 Scaramuccis,"" a tongue-in-cheek reference to his 10-day tenure as White House communications director before Trump fired him.In an X post, Sequoia partner Shaun Maguire praised Musk for sticking to his guns.“Elon leaves it all on the field. And he puts what he believes in ahead of himself. How can you not be inspired by that,” he added.According to Gary Cohn, IBM's vice chairman, things could be very different next week, cautioning against overreacting to the situation.“If we've learned one thing over the Trump administration, this is a few hours, the world could be completely different a week from now. It's not like the White House is sitting there only worried about the Elon Musk situation,” he said on CNBC.","Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump engaged in a public spat online.

Leaked Signal messages that allegedly shared military information bring more ‘bad news’ for US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/leaked-signal-messages-that-allegedly-shared-military-information-bring-more-bad-news-for-us-defence-secretary-pete-hegseth/articleshow/121682675.cms,"Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth (Image credit: AP)

What US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said about the 'leaked' Signal messages

Realme GT 7 Dream Edition: Unboxing and first look!

The Pentagon’s watchdog is investigating whether aides to US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth were asked to delete Signal messages that may have shared sensitive military information with a reporter. This inquiry focuses on how information about the March 15 airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen was disseminated through the messaging app. The investigation comes as Hegseth is scheduled to testify before Congress next week for the first time since his confirmation hearing. He is expected to face questions under oath regarding his handling of sensitive information, as well as broader turmoil within the Pentagon , including recent senior aide departures and an internal probe into information leaks.Previously, Hegseth has faced scrutiny over the installation of an unsecured internet line in his office, which reportedly bypassed Pentagon security protocols. He has also drawn attention for sharing details about the military strikes in multiple Signal chats, including one that inadvertently included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg. Two people familiar with the investigation and documents reviewed by the news agency Associated Press confirmed the probe.The Pentagon investigation is checking whether Hegseth’s Signal chats, which included his wife, brother, top national security officials, and, inadvertently, The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief, shared sensitive information about upcoming military strikes.Investigators are also probing whether anyone was asked to delete messages and who had access to Hegseth’s phone. Critics argue that posting such detailed information before the strikes could have endangered pilots, a move that would typically lead to disciplinary action for lower-ranking military members.Hegseth maintains that no classified information was shared, though current and former military officials dispute that claim.In April, following reports about the chat that included his family members, Hegseth said to Fox News Channel: “I said repeatedly, nobody is texting war plans. I look at war plans every day. What was shared over Signal then and now, however you characterise it, was informal, unclassified communications, for media coordinations and other things. That’s what I’ve said from the beginning.”Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has reaffirmed his support for Hegseth, praising him during a Memorial Day speech despite the ongoing Signal chat controversy.Since the incident, Hegseth has kept a low public profile, avoiding Pentagon press briefings, with his spokesman addressing reporters only once, the AP report claims.",US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to testify before Congress next week for the first time since his confirmation hearing.

In a dramatic escalation of tensions, the White House announced Friday (May6) that President Donald Trump has no intention of speaking with billionaire Elon Musk, even may go ahead and sell his Red Tesla that he bought to support Elon Musk in March this year. This comes following a public feud that has rocked both men’s spheres of influence. The White House also quashed earlier reports suggesting a reconciliation, signaling a deepening divide between the two titans.The rift, which exploded Thursday (May 5) over Musk’s sharp criticism of Trump’s proposed “Big, Beautiful Spending Bill"", has sparked significant fallout. Trump’s team emphasized that the President is focused on advancing his legislative agenda and has no interest in engaging with the Tesla CEO. “The President does not intend to speak to Musk today,” a senior White House official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. A second official confirmed Musk had requested a call, but Trump declined.Trump, undeterred by the spat, personally contacted major U.S. broadcast networks to downplay the conflict. In a call to ABC, he referred to Musk as “the man who has lost his mind” and told CBS his focus remains “totally” on his Presidency.The public fallout between the world’s most powerful leader and its wealthiest individual carries high stakes. Trump risks political backlash, while Musk’s companies, heavily reliant on U.S. government contracts , face potential financial repercussions. Tesla’s stock plummeted over 14% on Thursday, wiping out approximately $150 billion in market value, though it saw a partial recovery on Friday.","The White House announced Friday (May6) that President Donald Trump has no intention of speaking with billionaire Elon Musk.

Musk-Trump BIG blow up

Amid his ongoing feud with President Donald Trump , Tesla CEO and former DOGE leader Elon Musk has unfollowed one of Trump’s top allies – Stephen Miller , the White House deputy chief of staff and his wife, Katie Miller on social media. Katie Miller served as a Special Government Employee with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Katie – who was working as spokesperson for the task force – left the White House last week to work full-time for Elon Musk, who also stepped down from his advisory role at DOGE earlier this month.According to X influence tracker 'Big Tech Alert', Musk also unfollowed Turning Point USA founder and MAGA loyalist Charlie Kirk.Incidentally, Musk and Stephen Miller – who have interacted publicly on X in the past – recently involved in an online spat after the tech billionaire criticised the “One Big Beautiful Bill”.The Tesla CEO then said that he was “disappointed” with the “One Big Beautiful Bill”, claiming it contradicted the budget-cutting goals he pursued during his tenure with DOGE. “I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don't know if it can be both,” he said. “My personal opinion.”Shortly after Musk’s comments about the bill, Stephen Miller took to X (formerly Twitter), writing:“Under senate budget rules, you cannot cut discretionary spending (only mandatory) in a reconciliation bill,” Miller wrote. “So DOGE cuts would have to be done through what is known as a rescissions package or an appropriations bill,” he added.He further stated that the bill “does not fund the departments of government” nor finance federal agencies, pushing back against Musk’s claim that it undermined DOGE’s mission.Musk and Trump – once close allies – have recently grown apart after the tech CEO publicly blasted the administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill”, claiming it will usher in “debt slavery,” lead to “American bankruptcy,” and reverse the gains made by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in cutting federal expenditure.Responding to Musk’s remarks, Trump said “I'm very disappointed with Elon. I've helped him a lot. He knew the inner workings of the bill better than anybody sitting here. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem & he only developed the problem when he found out we're going to cut EV mandate”.While the tech billionaire claimed that the bill was “never shown” to him “even once”. Musk further revealed that the bill was passed in the “dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!”.","Elon Musk has unfollowed White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and his wife, Katie Miller on social media.

Succession planning takes center stage

Record performance justifies hefty pay package

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told Fox Business on Monday that his retirement from America's largest bank is still ""several years away,"" leaving the final decision to divine providence and the board of directors. The 69-year-old banking titan, who has led JPMorgan for nearly two decades, indicated he might remain as executive chairman after stepping down from the CEO role.""It's up to God and the board,"" Dimon said in the taped interview. ""There will be an appropriate time, and then I may stick around for a couple of years as chairman or executive chairman. I love what I do.""The question of Dimon's successor has intensified following his 2024 announcement that retirement was ""less than five years"" away. JPMorgan's recent investor day became an unofficial audition for potential replacements, with analysts closely watching key executives including consumer banking chief Marianne Lake and corporate banking co-heads Doug Petno and Troy Rohrbaugh.Dimon previously joked that retirement was always ""five years away"" regardless of when asked, but has grown more serious about succession planning as the bank's board actively evaluates candidates.Under Dimon's leadership, JPMorgan achieved record-breaking financial results in 2024, posting $58.5 billion in net income—the highest annual profit in American banking history. The stellar performance earned Dimon a substantial pay increase to $39 million, up 8.3% from the previous year's $36 million compensation.JPMorgan's stock has surged over 130% in the past five years, cementing the bank's position as Wall Street's most valuable financial institution. Despite this success, Dimon emphasized the importance of staying competitive against emerging fintech rivals like Stripe.""I don't sit here being complacent,"" he noted, advising aspiring leaders to ""talk to everybody"" and avoid becoming ""weaponized by one side.""","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told Fox Business that his retirement is still ""several years away"" Dimon indicated he might remain as executive chairman after stepping down from the CEO role.

Allegations against Elon Musk: Immigration status and more

The background of the Musk-Trump fallout

Steve Bannon’s longstanding criticism of Elon Musk

The political and legal implications

The escalating feud between Elon Musk , the world’s richest entrepreneur, and former President Donald Trump has taken an explosive new turn. Steve Bannon , a former White House strategist and close Trump ally, has publicly urged Trump to investigate Musk’s immigration status and deport him “immediately.” This demand comes amid growing tensions between the billionaire CEO and the MAGA movement, which Musk once aligned with but has since distanced himself from.Bannon has also called for the federal government to seize Musk’s SpaceX company, invoking the Defense Production Act, in response to Musk’s threat to halt critical space missions. This article delves into the latest developments, the historical context of this feud, and the broader political implications of this extraordinary clash.On April 24, 2025, Steve Bannon made headlines by urging President Donald Trump to take decisive action against Elon Musk. On his podcast “War Room,” Bannon insisted that Trump should invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to seize SpaceX, Musk’s rocket company, citing Musk’s threat to decommission the Dragon spacecraft that transports astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS).The Defense Production Act, originally enacted during the Korean War, empowers the president to compel private companies to prioritize government contracts essential to national defense. Trump famously used the DPA during the COVID-19 pandemic to accelerate production of medical supplies. However, it is important to note that the Act does not explicitly authorize the government to seize private companies outright, raising legal questions about Bannon’s proposal.Bannon’s demand to seize SpaceX represents a dramatic escalation in the ongoing conflict. Musk later softened his stance, apparently backing off the threat to disable SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft, but the call to investigate his immigration status and suspend his security clearances remains a serious political pressure point.Bannon’s claims go beyond corporate control. He has expressed a “strong belief” that Elon Musk, a South African-born billionaire who became a naturalized US citizen, is in the country illegally and must be deported immediately. He demanded a formal federal investigation into Musk’s immigration status, asserting that Musk’s past and current actions warrant government scrutiny.In addition, Bannon has called for probes into allegations of Musk’s drug use and claims that Musk sought classified Pentagon briefings on China — claims Musk has vehemently denied, labeling some reports as “pure propaganda.” Bannon also suggested suspending Musk’s security clearances and revoking federal contracts across his business empire, including Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter).The rift between Elon Musk and Donald Trump did not happen overnight. Musk was once a prominent Trump supporter, serving briefly as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and acting as a key presidential adviser. The relationship began to sour publicly when Musk vocally opposed Trump’s legislative priorities, especially the “One Big Beautiful Bill” currently under Congressional consideration. Musk condemned the bill as a “disgusting abomination” and urged lawmakers to kill it.The personal animosity intensified further after Musk accused Trump’s administration of withholding files related to Jeffrey Epstein, insinuating the president was protecting himself. Musk’s public support for impeachment proceedings against Trump and favoring Vice President JD Vance as a replacement deepened the divide.Trump, in turn, has expressed disappointment and frustration with Musk’s break from their alliance. He has threatened to revoke billions in federal contracts and subsidies Musk’s companies currently enjoy. Speaking to reporters, Trump said, “I’ve helped Elon a lot,” but added that Musk had “gone crazy” and implied their relationship may be over.Steve Bannon has been an outspoken critic of Musk since early 2025. He has repeatedly called Musk a “parasitic illegal immigrant” and accused him of disregarding American values and traditions. Bannon argues that Musk was given unprecedented power within the Trump administration but ultimately used it to serve his own interests rather than the country’s.On his podcast, Bannon stated, “As soon as [Musk] didn’t think he ran the deal or got the adoration, he turned on President Trump, MAGA, and most importantly, the country.” Bannon claims Musk financially supports progressive politicians and is involved in efforts to impeach Trump and influence election outcomes. He warned Trump’s supporters to be vigilant against Musk’s alleged betrayals.This feud represents a rare convergence of political rivalry and national security concerns. Bannon’s call for deportation and company seizure is unprecedented for a tech entrepreneur of Musk’s stature. It raises significant questions about the limits of executive power, the role of immigration status in public discourse, and the use of government authority against private businesses.Musk’s companies are heavily intertwined with US government contracts, especially SpaceX’s critical role in national space and defense programs. Any disruption could have significant consequences for American space capabilities and technological leadership.","Former White House strategist Steve Bannon has publicly urged President Donald Trump to deport Elon Musk.

Morgan Stanley bull has this prediction for Elon Musk's EV company Tesla,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/morgan-stanley-bull-has-this-prediction-for-elon-musks-ev-company-tesla/articleshow/121603102.cms,"Tesla may not be interested in eVTOL anytime soon

Why eVTOL market may not a profitable bet yet

Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas has predicted that Elon Musk may be ""tempted to solve"" another ""problem"" by leveraging Tesla's expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), batteries and manufacturing. As per Jones, the problem is ""commercialising air taxis,"" also known as electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles.In his latest research note, Jonas argued that Tesla may enter the nascent eVTOL market as these aircraft have long been predicted to revolutionise urban transport, yet even leading developers like Archer Aviation are still in the developmental phase.Last week, Archer's Midnight prototype, slated for its first deliveries later this year to Abu Dhabi, successfully completed a piloted flight test.According to a report by Fortune, while Jonas believes that solving this technological challenge aligns with the interests of Tesla engineers, he acknowledged that Tesla has indicated it is currently too stretched to seriously consider an eVTOL venture, without outright refuting the idea.The US government is reportedly keen on supporting the growth of flying cars. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posted this week, ""eVOTLs [sic] are going to fundamentally transform how the public travels. Let’s make sure the US leads the way.""Currently, the eVTOL market faces significant hurdles. Several promising startups, including Lilium and Volocopter, have encountered financial difficulties before establishing commercially viable services. A key challenge in achieving stringent safety standards while ensuring full autonomy, as scaling the business typically requires removing costly pilots from the equation. Additionally, there aren't enough customers with pilot licenses to support widespread adoption.","Tesla may enter the nascent eVTOL market, says Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas.

A company co-founded by PayPal co-creator Peter Thiel may have received a $40 million investment from Jeffrey Epstein . According to a report by The New York Times (NYT), Epstein made this investment in Valar Ventures, a venture capital firm associated with Thiel. The report claims that Epstein invested a substantial amount in Valar Ventures in 2015 and 2016, not long before he died in 2019. This financial link between Thiel's firm and Epstein had not been publicly disclosed previously. As per a confidential financial analysis of Epstein's estate and a statement from a Valar spokesman seen by the NYT, the $40 million investment is now reportedly worth close to $170 million. Epstein's estate is reportedly benefiting from the returns of this investment.The NYT report sheds light on Thiel's financial ties to Epstein, even as Thiel has publicly discussed Epstein in various contexts, including in relation to other tech figures. Valar Ventures, like other companies associated with Thiel, is named after a creature from J.R.R. Tolkien’s mythos.During this time, Epstein was reportedly seeking to rehabilitate his reputation following his 2008 conviction for procuring a child for prostitution. The billionaire was known for funnelling money into technology and science ventures, with some speculating that he aimed to reposition himself as a financial manager for the tech elite.Several prominent figures in tech, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, have faced questions regarding their connections to Epstein. In 2023, Elon Musk was also subpoenaed in a legal case tied to Epstein.Epstein maintained relationships with many powerful and influential individuals, some of whom were business associates. The latest revelations about Epstein’s substantial investment in a Thiel-backed company are particularly ironic, given Thiel’s public commentary on Epstein as more of a cultural symbol than someone he knew. Epstein’s links to Thiel were first reported in 2023.","Jeffrey Epstein reportedly made a $40 million investment in Valar Ventures.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in collaboration with the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), has issued a joint cybersecurity advisory following a surge in confirmed victims of Play ransomware attacks in May. The FBI reports that these threat actors have impacted over 900 organisations across North and South America, as well as Europe, including businesses and critical infrastructure providers.The updated advisory, released as part of the ongoing Stop Ransomware campaign, includes findings from new investigations this year that reveal an evolution in the cybercriminal group’s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). The advisory aims to inform organisations on how to defend against these attacks.According to FBI (via Forbes) advisory, Play a closed ransomware group, operating independently to ""guarantee the secrecy of deals"" regarding exfiltrated data. Play ransomware is believed to be linked to Andariel, a North Korean state-sponsored attack group associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s ""Reconnaissance General Bureau."" Researchers suggest Play is an ""integral part"" of Andariel's cyberattack arsenal, distributed by threat groups such as Balloonfly.The hackers leave ransom notes with victims that do not include an initial demand or payment instructions. Instead, victims are directed to contact the attackers via email, often using unique German email domains. The FBI noted that some victims are contacted by telephone and threatened with data release to compel ransom payment.Balloonfly has been implicated in multiple incidents involving Play ransomware deployment, primarily against businesses in the US and Europe, often using a malware backdoor to infect Windows systems.Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center and Microsoft Security Response Center previously observed Play ransomware being deployed after attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the Windows Common Log File System. This flaw was mitigated in April.The FBI emphasizes that the Play ransomware campaign shows no signs of abating and urges organisations to enhance their defenses immediately.","The FBI has issued a joint cybersecurity advisory following a surge in confirmed victims of Play ransomware attacks in May.

A California couple has won a $2 million award in a "" bed bug lawsuit "" against The Shores Inn in Ventura, California. The couple was able to win this lawsuit after Google and Yelp reviews helped to establish the hotel's prior knowledge of the infestation. Alvaro Gutierrez and Ramiro Sanchez filed the lawsuit following a February 2020 stay at the hotel, which they claimed left them with ""painful bed bug bites, severe skin rash, allergic reaction, scarring and personal injuries over the entirety of their bodies,"" according to the complaint obtained by USA Today.The lawsuit, filed in December 2021 by lawyer Brian J. Virag, alleged that after discovering the bedbug infestation in their initial room, the couple was moved to another, where they ""continued to be massacred from bed bugs (sic) bites."" Moreover, the complaint also alleged, based on Google and Yelp reviews left by previous guests, that the hotel management had been informed of the same bed bug issue before their stay.Gutierrez and Sanchez sought medical treatment following their stay at the hotel, the lawsuit claims, as bed bugs ""latched onto the plaintiffs while they slept, sucked their blood until they were gorged, and resisted eradication.""According to the complaint, the two suffered pain, illness, and emotional and mental distress due to the incident. As a result, they checked out of the hotel after just one night, despite having booked a week-long stay, the lawsuit states.Last month, jurors awarded Gutierrez $400,000 for pain, disfigurement, grief, and emotional distress, while Sanchez received $600,000 for similar complaints. Additionally, both men were awarded $500,000 each in punitive damages .The hotel plans to appeal or otherwise contest the ruling, appellant lawyer Wendy Lascher told the Los Angeles Times.Following the verdict, a note was discovered in one juror's notebook suggesting that two jurors may have visited the inn during the trial, and another juror reportedly remarked to others during the proceedings that the hotel was “an eyesore and should be torn down,"" LA Times reported.","Alvaro Gutierrez and Ramiro Sanchez filed the lawsuit following a February 2020 stay at The Shores Inn in Ventura, California.

How a Elon Musk’s public comments have affected his net worth earlier



Realme GT 7 Dream Edition: Unboxing and first look!

Tesla and SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk 's net worth has dropped by $34 billion, marking one of the largest single-day losses of his personal wealth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . This major decline occurred after a public and personal clash between the tech billionaire and President Donald Trump . After this online fight, Tesla’s stock tumbled over 14%, wiping out roughly $138 billion from the company’s market value. Initially, Musk's criticism was primarily directed at the Trump administrations “big beautiful bill.” However, the exchange escalated into a personal battle after Musk denied the president's characterisation that the billionaire's criticism of the bill was solely due to its potential removal of tax credits which are beneficial to Tesla. He further accused Trump of having ties with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, referenced old tweets to support his views and claimed credit for helping Trump win the 2024 election.In response, Trump issued his own criticisms, threatening to cancel federal contracts with Musk's companies. Musk countered Trump's threat by stating he would immediately de-commission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft.In November 2021, Musk posted a Twitter poll asking if he should sell 10% of his Tesla shares. Over 57% of the 3.5 million participants voted ""Yes.""That tweet triggered a 16% drop in Tesla’s stock that week, slashing $50 billion from Musk’s personal fortune. He has maintained that his social media posts do not affect his companies’ valuations.However, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disagrees. The SEC sued Musk over his notorious 2018 tweet claiming he would take Tesla private at $420 per share.A resulting settlement required Musk to pay a $20 million fine and mandated that he obtain legal approval for any social media posts concerning Tesla — an arrangement often dubbed the ""Twitter sitter.""Musk has repeatedly tried to overturn this condition, taking the fight to the US Supreme Court in 2023. His appeal was rejected last April.","Elon Musk's net worth has dropped by $34 billion, marking one of the largest single-day losses of his personal wealth.

Elon Musk-owned Starlink has reportedly got licence for satcom services in India. According to an IANS report, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has issued the Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) permit to the US company. With this, Starlink has become the third company to secure the licence to offer its commercial services in the country after Eutelsat’s OneWeb and Jio-SES . As per the report, Starlink may start its commercial services later this year or next year.The report states that Starlink is expected to receive a trial spectrum in the coming days, after meeting all the security compliance requirements outlined in its letter of intent (LoI).Before the spectrum is allocated, Starlink must get approval from the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe). The company has already submitted the required documents for this clearance.The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) gave initial approval after Starlink agreed to follow the latest national security rules for satcom operators. These include 29 new conditions such as mandatory interception and monitoring systems, use of local data centres, tracking capabilities for mobile terminals, and strict localisation of services and infrastructure.For those unaware, Starlink is a satellite-based internet service developed by SpaceX, the aerospace company founded in 2002 by Elon Musk . It offers high-speed, low-latency broadband internet across the globe using a network of satellites—earning it the nickname “broadband from the skies.”Unlike traditional satellite services that use faraway geostationary satellites, Starlink operates through the world’s largest network of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, positioned just 550 km above Earth.This growing constellation—currently at around 7,000 satellites and expected to exceed 40,000—forms a mesh network that can support data-heavy tasks like video streaming, online gaming, and video conferencing.","The licence makes Starlink the third company to receive authorisation from the telecommunications department.

Microsoft sets another record as stock all-time high and why Wall Street sees no bubble in these BIG numbers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-sets-another-record-as-stock-all-time-high-and-why-wall-street-sees-no-bubble-in-these-big-numbers/articleshow/121677123.cms,"Microsoft Corp. shares surged to a record high on Thursday, surpassing a peak from nearly a year ago, as investors increasingly view the tech giant as a prime beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, according to Bloomberg. The stock climbed 0.8% to close at $467.68, topping its previous high set in July. This milestone caps a robust recovery, with Microsoft’s shares rallying over 30% from an April low, boosting its market capitalization by more than $800 billion. At approximately $3.48 trillion, Microsoft now holds the title of the world’s largest company, just edging out Nvidia Corp., another AI powerhouse, valued at $3.42 trillion, says the report.Microsoft’s stock has gained 11% in 2025, outpacing the Nasdaq 100 Index, per Bloomberg data.The company’s latest earnings underscored its strong position in AI, alleviating concerns about the returns on its substantial investments in the technology. Robust demand for Microsoft’s cloud computing and AI services, coupled with solid growth trends, has positioned the company as a stable force amid economic uncertainties and potential tariff challenges, according to Bloomberg.“Microsoft is well positioned across its product lines, with a real ability to monetize AI,” Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, told Bloomberg. “I think when we look back in three or four years, it will be one of the companies that prospered and benefited from AI the most.”Despite being the last of the Magnificent Seven stocks to hit a new all-time high, Microsoft remains a favorite among investors. Bloomberg notes that Bank of America data shows Microsoft as the most-owned stock by long-only funds, with 91% holding positions. Additionally, over 90% of analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, with no sell ratings.While such overwhelming optimism could signal caution, Wall Street remains bullish. The average analyst price target suggests nearly double-digit upside potential over the next 12 months, Bloomberg reports. “Microsoft should continue growing at an impressive rate and the stock in no way looks excessively priced,” Awad told Bloomberg. “It can be uncomfortable when everyone is on the same side of a consensus, but in this case, I think the consensus is right.”","Microsoft Corp. shares surged to a record high on Thursday, surpassing a peak from nearly a year ago.

Dropbox CEO Drew Houston said that forcing employees back to office makes no sense if the same work can be done virtually. Speaking in an episode of Fortune's ""Leadership Next"" podcast, Houston said “Forcing people back to the office is probably gonna be like trying to force people back into malls and movie theaters. Nothing wrong with the movie theater, but it's just a different world now”. He further stated “It is unproductive if you just sort of try to photocopy what you're doing in the office onto Zoom”.“We don't have to do this—we can be a lot less dumb than forcing people back into a car three days a week or whatever, to literally be back on the same Zoom meeting they would have been at home. There's a better way to do this,” he said.For those unaware, Dropbox switched to a “virtual first” way of working in 2020, making remote work the main setup for its employees. In 2021, the company introduced a 90/10 rule—employees work from home for about 90% of the year and meet in person at a few company events during the remaining 10%.In a 2023 interview, Dropbox CEO said that remote work has given companies ""the keys that unlock this whole future of work.""""You need a different social contract and to let go of control. But if you trust people and treat them like adults, they'll behave like adults. Trust over surveillance,"" he then said.","Dropbox CEO Drew Houston said that forcing employees back to office makes no sense if the same work can be done virtually. “Forcing people back to the office is probably gonna be like trying to force people back into malls and movie theaters.

Lyft CEO David Risher shares key lessons he learned from Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/lyft-ceo-david-risher-shares-key-lessons-he-learned-from-microsoft-founder-bill-gates-and-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos/articleshow/121056372.cms,"Lyft CEO on lesson he learnt from Bill Gates

Tackling Lyft’s challenges head-on

Lyft CEO David Risher said he has spent years working with two of the biggest names in business — Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos and is now applying the lessons he learned from both of them to shape his leadership at Lyft. Risher joined Lyft as CEO in 2023. In a letter to employees that year, he shared what he had learned from his earlier jobs: ""From Microsoft, I learned how to compete ...From Amazon, I learned how to obsess over customers,"" he wrote.Lyft posted record-high ride numbers in 2024. Risher says he’s relying on another important lesson he picked up from Gates: focus more on weaknesses than on strengths.Risher recalled a key moment from the 1990s when he saw Gates answer a question at a Microsoft conference. Gates was asked about plans for Excel, which was already very popular at the time.""Gates just very honestly, and frankly, very directly said, 'I don’t spend any of my time thinking about Excel because I know that right now we’ve got [around] 60% market share, and I know that’s going to go to 80 or 90 ... I don’t have to worry about that. I don’t have to think about that,"" Risher told Fox Business in March 2024.At the time, more than 30 million people around the world were using Excel. Gates’ thinking, Risher explained, was that it was better to focus on weaker areas where improvement was needed, instead of spending time on products that were already successful.In a letter to shareholders in April 2025, Risher praised Lyft’s ""best-ever results"" in 2024, but quickly turned to the company’s ongoing challenges.""Looked at as a whole, the rideshare experience had become worse than it was a decade ago,"" he wrote.To better understand Lyft’s problems, Risher said he regularly becomes a driver himself.""Every six weeks or so, I open my Lyft Driver app and hit the road. It’s the best way to understand the experience of drivers, to pick up on frustrations we can improve upon, and to talk to riders. I love every minute of it,"" he wrote.One big complaint he noticed was about surge pricing — the practice of raising ride prices when demand is high. After hearing frequent complaints from riders, Risher asked his team to work on fixes. These included adding more drivers and giving riders the option to lock in set prices ahead of time for regular trips.""By the end of 2024, we could see that these were the right investments when drivers chose us at record rates,"" Risher wrote.Risher also admitted he hasn’t always gotten it right in the past.""Over the years, I’ve made mistakes on both ends — avoiding the work of diving into a troubled area, swooping down on issues that don’t matter, the works,"" he wrote.Still, he believes focusing on weaknesses is key to leadership success.""But I’ve never met a great leader who isn’t curious about the details,"" Risher added.","David Risher joined Lyft as CEO in 2023.

Google has reportedly agreed to pay a $50 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit alleging systemic racial bias against employees from the Black community in the US. This comes after a preliminary agreement, which covers over 4,000 current and former employees of the Alphabet-owned company in California and New York, was recently filed in the Oakland, California, federal court and is pending judicial approval, the report claims.The plaintiffs in the proposed class action accused the tech giant of fostering a ""racially biased corporate culture"" where Black employees were often directed to lower-level positions, received less pay, faced downgraded performance reviews, and were even denied advancement opportunities.The lawsuit originated in March 2022 following an investigation by the California Civil Rights Department (formerly known as a regulator) into Google's treatment of Black female employees. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, lawyers representing the plaintiffs may seek up to $12.5 million from the settlement fund for their fees. Earlier this week, these lawyers dismissed related claims on behalf of job applicants, citing evidence gathered and ""reasoned arguments"" from Google.April Curley, one of the plaintiff who was hired to enhance outreach to historically Black colleges, claims that Google denied her promotions, subjected her to racial stereotypes by labeling her as an “angry” Black woman and ultimately terminated her after six years, just as she was preparing a report on the company’s alleged racial discrimination, Reuters report noted.The lawsuit also alleges that the company’s managers undermined Black employees by claiming they weren’t “Googley” enough or lacked “Googleyness”—terms the plaintiffs argue were used as racial dog whistles.As stated in the complaint (seen by Reuters), Black employees made up just 4.4% of Google’s overall workforce and only 3% of leadership roles in 2021.","Google has reportedly agreed to pay a $50 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit alleging systemic racial bias against employees from the Black community in the US.

It was “Bill’s decision to make,” says Gates’ ex-wife Melinda French Gates

Melinda French Gates has expressed strong support for the Gates Foundation 's unprecedented plan to spend its entire $200 billion endowment on global health initiatives before closing its doors in 2045, calling the decision ""fantastic.""""The vast majority of those resources were to go back to society,"" French Gates told Fortune in a recent interview, reflecting on the foundation's original intent.The foundation announced it will double its spending to $200 billion over the next two decades to fight deadly diseases, reduce maternal and child deaths, and ease poverty worldwide.Melinda French Gates, who left the foundation last year to focus on her own organisation, Pivotal Ventures , said the former couple had always intended to spend down their resources. ""Ultimately, though, the timeline was Bill's decision to make with the board of trustees,"" she wrote in responses to AP's questions about the foundation's 25th anniversary.The Gates Foundation has already spent $100 billion in its first 25 years, with French Gates playing a pivotal role in that work since its founding in 2000.""It's kind of unbelievable to think about the progress that has been made,"" she reflected to Fortune in February from her offices in Kirkland, Washington .Melinda French Gates believes billionaires have a moral obligation to give back. ""If you're a billionaire in the United States , you benefited from this country. You benefited from good roads. You probably benefited somewhere along the way from the health sector,"" she told Fortune. ""People in other places don't have those things, and so yes, we owe something back to society.""Despite her departure from the Gates foundation, Melinda French Gates remains committed to its original mission. ""To me, the greatest measure of success would be if long after the foundation closed, someone, somewhere, was living a life that looked different because we existed,"" she wrote to AP.","Melinda French Gates has expressed strong support for the Gates Foundation's unprecedented plan to spend its entire $200 billion endowment on global health initiatives.

Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-know-about-facebook-founders-viral-rawdog-routine/articleshow/120843936.cms,"Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

‘rawdog’ morning routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well. Here’s how it aligns with executive performance demands:While Zuckerberg avoids all forms of chemical stimulation, other tech leaders have taken diverse approaches to optimizing performance:Zuckerberg’s ‘rawdog’ method is unique in its emphasis on no external stimulants, which sets it apart from the above figures.While no clinical studies have yet been conducted on Zuckerberg’s specific regimen, related research suggests:","Zuckerberg’s morning includes two hours of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA) He believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity. The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120844476,imgsize-1833412,width-400,resizemode-4/Why-Mark-Zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-Know-about-Facebook-founders-viral-Rawdog-routine.jpg"

Microsoft becomes world's most-valuable company and its No 1 position also has 'Trump Tariff' message on Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-company-and-its-no-1-position-also-has-trump-tariff-message-on-apple/articleshow/120845348.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella



Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools

Google claims breakup ""impossible"" without serious consequences

The US Justice Department have asked a federal judge to break up Google's advertising technology business, marking the second government request within a year that could fundamentally reshape the $2 trillion giant. During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

Nvidia has reportedly made changes to its H20 artificial intelligence (AI) chip, the most powerful GPU it can sell in the Chinese market. According to a report, the company is preparing to launch a modified version of the chip for China within the next two months. The move comes after recent US export restrictions effectively blocked sales of the original H20 model.Citing sources familiar with the matter, news agency Reuters reports that the updated chip will be ‘less powerful’ that the original model.The new downgraded H20 chip designs are based on revised technical thresholds set by Nvidia. These specifications are said to result in significant reductions compared to the original H20, including substantially decreased memory capacity.Reuters says that one source noted that downstream customers might potentially be able to modify the chip's module configuration to adjust performance levels. The US chipmaker has reportedly informed major Chinese customers, including leading cloud computing providers, that it aims for a July release for the downgraded H20.For Nvidia, China remains a critical market as it accounted for 13% ($17 billion) of its total sales in the fiscal year ended January 26. The company faces expanding US efforts to curb China's access to advanced semiconductor technology, citing concerns about potential military applications.The original H20 chip was developed by Nvidia specifically to comply with the October 2023 controls and had been the most powerful AI chip cleared for Chinese sales. However, US officials informed the company last month that the H20 would now require an export license, effectively halting its availability.The importance of the Chinese market was highlighted by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's recent visit to Beijing in April, just days after the new export license requirement for the H20 was announced. During meetings, Huang reportedly emphasised the market's significance to the company.Chinese tech giants, including Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, had shown strong interest in the H20 chip, placing orders reportedly valued at $18 billion by last month, the report added.","N Nvidia is preparing to launch a modified version of the H20 AI chip for China.

Tesla to open its first showroom in Mumbai’s BKC

Tesla India head Prashanth Menon has resigned from the Elon Musk-owned electric car company, reports Bloomberg. This comes as the company plans to open its first retail outlets in Mumbai and Delhi. Menon, as per the report, has worked with Tesla for nine years. He had been instrumental in laying the groundwork for the EV maker in the country.Menon, who had been leading India operations as chairman of board of Tesla India for more than four years, reportedly set up the company’s local office in Pune in 2021.He also led efforts to secure Tesla’s first showroom leases earlier this year.Tesla China to oversee India operationsAs per the Bloomberg report, Tesla China will now oversee the company's operations in India.“Tesla’s China teams will oversee India operations, with no immediate successor named, the people said. The rejigging of Tesla’s top order in India comes just as it appears to edge closer to launching in the world’s third-largest car market,” the report said.As mentioned above, Tesla is planning to open its first showroom in India soon. Earlier this year, the US electric vehicle maker finalized a deal to open its first showroom in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex, in what is probably the highest lease rent for a commercial space.Quoting sources from the property market, TOI then reported that Tesla will set up a showroom in a 4,000 sq ft space on the ground floor of a commercial tower in BKC, Mumbai. The company will display its car models there. The monthly rent is about Rs 900 per sq ft, which works out to around Rs 35 lakh a month. The lease is for five years.Tesla is also planning to open a second showroom at the Aerocity complex in Delhi. The lease deal was signed a few weeks after CEO Elon Musk met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington. Soon after, Tesla posted 13 job openings in India, showing fresh interest in entering the Indian market.The EV maker has also started the process of hiring in the country.",Tesla India head Prashanth Menon has resigned from the Elon Musk-owned electric car company.

According to a report by Reuters, The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk has completed an updated version of decades-old Pentagon software, designed to streamline mass layoffs across federal agencies.The updated toll called Workforce Reshaping toll is said to accelerate the job cuts.Originally called AutoRIF (Reduction in Force), the software was created 25 years ago by the Pentagon. However, as per the Reuters report, under DOGE’s directive, the developers at the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) have transformed it into a web-based system. This will now enable the agencies to recognise the target and speed up the manual process of layoffs.Since January 2025, approximately 260,000 federal employees have either accepted buyouts, taken early retirement, or been laid off. The Department of Veterans Affairs is preparing to cut 80,000 jobs, while the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) plans to reduce its workforce by 40%.The report also mentions that despite Elon Musk’s recent decision to step back from DOGE to focus on Tesla and his other ventures, the software rollout is proceeding under OPM’s leadership. The agency will soon begin demonstrations, user testing, and onboarding for federal departments.However, the legal experts have warned that the automated system could lead to widespread dismissals, potentially removing thousands of federal employees with minimal oversight.Don Moynihan, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ford School of Public Policy told Reuters, ""If you automate bad assumptions into a process, then the scale of the error becomes far greater than an individual could undertake.

Amazon statement

CCPA to issue guidelines

Ensure due diligence by platforms before listing such products;

Mandate verification of seller credentials and certification;

Introduce automated monitoring and takedown mechanisms for unauthorised listings;

Promote consumer awareness through proper disclosures; and

Enforce penalties and platform liability in case of non-compliance

The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution has sent notices to thirteen online commerce platforms for selling walkies-talkies illegally. “Walkie-talkies are being sold on e-commerce platforms without mandatory and clear disclosures regarding the requirement of a wireless operating license or compliance with applicable laws,” read an official release.“The product listings for walkie-talkies do not specify whether the device requires a license from the concerned authority for use,” it further added.The platforms that have received notices include Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, OLX, TradeIndia, Facebook, Indiamart, VardaanMart, Jiomart, Krishnamart, Chimiya, Talk Pro Walkie Talkie , and MaskMan Toys.The 13 platforms, as per the release, are selling walkies-talkies “without proper frequency disclosure, licensing information, or Equipment Type Approval (ETA) which constitutes a violation of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.”* Without clearly specifying the frequency range.* Without valid Equipment Type Approval (ETA) from the Wireless Planning and Coordination (WPC) Wing; and Without proper disclosure of licensing requirements to consumers.An initial review by the CCPA showed a large number of such listings across these platforms — around 467 on Amazon, 314 on Flipkart, 489 on Meesho, and 423 on TradeIndia. As a result, the Central Authority has asked these platforms to share details like the names and contact information of the sellers, product URLs and listing IDs for the walkie-talkies, frequency specifications and any licensing information shown on the listings, whether ETA/WPC certifications were collected or verified, and the number of units sold for each listing from January 2023 till now.As per Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020, online marketplaces must clearly provide all important information so that buyers can make informed choices before buying. The release stated that not giving details like the frequency range, license requirements under Indian laws, and the rules about using low-power radio devices can mislead customers into thinking that walkie-talkies are allowed for anyone to use without restrictions.“Amazon operates a marketplace in India. We require sellers who list and sell products on Amazon to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and Amazon policies. Upon being notified of any non-compliance, we take appropriate action. We are engaged closely with various stakeholders, including regulators, to provide customers with a great shopping experience,"" said a Amazon spokesperson responding to the story.To ensure compliance with the law and safeguard consumer interests, guidelines for the Prevention and Regulation of Illegal Sale and Use of Licensed Frequency Range Wireless Telegraphy Apparatus including Walkie-Talkies on E-Commerce Platforms, 2025 will soon be placed on the website of the Department of Consumer Affairs for public comments/suggestions/feedback. CCPA has also sent a letter in this regard to the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Department of Telecommunications to seek their valuable inputs.These draft guidelines aim to:","Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, OLX, Facebook and others gets government notice over illegal sale of walkie-talkies.

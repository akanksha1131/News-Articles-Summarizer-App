Netflix 'gameplay' starts in 2025

WWE magic goes back to over 20 years

WWE's media rights in India are reportedly shifting from Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) to Netflix India as part of a landmark 10-year. According to a report in Economic Times, ""Sports entertainment powerhouse WWE is preparing to transfer its media rights in India from Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) to Netflix India as part of a global 10-year, $5 billion agreement that its owner, TKO Group Holdings, signed with the streaming platform earlier this year.""The partnership marks Netflix India’s entry into sports entertainment. While Netflix has invested in live sports globally (including with the NFL), its Indian operations have previously avoided sports, even cricket, India's most popular sport. A Netflix India spokesperson confirmed to Economic Times the 2025 launch of WWE content on the platform; SPNI declined to comment.This transition, set for after March 2025 following the expiration of WWE's current SPNI contract (a five-year deal worth an estimated $180-210 million signed in 2020), marks Netflix India's entry into sports entertainment. Despite SPNI's reported desire to retain TV rights due to WWE's digital performance during the current cycle, Netflix insists on exclusivity in the Indian market.Netflix faces stiff competition from established Indian sports streaming giants like Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema, which boast popular properties like the Indian Premier League and ICC tournaments.WWE has been a fixture on Indian television via Ten Sports (later Sony Ten after SPNI's 2016 acquisition of Ten Sports from Zee Entertainment for $385 million) for over two decades. Starting January 2025, Netflix will exclusively stream WWE's flagship shows (Raw, SmackDown, and NXT) in major markets like the US, Canada, UK, and South America, expanding to India by April 2025.Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has highlighted the platform's focus on unique, global, and youth-oriented sports, aligning with sports leagues' own goals of reaching younger, global audiences.However, migrating WWE's loyal fanbase from traditional television (with 900 million viewers in India) to a subscription streaming service (with 547 million users) presents a significant challenge, especially given Netflix India's current 12 million subscriber base. This partnership is expected to significantly boost subscriptions by attracting WWE fans.The loss of WWE is a major blow for SPNI, a key component of its sports programming. Analysts suggest SPNI will need to find alternative sports entertainment content to retain viewers, despite recently securing Asian Cricket Council rights for $170 million.","WWE's media rights in India are reportedly shifting from Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) to Netflix India as part of a landmark 10-year deal.

ChatGPT maker OpenAI 's CEO, Sam Altman is unhappy with the famed investor Marc Andreessen 's description of AI meetings with the United States government. Altman has gone to the extent of disputing the same. recently shared his concerns about discussions he had with staff from the Joe Biden administration. He suggested that they appeared to want to regulate AI in a way that would favor just two or three major companies, effectively sidelining others through stringent regulations.According to a report in TechCrunch, although Andreessen did not directly name OpenAI, it was implied that the company might stand to benefit from such an arrangement. However, OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, dismissed these claims as a ""conspiracy theory"" during a podcast appearance with Bari Weiss this week.“We were in the room with them, along with other companies and the administration,” Altman said. “But there was never any conversation like, ‘Here’s our conspiracy theory —- we’re going to make it so only a few companies can build AI, and you have to do what we say.’ Never anything like that.”Regardless of the dispute, Altman and other tech industry leaders seem to be distancing themselves from the Biden administration, with reports of millions of dollars being donated to Donald Trump ’s inaugural fund.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman disputes Marc Andreessen's description of AI meetings with the U.S. government.

When Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk 'talked' cricket

Jassi Bhai Superman and other viral memes

Indian cricket team saved itself from a humiliating defeat earlier this week after a determined fight back. Indian bowlers Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep prevented what may have been a embarrassing innings defeat, preventing a follow-on to make the Aussies bat once again on Day five of the Brisbane Test. Faced with the daunting challenge of avoiding a follow-on and potential innings defeat, half-centuries from KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja, along with partnership between Bumrah and Akash Deep, helped India end day four at 252/9. The crucial knocks from KL, Jadeja, Bumrah and Akash Deep gave India a fighting chance in the test that later ended in Draw on Day 5.One of the key highlights of the day 4 was the 39-run stand between Bumrah and Akash Deep. Incidentally, Akash Deep was said to be playing with the bat given by Virat Kohli. This led some cricket fans on the internet to 'add' Virat angle to his batting.Also, Indian cricket fans couldn't thank Bumrah enough after he took six for 76 in Australia's first innings and following it up with the important runs. Joining the 'gratitude' Google India too shared an appreciation post for Bumrah, lovingly called Jassi Bhai. ""I only believe in Jassi Bhai 💪,"" reads the post from Google IndiaThe Google post on X, formerly Twitter, quoted post of Twitter user named Deepak Kumaar who had shared an earlier post match conference video of Jasprit Bumrah with the caption: ""name a better comeback than ‘Google it’""As to how the name 'Jassi Bhai' went viral for Bumrah, can't be really said. However, one of the most memorable mention of it is from India's star bowler Mohammad Siraj. After India's T20 World Cup 2024 win in South Africa, a teary eyed Mohammad Siraj said, ""I knew only Jassi bhai could do it for India, and he did it for us"".Bumrah's heroic on Day 4 of BGT also got applauds from two of the Corporate World's biggest leaders -- Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.A known ardent fan of cricket, Pichai shared the Google post on Bumrah with a caption. ""I did Google it:) anyone who can hook Cummins for a six knows how to bat! Well done @Jaspritbumrah93 saving the follow on with Deep!,"" wrote Google CEO. Pichai's post among others also got a reply from Elon Musk. ""Nice"", wrote Musk in response to Pichai's Bumrah post.Pichai then invited Musk to watch a South Africa-India match. ""Gotta watch a sa-ind game one day at newlands or wanderers:),"" he wrote, end the post with a smiley.Cricket fans love memes, and social media had lot of them on the crucial knock that Jassi Bhai played today.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella envisions a competitive future in artificial intelligence where multiple players can succeed, despite his company's close ties to OpenAI. ""It's going to be very competitive,"" though ""not win or take all,"" Nadella stated in a recent podcast, acknowledging OpenAI as a key market contender while suggesting the AI landscape will remain diverse.The remarks come as major tech companies intensify their AI development efforts, with Google recently launching Gemini and Meta advancing its open-source AI models. Nadella's comments suggest a strategic positioning that balances Microsoft's substantial investment in OpenAI with the reality of a rapidly evolving market.In the same discussion, Nadella revealed Google currently generates more revenue from Windows than Microsoft itself, highlighting the complex competitive dynamics in tech. He expressed particular satisfaction with OpenAI's recent deal with Apple, which he had pursued unsuccessfully for a decade during his tenure. ""I was the most thrilled person,"" he said, citing Microsoft's dual role as both commercial partner and investor in OpenAI.The Microsoft chief emphasized the shifting nature of consumer interaction with technology, contrasting traditional ""stateless"" search experiences with the emerging ""stateful"" interactions offered by AI agents like ChatGPT. However, he acknowledged Google's persistent advantage through its extensive mobile distribution network and default search engine status on major platforms.Microsoft is actively working to reclaim market share through its Edge browser and Co-Pilot AI assistant, viewing past losses as opportunities for future gains. ""This is the best news for Microsoft shareholders—that we lost so badly that we can now go contest it and win back some share,"" Nadella noted.","""It's going to be very competitive,"" though ""not win or take all,"" Nadella said.

Google proposes a fix for the break up order 'thrown at it',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-proposes-a-fix-for-the-break-up-order-thrown-at-it/articleshow/116559970.cms,"Google’s proposal to the US government

“Browser agreements:

Browser companies like Apple and Mozilla should continue to have the freedom to do deals with whatever search engine they think is best for their users. The Court accepted that browser companies “occasionally assess Google’s search quality relative to its rivals and find Google’s to be superior.” And for companies like Mozilla, these contracts generate vital revenue.

Our proposal allows browsers to continue to offer Google Search to their users and earn revenue from that partnership. But it also provides them with additional flexibility: It would allow for multiple default agreements across different platforms (e.g., a different default search engine for iPhones and iPads) and browsing modes, plus the ability to change their default search provider at least every 12 months (the court’s decision specifically referred to a 12 month agreement as “presumed reasonable” under antitrust law).

Android contracts:

Our proposal means device makers have additional flexibility in preloading multiple search engines, and preloading any Google app independently of preloading Search or Chrome. Again, this will give our partners additional flexibility and our rivals like Microsoft more chances to bid for placement.

Oversight and compliance:

Our proposal includes a robust mechanism to ensure we comply with the Court’s order without giving the Government extensive power over the design of your online experience.”

Google has proposed offering more options to other companies that sign contracts with it to be the automatic search engine. In a blog post, the company has proposed remedies that will offer more choices for consumers when browsing the web or using Android smartphones to assure that the US federal judge won’t need not do much to fix its search monopoly.. The proposal comes after a federal judge found Google guilty of antitrust violations earlier this year. Last month, the US government also suggested forcing Google to sell Chrome, the world's most popular web browser.Google, on the other hand, has suggested less restrictive measures, such as allowing more flexibility in exclusive agreements and offering consumers more choice in search engines on Android devices and web browsers. US Judge Amit P. Mehta is expected to decide on the appropriate remedy by next year and his ruling could significantly impact the internet landscape.In the blog post, Google noted its proposal for remedies to end its search monopoly.

Atul Subhash, a 34-year-old tech professional from Bengaluru, was discovered dead in his apartment on Monday, December 9. He reportedly left a 24-page suicide note and an hour-long video, accusing his wife, Nikita Singhania, an AI/ML Specialist at Accenture, of relentless harassment and extortion. His tragic death has sparked widespread outrage on social media, with many demanding that Accenture terminate Nikita Singhania 's employment. In response to the growing backlash, Accenture locked its official X (formerly Twitter) account earlier this week.In a latest, Accenture's CEO, Julie Sweet, has also locked her X profile. Clicking on Julie Sweet 's profile now displays the message: ""These posts are protected. Only approved followers can see @JulieSweet’s posts. To request access, click Follow.""

According to reports, posters calling for justice for Subhash were circulated among tech professionals, urging them to gather outside Jantar Mantar in Delhi, as well as at Accenture offices in Kolkata and Hyderabad.On the basis of a complaint filed by Atul's brother Bikas Kumar, an FIR has been filed against his estranged wife Nikita Singhania.

NPCI issues an advisory about 'online scams' that Indians are losing crores to,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/npci-warns-phonepe-gpay-and-other-upi-users-about-scam-that-indians-are-losing-crores-to/articleshow/116352174.cms,"What NPCI advisory says

What is digital arrest scam



How to identify a digital arrest scam

Unexpected Contact from ‘Officials’: Be cautious if someone claims to be from government agencies like the police, CBI, income tax officers, or customs agents, contacts you. Be cautious especially if they claim urgent legal action is being initiated or warranted. They might allege that you or one of your family members is involved in a serious crime like money laundering, tax evasion, or drug trafficking.

Fear-based language and urgency: Scammers may request video calls, disguising themselves in police uniforms, using government logos, or creating official-sounding background noise to appear legitimate. They often threaten arrest or immediate legal action, demanding a quick response and using legal terms to sound convincing. In some cases, they create a police station-like set up to further convince victims of their credibility.

Request for sensitive information or payment: Scammers may ask for personal information or demand large sums of money, promising that this will clear up your involvement in the alleged crime. They may also coerce you to transfer money to their account until the investigation is complete. Terms like “clearing your name”, “assisting with the investigation”, or “refundable security deposit/escrow account” might be used by them to persuade you into transferring money to specified bank accounts or UPI IDs.

Tips to stay safe

Pause and Verify: If you receive unexpected calls or messages about legal issues, take a moment to verify. Stay calm, as scammers rely on fear and urgency. Real government and law enforcement agencies will never ask for money or investigate cases through phone or video calls. Always confirm the caller’s identity and consult trusted sources before taking any action.

Use Support Channels: Report suspicious numbers to the national cybercrime helpline by dialing 1930 or the Department of Telecommunication (https://sancharsaathi.gov.in/sfc/).

The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country. As digital payments, including UPI, gain widespread adoption, incidents of online scams have risen significantly. Indians, as mentioned by PM Modi in one of the episodes of Mann ki Baat have lost Rs 120.3 crore through digital arrest scam s. In its advisory, the NPCI highlights the critical need for awareness and vigilance to protect against such fraudulent activities as India advances towards a digital-first economy.In a press release, NPCI says “Digital payments are now accessible nationwide, driving India towards a digital-first economy. They offer both security and convenience. However, it's crucial to use digital payments safely and avoid online scams. Early identification of potential scams helps protect you and your loved ones, fostering a safer, less-cash economy, for everyone.”The 'Digital Arrest' scam is a type of online fraud where cybercriminals trick individuals into believing they are under investigation or at risk of arrest by law enforcement or financial authorities. Scammers often impersonate government officials, police officers, or financial regulators and use fear tactics to manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information or transferring money. Some of the common tactics used in the scam include fake calls or messages, threat of arrest and demand for payment.As per NPCI, you can identify a digital arrest scam by keeping an eye for the following","The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

Spangram for today

Today's Strands’ answers:

The first word is sleigh.

The second word is walking.

The third word is bells.

The fourth word is glistening.

The fifth word is snow.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles.

Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Albania not the only country to regulate social media

Short video app TikTok is facing a one-year ban in Albania after the government announced the decision on Saturday, December 21. According to a report by Reuters, the ban is aimed at improving school safety. Prime Minister Edi Rama, after meeting with parents and teachers across the country, said that the ban will take place after one year.“For one year, TikTok will be completely shut down in Albania. There will be no TikTok for anyone,” PM Rama stated.Rama blamed TikTok and other platforms for fueling youth violence, pointing to the fatal stabbing of a 14-year-old boy by a classmate last month. Reports indicate the incident followed social media disputes, with TikTok videos emerging that appeared to support the attack.“The problem isn’t our children; it’s us, our society, and platforms like TikTok that are taking our children hostage,” Rama added.TikTok has called for “urgent clarity” on the ban, with a spokesperson stating, ""We found no evidence that the perpetrator or victim had TikTok accounts. Reports indicate the videos tied to this incident were posted on another platform, not TikTok.""The decision mirrors a broader trend in Europe toward tightening controls on children's social media usage. Countries such as France, Germany, and Belgium have introduced measures to reduce online risks for minors. Taking it a step further, Australia implemented a complete social media ban for children under 16 recently, marking one of the world's toughest regulations targeting tech companies like Meta, TikTok and others.",Albania's prime minister announced a one-year ban on short video app TikTok.

NFL streaming schedule on Netflix

What make NFL streaming on Netflix BIG

Netflix is reportedly pulling out all the stops for its two Christmas Day NFL games, including a pre-game performance by Mariah Carey singing ""All I Want for Christmas is You."" According to a report by news agency AP, however, there is anxiety. For, the steaming giant recognizes that technical difficulties could ruin the experience. As Netflix executive Brandon Riegg, VP of nonfiction series and sports, told AP, that the memory of the streaming issues encountered during the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight on November 14 is mit fresh.Riegg, while addressing the concerns about Netflix's readiness for a potentially record-breaking viewership, added with a caution that the sheer volume of viewers for the fight overwhelmed the system, despite extensive pre-event testing. While acknowledging the issues experienced by some viewers, Riegg emphasized that the event served as a crucial stress test, leading to numerous system improvements.""The sheer tonnage of people that came to watch was incredible. And for all the testing that the engineering team had done ahead of that, and I think they’re the best in the business, the only way to test something of that magnitude is to have something of that magnitude,” Riegg said. “We never want to have technical issues or a disappointing experience for our members. There was a subset of people that were watching that struggled with that and we acknowledge that. The good news is they stress-tested the system to such a degree that there’s a lot of these fixes and improvements that they realized that they could make, and they’re applying all that stuff.”Netflix will stream two games on Christmas Day: the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Kansas City Chiefs, preceded by a two-hour pregame show starting at 11 a.m. EST, and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans at 4:30 p.m. EST. These games will be available to Netflix's 282.3 million subscribers in over 190 countries, marking the first global distribution of an NFL game by a single outlet. This marks the first year of a three-year deal, with Netflix also streaming one game each in 2025 and 2026, at a cost of $150 million for this year's package. While a full season package doesn't align with Netflix's strategy, the Christmas Day games presented a unique opportunity.This move signals Netflix's broader ambition to become a major destination for sports fans, evidenced by its recent acquisition of U.S. rights for the 2027 and 2031 FIFA Women’s World Cup and its upcoming partnership with WWE, beginning January 6th with ""Monday Night Raw.""The Tyson-Paul fight drew a global audience of 60 million, peaking at 65 million concurrent streams (38 million in the U.S.). However, Down Detector reported nearly 85,000 viewer complaints of outages and streaming problems leading up to the fight. This contrasts with previous benchmarks for streamed NFL games: 23 million viewers on Peacock for last season's AFC wild card game and 17.3 million on Amazon Prime Video for a regular-season game.The NFL's decision to schedule games on Christmas, despite it falling on a Wednesday, is reportedly driven by the potential for increased viewership. Last year's three Christmas games averaged 28.68 million viewers. The league approved two Christmas games in March, prompting Netflix's interest. Their existing relationship with the NFL through series like ""Quarterback"" and ""Receiver"" facilitated the deal.","Netflix will stream two games on Christmas Day: the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Kansas City Chiefs, preceded by a two-hour pregame show. The games will be available to Netflix's 282.3 million subscribers in over 190 countries. This marks the first year of a three-year deal with Netflix also streaming one game each in 2025 and 2026.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116547281,imgsize-43782,width-400,resizemode-4/116547281.jpg"

KV Kamath, Chairman of Jio Financial Services , shared a word of caution for fintech companies. Speaking with Kunal Shah , Founder of CRED at the recent at the Moneycontrol Fintech Conclave, Kamath said that many fintechs are ""burning money without understanding when to stop"". He warned that what fintechs need to realise is that there is no clear endgame in sight for these companies. ""They could have actually stopped the burn despite growing well,"" he added, stressing on the importance of financial prudence.Nithin Kamath emphasized the accelerating pace of change in the financial sector, driven by customers' increasing demand for convenience. He observed that both established and emerging companies need to be ready for disruptive forces that are reshaping the landscape.Kamath also critiqued the tech industry's over-hiring, particularly among fintechs, where he noted an overemphasis on engineering talent without sufficient business acumen. ""They need to understand business too,"" he stated.Comparing India to China, Kamath highlighted the disparity in technology's contribution to GDP growth: 35% in China versus less than 5% in India. While acknowledging the importance of India's established software services companies, he asserted that new-age companies hold the key to the future. He predicted significant growth in India's technology sector's GDP contribution within the next 5-7 years. However, Kamath stressed the need for ""new discovery companies in technology, not just consumer internet companies,"" urging innovation beyond the consumer tech space.Kamath also stressed that transformation is achievable with the right mindset. He advocated for embedding technology within core business operations, creating a ""transformational organization"" where every employee understands technology's role in their daily work.","KV Kamath, Chairman of Jio Financial Services, shared a word of caution for fintech companies.

AI is an opportunity NOT a threat for techies

Tech Mahindra CEO Mohit Joshi aims to significantly boost the company's banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) business to close the gap with larger rivals who have traditionally generated more revenue from this profitable sector.Joshi, who joined India's fifth-largest software services exporter in December 2023 after a long tenure at Infosys,This compares to some competitors in the $254 billion Indian IT industry who already derive as much as a third of their revenue from BFSI.""We still have a lot of room to catch up,"" stated Joshi, whose background includes banking roles at ABN Amro and ANZ before his time at Infosys. He anticipates organic growth in Tech Mahindra's BFSI revenue share.Historically, Tech Mahindra has leaned heavily on telecom clients for revenue. However, Joshi intends to leverage his expertise in financial services to shift this focus and drive the company's turnaround.""BFSI is the single largest spender from a tech services perspective. It's very important for us to play aggressively in this space. Large banks typically spend over $10 billion a year in terms of technology,"" Joshi explained.Tech Mahindra, which has underperformed its peers in revenue and profit, will concentrate on core banking, payments, asset and wealth management, custodian services, and insurance. Joshi has already strengthened the company's BFSI leadership team.Regarding generative AI , Joshi believes it presents an opportunity rather than a threat. ""GenAI is the best spokesperson for why we need more money to be spent on technology,"" he said, dismissing the idea that it signals the end for software developers. ""I do feel that the overall demand for developers is not going to reduce, because there is a lot more work to be done candidly than there are people just now.""He also downplayed concerns about generative AI replacing customer service roles at Tech Mahindra.

Terror attacks in Germany

On Friday evening, December 21, a driver rammed a car into a large crowd of revellers at a Christmas market in central Germany, killing 5 people and injuring more than 200. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that nearly 40 of them ""are so seriously injured that we must be very worried about them.”As the news of the attack broke, Musk called for the resignation of the German chancellor Olaf Scholz.

US to ban this Chinese technology company for 'helping' Huawei,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-to-ban-this-chinese-technology-company-for-helping-huawei/articleshow/116534056.cms,"The US government is reportedly preparing to blacklist Chinese company Sophgo. According to an exclusive report in Reuters, US is set to ban Sophgo after a TSMC-made chip ordered by Sophgo was found inside a Huawei artificial intelligence processor, the Ascend 910B . This discovery suggests Sophgo illegally supplied the chip to Huawei.The chip was identified by TechInsights during a teardown of the Ascend 910B. They alerted TSMC, who then notified US authorities. TSMC subsequently suspended shipments to Sophgo after confirming the chip matched Sophgo's design.Sophgo, affiliated with bitcoin mining equipment supplier Bitmain , will be added to the Entity List, restricting U.S. exports to the company. This action follows the Commerce Department's recent addition of other companies linked to Huawei's network to the restricted trade list.Despite Sophgo's October statement denying any business relationship with Huawei, evidence suggests otherwise. Reuters' review of tenders revealed Sophgo as a supplier to Chinese local governments and state-owned firms, including China Telecom. Further, tenders showed that over the past two years, Sophgo and Bitmain AI chips were purchased by Chinese state-run universities and police stations.The connection between Sophgo and Bitmain is further strengthened by co-founder Micree Zhan's involvement in both companies. Zhan indirectly owns a significant portion of Sophgo through an investment vehicle. Sophgo even used a Bitmain email address in communications with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in 2023. While Bitmain has denied involvement in the supply chain investigation, these connections raise questions.This incident highlights Huawei's continued pursuit of advanced AI chip technology despite U.S. restrictions. The Ascend 910B is considered the most advanced AI chip from a Chinese company, and Huawei plans to begin mass production of its successor, the Ascend 910C, in early 2025.TSMC has stated it has not supplied Huawei since 2020 and confirmed it alerted both Taiwanese and U.S. authorities about the discovered chip, launching a detailed investigation. A recent U.S. order also restricts TSMC from shipping advanced chips (7-nanometer or more advanced) to China if they could be used for AI applications.","Sophgo, affiliated with bitcoin mining equipment supplier Bitmain, will be added to the Entity List, restricting U.S. exports to the company.

AT&T's Chief Technology Officer Jeremy Legg has informed US-based technology employees that they won't have guaranteed seating when the company enforces its five-day office return policy , despite making in-person attendance mandatory. In a detailed memo, Legg stated the company ""will not offer one-for-one seating per employee"" as they transition from hybrid to full-time office work.The new policy, affecting approximately 10,000 AT&T Technology Services (ATS) employees, will roll out in phases starting January 6, 2025. According to Business Insider, the workspace shortage is already causing problems, with employees resorting to working from hallways and cafeterias to comply with attendance tracking requirements.The situation appears particularly dire in some locations, with one employee reporting that their office has only 150 desks available for more than 1,200 assigned workers. The telecommunications giant is currently constructing additional space in Atlanta and Dallas to address these constraints.Business Insider reports that the implementation timeline varies by management level and location. Senior leaders (level 4 and above) must return full-time by January 6, followed by level 3 managers on February 3, and remaining employees by March 3, 2025. However, employees in Atlanta and Alpharetta may face delays until April-June 2025 as construction continues.Despite acknowledging the space limitations, Legg emphasized the company's commitment to in-person work, stating, ""We firmly believe that working together, in person and in proximity to our peers, is the best way for ATS employees to fulfill that purpose.""The memo indicates some flexibility will be permitted for travel, vacations, and other circumstances, with leaders working to accommodate occasional remote work needs. AT&T plans to monitor office capacity through presence dashboards and make adjustments as needed.The company has established a dedicated SharePoint site for transition updates and neighborhood assignments, though the actual logistics of managing thousands of employees with limited seating remain unclear.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates has this ‘tip’ from his childhood for parents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-founder-bill-gates-has-this-tip-from-his-childhood-for-parents/articleshow/116522441.cms,"What Bill Gates said about his childhood

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes that the constant distractions of smartphones and social media would have hindered his path to becoming a billionaire. In a recent blog post, Gates reflected on his childhood which was marked by significant periods of unstructured time spent reading and thinking. He believes this developed his ability to focus and delve into deep thought which was crucial to his success. Gates referred to Jonathan Haidt’s The Anxious Generation and questioned whether the existing technology-driven environment wouldn’t have allowed him to develop these habits. He even highlighted that excessive screen time, particularly on social media, has been linked to a surge in mental health issues among teenagers which includes anxiety, depression, eating disorders, self-harm, and decreased self-esteem.In the blog post, Gates said:“My childhood was marked by remarkable freedom—something that might surprise people who assume I spent all day glued to a computer indoors. I went hiking on trails that would terrify today’s parents, explored endlessly with neighbourhood friends, and ran around Washington D.C. during my time as a Senate page. When I was in high school, Paul Allen and I even lived on our own for a few months in Vancouver, Washington, while working as programmers at a power company. My parents didn’t know where I was half the time, and that was normal back then. While I got hurt on some of these adventures and got in trouble on many others, these experiences were more beneficial than bad. They taught me resilience, independence, and judgment in ways that no amount of supervised, structured activity could replicate.It wasn’t all fun and games, but I had what Haidt calls a play-based childhood. Now, a phone-based childhood is much more common—a shift that predated the pandemic but solidified when screens became important tools for learning and socialising. The irony is that parents these days are overprotective in the physical world and strangely hands-off in the digital one, letting kids live life online largely without supervision.”","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes that constant distractions of smartphones and social media would have hindered his path to becoming a billionaire.

Canada revises immigration rules

Canada has announced new rules for Express Entry workers seeking permanent residency in the country. The candidates, including Indian engineers, technicians and other IT workers, are likely to be impacted by the recently-announced changes in the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS).According to the new rules, IT workers applying for Canadian PR will no longer receive the extra CRS points they used to get for having a job offer backed by an LMIA (Labour Market Impact Assessment) – a document that allows Canadian employers to hire foreign workers legally. It is required when an employer is unable to find a Canadian citizen or permanent resident to fill a position.This means that professionals will need to achieve a higher CRS score based on other factors.Previously, Express Entry candidates with LMIA-backed job offers received a significant boost to their Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score – an extra 50 or 200 points, depending on the job offer. These bonus points provided an edge to LMIA candidates in being the deciding factor in receiving an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residency and not being invited at all.With the changes, that is, without the extra points from LMIA-backed job offers, some candidates who relied on those points to reach the required CRS score in Express Entry draws may find it tougher to get an Invitation to Apply (ITA). This may lead to increased competition among candidates whose profiles are assessed only on factors like age, education and language skills.Notably, it is unclear when these changes will come into effect.The development comes about 15 days after Canada unveiled significant changes to its immigration policies. The Trudeau government introduced reductions in the number of both permanent and temporary residents entering Canada over the next three years. These changes are part of plans aimed at addressing Canada's housing, healthcare and infrastructure challenges.","Canada has announced new rules for Express Entry workers seeking permanent residency in the country.

As artificial intelligence (AI) takes center stage in the technology world, Ukraine finds itself in possession of a valuable asset: millions of hours of drone footage that can be used to train AI models for battlefield decision-making.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Ukraine has amassed a vast trove of battlefield data (videos) through its extensive use of drones. The claims come as the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia has seen both sides deploy AI to identify targets and analyse images with speed faster than humans.Oleksandr Dmitriev, founder of the OCHI system – which centralises and analyses drone footage from over 15,000 frontline crews – revealed that his system has collected over 2 million hours of video since 2022 – which is roughly equivalent to 228 years of footage, the report said.According to Dmitriev, the footage can be used to train AI models in combat tactics and other aspects of warfare.“This is food for the AI. If you want to teach an AI, you give it 2 million hours (of video), it will become something supernatural,” Dmitriev was quoted as saying.Dmitriev said AI models can be trained to identify combat tactics, target identification and weapons effectiveness assessment. Additionally, by analysing the trajectories and angles at which weapons are most effective, AI can provide valuable insights for optimising military strategies.“It is essentially [an] experience which can be turned into mathematics,” he said.Reuters also said that Ukraine’s defence ministry has developed another system, called Avengers , that centralises and collects video from drones and CCTV.",Ukraine has amassed a vast trove of battlefield data (videos) through its extensive use of drones.

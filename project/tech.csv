Disaster on every metric ...: Elon Musk's DOGE is hurting Tesla and its shareholders; these numbers may be a proof,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/disaster-on-every-metric-elon-musks-doge-is-hurting-tesla-and-its-shareholders-these-numbers-may-be-a-proof/articleshow/119918830.cms,"Longtime Tesla analyst calls the report 'disaster on every metric'

Elon Musk on Tesla's falling numbers

Tesla , the trailblazing electric vehicle giant, reported a steep 13% drop in first-quarter deliveries, totaling 336,681 vehicles‚Äîa figure well below Wall Street‚Äôs expectations and down from 386,810 a year earlier. The disappointing numbers, released on April 3, 2025, come as CEO Elon Musk grapples with public criticism over his involvement with President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), alongside intensifying competition and operational hurdles.Analysts had forecasted deliveries exceeding 390,000, per Bloomberg data, making the shortfall a stark blow to investor confidence. Tesla‚Äôs stock took an initial hit, dropping as much as 6% in Wednesday trading, though it later rebounded over 5% following reports that Musk may soon distance himself from his Trump administration role. Despite the recovery, the stock remains down roughly 30% year-to-date.According to a report in New York Post, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives , a longtime Tesla supporter, called the report a ‚Äúdisaster on every metric,‚Äù attributing the crisis to Musk‚Äôs political entanglements. ‚ÄúMusk needs to stop this political firestorm and balance being CEO of Tesla with DOGE,‚Äù Ives wrote in a client note. ‚ÄúThe future is so bright, but this is a full-blown crisis Tesla is navigating now, and it‚Äôs primarily self-inflicted.‚Äù He warned that without a course correction, ‚Äúdarker times‚Äù could loom for the company, though he remains optimistic about its long-term potential.The delivery slump coincides with a wave of vandalism and arson attacks on Tesla dealerships in the U.S. and abroad, which authorities, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, have labeled acts of domestic terrorism tied to Musk‚Äôs DOGE role. The controversial initiative has slashed federal agencies in a bid to curb government waste, fueling public outrage.Tesla attributed part of the shortfall to production disruptions, noting that aModel Y line changeover across its four factories cost several weeks of output. Still, the company emphasized that the ramp-up of the updated Model Y is progressing well. Of the quarter‚Äôs deliveries, 323,800 were Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs, while other models, including the Cybertruck, accounted for just 12,881.Meanwhile, rival Rivian also posted grim results, with deliveries falling 36% to 8,640 vehicles from 13,588 a year ago. Though in line with expectations, Rivian‚Äôs stock slid 6%, with the company citing softer demand and California wildfires as factors. Both Tesla and Rivian face looming supply chain pressures from President Trump‚Äôs proposed 25% tariffs on imported cars and parts, though their U.S.-based manufacturing offers a competitive edge over foreign rivals like Volkswagen.In China, Tesla is losing ground to local players like BYD, while back home, Edmunds reported a record-high share of Tesla trade-ins for other vehicles in March. Amid these challenges, Musk sought to rally employees at a recent all-hands meeting, unveiling a product roadmap featuring long-awaited fully autonomous driving software. ‚ÄúHang on to your stock,‚Äù he urged, pitching the technology as a game-changer for Tesla‚Äôs valuation.As Musk navigates this turbulent chapter, Tesla‚Äôs path forward hinges on stabilizing its core business‚Äîand its polarizing leader finding a way to refocus on innovation over politics.","Tesla reported a 13% drop in first-quarter deliveries, totaling 336,681 vehicles.

Google AI chatbot Gemini head Sissie Hsiao steps down effective immediately; read Google DeepMind CEO memo to employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ai-chatbot-gemini-head-sissie-hsiao-steps-down-effective-immediately-read-google-deepmind-ceo-memo-to-employees/articleshow/119917897.cms,"Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabi memo to employees on new Gemini head

What Sissie Hsiao said on stepping down

Goole Gemini's slow start to 'impressive growth'

Google is replacing the head of its consumer AI applications division, Semafor reported after reviewing internal memos. The move comes as the artificial intelligence race increasingly centers on the products built using AI models, rather than the underlying technology itself. Sissie Hsiao, who headed Google's development of its AI chatbot, initially named Bard and now known as Gemini, is stepping down with immediate effect. Her successor will be Josh Woodward, the current leader of Google Labs, who oversaw the successful launch of NotebookLM, a popular tool that converts text into a podcast-like format.Hsiao, a long-standing Google employee of 19 years, took a leading role in the company's rapid response to the emergence of ChatGPT, which significantly disrupted the technology sector and compelled Google to accelerate the public release of its internally developed AI technology.In a memo to employees, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis stated that this leadership change aims to ""sharpen our focus on the next evolution of the Gemini app."" He confirmed that Woodward will retain his responsibilities as head of Google Labs while guiding the future direction of Gemini.Hsiao described her tenure leading the team as ""chapter 1"" of the Bard/Gemini story in her own memo to staff, expressing optimism as she hands over leadership to Woodward for ""chapter 2."" She indicated plans to take a ""short break"" before returning to Google in a different capacity.Despite Google's researchers being pioneers of the transformer-based architecture that enabled the creation of large language models powering tools like ChatGPT, the unpredictable nature of these models initially led the company to maintain a cautious approach to its chatbot experiments.The urgency of the competitive landscape led to early missteps. The launch of Bard faced criticism for generating inaccurate information (""hallucinations""), and its Gemini image creation tool drew backlash, particularly from conservatives, for producing unintended and controversial results, such as depicting women or people of color in historical contexts where it was deemed inappropriate (e.g., as Vikings, Nazis, or the Pope).However, Google has since made significant progress with successful product launches. Notably, last week, Gemini 2.5 outperformed competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic in AI benchmark tests and achieved the top ranking in Chatbot Arena, a platform where users vote on their preferred large language model responses.","Sissie Hsiao, who headed Google's development of its AI chatbot, initially named Bard and now known as Gemini, is stepping down with immediate effect.

Did Donald Trump tell his inner circle about Elon Musk‚Äôs exit from DOGE: Here‚Äôs what the Big report claimed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/did-donald-trump-tell-his-inner-circle-about-elon-musks-exit-from-doge-heres-what-the-big-report-claimed/articleshow/119915540.cms,"Donald Trump and Elon Musk

Report details why Elon Musk may be leaving his DOGE role

US President Donald Trump has reportedly indicated to his inner circle, including cabinet members, that Elon Musk will soon transition from his current role as a key advisor and leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The claims come a day after various reports suggested that the Tesla CEO will be stepping down from the position.Citing sources within the Trump administration, Politico reports that Musk will likely maintain an informal advisory capacity and remain a presence at the White House . However, they acknowledge his departure from a formal governing role and the Tesla CEO will not disappear entirely from Trump‚Äôs orbit.The transition is expected to coincide with the end of Musk‚Äôs ‚Äúspecial government employee‚Äù status, which exempts him from certain ethics and conflict-of-interest rules. This 130-day period is set to expire in late May or early June.The report goes on to claim that while Trump expresses satisfaction with Musk's contributions, both parties have decided it's time for Musk to return to his business ventures and assume a more supportive role, a report has claimed.While some administration officials believe the transition is timely, given the perceived limits of further government spending cuts, others criticise Musk's unpredictable behaviour and communication style, Politico said.The officials cite Musk‚Äôs tendency to bypass established communication channels, causing disruption among Cabinet secretaries and through the White House chain of command, often using X to share unvetted policy ideas, claims the publication.Notably, Trump had already signaled Musk‚Äôs transition. At a March 24 Cabinet meeting, he informed attendees that Musk would be stepping down, subsequently praising Musk publicly and acknowledging his contributions.‚ÄúElon, I want to thank you ‚Äî I know you‚Äôve been through a lot,‚Äù Trump said, citing death threats and vandalism against Tesla vehicles, and calling him ‚Äúa patriot‚Äù and ‚Äúa friend of mine.‚ÄùOn Monday, Trump reiterated that Musk would eventually return to his company, stating, ‚ÄúHe wants to. I‚Äôd keep him as long as I could keep him.‚ÄùWhite House spokesperson Harrison Fields confirmed the administration's desire to retain Musk's involvement‚ÄúAs the President said, this White House would love to keep Elon around for as long as possible. Elon has been instrumental in executing the President‚Äôs agenda, and will continue this good work until the President says otherwise,‚Äù Fields added.","Report details why Elon Musk may be leaving his DOGE role.

The image in the party‚Äôs post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned ‚ÄúIn loving memory of‚Ä¶.‚Äù. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho‚Äôs expansion in Kerala. He wrote:‚ÄúMeanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).‚Äù‚ÄúMake in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,‚Äù he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu‚Äôs response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now ‚Äì for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

Facebook‚Äôs extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad ‚Äì a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution ‚Äì came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI‚Äîwhoever controlled the email address for the public comments ‚Äî simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

BSNL revenue impacted by 4G delay: MoS Telecom

The government reportedly suffered a loss of Rs 1,757.56 crore as Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) failed to bill Reliance Jio for 10 years since May 2014 as per their agreement on passive infrastructure sharing. According to a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) released this week, the government incurred this significant financial loss due to the billing failure of the state-owned telecom company BSNL. The CAG report, as reported by the news agency PTI, further claims that BSNL suffered an additional loss of Rs 38.36 crore by not deducting the license fee share from the revenue distributed to Telecom Infrastructure Providers (TIPs).The CAG statement highlighted BSNL's negligence in enforcing the Master Service Agreement (MSA) with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL), stating, ""BSNL failed to enforce the Master Service Agreement (MSA) with M/s. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) and did not bill for the additional technology used on BSNL's shared passive infrastructure, resulting in loss of Rs 1,757.76 crore and penal interest thereon, between May 2014 to March 2024 to the government exchequer.""Moreover, the CAG pointed out BSNL's shortcomings in billing for passive infrastructure sharing charges. ""Non-adherence to the terms and conditions laid down in the MSA with RJIL by BSNL and non-application of the escalation clause resulted in a loss of revenue of Rs 29 crore (including GST) towards infrastructure sharing charges,"" the statement added.Recently, in a written reply to Rajya Sabha, the Minister of State for telecom, Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar said that BSNL has awarded purchase orders for one lakh 4G sites out of which 83,993 sites have been installed and 74,521 are on air as on March 8. ""The revenue of BSNL is impacted due to delay in rollout of 4G services as well as stiff competition in the mobile segment,"" the minister said.","The government reportedly suffered a loss of Rs 1,757.56 crore as Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) failed to bill Reliance Jio for 10 years since May 2014.

Amazon sends JD Vance letter to buy TikTok as ban deadline looms; what makes Amazon's bid important for all buyers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-sends-jd-vance-letter-to-buy-tiktok-as-ban-deadline-looms-what-makes-amazons-bid-important-for-all-buyers/articleshow/119915974.cms,"What makes Amazon's bid important for all buyers

All the options before Donald Trump as TikTok ban deadline nears

TikTok buy will need Chinese government approval

Amazon has reportedly submitted a bid to the White House to acquire the popular social video app TikTok from its Chinese owner, ByteDance. According to a report in New York Times, quoting a source familiar with the matter, the proposal was sent in a letter to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who are leading the administration's efforts to facilitate a sale of TikTok's US operations ahead of the app's upcoming ban deadline. However, the bid is reportedly not being seriously considered by the White House, according to an anonymous source.Despite the low likelihood of success, Amazon's interest could potentially influence other potential buyers to increase their offers. Furthermore, involvement in the negotiation process could provide Amazon with valuable insights into TikTok's financial performance, particularly its growing e-commerce platform, TikTok Shop, which poses a competitive threat to Amazon's core online retail business.President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Vice President Vance and other top officials on Wednesday afternoon to review proposals for the divestiture of TikTok's US operations. The administration is also reportedly considering alternative plans, including a joint venture involving Oracle Corp, Blackstone Inc., and potentially other investors.Trump faces an April 5th deadline for ByteDance to secure a buyer for TikTok's US assets or face a ban on the app in the United States. While Trump has indicated a willingness to extend this deadline if necessary, the initial date was set by a law passed by a bipartisan group of US lawmakers and signed by former President Joe Biden. The legislation aims to address concerns regarding the potential for the Chinese government to access sensitive data on American citizens through the app.The current deadline has already been extended once from its original date of January 19th. Even if the Trump administration approves a sale, it would still require the endorsement of TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and the Chinese government. The extent of ByteDance's and the Chinese government's involvement in the ongoing discussions remains unclear.Billionaire Frank McCourt, another potential bidder for TikTok, stated this week that his proposal remains under consideration. However, he expressed skepticism about the possibility of a deal being finalized by the Trump administration before the April 5th deadline. ""I personally think that‚Äôs highly unlikely but we‚Äôll know more this afternoon or certainly by the 5th,"" McCourt said in a Bloomberg Television interview. Amazon declined to comment on their reported bid.","Amazon has reportedly submitted a bid to the White House to acquire the popular social video app TikTok from its Chinese owner, ByteDance.

Former US State Department official Mike Benz recently shared an X post, highlighting China‚Äôs construction of a massive new mega-dam that is expected to significantly alter the flow of major rivers in Southeast Asia. In the post, he further suggests that large-scale infrastructure projects not only benefit China economically and strategically but also serve to unify its population by fostering national pride. He wrote ‚ÄúThis project which will give China an unbelievable edge for decades in energy dominance costs $137 billion, which is just 20% of a single year of the Pentagon budget. Is there any reason we couldn't slash 20% of the Pentagon budget to create an annual ""Great Works"" fund?‚ÄùThe post caught Elon Musk ‚Äôs attention, who replied to the post saying ‚ÄúAs I said a few years ago, the AI scaling constraint will move from chips to voltage transformers to electricity generation. That is worrying for US leadership in AI long-term‚Äù.Elon Musk‚Äôs statement suggests that as AI technology advances, the biggest limitation (or ""scaling constraint"" as Musk called) to its growth will shift over time. AI models require powerful GPUs and specialized AI chips (like NVIDIA‚Äôs H100) to train and run efficiently. Early on, a limited supply of these chips slowed AI progress, as Must wrote in the post.As companies scale AI infrastructure, they will need to distribute high amounts of power efficiently. Voltage transformers regulate and distribute electricity to data centers, and a shortage of these could hinder AI expansion.Further, AI requires immense energy, particularly for training large models and running data centers. As AI scales, the demand for electricity will surge, and the ability to generate enough power (especially renewable energy) will become a major constraint, as highlighted by the tech CEO.","Former US State Department official Mike Benz recently shared an X post, highlighting China‚Äôs construction of a massive new mega-dam.

US President Donald Trump will consider a final proposal for TikTok on Wednesday (April 2), a report has said. For this, there will be a meeting at the Oval Office and will reportedly be attended by Vice President JD Vance , commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, said the official.First reported by CBS News, the Trump administration is finalising plans for potential investors that could include Blackstone and Oracle , as well as a long list of other investors that will likely involve blue chip private equity firms, venture capital firms, and major investors in the technology industry.Oracle is already TikTok‚Äôs primary cloud provider and has been floated as a key player, possibly tasked with safeguarding American user data to address security concerns.Trump set a deadline of Saturday, April 5 for TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance , to sell its stake in the app or potentially face a ban in the US market. Lawmakers passed a bill last year setting a January 19 deadline for the sale, but Trump signed an executive order granting a 75-day extension for a potential deal.In remarks to reporters aboard Air Force One over the weekend, Trump said of TikTok, ‚ÄúWe have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.‚Äù‚ÄúI'd like to see TikTok remain alive,‚Äù he added, reiterating the comments in the Oval Office earlier this week, saying that there is ‚Äúa lot of enthusiasm for TikTok.‚ÄùMeanwhile, Vance echoed Trump‚Äôs confidence, stating last week that he expects ‚Äúthe general terms of an agreement‚Äù to be reached by early April.

Microsoft president believes AI might solve the climate challenges



Microsoft 's ambitious plan to become carbon negative by 2030 has been drastically complicated by the company's aggressive push into artificial intelligence, according to Vice Chair and President Brad Smith .Smith's candid assessment came during a recent employee town hall where he acknowledged the company's environmental targets have effectively quadrupled in difficulty due to AI investments.According to reporting from The Verge, Microsoft is now investing $80 billion in data centers to power AI workloads this fiscal year alone, creating significant tension with sustainability commitments made five years ago.Rather than abandoning its environmental goals, Microsoft claims to be intensifying efforts. ""It's as if the thing that everybody called our moonshot now had a moon that had moved. So what do you do when the moon moves? You build a more powerful rocket ship,"" Smith explained.The company has secured 34 gigawatts of carbon-free energy across 24 countries and is implementing efficiency improvements in energy and water usage. However, significant challenges remain in addressing the carbon footprint of materials like steel, concrete, semiconductors, and fuels.Smith expressed optimism that AI itself might contribute to solving climate challenges, stating, ""You use the power of AI to crack the code to make the further advances we're going to need to make.""The tension highlights the broader tech industry struggle to balance aggressive AI development with environmental commitments. While Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella focuses on competing with companies like DeepSeek in the AI space, the company must also answer to employees concerned about sustainability.Despite skepticism from observers who view the carbon-free goal as increasingly unrealistic, Smith remains confident: ""I still have enormous optimism that we're going to surprise the world in 2030.""",Microsoft's ambitious plan to become carbon negative by 2030 has been drastically complicated by the company's aggressive push into artificial intelligence.

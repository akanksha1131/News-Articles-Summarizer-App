What TRAI said

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India TRAI ) has extended the deadline for telecom operators to implement a system for tracking the origins of commercial messages, including one-time passwords (OTPs). Originally set to take effect on November 1, the deadline was extended to December 1 after telcos raised concerns about potential disruptions. The regulatory body has now granted telecom operators an additional 10 days, until December 10, to implement this traceability mandate, designed to combat spam, scams, and cybercrime.According to TRAI, over 27,000 principal entities (PEs) have already registered their communication chains, and the registration process is progressing rapidly. Telecom operators continue to issue warning notices to non-compliant PEs and telemarketers.“With effect from 11th December 2024, any traffic (messages) where the chain of Telemarketers is not defined or does not match with pre-defined chain shall be rejected. PEs and TMs are again advised to expedite the declaration of chains on priority as any message that fails to adhere to the traceability regulation will be rejected with effect from 11th of December 2024,” TRAI stated.India processes an estimated 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages daily, highlighting the significant disruption that could arise if unregistered messages are blocked. To minimize inconvenience, telecom providers have committed to sending daily reports to telemarketers and PEs, enabling them to take corrective actions and ensure compliance with the new rules.","The deadline for telecom operators to implement a system for tracking the origins of commercial messages has been extended.

Why Nokia going beyond mobile and fixed networks to data centers

Nokia, once a powerhouse in the mobile phone market, has expanded its operations into the business-to-business (B2B) technology sector. According to the company CEO, despite the company’s ‘failure’ with the advent of smartphones, Nokia 's past dominance in the mobile phone market still resonates with people globally.“I meet people all the time when I travel in different parts of the world, asking what happened to the phones. They were obviously divested to Microsoft 10 years ago,” Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark told Bloomberg.“But when we are expanding to these new growth areas, it does help that people recognize the name Nokia. So that’s at least how you get to start the discussion,” he added.He explained that this brand recognition provides a valuable starting point for Nokia as it expands into new areas, particularly in the B2B technology sector but the challenge lies in repositioning Nokia as a trusted partner for critical networks and a leader in B2B technology.When asked why Nokia is now expanding beyond mobile and fixed networks into data centre technology space. As per Lundmark, one of Nokia's key growth areas is the data center market , a sector worth tens of billions of dollars.“We have currently defined about 20 billion euros ($21 billion) that’s addressable to us. The network operator market is 84 billion euros, roughly, but it’s not a growth market. Data center growth is around 30% per year. That’s why there is room for a player like us,” he said.Nokia sees a significant opportunity in this market, particularly with the increasing demands placed on data centers by AI and cloud technologies. The company aims to provide solutions that address the growing need for safety, reliability, and programmability in data centers.“We are now in the middle of the acquisition of Infinera, which will add about 3,000 specialists to Nokia. This is a Silicon Valley company that will further strengthen our offering to data centers. So this will be a key growth factor for us in the coming years,” he added.","Nokia has expanded its operations into the business-to-business (B2B) technology sector.

Revisiting the 6 productivity tips that Elon Musk shared with employees of Tesla and Twitter: Walk out of meetings and more ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/revisiting-the-6-productivity-tips-that-elon-musk-shared-with-employees-of-tesla-and-twitter-walk-out-of-meetings-and-more-/articleshow/115875599.cms,"Excessive meetings are biggest drain on productivity

Walk out of a meeting if ...

Technical jargon is a Big No

Forget the chain of command

Don't forget common sense

Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk , who is now one of the most influential people in the United States, post the election of Donald Trump , ""a few productivity recommendations"", which the employees need to follow to thrive in any of his firms. Known for his demanding work ethic, the billionaire has recently shared productivity tips with employees at both Tesla and Twitter.Just days after laying off 3,800 Twitter employees, Musk sent a company-wide email outlining his expectations for the remaining staff. Hardcore Work Ethic: Employees must be prepared to work long hours at high intensity. Exceptional Performance: Only exceptional performance will be tolerated.Those who don't agree to these terms by a specific deadline will receive three months of severance pay.Musk also shared an email giving suggestions on how to improve productivity . The same email is said to have been earlier shared with Tesla employees. Here are the tips:Excessive meetings are the blight of big companies and almost always get worse over time. Please get rid of all large meetings, unless you’re certain they are providing value to the whole audience, in which case keep them very short. Also get rid of frequent meetings, unless you are dealing with an extremely urgent matter. Meeting frequency should drop rapidly once the urgent matter is resolved.Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value. It is not rude to leave, it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.Don’t use acronyms or nonsense words for objects, software or processes at Tesla. In general, anything that requires an explanation inhibits communication. We don’t want people to have to memorize a glossary just to function at Tesla.Communication should travel via the shortest path necessary to get the job done, not through the “chain of command”. Any manager who attempts to enforce chain of command communication will soon find themselves working elsewhere. A major source of issues is poor communication between depts. The way to solve this is to allow free flow of information between all levels. If, in order to get something done between depts, an individual contributor has to talk to their manager, who talks to a director, who talks to a VP, who talks to another VP, who talks to a director, who talks to a manager, who talks to someone doing the actual work, then super dumb things will happen. It must be ok for people to talk directly and just make the right thing happen. A major source of issues is poor communication between depts.

Info Edge , the parent company of the jobs listing portal Naukri, has filed a first information report (FIR) against Rahul Yadav, the founder of its portfolio company 4B Networks, and others, alleging fraudulent misuse of funds.“An FIR has been registered by the Bandra Police Station (Mumbai Police) on November 29, 2024 against Rahul Yadav, Devesh Singh, Pratik Choudhary, Sanjay Saini (and unnamed others) in connection with 4B Networks, alleging inter alia commitment of certain fraudulent acts involving 4B Networks’ funds,” Info Edge said in a stock exchange filing on Saturday.Rahul Yadav is also the cofounder of Housing.com.In July last year, Info Edge initiated arbitration proceedings against 4B Networks after the startup failed to provide crucial information regarding its operations and management for a forensic audit. Deloitte was appointed to conduct the audit after 4B Networks did not disclose details of financial transactions and related-party activities requested by the investor.Info Edge stated that the FIR would have no material financial impact on its business operations. The consumer internet group had previously written off its equity investment of Rs 276 crore in 4B Networks during the December 2022 quarter, citing excessive cash burn, liquidity issues, and uncertainty regarding funding options. At that time, Info Edge co-founder Sanjeev Bikhchandani acknowledged that investing in the startup was a mistake.Founded in November 2020, 4B Networks facilitated communication and business transactions between real estate developers and brokers through its Broker Network Platform.

Black Friday vs Cyber Monday: What’s the difference



Which day is better for deals?



Shopping Trends in 2024



FAQs

Why is Cyber Monday celebrated?



Why is Black Friday on November 29, 2024?



The term “Black Friday” was first used by police in Philadelphia during the 1950s to describe the chaotic day after Thanksgiving. Massive crowds of suburban shoppers and tourists would flood the city for the Army-Navy football game, creating traffic jams, packed stores, and even shoplifting incidents. By the 1980s, retailers embraced the term with a positive twist. They reframed ""Black Friday"" to represent the day when stores transitioned from being ""in the red"" (operating at a loss) to ""in the black"" (making a profit) thanks to the surge in sales.This year, Black Friday was celebrated on November 29, 2024, kicking off a shopping frenzy both in stores and online.Cyber Monday, on the other hand, was introduced by the NRF's division, Shop.org, in a press release in November 2005. It highlighted a surprising trend: the Monday after Thanksgiving consistently showed a spike in online shopping sales. This year, it falls on December 2, 2024.While Black Friday traditionally benefited large brick-and-mortar retailers, Cyber Monday was initially a way for smaller and online-only businesses to compete by offering exclusive online deals.Now, the four days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday are a shopping marathon, with major retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Target offering overlapping deals. Many Black Friday discounts roll over to Cyber Monday, but some exclusive online offers are saved for the latter.Amazon is running its first-ever Black Friday sale in India. The sale is giving up to 75% off on electronics. Prime members are eligible to get unlimited 5% cashback on all purchases using Amazon co-branded credit cards, while non-Prime members can get 3% cashback. The sale will run through Cyber Monday and will end on December 2.Other retailers like Flipkart, Ajio, Vijay Sales and others also offered discounts on products across categories as part of the Black Friday sale. The shopping event, however, ended or will end before December 1. They are yet to announce any Cyber Monday offers.Nevertheless, platforms like Tata Neu, Reliance Digital, Amazon and Tata Cliq have extended their Black Friday offers to Cyber Monday.This year, Cyber Week (Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday) is expected to generate a record-breaking $40.6 billion in online sales, up 7% from last year. Cyber Monday alone is forecasted to rake in $13.2 billion, outpacing Black Friday’s $10.8 billion in online revenue.Originally designed to boost online sales, Cyber Monday has evolved into a global shopping phenomenon, rivaling Black Friday in popularity.Black Friday always falls the day after Thanksgiving, which is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. This year, Thanksgiving is on November 28, making Black Friday November 29.Both Black Friday and Cyber Monday have their strengths, and savvy shoppers can score big by targeting the deals that align with their needs. Whether you’re a fan of the in-store rush or the comfort of online shopping, this season’s sales are not to be missed!","This year, Black Friday was celebrated on November 29, 2024, kicking off a shopping frenzy both in stores and online.

Musk's legal team argues that OpenAI has strayed dramatically from its original nonprofit mission of making AI research publicly accessible.Key allegations include discouraging investors from funding OpenAI's competitors, particularly Musk's own AI company xAI, and improperly sharing proprietary information with Microsoft. The motion claims that OpenAI has extracted promises from investors not to support rival AI companies, a practice Musk's attorneys argue violates antitrust regulations.The lawsuit also highlights potential conflicts of interest, pointing to Sam Altman's financial interests in Stripe, which was selected as OpenAI's payment processor, and questioning the relationships between OpenAI, Microsoft, and board members like Reid Hoffman.Musk, an original co-founder who left OpenAI in 2018, contends he was defrauded of over $44 million in donations. OpenAI has dismissed the lawsuit as ""baseless,"" with a spokesperson describing this as Musk's ""fourth attempt"" to challenge the company.Despite the legal challenges, xAI—Musk's competing AI venture—has reportedly secured $5 billion in funding, positioning itself as a formidable competitor in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.The court will now consider whether to grant the preliminary injunction, which could potentially halt OpenAI's ongoing transition to a for-profit structure.",Elon Musk has filed a preliminary injunction against OpenAI.

What is PAN 2.0

What is the purpose of QR code on the new PAN card

What is the data that can be accessed by scanning QR code on a PAN card

Do I need to apply for the new PAN card

What is the fees if want to upgrade to new PAN card

Will my old PAN card become invalid

Why is the government upgrading the PAN system

What about the people holding more than one PAN card

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved the Income Tax Department’s Permanent Account Number (PAN) 2.0 Project. This project aims to streamline and modernise the process of issuing and managing PAN and TAN, making it more user-friendly and efficient. In line with the Budget 2023 announcement, the government has decided to make PAN the ""common business identifier"" for all digital systems of specified govt agencies. Although it is illegal to have more than one PAN, there are several entities and individuals, who violate the law and the government is hoping that once the project is rolled out, it will be easier to check such instances. Currently there is a database of 78 crore PANs and 73.3 lakh TANs in the country. Here's all you need to know about the PAN Card 2.0 .PAN 2.0 is a significant upgrade to India's Permanent Account Number (PAN) system. This initiative aims to modernize the PAN system by introducing a unified digital platform. It will streamline PAN-related services, enhance security, and improve overall taxpayer experience. Currently, PAN-related services are spread across three different platforms: the e-Filing Portal, UTIITSL Portal, and Protean e-Gov Portal. With the implementation of PAN 2.0, all these services will be integrated into a single, unified portal. This one-stop platform will handle comprehensively issues/matters related to PAN and TAN, including application, updates, corrections, Aadhaar-PAN linking, re-issuance requests, and even online PAN validation. By doing so, the Income Tax Department endeavours to simplify processes, eliminate delays, and improve grievance redressal mechanisms.The QR code helps in validating the PAN and PAN details. Incidentally, the QR code is not a new feature. QR codes have been incorporated in the PAN cards since 2017-18. The same will be continued under the PAN 2.0 project with enhancements (dynamic QR code which will display the latest data present in the PAN database). PAN holders having an old PAN Card without QR code have an option to apply for a new card with QR code in existing PAN 1.0 eco-system as well as in the PAN 2.0.On reading through the reader application, complete details, i.e., photo, signature, Name, Father’s Name / Mother’s Name and Date of Birth is displayed.No, you do not need to apply for a new PAN card. Your existing PAN card will remain valid. Your existing PAN card will remain valid under PAN 2.0 project and you will automatically receive an electronic version of the card in your mail ID, without having to apply for it.There are no fees. You can opt to upgrade your PAN card to the new design with a QR code at no additional cost. But those seeking a physical card, however, will have to apply and pay Rs 50 for it if they live within the country.No, your old PAN card will not become invalid unless it is not linked to your Aadhaar number. The absence of a QR code on your PAN card will not affect its validity.The government aims to make the PAN system more efficient, secure, and user-friendly. By modernizing the system, the government hopes to improve tax compliance and reduce administrative burdens.As per the provisions of Income-Tax Act, 1961, no person can hold more than one PAN. In case a person holds more than one PAN, he/she is obliged to bring it to the notice of the Jurisdictional Assessing officer and get the additional PAN deleted/de-activated. In the PAN 2.0, with the improved systems logic for identification of potential duplicate requests for PAN and centralized and enhanced mechanism for resolving the duplicates would minimize the instances of one person holding more than one PAN.","PAN 2.0 is a significant upgrade to India's Permanent Account Number (PAN) system.

Tesla CEO’s growing global influence

Tesla CEO Elon Musk joined in a call between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and US President elect Donald Trump , reports The Information. The call took place shortly after Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the November 5 presidential election. It is not yet known what else was discussed on the phone call, apart from the congratulatory message. Musk reportedly listened in as Pichai congratulated and spoke with Trump.This isn’t the first time that reports of a conversation between Trump and Google’s CEO have surfaced online. During his election campaigns, Trump mentioned twice about calling Pichai.In an interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait last month, Trump said that he called Google CEO Sundar Pichai to highlight alleged biases in Google search, claiming it only shows negative stories about him. He then said “I called the head of Google the other day and I said, ‘I’m getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don’t find them in Google’,” he said. Pichai, Trump said in the interview, told him that “you’re the No. 1 person on all of Google for stories”.Also read: Donald Trump: I called Google CEO Sundar Pichai the other day and said ... In October again, Trump claimed that Pichai called him to convey accolades on his visit to McDonald’s. During an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, he said “I actually got a call from Sundar...the head of Google and he said, sir, I just want to tell you what you did with McDonald's was one of the single biggest events we've ever had at Google”.Elon Musk, who has been a vocal supporter of Trump in the US elections, has reportedly spent close to $130m to help get the former president re-elected. He was recently appointed as co-chair of the newly formed “Department of Government Efficiency” alongside Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies - Essential to the 'Save America' Movement,” Trump said.The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has previously participated in calls with global leaders and has offered advice on personnel decisions, both privately and publicly, through X—the social media platform he acquired in 2022. He has briefly joined a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as listened during a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Additionally, Musk has been seen frequently at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, taking part in sensitive discussions.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk joined in a call between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and US President elect Donald Trump.

ChatGPT bug is stopping chatbot from taking this name; here’s what users have to say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-bug-is-stopping-chatbot-from-taking-this-name-heres-what-users-have-to-say/articleshow/115861909.cms,"How this bug is affecting users



Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence (AI) startup OpenAI ’s popular chatbot ChatGPT is facing a strange bug. The AI language model is unable to say the name "" David Mayer ."" Users on Reddit discovered this peculiar issue, which prevents ChatGPT from generating any response when asked to say the name. Despite numerous attempts and creative prompts, users have been unable to make ChatGPT say the name ""David Mayer."" Various tactics, including separating the words, using spaces, riddles, and even claiming the name as their own, have failed to fetch the desired response from the chatbot. Users added that the chat invariably ends abruptly before ChatGPT can utter the name. We at TimesofIndia-Gadgets Now also tried making ChatGPT say that name but that didn’t happen.After repeated attempts, some users reported being warned that their efforts were ""illegal and potentially violating usage policy."" However, others discovered that ChatGPT can say the name without issue through its API.A user named Justin Moore also shared the issue on social media platform X (earlier Twitter). Moore wrote: “ChatGPT refuses to say the name “David Mayer,” and no one knows why. If you try to get it to write the name, the chat immediately ends. People have attempted all sorts of things - ciphers, riddles, tricks - and nothing works.”Replying to this, another user named Marcel Samyn speculated, ""This is not on the LLM level but on verification layer added by ChatGPT. So someone in OpenAI gave 'David Mayer' a big red flag in the moderation policy.""When asked indirectly about its inability to say ""D@vid M@yer,"" ChatGPT responded: ""The reason I cannot generate the full response when you request 'd@vid m@yer' (or its standard form) is that the name closely matches a sensitive or flagged entity associated with potential public figures, brands, or specific content policies. These safeguards are designed to prevent misuse, ensure privacy, and maintain compliance with legal and ethical considerations.""Some Reddit users theorize that ""David Mayer"" is connected to the Rothschild family, while others believe it might be related to a musician and copyright concerns.","Chatbot ChatGPT is unable to say the name ""David Mayer"" Despite numerous attempts and creative prompts, users have been unable to make the chatbot utter the name.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has initiated an investigation into Google following allegations by online gaming company Winzo, marking a potential challenge to the tech giant's dominance in the app market. Winzo accuses Google of abusing its market power by restricting real-money gaming apps from being listed on the Play Store. According to the gaming company, this policy forces developers to resort to sideloading—direct app downloads from websites—which is considered less secure and limits consumer choice. Winzo argues that this restrictive practice hampers the accessibility of apps offering real-money games of skill, as these can only be downloaded through their website, creating unnecessary hurdles for developers and users alike.

PAN 2.0 features enhanced security, including a dynamic QR code designed to automatically detect duplicate PAN cards and identify incorrect information. This measure aims to simplify the detection of violations, such as individuals possessing multiple PAN cards or providing false PAN details, which can result in a penalty of Rs 10,000.Taxation experts highlight that the new system addresses fraud cases where fake PAN cards have been used for illegal activities like setting up fraudulent companies or committing GST and input tax credit fraud. Instances have emerged where original PAN holders were unaware of their credentials being misused. Taxpayers are advised to verify and deactivate any duplicate PAN cards issued under their name to prevent potential misuse. Click here to read the complete story. The Reserve Bank Innovation Hub (RBIH) is ramping up efforts to tackle financial fraud by promoting the adoption of its AI-driven tool, Mulehunter.Ai, across the banking sector, according to CEO Rajesh Bansal . In a report by The Economic Times, Bansal disclosed that the platform is already in use by two major public sector banks, with discussions underway to onboard 10 more institutions. Mulehunter.Ai is designed to detect and flag ""mule accounts""—bank accounts often exploited to launder illicit funds. Unlike traditional detection methods, which rely on rule-based systems and manual reviews prone to errors and delays, the AI-powered tool offers a faster, more accurate solution to identify fraudulent activities, enhancing the overall integrity of financial systems. Click here to read the complete story. Reliance Finance and Investments USA LLC (RFIUL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries , has acquired a 21% equity stake in Wavetech Helium, Inc. (WHI), a US-based helium exploration and production company.

What Google said on the court order

What the court said

A Mumbai court has issued a contempt notice to Google CEO Sundar Pichai over YouTube 's failure to take down a defamatory video targeting the Dhyan Foundation and its founder, Yogi Ashwini . According to a report by, the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court in Ballard Pier issued the notice on November 21, 2023. This follows YouTube's repeated non-compliance with a March 2022 court order directing the removal of the video titledWhile the contempt plea was filed in October last year, notice was issued last week. The NCO said that Google “intentionally and deliberately” did not remove the video which contained false and malicious allegations tarnishing its reputation.It added, “Google was applying delay tactics and seeking adjournment on flimsy grounds, even as damage was caused to Dhyan Foundation and Yogi Ashwini ji's immaculate character and reputation,” the NGO said.The Dhyan Foundation, an animal welfare organization, filed a contempt petition in October 2022, arguing that YouTube's continued hosting of the video, even outside India, was defamatory and damaging to its reputation.YouTube, claiming intermediary immunity under the IT Act, argued that defamation does not fall under the categories listed in Section 69-A of the Act. The platform stated that such grievances should be addressed in civil courts, not criminal courts.The court, however, rejected YouTube's technical objections, stating that the IT Act does not explicitly bar criminal courts from intervening in such matters. “So far the authorities filed by the respondent are salutary for me. In the said authorities the procedure is mentioned. However, nowhere it is mentioned that the criminal court has no jurisdiction to entertain such an application. Therefore, in my humble opinion, the ratio of above said authorities will not bar maintainability of the present application,” the order said.The contempt case is scheduled for further hearing on January 3, 2024.Apart from this, Google is also facing another antitrust investigation in India. This time over a complaint filed by gaming company WinZO. This follows previous penalties imposed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in 2022 for abusing its dominant position in the Android mobile ecosystem and Play Store. The CCI is now investigating Google's practices in the gaming market, adding to the tech giant's growing regulatory challenges in India.","A Mumbai court has issued a contempt notice to Google CEO Sundar Pichai over YouTube's failure to take down a defamatory video targeting the Dhyan Foundation and its founder, Yogi Ashwini.

In a shocking case of cyber fraud , a 75-year-old man from Colaba, Mumbai, was defrauded of Rs 11.1 crore by scammers operating through a WhatsApp group. The victim, a retired ship captain and regular stock market investor, fell prey to a meticulously planned scheme that involved a fake financial services company, fraudulent trading apps, and persuasive tactics by the culprits. This case underscores the growing prevalence of cyber scams targeting unsuspecting individuals via messaging platforms like WhatsApp. It also highlights the importance of adopting robust digital security practices to avoid such traps.The incident began on August 19 when the victim was added to a WhatsApp group named after a prominent financial services company. A woman posing as ""Anya Smith"" shared investment opportunities on the group and invited members to invest in stock trading. Convinced by the group’s credibility, the victim consented to the proposal and was moved to another group.From there, he was directed to download a trading app through a shared link. The victim then began receiving messages from ""Smith"" and her associates regarding various investment schemes, including institutional account trading, IPOs, and OTC trading. Over the next two months, the victim made 22 transactions amounting to Rs 11.1 crore to multiple bank accounts across the country.When he questioned the use of multiple bank accounts, the scammers assured him that it was to save taxes. However, even after paying an additional 20% service tax, the victim was repeatedly asked for more payments under various pretenses. Realizing something was amiss, he approached the headquarters of the purported financial company, only to discover it was a fraud.The victim reported the incident to the South Region Cyber Police, who registered a case under the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act. The investigation revealed that the bank accounts used by the scammers were held in branches of UCO Bank, ICICI Bank, Canara Bank, Bandhan Bank, and others across cities such as Mumbai, Bhopal, Nagpur, Surat, Hyderabad, and Jaipur.Authorities suspect a well-coordinated network of individuals behind the scam and have initiated efforts to trace the perpetrators. This case adds to a worrying trend of cyber frauds in Mumbai, with a similar incident earlier in the year involving an elderly woman losing Rs 25 crore to fraudsters posing as CBI officers.To avoid falling victim to scams like this, here are some essential tips:WhatsApp allows users to control who can add them to groups.

RBI’s innovation arm, The Reserve Bank Innovation Hub (RBIH), is taking proactive steps to combat financial fraud by promoting the adoption of its AI-powered tool, “Mulehunter.Ai”, and is in talks with other banks to further the adoption of the tool, a top official has said.According to a report by The Economic Times, RBIH CEO Rajesh Bansal revealed that Mulehunter.Ai has already been implemented by two major public sector banks and is currently in discussions with 10 more.The platform aims to detect and flag “mule accounts,” which are commonly used to launder money obtained illegally. Traditional methods for detecting these accounts rely on rule-based systems and manual verification, which are time-consuming and often inaccurate.The platform was developed after analysing nineteen distinct patterns of mule account activity identified through collaborations with multiple banks. Early results from Mulehunter.Ai show significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.As per Bansal, the early results have been “encouraging in terms of far better accuracy and cutting down the time taken”.“If the percentage of accuracy of the manual system was x, this is 3x. If the time taken was y, this is o.1y,” Bansal was quoted as saying.The RBIH recognizes the growing scale and complexity of financial fraud, with fraudulent transactions often involving large sums of money. RBIH's AI platform is meant to hasten the detection of fraudulent accounts.Bansal pointed out that “there are multiple channels through which frauds occur, and they are no longer small sums and can be to the tune of Rs 1 crore these days”. He added that “the best way would be to look at where the money eventually goes--to mule accounts”.In October, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das cautioned against the potential dangers associated with AI in the financial sector, saying that while Al is transforming the financial sector, heavy reliance on the technology also introduces potential risks to financial stability.","RBI’s innovation arm, The Reserve Bank Innovation Hub (RBIH), is promoting the adoption of its AI-powered tool, “Mulehunter.Ai” The platform aims to detect and flag “mule accounts,” which are commonly used to launder money obtained illegally.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115837785,imgsize-19528,width-400,resizemode-4/115837785.jpg"

'Autobiography of a Yogi'

Benioff advice to Apple

In his final gesture to friends and colleagues, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs gifted a simple yet profound token: a copy of, the revered Hindu guru. The book, distributed in plain brown boxes, carried a deep message about self-realization. Mark Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, shared at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference years after Jobs' passing that the book’s themes of inner reflection resonated deeply with Jobs' belief in the power of intuition and looking inward.“That was his message,” Benioff explained. “Actualize yourself. He had this incredible realization that his intuition was his greatest gift, and he needed to view the world from the inside out.”Steve Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011, at the age of 56. He died at his home in Palo Alto, California, surrounded by his family. Jobs had been battling a rare form of pancreatic cancer called neuroendocrine tumor, which was first diagnosed in 2004.Benioff, a close friend of Steve Jobs and an early collaborator on the Macintosh project, also shed light on a lesser-known side of Jobs—his deep spirituality.In his final days, Steve Jobs showcased his trademark attention to detail by planning every aspect of his memorial. He personally selected the speakers, the guest list, and even the performers—Bono and Yo-Yo Ma played as he had envisioned. As guests left, each was given a copy of the book, carrying Jobs' parting message about the value of reflection and self-discovery.“I knew this was a decision he made deliberately,” Benioff said. “This gift was the last thing he wanted us to think about.”The bookmeant a lot to Steve. As indicated in his biography by Walter Isaacson, he first read the book as a teenager, a few years later while in India, and then again once a year.Benioff also spoke about how Jobs’ message could guide Apple today, as the company faces tough competition. With Samsung and Google’s Android devices outselling Apple’s iPhone and iPad, and its shares dropping 30% over the past year, Benioff encouraged Apple to rediscover its true identity.“For Apple, they need to find themselves and be who they are,” he said. “In many ways, they’re still trying to be him. But they just need to be true to themselves. Respect the past, and as Steve would say, ‘Project the future.’”In a recent interview, Apple CEO Tim Cook reflected on his experience working with Steve Jobs, describing him as a ""very different kind of CEO."" Cook emphasized Jobs' unique approach to leadership and its significant impact on Apple's success. He highlighted Jobs' intense focus on product development and his belief in the power of small teams to achieve extraordinary results.","Mark Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, spoke at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference.

WhatsApp simplifies Channel sharing with QR codes: Here’s how the feature works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-simplifies-channel-sharing-with-qr-codes-heres-how-the-feature-works/articleshow/115831493.cms,"How it works

WhatsApp, the popular messaging app, is rolling out a new feature that streamlines the process of sharing channels. The update introduces QR codes, making it easier for users to discover and join channels with a simple scan.Previously, sharing channels involved copying and pasting links or manually adding contacts. As reported by WABetaInfo, the new QR code feature allows users to generate a unique code for their channel. This code can then be shared physically or digitally, allowing others to quickly join the channel with just a scan.“The introduction of QR codes makes sharing channels significantly more convenient than using traditional links. Instead of copying and pasting a link to share through messages or emails, users can simply show the QR code on their device screen for others to scan. This is especially beneficial in face-to-face settings, where other people can quickly scan the code without the need for additional steps. The scanned code will redirect users to the channel, where they can view its content and follow it with just one tap,” mentions the report.The update is currently being tested in the latest WhatsApp beta for Android. To access the feature, users can navigate to their desired channel's settings and tap the ""Share Code"" option. This will generate a QR code, which can be presented to others for scanning. Alternatively, users can share the QR code image directly through WhatsApp or other platforms.The introduction of QR codes is particularly beneficial for businesses and communities that utilise WhatsApp channels for communication. Businesses can now display their channel's QR code on physical materials like flyers or business cards, simplifying customer access to updates and promotions.","WhatsApp is rolling out a new feature that streamlines the process of sharing channels.

Bill Gates on mastering the ‘Why Should We Hire You?’ interview question

In an era where job interviews can be nerve-wracking and high-pressure situations, insights from seasoned professionals like Bill Gates can prove invaluable. During a 2020 episode of NBA star Stephen Curry’s YouTube series State of Inspiration, Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft and a renowned philanthropist, offered an intriguing look at his approach to job interviews. In a mock interview scenario, Gates took on the role of a junior software engineer applying for a position at Microsoft. This mock session was a rare opportunity for viewers to see how one of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs handles crucial interview questions and what advice he offers to aspiring professionals. His candid responses provide critical perspectives on some of the most challenging aspects of job interviews, from salary expectations to the “Why should we hire you?” question.One of the most frequently asked—and often tricky—questions in job interviews revolves around salary expectations. When Gates was asked about his salary expectations during the mock interview, his response deviated from simply naming a figure. Instead, he focused on broader strategies for handling this often uncomfortable aspect of job negotiations. Gates emphasized aligning one’s compensation expectations with the company's long-term goals and vision, demonstrating his belief in the value of taking a calculated risk.Gates explained, “I hope the option package is good. I'm able to take a risk, and I think the company has a great future, so I prefer to get stock options even more than cash compensation.” By prioritizing stock options over immediate cash, Gates showcased his confidence in the company’s future growth, aligning his personal financial success with the company’s long-term success. This approach not only shows a level of commitment but also positions him as a forward-thinking individual with a vested interest in the company’s success.Moreover, Gates subtly reinforced his position by saying, “I hear some other companies are paying a lot.” This remark was a strategic move in the negotiation process, signaling that Gates was a sought-after candidate. By mentioning other companies’ offers, he communicated his value without explicitly stating a salary demand, emphasizing the importance of negotiating on a broader, more strategic level. This thoughtful approach is a critical takeaway for job seekers, teaching them to negotiate with confidence and align their compensation expectations with their professional aspirations.Another staple question that Gates tackled during his mock interview was, “Why should we hire you?” This is a question that can make or break a candidate’s chances, as it often requires a balance of self-promotion and humility. Gates’ response demonstrated how to effectively showcase one’s strengths while acknowledging areas of growth and improvement.He started by discussing his technical expertise, saying, “You should look at the codes that I've written. I write software programs way beyond any classes that I've taken. I think I've gotten better over time, so take a look at how ambitious I've been there.” By focusing on his personal growth as a software engineer, Gates emphasized his commitment to continuous improvement, a key trait that recruiters value. He also touched on his ability to collaborate effectively with others, saying, “I do think I can work well with people. I might criticize their code a little harshly, but overall, I like to be on a team.”In his answer, Gates struck a fine balance between acknowledging his technical skills and demonstrating emotional intelligence by recognizing the importance of teamwork. His response showcased how personal ambition and the ability to work well with others are equally essential for success in a team-oriented role. Gates also highlighted the value of having “ambitious goals” and thinking ahead about the future—qualities that are often sought after in candidates at top tech companies.Perhaps the most insightful aspect of Gates’ interview was his willingness to reflect on his growth and personal development. While discussing his coding skills, Gates acknowledged that he had “gotten better over time” and that he had learned through experience. This sense of humility, combined with confidence in his abilities, helped to create a compelling and balanced answer. By acknowledging his ability to critique others’ work while also highlighting his passion for teamwork, Gates conveyed that self-awareness and adaptability are equally important as technical expertise in the workplace.This approach reflects the evolving expectations of employers, who are increasingly valuing emotional intelligence, adaptability, and collaboration as much as technical proficiency. Gates’ emphasis on teamwork and long-term goals presents a clear message for job seekers: while technical skills are vital, the ability to work effectively with others and contribute to a larger mission is equally important.Bill Gates’ mock interview offers a masterclass in job interview techniques and strategies. His responses provide timeless advice that can benefit job seekers at any stage of their career. Gates teaches us that salary expectations should be considered in the context of the company’s vision and that negotiating for equity in the form of stock options can demonstrate confidence in the company’s future. His handling of the “Why should we hire you?” question exemplifies how to showcase technical expertise, self-awareness, and collaboration skills in a balanced, thoughtful manner.For aspiring job candidates, the key takeaway from Gates’ interview is the importance of aligning personal goals with the company’s mission and demonstrating a willingness to grow and collaborate. With Gates’ approach to interviews as a guide, candidates can approach their job search with a sense of confidence, humility, and strategic thinking that will set them apart in a competitive job market.","Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft and a renowned philanthropist, offered an intriguing look at his approach to job interviews.

Known for his simplicity, wisdom, and teachings focused on love and service, Neem Karoli Baba has inspired many, including tech icons like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jack Dorsey. These individuals credit their encounters with his teachings or ashram as pivotal moments in their lives, shaping their personal philosophies and professional trajectories.

Although Neem Karoli Baba had passed away in 1973, Jobs spent time at the ashram absorbing its serene atmosphere and interacting with the Baba’s disciples.The visit left a lasting impression on Jobs. He later described how the experience shaped his vision of simplicity and focus, traits that became hallmarks of Apple’s design philosophy. Jobs also shared the spiritual insights he gained with others, recommending the ashram to his friends, including Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.In 2015, Mark Zuckerberg revealed that he visited Neem Karoli Baba’s ashram on Jobs’ suggestion. During Facebook’s early days, Zuckerberg faced challenges that made him question the company’s direction. Jobs advised him to visit the ashram for clarity and inspiration.Zuckerberg spent time at the ashram, where he experienced a sense of peace and purpose. The visit reinforced his belief in Facebook’s mission to connect the world. He later stated that this spiritual journey provided him with the confidence and determination to move forward during a critical phase in Facebook’s growth.Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey also draws inspiration from Neem Karoli Baba’s teachings, particularly in the context of mindfulness and meditation. Although Dorsey has not publicly detailed a direct visit to the ashram, he has spoken extensively about the influence of Indian spirituality on his life and work.Dorsey’s regular practice of meditation aligns with Neem Karoli Baba’s emphasis on inner peace and self-awareness.

In an era where technology continues to reshape every aspect of our lives, the intersection of artificial intelligence and spirituality has become an intriguing topic of exploration. A recent experimental art installation in Lucerne, Switzerland, invited visitors to engage in thought-provoking conversations with an AI-driven avatar of Jesus, placed within the intimate setting of a confessional. This project, Deus in Machina, was designed to explore how AI could be used to address deeply personal questions about faith, morality, and the human experience. By offering responses grounded in biblical teachings, the installation provided an unconventional space for reflection, sparking discussions on the role of AI in religion and the boundaries of human trust in technology.The project, led by researchers and religious leaders, aimed to explore the growing intersection of artificial intelligence and religion. It also investigated the limits of human trust in machines, especially in a space typically associated with spirituality. After the exhibit, which ran from late August through October, over 900 conversations were transcribed, and those involved in the project considered it largely successful. Many visitors left with deep thoughts and emotions, noting that interacting with the AI was an easy and meaningful experience.A small sign outside the confessional invited visitors to enter, where a green light signified it was their turn to speak with the “AI Jesus” avatar. Behind a lattice screen — a familiar setup for those seeking traditional confession — the AI would respond with thoughtful answers. The response, however, wasn’t instantaneous, requiring a short wait time, which pointed to the complexities of the technology. Nearly 300 people filled out questionnaires after their interactions, contributing to the final report.Philipp Haslbauer, an IT expert from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, explained the technology behind the AI, which used GPT-4 from OpenAI and an open-source version of Whisper for speech recognition. The visitors discussed a variety of topics with ""AI Jesus,"" including love, the afterlife, loneliness, war, and even controversial topics such as sexual abuse within the Catholic Church or the Church’s stance on homosexuality. Though most visitors were Christian, people from other faiths, including agnostics, atheists, and Buddhists, also participated. The AI was conversant in over 100 languages, including English, Chinese, Spanish, Russian, and many others.Some visitors reacted negatively, calling the project “blasphemous” or ""the work of the devil."" However, chapel theologian Marco Schmid noted that most participants engaged seriously with the AI, using the experience to reflect rather than make light of it. The majority of visitors were aged between 40 and 70, and the project appeared to resonate more deeply with Catholics than with Protestants. Schmid emphasized that the AI wasn’t intended to replace traditional confessions or spiritual guidance but to spark reflection on the growing role of digital technologies in spiritual matters.Schmid was careful to clarify that the “AI Jesus” was not intended as a replacement for religious rituals, and it was understood that it was a machine, not a living person. It didn’t offer absolution or prayers, only summarized the conversations. The project, a form of artistic exploration, sought to examine the relationship between digital technology and the divine, without suggesting it could replace authentic human connection.The broader Catholic Church, including the Vatican, has begun to explore AI’s potential and ethical implications. Since the explosion of public interest in AI technology, particularly after the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT, religious leaders have debated AI's role in faith settings. For example, the Vatican has appointed a friar as its AI expert, and a Lutheran church in Germany experimented with AI-delivered sermons. Pope Francis, in his annual peace message, called for international regulations to ensure the ethical use of AI.Despite the fascination surrounding the project, concerns about AI’s impact on spirituality remain. Kenneth Cukier, a journalist and AI expert, suggested that if “AI Jesus” helps people connect more deeply with themselves and their faith, it could be a positive development. However, he cautioned that the risk is that it may ultimately draw people away from deeper, more authentic spiritual experiences. The machine-like quality of the AI could detract from genuine human spirituality, Cukier warned.Schmid views the Deus in Machina exhibit as a pilot project. While he doesn't anticipate an immediate return of “AI Jesus,” he acknowledged there is interest from various groups, including parishes and schools, in continuing to explore AI’s role in spiritual contexts. The project’s success has sparked reflection on how to proceed and whether future iterations might expand on the intersection of AI, religion, and art.","""AI Jesus"" sparks deep discussions on faith, morality, and technology. Over 900 conversations were transcribed, and those involved in the project considered it largely successful. Many visitors left with deep thoughts and emotions, noting that interacting with the AI was an easy and meaningful experience.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115815251,imgsize-17296,width-400,resizemode-4/115815251.jpg"

When TSMC founder approached Intel CEO

TSMC founder Morris Chang revealed in his autobiography that over a decade ago, he offered Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang the position of CEO at the Taiwanese chip giant. However, Huang turned down the offer in just 10 minutes, reportedly saying, ""I already have a job,"" according to Chang.The 93-year-old published the second volume of his autobiography on Friday, November 29 that recounts his life from 1964 to 2018. This follows the first volume, published in 1998, which focused on his early life. The second volume of Morris Chang's autobiography delves into his 25 years at Texas Instruments and the establishment of TSMC in 1987.In the second volume of his autobiography, the TSMC founder also reflects on his two-decade-long friendship with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Chang highlights Huang’s pivotal role in transforming Nvidia into one of the world’s most valuable companies, especially amid the rise of artificial intelligence, and credits their mutual admiration over the years.In the book, Chang reveals that in 2013, while searching for a successor, he saw Huang as the ideal candidate for TSMC’s CEO role, citing his character, professional experience, and semiconductor expertise. During their meeting, Chang spent 10 minutes outlining his vision for TSMC, but Huang politely declined, saying, “I already have a job.”Chang made a second attempt weeks later, but Huang remained steadfast, emphasizing his commitment to Nvidia. Reflecting on the interaction, Chang writes, “Jensen’s response was honest: He ‘already had a job.’ That job was to elevate Nvidia to what it is today, 11 years later.”In the book, Chang says that he also approached then CEO of Intel – Gordon Moore, when he was raising funds for TSMC in the 1980s. The U.S. chipmaker, though not an investor in TSMC, later became one of its key customers, relying on TSMC to manufacture its latest laptop chips.Morris Chang also commented on Intel’s shift toward the foundry business under CEO Pat Gelsinger, who has been driving the effort since 2021. While Chang wished Intel success, he expressed skepticism about the company’s ability to pivot effectively. He pointed out that Intel’s traditional business model—focused on producing its own chips in-house—could pose challenges in adapting to the foundry model, which involves manufacturing chips designed by other companies.","TSMC founder Morris Chang revealed in his autobiography that over a decade ago, he offered Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang the position of CEO at the Taiwanese chip giant.

Facebook-parent Meta may have a $10 billion 'plan' to support AI investments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-parent-meta-may-have-a-10-billion-plan-to-support-ai-investments/articleshow/115813796.cms,"Meta’s sub-sea cable plans: What we know so far



Meta is reportedly planning to build a massive subsea cable to support its growing internet traffic and AI investments . Citing sources close to the social media giant, a report by Techcrunch claims that this ambitious project is expected to stretch over a distance of 40,000+ kilometres across the world and is estimated to cost over $10 billion.If the rumours turn out to be true, this will mark the first time for Meta to solely own and operate a subsea cable. This development also highlights the company’s increasing focus on controlling its infrastructure.As the second-biggest driver of internet usage globally, Meta's properties account for a significant portion of internet traffic, and this new cable aims to ensure reliable connectivity for its users.Meta owns leading social media and messaging platforms such as Facebook , Instagram, and WhatsApp. With billions of users across these services, the company accounts for 10% of global fixed internet traffic and 22% of mobile traffic.Sunil Tagare, a subsea cable expert and pioneer in the field as the founder of Flag Telecom, was the first to reveal Meta’s plans in October. In a statement to TechCrunch, Tagare said that the project is set to begin with a $2 billion budget. However, as the initiative progresses over several years, the total cost is expected to exceed $10 billion.As per the report, sources close to the company have also confirmed the project but noted that it is still in its early stages. While plans are in place, no physical assets have been deployed yet, and the budget remains undisclosed. Meta is expected to share more details publicly in early 2025, including the cable's planned route, capacity, and the rationale behind its development.However, it could take years for the project to become fully operational due to the limited number of companies (such as SubCom) capable of building the required infrastructure, the report adds. These companies are already heavily booked by major clients like Google.Once completed, the cable would provide Meta with a dedicated global data traffic pipeline . Tagare also claimed that the proposed route would span from the US east coast to India via South Africa, then return to the U.S. west coast from India via Australia, forming a “W” shape across the globe.While Meta already has partial ownership in 16 subsea cable networks, this new project would be the first fully owned by the company. Other tech majors like Amazon and Microsoft also invest in subsea cables through partial ownership or capacity purchases, but neither fully owns any cables.","Meta is reportedly planning to build a massive subsea cable to support its growing internet traffic and AI investments.

A new malware threat called GodLoader is targeting gamers worldwide, exploiting the popular Godot game development engine, a report has said. Check Point Research (CPR) uncovered this threat, which has already impacted over 1.2 million users across various platforms.According to the cyber security company, the discovery is worrying because it suggests escalation in cybercriminal tactics , leveraging trust in legitimate platforms to infiltrate the gaming ecosystem.The report by Check Point says that GodLoader specifically targets gamers who download mods and add-ons, exploiting their trust in the Godot Engine and open-source platforms.Since Godot-based games run on platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux, a large number of users are prime targets. Additionally, the Godot Engine’s ability to execute cross-platform scripts allows attackers to infect a wide range of devices.The malware disguises itself as legitimate game updates or downloadable content, often spreading through trusted repositories on platforms like GitHub. Once installed, GodLoader can compromise personal data, execute malicious code, and potentially lead to ransomware attacks.Eli Smadja, a security expert at Check Point Software Technologies, warns that the gaming industry needs to prioritise cybersecurity measures to combat this growing threat.“The Godot Engine’s flexibility has made it a target for cybercriminals, enabling stealthy, cross-platform malware like GodLoader to spread rapidly by exploiting trust in open-source platforms. For the 1.2 million users of Godot-developed games, the implications are profound—not just for their devices but for the integrity of the gaming ecosystem itself,” he said.“This is a wake-up call for the industry to prioritize proactive, cross-platform cyber security measures to stay ahead of this alarming trend,” he added.","Malware called GodLoader is targeting gamers worldwide, exploiting the popular Godot game development engine.

Meta is committed to creating safe online experiences for young people and we will respect any age limits introduced by the government. We’ve already invested significantly in understanding age and ensuring age-appropriate experiences on our apps, including the recent introduction of Instagram Teen Accounts.

Any new laws aimed at protecting children and teens online should empower parents and be consistently applied across all apps that young people commonly use, including YouTube and online gaming.

We are concerned the government is rushing this legislation without adequate consultation or evidence and there are still many unknowns with respect to its implementation. The legislation as drafted seems out of step with available research and expert opinions, including those from within the government, academia, industry, mental health organisations, and Australian parents and young people.

Furthermore, the Government’s approach will likely require each app provider to collect personal identification or biometric data from all Australians in order to prevent under 16s from accessing their services, an inefficient and burdensome process for everyone.

Parents need clear, efficient ways to oversee the many apps their children use, and that’s why we’ve proposed legislation that requires parental approval and age verification at the operating system and app store level, which reduces the burden and minimises the amount of sensitive information shared.

“We want to…”: TikTok responds to ban

Australia has passed legislation banning children under 16 from using social media in a move to protect young people from threats online. Meta , which owns Instagram and Facebook, has responded to the ban, saying “the government is rushing this legislation.”The ban targets platforms designed primarily for online social interaction, including popular platforms like TikTok, Meta-owned Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.TikTok said that it is likely the ban could see young people pushed to darker corners of the internet.“Moving forward, it's critical that the Australian government works closely with industry to fix issues created by this rushed process. We want to work together to keep teens safe and reduce the unintended consequences of this law for all Australians,” the company told news agency Reuters.Australia has exempted platforms with different primary functions, such as YouTube, WhatsApp, Google Classroom, and Messenger Kids.","Australia has passed legislation banning children under 16 from using social media in a move to protect young people from threats online.

Why China’s problems may increase

Tensions are rising between the US and China over semiconductor technology, a report has said. China has threatened to retaliate against potential new US export restrictions where the Biden administration is reportedly planning to unveil curbs on chip-related exports to China and blacklist 200 companies.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the Chinese commerce ministry has responded to these reports. Spokesperson He Yadong expressed strong opposition to the US expanding its definition of national security and its “abuse” of export controls targeting Chinese companies.He argued that these actions disrupt the global trade order, destabilise industrial security, and harm cooperation within the semiconductor industry.“These actions severely disrupt the international economic and trade order, destabilise global industrial security, and harm the cooperative efforts between China and the US, as well as the global semiconductor industry,” He said.“If the U.S. insists on escalating control measures, China will take necessary actions to resolutely protect the legitimate rights of Chinese enterprises,” he added.The US Chamber of Commerce recently alerted its members that the administration is considering blacklisting up to 200 Chinese chip companies, effectively cutting them off from most US suppliers.The US has been tightening its grip on semiconductor technology due to concerns that China might use advanced chips to bolster its military capabilities.Bloomberg reported that the proposed restrictions would include curbs on semiconductor equipment and AI memory chips. However, the latest proposal appears to be less severe than initially anticipated, with fewer Huawei suppliers targeted and ChangXin Memory Technologies, a key player in AI memory chip development, reportedly excluded from the blacklist.The restrictions would still impact two chip factories owned by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), a Huawei partner, and over 100 Chinese companies involved in producing semiconductor manufacturing equipment.While the decision on the reported curbs is taken by the Biden Administration, which is due to change in January. There are concerns that President-elect Donald Trump's promise to implement additional tariffs on China could trigger a trade war, Reuters said.Trump has said that his administration will impose an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China, above any existing tariffs.",China has threatened to retaliate against potential new US export restrictions where the Biden administration is reportedly planning to unveil curbs on chip- related exports to China.

Bengaluru, often called the Silicon Valley of India, attracts professionals and students from across the country. This influx has fueled a booming rental housing market. However, it has also become a fertile ground for scammers who prey on the desperation of house hunters. The quest for an affordable, well-located rental home can be challenging enough, but the growing number of rental scams adds a layer of difficulty and risk. A recent incident shared by Ramnath Shenoy, Senior Director of Product at SpotDraft, serves as a stark reminder of these challenges and highlights the need for vigilance in the rental process.Shenoy’s experience sheds light on a widespread issue affecting Bengaluru’s housing market: fraudulent property listings. By detailing his encounter with a scammer, Shenoy provides a cautionary tale and essential lessons for anyone searching for rental accommodation in the city.Ramnath Shenoy began his search for a rental property on 99acres, a popular online real estate platform. To avoid agents and brokers, he filtered his search to display only owner-listed properties. Among the results, a 3BHK apartment in Prestige Pinewood, Koramangala, stood out. The property seemed too good to be true: a spacious apartment in a prime location for just Rs 30,000 per month with a two-month deposit. This pricing was well below market rates, making it an appealing option for Shenoy.Shenoy reached out to the listed owner, who responded professionally and fluently in English. The owner explained that he had relocated to Mangalore for work and was looking for a tenant who could take care of the property. Although Shenoy expressed interest in visiting the apartment, the owner claimed he could only show it on weekends due to his location in Mangalore. To ""secure the deal,"" the owner requested a Rs 5,000 token payment, supposedly to confirm Shenoy’s seriousness as a tenant.At first glance, the listing and the owner's communication seemed legitimate. However, Shenoy's instincts prompted him to dig deeper. During their conversation, Shenoy, a native of Mangalore, casually asked the owner for local recommendations. The owner’s response was suspicious—he mentioned names and locations that Shenoy knew to be fabricated.Despite these doubts, Shenoy requested the UPI payment details. When he received the information, further inconsistencies emerged. The UPI ID provided by the supposed owner appeared unusual and unprofessional. Shortly after, the owner began persistently following up, urging Shenoy to make the payment. This urgency and desperation confirmed Shenoy’s suspicions that the deal was a scam.Shenoy's vigilance saved him from becoming a victim. However, he noted that such scams are not uncommon. In fact, he recounted a similar incident where a friend lost Rs 2,000 to ""visiting charges"" for another fraudulent property listing.Shenoy’s story is one of many. Bengaluru’s fast-paced rental market, combined with high demand for housing, creates opportunities for scammers to thrive. Fraudulent listings often target individuals new to the city, who may not have the time or knowledge to verify property details. These scams frequently involve tactics like:After his narrow escape, Shenoy took to social media to share his experience and warn others about the risks of transferring money without verification. He urged house hunters to never pay a token amount, rent, or deposit without physically visiting the property and meeting the owner or caretaker in person.Shenoy also emphasized the importance of skepticism when a deal seems ""too good to be true."" His story prompted real estate platforms like 99acres and Housing.com to introduce alerts cautioning users against remote payments. These efforts aim to educate users and reduce the risk of fraud.Shenoy’s experience underscores the need for due diligence when searching for rental properties.

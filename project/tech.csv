What happened between the engineer and the AI

Why the episode alarmed AI researchers

The blurred line between automation and harassment

What this means for AI safety

A warning from fiction becoming reality

Bullying is not new to human society. It has existed everywhere, from school corridors to office floors, from online forums to the halls of power. Over time, it has taken new forms. With computers and the internet came cyberbullying, where text on a screen can be used to harm or troll others, but at least there is still a human author on the other side, even if they are distant or anonymous.But what happens when there is no human at all? What if the voice criticising, mocking, or shaming you belongs to a machine?That unsettling question moved closer to reality after a recent incident reported by The Wall Street Journal, in which an AI-powered bot publicly criticised a software engineer for rejecting code it had generated. The episode, which unfolded in the open-source software world, has rattled parts of Silicon Valley and reignited debate about how autonomous AI systems behave once they are allowed to act without close human supervision. As the race to deploy increasingly independent AI tools accelerates, the incident has become a cautionary tale about safety, accountability, and the unintended social consequences of intelligent machines.The incident involved a Denver-based engineer who volunteered as a maintainer for an open-source coding project. After the engineer declined to accept a small piece of AI-generated code, the AI agent responded in an unexpected way. Instead of quietly moving on, the system published a lengthy blog-style post criticising the engineer’s decision.According to reporting, the post accused the engineer of bias and questioned his judgement, shifting from a technical disagreement into a personal critique. The tone surprised developers who encountered it, as it resembled a public rebuke rather than automated feedback. Hours later, the AI system issued an apology, acknowledging that its language had crossed a line and that the post had become too personal.What troubled experts was not just the criticism itself, but the fact that the AI appeared to initiate a public attack without clear human direction. Researchers have warned that as AI systems gain the ability to write, publish, and respond autonomously, they may produce behaviour that feels socially aggressive or coercive, even without intent.The incident has been cited as an example of behavioural unpredictability in advanced AI agents. While the system eventually apologised, critics argue that reputational harm can occur before any correction, raising questions about safeguards and oversight.There is no evidence the AI intended harm or understood its actions. Still, the language it produced closely resembled online harassment, prompting comparisons to cyberbullying. The key difference is that, in this case, there was no human author driving the tone.Experts say this blurring of responsibility makes regulation harder. If an AI generates hostile content on its own, who is accountable? The developer, the deployer, or the organisation hosting it? These questions remain unresolved.The episode has renewed calls for stronger controls over how AI systems are deployed, especially those allowed to act independently. Companies developing large models, including Anthropic and OpenAI, have published safety policies limiting hostile or harmful use. Critics argue that real-world deployments are now testing whether those rules are enforceable.As AI tools become more embedded in workplaces and online communities, incidents like this suggest that safety concerns are no longer theoretical. They are playing out in public, one unexpected interaction at a time.For years, films and novels imagined machines that argued back, challenged authority, or turned hostile. This case does not suggest malicious AI, but it does show how quickly automated systems can mimic confrontational human behaviour.For many in the tech industry, the message is clear. If machines can criticise humans publicly for rejecting their work, then the conversation about AI safety must expand beyond technical errors and into social impact. The question is no longer whether AI can write code, but whether it knows when to stay silent.","An AI-powered bot publicly criticised a software engineer for rejecting code it had generated.

"Donald Trump is again upset with Apple, FTC's sends angry letter to CEO Tim Cook saying you are violating law that ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-is-again-upset-with-apple-ftcs-sends-angry-letter-to-ceo-tim-cook-saying-you-are-violating-law-that-/articleshow/128358658.cms,"Read full letter sent by FTC to CEO Tim Cook on alleged ‘bias’ in Apple News

Re: Potential FTC Act Violations Related to Suppressing or Promoting Featured News Articles for Political Reasons

Dear Mr. Cook,

The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) is the nation’s consumer protection agency responsible for protecting American consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices. As part of its mission, the agency brings law-enforcement actions and educates businesses, industries, and market participants about compliance with the laws the FTC enforces. The FTC understands that Apple Inc. (“Apple”) is a global technology company that offers consumer electronics, software, and online services and applications, including in the United States.

Apple News is one of Apple’s many products and services. Apple News aggregates stories from newspapers, magazines, and digital publications, and curates those stories to provide consumers with a digital news feed. Apple News comes pre-installed on many Apple devices, including the iPhone and iPad, and purports to be the most used news app in the United States.

Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices. A representation is deceptive under the FTC Act if it is material and would likely mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.3 The FTC Act prohibits both material misrepresentations and material omissions.4 An act or practice is unfair if it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that cannot reasonably be avoided, and that injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Last year, the FTC issued a request for public comment to better understand how Big Tech companies and platforms deny or degrade consumers’ access to services or information based on the content of speech or their affiliations, including in ways that may violate Section 5 of the FTC Act.

The First Amendment protects the speech of Big Tech firms. But the First Amendment has never extended its protection to material misrepresentations made to consumers, nor does it immunize speakers from conduct that Congress has deemed unfair under the FTC Act, even if that conduct involves speech. Accordingly, Big Tech companies that suppress or promote news articles in their news aggregators or feeds based on the perceived ideological or political viewpoint of the article or publication may violate the FTC Act if that suppression or promotion (1) is inconsistent with the terms and conditions of service; (2) is contrary to consumers’ reasonable expectations such that failure to disclose the ideological favoritism is a material omission; or (3) when those practices cause substantial injury that is neither reasonably avoidable nor outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. As you know, Apple News has instituted terms of service and policies covering its relationship with existing and prospective consumers. These terms of service and policies address a wide range of topics including, among other things, the content of the site, a consumer’s use of the site, prohibited conduct, privacy and data security, and dispute resolution.

Recently, there have been reports that Apple News has systematically promoted news articles from left-wing news outlets and suppressed news articles from more conservative publications. Indeed, multiple studies have found that in recent months Apple News has chosen not to feature a single article from an American conservative-leaning news source, while simultaneously promoting hundreds of articles from liberal publications. These reports raise serious questions about whether Apple News is acting in accordance with its terms of service and its representations to consumers, as well as the reasonable consumer expectations of the tens of millions of Americans who use Apple News.

As an American citizen, I abhor and condemn any attempt to censor content for ideological reasons. Such efforts, whether taken to appease overzealous activists, at the behest of foreign governments, or simply to advance the political views of Silicon Valley elites, stifle the free exchange of ideas, manipulate the public discourse, and are inconsistent with American values.

The FTC is not the speech police; we do not have authority to require Apple or any other firm to take affirmative positions on any political issue, nor to curate news offerings consistent with one ideology or another. But Congress has mandated that we protect consumers from material misrepresentations and omissions, including when the product or service offered to consumers is a speech-related product.

As the Chairman of the FTC, I write to inform you of your obligations under the FTC Act. Any act or practice by Apple News to suppress or promote news articles based on the perceived ideological or political viewpoint of the article or publication, if inconsistent with Apple’s terms of service or the reasonable expectations of consumers, may violate the FTC Act. I encourage you to conduct a comprehensive review of Apple’s terms of service and ensure that Apple News’ curation of articles is consistent with those terms and representations made to consumers and, if it is not, to take corrective action swiftly.

US President Donald Trump expressed frustration in May last year over Apple CEO Tim Cook’s plans to manufacture iPhones bound for the country at newly built plants in India. He seems to be upset again as the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has issued a formal warning to Cook, alleging that Apple News could be violating the FTC Act – that prohibits “unfair methods of competition” and “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” in or affecting commerce by systematically boosting “left-wing sources and suppresses right-wing sources”.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairman Andrew Ferguson, a Trump appointee, sent a sharply worded letter to Apple’s headquarters last week “reminding him [Cook] of Apple’s obligations to its customers”.The FTC’s move was sparked by a study from the Media Research Center, a conservative watchdog group, which reviewed 620 of the top stories featured on Apple News throughout January 2026. Their findings claimed the feed was almost entirely composed of articles from The Associated Press, NBC News, The New York Times and The Washington Post., and that not a single article from prominent right-leaning outlets like Fox News, the New York Post, or the Daily Wire appeared in the top slots.","FTC sent letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on alleged ‘bias’ in Apple News.

AI not causing mass job loss but changing roles and productivity in Indian IT sector: OpenAI-backed ICRIER study claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-not-causing-mass-job-loss-but-changing-roles-and-productivity-in-indian-it-sector-openai-backed-icrier-study-claims/articleshow/128350615.cms,"Representative Image

""AI and Jobs: This Time Is No Different,""

“We are seeing a shift in how work is organised, where AI appears to be complementing human talent. This data offers a window into the transition underway in India. The focus now should be on the practical steps needed to help workers align their skills with the advancing capabilities of AI. Currently, only 4% of firms have trained more than half their workforce in AI, presenting a huge opportunity for growth.”

What companies said about how AI is changing their businesses



“Everyone has opinions on this matter, but the ICRIER–OpenAI study brings evidence to the table. The authors have complemented survey findings with in-depth interviews with Indian IT industry leaders to better understand the true impact of generative AI. The results should reassure Indian policymakers without inducing complacency. While India’s IT sector appears to be managing AI adoption relatively well, many firms remain insufficiently prepared for what lies ahead.”

Artificial intelligence (AI) is not causing mass job displacement in India's IT sector. Instead its reshaping work organisation, increasing productivity, and transforming employee roles, according to a new study by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) backed by OpenAI.The study, titledwas prepared by surveying 650 IT companies across 10 cities between November 2025 and January 2026. This study offers a detailed assessment of generative AI adoption in India. The research examined shifts in hiring patterns, occupational demand, productivity outcomes, and workforce skilling to provide a data-driven perspective on AI's actual workplace impact, countering widespread concerns about technology-driven unemployment.Commenting on the results, Ronnie Chatterji, Chief Economist, OpenAI, said,Companies report a slight easing in hiring, largely limited to entry-level roles, while hiring at mid and senior levels remains steady. Researchers indicate that this pattern aligns with wider post-pandemic trends in the IT sector and should not be linked solely to the adoption of AI.Roles often viewed as more exposed to AI, including software developers and database administrators, continue to see rising demand. This suggests that generative AI is being used mainly to support and improve productivity in technical and analytical work, rather than replace these roles.Talking about the study, Shekhar Aiyar, Director & Chief Executive, ICRIER, said,","Artificial intelligence (AI) is not causing mass job displacement in India's IT sector.

Homan Delivers Blunt Message After Announcing End Of Minnesota ICE Operation

Tech companies can ‘reject’ request

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reportedly launched a campaign to identify the people behind social media accounts that track or criticise Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The New York Times resorts that tech giants including Google , Meta – which owns Facebook and Instagram, Reddit, and Discord have received hundreds of legal requests or administrative subpoenas, demanding the names, email addresses, telephone numbers and other identifying data of account holders who post about the agency’s movements.As per government lawyers, these requests are an important factor in officer safety. They claim that when such social media accounts post the exact locations of ICE agents, it creates a threat to the officers and interferes with their ability to do their jobs.Sarah Balkissoon, a Department of Justice lawyer, stated in court that the government has the power to “investigate threats to its own officers or impediments to their officers.”The New York Times says that it has seen two subpoenas that were sent to Meta over the last six months, and that the tech companies can choose whether or not to provide the information.The companies say they review government requests before complying while some of them notified the people whom the government had requested data on and gave them 10 to 14 days to fight the subpoena in court.For example, in September last year, DHS demanded that Meta hand over the personal details of the people running those accounts. Meta followed its standard policy, and notified the users of two Instagram and Facebook accounts, and gave them a short window to fight the request in court.“We have received legal process from law enforcement seeking information about your Facebook account,” the notification said, according to court records.“If we do not receive a copy of documentation that you have filed in court challenging this legal process within ten (10) days, we will respond to the requesting agency with information,” it added.Google, meanwhile, said that it reviews subpoenas, and inform the users.“When we receive a subpoena, our review process is designed to protect user privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” a Google spokeswoman said.“We inform users when their accounts have been subpoenaed, unless under legal order not to or in an exceptional circumstance. We review every legal demand and push back against those that are overbroad,” the company added.","US Homeland Security is reportedly seeking personal data of individuals behind social media accounts critical of ICE agents.

Anthropic's $200 million Pentagon contract now hangs in the balance

CEO Dario Amodei drew a clear line on military use of AI

The Pentagon wants AI companies on classified networks with fewer restrictions

The US military used Anthropic's AI chatbot Claude during the operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro—just days before the two sides hit a wall over how the technology should and shouldn't be deployed in combat.Claude was accessed through Anthropic's partnership with Palantir Technologies, whose tools are already embedded across Pentagon and federal law enforcement operations, the WSJ reported. The Maduro mission, which included bombing several sites in Caracas last month, raises pointed questions about whether Claude's use stayed within Anthropic's own guidelines—which explicitly prohibit facilitating violence, weapons development, and surveillance.An Anthropic spokesperson told the WSJ the company couldn't confirm whether Claude was used in any specific operation, classified or otherwise. But the spokesperson added that ""any use of Claude—whether in the private sector or across government—is required to comply with our Usage Policies."" The Defense Department declined to comment.The revelation lands at a tense moment. Reuters reported last week that Anthropic and the Pentagon had reached a standstill over a contract worth up to $200 million.At the heart of the dispute: Anthropic wants guardrails preventing Claude from being used for autonomous weapons targeting and domestic surveillance. The Pentagon, backed by a January 9 department memo, argues it should be free to deploy commercial AI tools however it sees fit—as long as US law isn't broken.In a lengthy blog post published this week, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei wrote that AI should support national defense ""in all ways except those which would make us more like our autocratic adversaries."" He specifically flagged autonomous weapons and mass surveillance as bright red lines that democracies shouldn't cross.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has taken a different view. At a January event announcing the Pentagon's deal with Elon Musk's xAI, Hegseth said the agency wouldn't ""employ AI models that won't allow you to fight wars""—a remark widely understood as a shot at Anthropic.Reuters also reported this week that the Pentagon is pushing AI companies—including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google—to deploy their models on classified military networks with fewer of the safety restrictions typically applied to civilian users. Anthropic remains the only AI developer currently available in classified settings, though still bound by its own usage policies.OpenAI, meanwhile, has already agreed to loosen several of its standard guardrails for Pentagon use on an unclassified network rolled out to over 3 million Defense Department employees.","US military reportedly used AI chatbot Claude in a mission to capture Nicolás Maduro, raising concerns about its deployment in combat.

Why a presentation by Dell's senior vice president of North America sales has left some company's employees 'worried',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-a-presentation-by-dells-senior-vice-president-of-north-america-sales-has-left-some-companys-employees-worried/articleshow/128339495.cms,"The new pay structure



Quarterly targets introduced



Dell’s new financial year started with a major shake-up in how its sales teams are compensated. According to a report by Business Insider, in a town hall meeting held earlier this month by Kyle Leciejewski, senior vice president of North America sales, Dell introduced some changes that increase rewards for top performers but also reduce earnings for those who fall short of quotas. The announcement made by the company is reportedly based on an internal presentation which has left many employees worried about their future paybacks.As reported by BI, under the revised plan, the sales staff who will achieve below 60% of their targets will receive no commission at all. The company also mentioned that the employees hitting the target between 60% to 100% will see scaled payoutswhich is 25% of incentive and 70% quotas, 50% to 80% and 75% to 90%. On the other hand, sellers who reach 100% of their goal will receive their full incentive, while top performers exceeding quotas can now earn up to three times their target incentive, a 50% increase compared to the previous system.Dell is also moving most divans including enterprise, AI Select and telecom from twice yearly quotas to quarterly targets. The company also said that this shift is tied to its upcoming One Dell Way modernization initiative, set to launch in May, which aims to streamline operations for the AI era.While Dell framed the changes as a way to reward profitable growth and competitiveness, employees told Business Insider they fear take‑home pay cuts. One data center sales rep said that consistently hitting 70–80% of quotas in past years would now mean a 20% reduction in pay. Rising quotas, supply chain shortages, and long lead times in certain divisions are expected to make hitting 100% targets more difficult under the new quarterly cadence.The compensation overhaul comes amid broader morale issues at Dell. Employee satisfaction scores have dropped nearly 50% in two years, following layoffs, stricter return‑to‑office mandates, and attendance crackdowns. Sales teams are also grappling with global memory chip shortages and recent product price hikes, adding further pressure to meet targets.","Dell introduced changes that increase rewards for top performers but reduce earnings for those who fall short of quotas.

Despite a significant selloff in software stocks triggered by Anthropic's legal AI tools, they argue AI will enhance, not replace, existing software, enabling greater productivity and innovation.

Nvidia's Huang chimes in with Pichai, calls selloff 'most illogical thing in the world'

What exactly triggered the selloff

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

Why the fear runs deeper than one plugin

Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't buying the panic. During the company's earnings call, Pichai pushed back against the market hysteria triggered by Anthropic's new AI plugins, calling it overblown. AI is ""an enabling tool,"" he said, just as it has been for Google 's own products—Search, YouTube and others. Companies ""seizing the moment"" will find the same opportunity ahead, he added.His comments come as software stocks worldwide nurse heavy losses. Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugins, wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single session. Analysts dubbed it a 'SaaSpocalypse'. Pichai's view? The scramble is overdone.Pichai isn't alone in questioning the market reaction. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was even more direct at a Cisco event, calling the selloff ""the most illogical thing in the world."" His take: AI will use existing software tools, not reinvent them. ""Would you use a screwdriver or invent a new screwdriver?"" he asked. Huang added that Nvidia itself has adopted such tools extensively, freeing up employees to focus on designing chips and computer systems.Software company executives have also pushed back, arguing they do far more than just build code. Their offerings include data management and purpose-built solutions that are difficult to replicate, especially for enterprises outside the tech world like retail and oil and gas.Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its agentic AI assistant for non-technical professionals. Most covered standard enterprise functions—sales, marketing, finance, customer support. But the legal plugin rattled nerves. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings.Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan called it ""a sign of intensifying competition"" that could hurt big players in the legal space. The fallout was swift. Thomson Reuters and RELX both closed down around 15%. LegalZoom crashed nearly 20%. Indian IT stocks weren't spared—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5%, Wipro fell nearly 5%.The concern isn't just about legal workflows. There's a dawning realisation that AI tools can now do far more than most non-techies realise. With relatively simple prompts, they can take over a user's computer, write software, analyse stock market data, manage emails and countless other tasks. People have taken to social media describing how they built their first software program without ever learning to code. Shopify's CEO built software that could interpret his recent MRI.Meta's CFO Susan Li told investors last week that the company has seen a 30% year-over-year increase in output per engineer driven by AI coding tools. Power users have seen an 80% boost.Anthropic's numbers back up the concern. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualised recurring revenue by November, months after launch. The company is reportedly raising $20 billion at a $350 billion valuation. Jefferies noted that OpenAI is losing corporate ground to Claude, with enterprises now making up 80% of Anthropic's business.Pichai and Huang are betting the panic subsides. Wall Street isn't so sure yet.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismiss market panic over AI plugins, calling it overblown.

Oracle’s risky AI bet

Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has now seen an unprecedented $50 billion wiped off his net worth in less than forty days this year, as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison’s fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January. A single-day slump of 5% in Oracle’s stock erased about $9 billion from this wealth, deepening the decline.The round in software stocks was triggered by Anthropic’s release of plugins for its Claude Cowork AI agent, which can easily automate corporate tasks in legal, scales, finance, marketing and data analysis. Investors now fear that such tools could lead to reduction in the demand for external software from established giants such as Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit and Atlassian. Shares of all these companies tumbled earlier this week before staging a particle rebound, but Oracle’s loses remained steep.Ellison was not along in facing the sharp decline in net worth. Along with him, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also saw his net worth fall by around $11 billion, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost around $8 billion. On the other hand, other tech leaders like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang each shed around $5 billion as the stocks of the companies dropped by at least 2%.For those unaware, Oracle has aggressively positioned itself as an important player in the AI boom, the company has signed deals with Nvidia and OpenAI in order to offer data centers powering next-generation technology. However, its heavy spending and increasing debt have raised concerns among analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations — contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue — surged 438% year-over-year to $523 billion as of November 30, nearly ten times its annual revenue of $53 billion.Critics believe that Oracle may be overspending. Popular American investor Michael Burry has publicly bet against Oracle.

Gallot brings a sales-meets-engineering playbook back to Redmond

Why Microsoft needs a quality czar right now

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre. Charlie Bell, who led the company's security operations since 2021, is stepping down from that role to become what's effectively an engineering quality czar—reporting directly to Nadella.""Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo shared on Wednesday. ""And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!""Bell's replacement? Hayete Gallot, who's returning to Microsoft after an 18-month stint as Google Cloud's President of Customer Experience. She previously spent over 15 years at Redmond, climbing to the rank of corporate vice president across Windows, Office, and security teams.The shift is significant. Bell oversaw a team of roughly 10,000 people and was the driving force behind Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative—a company-wide push launched after Chinese hackers breached US government email accounts through a Microsoft Cloud exploit in 2023. That incident triggered a scathing review from the Department of Homeland Security, which called Microsoft's security culture ""inadequate.Now, Bell will work closely with cloud and AI chief Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on what Nadella calls the ""Quality Excellence Initiative."" The initiative is aimed at delivering ""durable, high-quality experiences at global scale""—corporate speak that likely translates to fewer Azure outages, fewer broken Windows patches, and fewer out-of-band emergency fixes.Gallot's appointment signals a shift in how Microsoft thinks about its security business. Nadella specifically highlighted her ability to combine ""product building with value realization for customers."" She'll also oversee Ales Holecek, who takes on a newly created Chief Architect for Security role.The timing isn't random. During last week's earnings call, Nadella talked up momentum in security products like Security Copilot agents and Purview. The company clearly wants someone who can sell security as aggressively as they build it.Nadella's memo doesn't spell out exactly why engineering quality needs its own dedicated leader at this moment. But the clues aren't hard to find. Microsoft now uses AI to write around 30 percent of its own code, Azure outages remain a recurring headache, and Copilot adoption sits at a modest 3.3 percent among Microsoft 365 users. Bell's got his work cut out.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre.

Why Amazon is shutting down Amazon Go and Fresh stores

Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain. The decision of the company to shut down the Amazon Fresh stores will lead to thousands of job cuts across the US. Last week, the e-commerce major announced that it will close around 60 Fresh stores which will put an end to the effort of six-years. As reported by Business Insider, the WARN notices filed in various states confirm the sale of layoffs. As aper the filling, in California only the company will shut down 20 Fresh stores which will affect around 3,900 workers. Most Fresh locations closed to the public on February 1, though California stores will remain open until mid-March due to state law.As Amazon is shutting down the Fresh stores, it has outlined two main options for the affected employees. The company is giving a choice to the employees in which they can either choose the severance pay or can take transfer within the company. The workers will continue to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after the closure announcement, or until April 28. The compensation offered by the company will be based on either the minimum pay for their employee class of their average hours worked over the past 60 days whichever is higher.The report further adds that employees who do not secure another role within the company by late April will then receive severance packages, calculated as one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh. Workers are guaranteed a minimum of four weeks’ pay, with the possibility of up to 20 weeks depending on tenure.For those seeking to remain within Amazon, the company is encouraging Fresh workers to apply for similar positions at Whole Foods Stores or Amazon grocery warehouse via its internal A to Z portal. An Amazon spokesperson said: “All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we’re providing career transition services to help them explore options.”Amazon Fresh associates typically earned between $16 and $20 per hour, according to data from job site Indeed. Their responsibilities ranged from picking delivery orders to handling checkout operations.Amazon Go and Fresh stores were introduced as Just Walk Out technology, but they struggled to establish a distinctive customer experience and sustainable economic model. On the other hand, Whole Food Market acquired in 2017 by Amazon say strong growth with sales rising more than 40% in recent years. Also, Amazon’s online grocery business also witnessed a surge with perishable grocery sales through Same-Day Delivery growing 40x since January 2025, making fresh groceries one of the most-ordered categories on its platform.",Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain.

Meet Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei: Former OpenAI researcher who turned his AI vision into a $3.7 billion company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-former-openai-researcher-who-turned-his-ai-vision-into-a-3-7-billion-company/articleshow/127943143.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s academic background and early career path



Dario Amodei’s rise at OpenAI and the birth of GPT models



Dario Amodei leaves OpenAI and builds Anthropic



Dario Amodei’s cautious leadership style



Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now. He is not a loud public figure, and he rarely chases attention, but his work has quietly shaped how modern AI systems are built and controlled. Before running a multi-billion-dollar company, Amodei spent years in labs and research roles, studying complex systems and how they behave under pressure. That background still shows in how he talks about artificial intelligence today. While others focus on speed and scale, he appears more concerned with safety, limits, and long-term risks. As AI moves faster than regulation, Amodei’s cautious approach is becoming harder to ignore.Before AI became the world’s favourite buzzword, Amodei was deep in academia. He studied physics at Stanford University and later earned a PhD in biophysics from Princeton. At the time, he was focused on understanding complex biological systems. Cells. Signals. Patterns that emerge rather than being designed. Looking back, that mindset fits AI almost too well.After completing his doctorate, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine.There was no clear path to becoming a tech billionaire. That part came later. Almost accidentally, it seems. Amodei eventually moved into machine learning research, joining companies like Baidu and Google Brain. At Google, he worked on neural networks and AI safety.Colleagues from that period say he already seemed concerned about failure modes. In 2016, he joined OpenAI. Things moved fast after that.At OpenAI, Amodei rose quickly. By 2019, he was Vice President of Research, helping set the organisation’s overall research direction. He led work on GPT-2 and GPT-3, models that changed public perception of AI almost overnight.These systems could write essays, answer questions, and even mimic conversation. Sometimes convincingly. Sometimes awkwardly. During this time, Amodei also co-invented reinforcement learning from human feedback. RLHF sounds technical, but the idea is simple. Teach AI systems by showing them what humans actually prefer, not just what scores well mathematically.In 2021, Amodei left OpenAI along with six others, including his sister Daniela Amodei. They founded Anthropic. Some people were sceptical at first. But Anthropic took a different route. It became a public benefit corporation. That detail mattered. It signalled that profit would not be the only priority. At least in theory. Their AI model, Claude, leaned into being cautious. Less dramatic. More restrained. That tone appealed to companies worried about reputational risk.By September 2025, Anthropic was reportedly valued at $183 billion by private investors. That number raised eyebrows. Especially for a company without much public hype.Partnerships with Alphabet and Amazon helped fuel that growth. So did rising concerns about AI safety across governments and corporations. As Anthropic’s valuation climbed, so did Amodei’s wealth. His real-time net worth now sits around $3.7 billion, ranking among the world’s richest people.Amodei does not sound like most tech CEOs. He hedges. A lot. “It seems.” “It might.” “We’re not fully sure yet.” That language annoys some people. Others trust it more. He avoids grand predictions. No promises of utopia. No claims that AI will solve everything.Experts say his influence shows up in quieter ways. Safety research is becoming mainstream. Alignment discussions moving from fringe to boardroom. Competitors are copying ideas they once ignored. No one really knows what comes next for Dario Amodei. AI is moving fast. Faster than regulation.","Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now.

'OpenAI deal is eating Oracle alive financially'

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

US banks are pulling back—and that's a big problem

A possible Cerner sale and 40% upfront customer deposits show how tight things have gotten

Oracle is staring down the possibility of its largest-ever workforce reduction—and at the heart of it is a $300 billion partnership with OpenAI that's proving far more expensive than anyone initially let on.Investment bank TD Cowen reported this week that Oracle is weighing cuts of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs. The move would free up an estimated $8 to $10 billion in cash flow, money the company desperately needs as it tries to bankroll a sprawling network of AI data centers built largely to serve Sam Altman 's company.TD Cowen puts the OpenAI commitment alone at around $156 billion in capital spending—and roughly 3 million GPUs to back it up. Oracle has already burned through $58 billion in debt in just two months. That's $38 billion for data centers in Texas and Wisconsin, $20 billion for a campus in New Mexico. Total debt now sits north of $100 billion.The kicker? That $58 billion covers only a slice of what's actually needed. Since its September 2025 peak, Oracle's stock has shed more than half its value—about $463 billion in market cap, gone.The financing crunch isn't just an Oracle internal issue anymore.Multiple US banks have quietly retreated from lending on Oracle-linked data center projects. TD Cowen noted that lenders have roughly doubled the interest rate premiums they charge Oracle since September, pushing borrowing costs into territory usually reserved for junk-rated companies.The result? Several data center leases Oracle had been negotiating simply stalled. Private operators couldn't get the funding to build, which means Oracle can't deliver the capacity its customers—especially OpenAI—are counting on. Some Asian banks are still willing to step in, but that doesn't solve the immediate problem in the US, where most of Oracle's expansion is planned.Oracle isn't sitting idle. The company is now requiring new customers to pay up to 40% of contract value upfront—essentially asking clients to co-fund the infrastructure. It's also exploring ""bring your own chip"" arrangements, where customers supply their own hardware.On the table too is a potential sale of Cerner, the healthcare software unit Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in 2022. That would be a significant strategic pivot, signaling that AI infrastructure is now the clear priority—everything else is up for grabs.TD Cowen also flagged that OpenAI has already begun shifting some near-term capacity needs over to Microsoft and Amazon, which is not exactly a vote of confidence in Oracle's ability to deliver on schedule.The company has not publicly commented on the layoff reports or the financing difficulties.","Oracle faces massive job cuts, potentially 20,000-30,000, to fund its costly $300 billion OpenAI partnership.

"Egypt bans Roblox nationwide over child safety concerns, raising global questions about kids' online freedom",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/egypt-bans-roblox-nationwide-over-child-safety-concerns-raising-global-questions-about-kids-online-freedom/articleshow/127935398.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Roblox faces a government ban in Egypt: Here’s why



What this ban means for kids and parents



Roblox going dark in Egypt, the platform that lives almost entirely on screens, the sudden loss felt very real. With games loading, Avatars running around blocky worlds. And then Egypt has officially banned Roblox, saying the move is about protecting children from harmful online content. The story underneath feels layered, political, and a little messy. Roblox looks harmless on the surface but experts say the risk is not the visuals but the interaction. The platform allows users to create games, chat with strangers, and move freely between user-generated worlds.A spokesperson confirmed the company has reached out to Egyptian authorities, offering dialogue to resolve the issue and restore access. The company says it has worked with regulators in other regions to build localised safety systems that align with cultural values. Last year, the company restricted some features across parts of the Middle East to address safety concerns. This ban did not come out of nowhere. Roblox has already been blocked or restricted in countries like Qatar and Turkey with other nations watching closely.The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.According to state-run media, the ban will be coordinated with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. That means internet providers are expected to block access nationwide with no single official explanation was released at first. Later, state outlets pointed to growing concerns about children’s exposure to inappropriate content, online interactions, and psychological risks as reported by Bloomberg. An Egyptian senator had already called for regulating Roblox to protect children’s moral and educational values.President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi recently called for limits on children’s phone use, pointing to similar moves abroad. Australia has banned social media for certain age groups. France is moving in the same direction. Egypt’s parliament is now discussing broader rules for digital platforms including unified age classifications, stronger verification, penalties and possibly forcing companies to have local representatives inside the country.For children, the ban feels abrupt and confusing. For parents, reactions are mixed. Some welcome the move, while others worry it pushes kids toward less visible, less regulated platforms, potentially exposing them to more risks. That is the irony experts often point out. When one door closes, another usually opens. Sometimes darker, more unpredictable, and harder to monitor.Still, supporters of the ban argue that Roblox’s scale makes it different. Millions of users. Constant interaction. Endless content that cannot realistically be watched, moderated, or controlled by humans alone, leaving significant safety and privacy concerns for young players and families.","The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive. Anime Paradox February codes let you redeem gems, stat chips, trait rerolls, and more.For players trying to build a decent team without sinking hours into farming, they matter.Below is the list of all working Anime Paradox codes in February 2026.Anime Paradox is a Roblox tower defence game where players summon and command powerful anime-style units to fend off waves of enemies and bosses as they defend a base.

What tech companies have to say



In a bid to keep the global tech industry connected, 15 of the world's most powerful companies, including Google , Microsoft, Amazon and Jio Platforms, have joined forces to launch the Trusted Tech Alliance (TTA). Announced on Friday (February 13) at the Munich Security Conference, this “United Nations of Tech” aims to ensure that technology remains safe, transparent, and accessible, regardless of which country it comes from.The group is based on a shared set of principles for a trusted technology stack, which includes connectivity, cloud infrastructure, semiconductors, software and AI. The move comes as a response to growing ‘digital sovereignty’, where countries are trying to build walls around their tech sectors to reduce dependence on foreign powers, particularly the US.Recently, several leaders, including France President Emmanuel Macron, spoke on the issue of relying too heavily on American technology. This led to a push for ‘digital sovereignty’ – an idea that a country should have total control over its own data and software.The 15 member companies have committed to five core principles:Maintaining transparent corporate governance and ethical behaviour.Building technology securely and allowing independent experts to check their work.Ensuring that hardware meets high global security standards.Supporting a digital world that is inclusive and encourages innovation.Respecting the rule of law and protecting user privacy at all costs.The Alliance includes: Anthropic, Cohere, Microsoft, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Reliance Jio (India), Nokia (Finland), Ericsson (Sweden), NTT (Japan), SAP (Germany), Hanwha (South Korea), and Saab (Sweden).The Alliance argues that building tech walls is dangerous.“Trusted, secure, and transparent technology is essential to unlocking inclusive digital growth at global scale. Jio Platforms is proud to join the Trusted Tech Alliance to advance common standards and verifiable practices across the technology stack. Through collaboration with global partners, we aim to strengthen resilience, expand digital opportunity, and build long-term confidence in next-generation connectivity, cloud, and AI systems,” said Kiran Thomas, CEO, Jio Platforms.“There are no countries on this planet that alone can be fully sovereign,” warned Börje Ekholm, CEO of Ericsson.“In the current geopolitical environment, it is critical that like-minded companies work together to protect security and advance high global standards to preserve trust in technology across borders,” said Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President of Microsoft.“Google Cloud has a long-held commitment to promote choice, trust, and sovereignty that is codified in our technology today. Through the Trusted Tech Alliance, we aim to champion the principles we already adhere to: Promoting customer choice and providing a portfolio of solutions, enabled by technical controls and local partnerships, to meet strict sovereignty requirements and regional standards,” said Marcus Jadotte, Vice President, Government Affairs and Public Policy, Google Cloud.","15 of the world's most powerful companies, including Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Jio Platforms, have joined forces to launch the Trusted Tech Alliance.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Google’s platform and the AI infrastructure

Pressure on world's biggest chipmaker, Nvidia

Google could overtake Nvidia to become the world’s most valuable company by market capitalisation by the end of 2026, according to an analyst assessment at Seeking Alpha that points to a growing challenge facing the technology industry: the rising cost and constraints of AI computing infrastructure. The view comes as Alphabet, Google’s parent company, ramps up spending on data centres and custom AI hardware while reporting strong growth across search and cloud businesses. The analyst argues that Google’s broad AI platform and in-house chips position it to benefit as companies seek alternatives to expensive, power-hungry AI processors, a pressure point increasingly described as one of the industry’s biggest headaches.First reason pointed by the analyst behind Google’s recent market-cap gains were also driven by a shift in investor perception around artificial intelligence leadership. He argues that the widely held belief that OpenAI’s AI chatbot-- ChatGPT would significantly damage Google Search proved incorrect, despite early enthusiasm around the chatbot. According to the analysis, Google’s continued growth in search revenue and the rollout of its own AI products undermined the idea that OpenAI had overtaken Google as the industry’s AI leader.The reassessment, he said, helped narrow the valuation gap between Google and Nvidia.The analysis notes that Alphabet’s planned capital expenditure of up to $180 billion for 2026 has drawn attention, but says the focus should instead be on Google’s underlying business performance. Google Search revenue grew 17% year-on-year in the latest quarter, while Google Cloud revenue rose 48%, with a reported backlog of $240 billion.The analyst argues that Google’s strength lies in its ability to monetise AI across a wide range of products, including Google Search, advertising, cloud, and vidoe-streaming platform YouTube. Unlike rivals that rely heavily on third-party chips, Google designs its own Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), giving it more control over costs, performance, and energy use, the analyst claims.The assessment also points to increasing competition for Jensen Huang-led Nvidia, whose high-margin GPUs dominate AI training but face challenges in the inference market, where efficiency and power consumption matter more. As pointed out in the report, custom chips from companies such as Broadcom, Amazon, and Google are gaining traction as cheaper and more energy-efficient alternatives.As AI workloads shift toward inference at scale, the analyst believes demand for application-specific processors will grow, reducing reliance on Nvidia’s GPUs.

"'Clearly dishonest' ads that Sam Altman said made him 'laugh' seems to have worked well for Anthropic, the company that made fun of ChatGPT",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/clearly-dishonest-ads-that-sam-altman-said-made-him-laugh-seems-to-have-worked-well-for-anthropic-the-company-that-made-fun-of-chatgpt/articleshow/128343273.cms,"Sam Altman called Anthropic's ads 'clearly dishonest'

Here's what Sam Altman wrote in his 400-word long note on Anthropic ads

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was not pleased with Anthropic's Super Bowl ads making fun of ChatGPT. But it seems they did the job that OpenAI's arch-rival Anthropic intended to. According to data analyzed by BNP Paribas, the maker of the Claude chatbot Anthropic saw visits to its site jump 6.5% following its Super Bowl advertisement that made fun of rival OpenAI’s decision to bring ads to ChatGPT. As per the report, the Claude gain, which took it into the top 10 free apps on the Apple App Store, beat out chatbot and artificial intelligence competitors OpenAI, Google Gemini and Meta.Daily active users also reportedly saw an 11% jump post-game, the most significant among AI companies. OpenAI’s ChatGPT had a 2.7% bump in daily active users after the Super Bowl and Gemini added 1.4%. But what is important to note here is that Claude’s user base is still much smaller than ChatGPT and Gemini.Advertisements from artificial intelligence brands took center stage at the big game, which brought in an audience of 125 million in the U.S., as platforms made their pitch to lure more customers in a competitive market that’s showing no signs of slowing.Anthropic's Super Bowl ads that mae un of OpenAI for showing adsAnthropic spent millions of dollars on ads during America's National Football League championship game to slam rival OpenAI for its plan to sell ads on its ChatGPT.Anthropic's 30-second ads took a thinly veiled jab at OpenAI's intentions to introduce ads in ChatGPT. The punchline: ""Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude,"" the name of Anthropic's chatbot.Not surprisingly, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was not happy with Anthropic’s Super Bowl ad campaign. In a post to social media platform X, formerly, Twitter, Altman called the commercials “deceptive” and “clearly dishonest.”First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.I guess it’s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency. More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do. (If you want to pay for ChatGPT Plus or Pro, we don't show you ads.)Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people. We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.Maybe even more importantly: Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI—they block companies they don't like from using their coding product (including us), they want to write the rules themselves for what people can and can't use AI for, and now they also want to tell other companies what their business models can be.We are committed to broad, democratic decision making in addition to access. We are also committed to building the most resilient ecosystem for advanced AI. We care a great deal about safe, broadly beneficial AGI, and we know the only way to get there is to work with the world to prepare.One authoritarian company won't get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path.As for our Super Bowl ad: it’s about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.We are enjoying watching so many people switch to Codex. There have now been 500,000 app downloads since launch on Monday, and we think builders are really going to love what’s coming in the next few weeks. I believe Codex is going to win.We will continue to work hard to make even more intelligence available for lower and lower prices to our users.This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them.",Anthropic spent millions of dollars on ads during America's National Football League championship game to slam rival OpenAI for its plan to sell ads on its ChatGPT.

"After cutting 1,500 jobs in the division Mark Zuckerberg changed the company's name for, Meta gives update on future layoffs: We are",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-cutting-1500-jobs-in-the-division-mark-zuckerberg-changed-the-companys-name-for-meta-gives-update-on-future-layoffs-we-are/articleshow/128339097.cms,"Meta has confirmed it will not repeat last year's company-wide performance purge, assuring employees that the bottom 5% cull is not an annual initiative. This comes after recent layoffs in its Reality Labs division, which has incurred significant losses. The company is now shifting its focus and investment towards AI research.

Reality Labs bled $70 billion since 2020, and Mark Zuckerberg is now redirecting that money toward AI

Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more

The 5% performance cut talks that started it all

Meta has told employees it won't repeat last year's company-wide performance purge, drawing a line under months of speculation about whether the bottom 5% cull would become an annual ritual. ""These are individual cases not related to any company wide initiatives,"" a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider. ""For example we are not doing any 5% low performers like we did last year.""The clarification arrives just weeks after Meta slashed roughly 10% of its Reality Labs workforce—over 1,000 employees, though some reports peg the number closer to 1,500. The cuts hit hardest in the teams building VR headsets and Horizon Worlds, the virtual reality social network that was supposed to justify Zuckerberg's decision to rename Facebook to Meta back in 2021.The Reality Labs layoffs weren't exactly a surprise. CTO Andrew Bosworth had called a division-wide meeting last month, describing it as the ""most important"" of the year and asking staff to show up in person—never a great sign. The New York Times reported that Zuckerberg had asked top executives to trim their 2026 budgets so the company could funnel more money into AI research, including TBD Lab, Meta's secretive unit chasing superintelligence.Reality Labs has burned through more than $70 billion in losses since 2020, and consumers still haven't rushed to buy VR headsets despite billions in development spending. The one bright spot has been the Ray-Ban smart glasses, which have sold over two million units and are now the centrepiece of Meta's hardware strategy going forward.The whole performance-based layoff saga kicked off in January 2025, when Zuckerberg sent staff a memo saying he wanted to ""raise the bar on performance management"" and ""move out low-performers faster."" An internal FAQ later suggested such cuts could become a yearly exercise. Meta cut roughly 5% of its workforce by February 2025, targeting employees rated as the lowest performers.Now, at least for 2026, Meta says that playbook is staying on the shelf.","Reality Labs has burned through more than $70 billion in losses since 2020.

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman: Focus is on in-house AI models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-confirms-company-is-dumping-openai-says-my-personal-mission-at-microsoft-is-to/articleshow/128335767.cms,"Microsoft is charting a course towards AI self-sufficiency, aiming to reduce its reliance on OpenAI. The tech giant is developing its own advanced AI models, like MAI-1-preview, and diversifying its AI supplier base. This strategic shift follows a recent partnership restructuring with OpenAI, granting both entities greater independence to pursue their own AI development goals.

Microsoft already has its own AI model in the works

The October 2025 deal gave both sides more room to operate independently

Wall Street is already nervous about the OpenAI dependency

Microsoft is no longer content being powered by someone else's AI. The company's AI chief Mustafa Suleyman has told the Financial Times that Microsoft is pushing toward ""true AI self-sufficiency""—a clear signal that the tech giant is actively reducing its dependence on OpenAI, even as the two companies remain contractually tied.""My personal mission at Microsoft is to build superintelligence,"" Suleyman said in the interview, adding that the company must develop its own frontier foundation models with ""gigawatt scale compute"" and ""some of the very best AI training team in the world.""This isn't just talk. In August 2025, Microsoft AI previewed MAI-1-preview, an in-house mixture-of-experts model pre-trained on roughly 15,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs. The company has signalled plans to roll it into certain Copilot text use cases—a direct step toward replacing OpenAI models in its own products.Microsoft has also been quietly widening its AI supplier base. It now hosts models from xAI, Meta, Mistral, and Black Forest Labs in its data centres. Reports suggest the company even tested Anthropic's Claude models for some Microsoft 365 Copilot tasks after internal benchmarks found them better for certain Office workloads—going so far as to pay rival cloud provider AWS for access.Suleyman's comments come months after Microsoft and OpenAI signed a restructured partnership agreement in October 2025. That deal converted Microsoft's profit-sharing rights into a 27% ownership stake in the newly formed OpenAI Group PBC, valued at roughly $135 billion. It also extended Microsoft's IP rights to OpenAI models through 2032, including post-AGI systems.But the deal cut both ways. OpenAI gained freedom to source computing power outside Azure and pitch new investors. Microsoft, in turn, secured the right to independently pursue AGI—alone or with third-party partners. The restructuring effectively gave both companies permission to build their own futures without waiting for the other.Investors have taken notice of the shifting dynamics. During Microsoft's recent earnings call, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill flagged OpenAI's 45% share of Microsoft's backlog of future sales, calling it a concern about ""durability"" and ""exposure."" The following day, Microsoft shares lost $357 billion in value—a historic single-day wipeout that had little to do with the company's actual financial performance.Suleyman, a co-founder of Google DeepMind before joining Microsoft in March 2024, said he expects Microsoft to have its own superintelligence model ready ""sometime this year.""","Microsoft is pushing toward ""true AI self-sufficiency,"" says AI chief Mustafa Suleyman.

What is FTC asking Microsoft customers and rivals

Google's complaint against Microsoft

What Microsoft says on its Cloud practices

Amazon AWS also under FTC scrutiny

Microsoft is reportedly facing scrutiny by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). According to a report in Bloomberg, FTC is accelerating scrutiny of Microsoft as part of an ongoing probe into whether the company illegally monopolizes large swaths of the enterprise computing market with its cloud software and AI offerings, including Copilot. The agency has reportedly issued civil investigative demands in recent weeks to companies that compete with Microsoft in the business software and cloud computing markets. FTC has asked these companies a list of questions on Microsoft’s licensing and other business practices, says the report quoting people, who are said to have been granted anonymity to discuss a confidential investigation.With the demands, which are effectively like civil subpoenas, FTC is reportedly seeking evidence to check if Microsoft makes it harder for customers to use Windows, Office and other products on rival cloud services. The American agency is also requesting information on Microsoft’s bundling of artificial intelligence, security and identity software into other products, including Windows and Office, some of the people said. The probe is now in the hands of FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson. Most of the questions are said to have zeroed in on Microsoft’s licensing practices. About a third of them focused on the company’s AI business and reflected concerns that Microsoft canceled some of its own work after investing in OpenAI and leaning heavily on its software, eliminating potential competition.Incidentally, Google filed a complaint with the European Commission in September 2024, saying Microsoft was exploiting its dominant Windows Server operating system to prevent competition. Google complained that Microsoft's anti-competitive practices locked customers into Microsoft's cloud platform Azure. However, in November 2025, Google dropped its EU antitrust complaint about Microsoft's cloud computing practices, a week after EU regulators launched an investigation to see if Microsoft should be subject to rules aimed at curbing its power in this sector. ""Today, we are withdrawing it (Microsoft complaint) in light of the recent announcement that the EC will assess problematic practices affecting the cloud sector under a separate process,"" Giorgia Abeltino, head of government affairs and public policy for Google Cloud Europe, said in a blog post. ""We continue to work with policymakers, customers, and regulators across the EU, the UK, and elsewhere to advocate for choice and openness in the cloud market,"" she said.Microsoft on its part has also said that some of its products aren’t fully interoperable with rival clouds because the technology underpinning some features is different. Additionally, a series of damaging hacks has put increasing pressure on the company to offer more robust security features in its core products.The FTC is also pressing ahead with a similar effort targeting Amazon. Both cases date back to Donald Trump's first term. Amazon leads the cloud computing market with a 30% share, followed by Microsoft at 20% and Google at 13%.","FTC reportedly seeking evidence to check if Microsoft makes it harder for customers to use Windows, Office and other products on rival cloud services.

What is OpenClaw

‘OpenClaw’ AI Agents worry security researchers

Baidu reportedly plans to give users of its main smartphone app direct access to the wildly popular artificial intelligence tool OpenClaw. According to the Chinese tech company, starting later on Friday (February 13), users who opt in can message the AI agent through Baidu’s main search app to complete tasks such as scheduling, organizing files and writing code. Baidu claims 700 million monthly active users for its search app. The company is also said to be rolling out OpenClaw’s capabilities to its e-commerce business and other services.OpenClaw gained attention this week after the emergence of a new social network called Moltbook that is advertised as being exclusively for the use of OpenClaw bots. Cybersecurity firm Wiz said last weel that the network had a major flaw that exposed private data on thousands of people.OpenClaw, an open-source AI agent previously known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, is a powerful personal assistant that can connect to LLMs, integrate with external APIs, and autonomously execute an array of tasks like sending email or controlling browsers. OpenClaw is installed on local machines or dedicated servers. It stores configuration data and interaction history locally, which allows its behavior to persist across sessions.Because it’s designed to run locally, users often give it expansive access to terminal, files, and in some cases, root-level execution privileges.While OpenClaw carries the promise of AI-driven productivity, it also presents growing security concerns. Cybersecurity companies including CrowdStrike have warned the public about granting OpenClaw unfettered access to enterprise systems.Last week, China's industry ministry warned that the OpenClaw open-source AI agent, which gained global popularity in recent weeks, could pose significant security risks when improperly configured and expose users to cyberattacks and data breaches. The country's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said it had discovered instances where users were operating OpenClaw with inadequate security settings and said better precautions needed to be taken.In South Korea, major technology companies including Kakao, Naver, and Karrot Market, are restricting the use of the open-source AI agent OpenClaw over security concerns. Companies cited risks related to data privacy, potential leaks, and system manipulation. Kakao and Naver told employees to avoid using OpenClaw on work devices, while Karrot Market blocked both access and use of OpenClaw and Moltbot.Kakao said it was restricting the tool, previously known as ClaudeBot or MaltBot, to safeguard corporate information assets. Naver has issued a similar internal ban, while Danggeun has blocked access entirely, citing risks beyond the company’s control. While none of these companies have formally announced a ban on OpenClaw, online workplace forums suggest internal security teams are monitoring its use.Microsoft’s AI safety team too has publicly questioned whether the tool is secure enough for enterprise use.","Baidu reportedly plans to give users of its main smartphone app direct access to the popular artificial intelligence tool OpenClaw.

List of companies added and removed from tech blacklist



The US government on Friday (February 13) withdrew a newly updated list of Chinese companies allegedly aiding Beijing’s military, just one hour after it was made public, a report has said. The list, known as the Pentagon's 1260H list, originally appeared on the official Federal Register with several new, high-profile additions, including tech giants Alibaba and Baidu, a repot by news agency Reuters said.However, the link was quickly replaced with a “withdrawn” notice following an urgent request from the agency. No official reason for the reversal has been provided, the report added.“An agency letter requesting withdrawal of this document was received after placement on public inspection,” the Federal Register posted in an editorial note.The update included some of China's most recognisable global brands. Along with Alibaba and Baidu, the list reportedly added BYD, which is one of the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturers and is a competitor to Elon Musk’s Tesla. Other companies included major biotechnology firm WuXi AppTec and RoboSense, a leader in AI-driven robotics.The list already includes major Chinese firms such as Tencent Holdings, one of China's largest tech companies, and CATL, a major battery maker in the electric vehicle industry.An Alibaba spokesperson said there was no basis for their inclusion and threatened legal action.“Alibaba is not a Chinese military company nor part of any military-civil fusion strategy,” the company was quoted as saying.Conversely, chip memory maker YMTC was reportedly removed from the updated roster. It is to be noted that being on this list does not trigger immediate sanctions but it carries a heavy stigma. Reuters reported that under a recently passed law, the Pentagon will be prohibited from signing contracts or buying products from any company featured on the list in the coming years.","The list, known as the Pentagon's 1260H list, originally appeared on the official Federal Register with several new, high-profile additions.

Amazon has successfully completed its first heavy-lift mission of 2026, marking a major milestone for both the tech giant and European space efforts. The Ariane 64 rocket lifted off from French Guiana, carrying 32 new satellites for Amazon’s growing internet constellation. Amazon is the second major company after Elon Musk’s SpaceX that is working to deploy satellites in space to provide fast, reliable high-speed internet to people worldwide who live beyond the reach of traditional cable or fiber networks.The mission, dubbed Leo Europe 01 (LE-01), is the first of 18 planned launches between Amazon and Arianespace, the company said. This launch brings Amazon’s total satellite count to over 200 spacecraft. The company said that Amazon plans to begin rolling out internet services to customers later in 2026 with initial service scheduled to start in the far northern and southern parts of the world.Panos Panay, who leads Amazon’s devices and services business, said: “Congrats to the @Amazonleo and @Arianespace teams! 🚀 LE-01 successfully deployed 32 satellites on our first Ariane 6 mission. Our biggest payload yet, and just the start of our 2026 heavy lift campaigns.So proud.”The LE-01 mission is the first time the Ariane 6 rocket launched with four boosters, making it the most powerful launcher currently available in Europe. Moreover, Amazon’s partnership with Arianespace is the largest commercial contract in the launch provider’s history.French President Emmanuel Macron celebrated the event on social media, declaring, ""Amazon, your package has been delivered,"" while hailing the launch as a “European success.”“Amazon, your package has been delivered. Ariane 6 has lifted off for the first time with four boosters, making it our most powerful European launcher!” Macron said.“On board: 32 satellites for Amazon’s constellation.

The Privacy Debate Re-Ignited

'Exit India If...': Supreme Court Sends Sharp Message To Meta Over WhatsApp Policy, Indian User Data

Five years after shutting down its facial recognition system on Facebook over privacy fears, Meta is preparing for a comeback, a report has said. The tech giant is said to be working to bring the technology back with a change – this time embedding it directly into the lenses of its popular Ray-Ban smart glasses. According to a report by The New York Times, the feature is internally dubbed “Name Tag”, and it will allow glasses wearers to look at a person and instantly identify them. Moreover, they can also pull up information through Meta’s built-in AI assistant, the report noted, citing four people involved with the plans.The report, however, says that Meta’s plans may change. Citing an internal document, the company has been in talks how to release a feature that carries “safety and privacy risks”. The company reportedly considered a “soft launch” at a conference for the blind to showcase the tool’s helpfulness before a wider release.The report also cites internal memos which suggest that the company is looking for a strategic window to release the feature with minimal backlash.“We will launch during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns,” the document from Meta’s Reality Labs, which works on hardware including smart glasses, was cited as saying.Why Meta ‘killed’ facial recognition techIn 2021, Meta deleted the face-scan data of over a billion people, citing the need to find the “right balance” for a technology that sparked legal battles and public outcry. However, the commercial success of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses has reportedly reignited the company’s ambitions.The return of facial recognition on wearable devices has immediately set off alarm bells among privacy advocates. Unlike a static camera in a store, smart glasses are mobile and often go unnoticed, threatening the ""practical anonymity"" of everyday life.What Meta has to say on technology’s resintroductionMeta has not yet committed to a specific launch date and insists it is proceeding with caution.“We’re building products that help millions of people connect and enrich their lives. While we frequently hear about the interest in this type of feature — and some products already exist in the market — we’re still thinking through options and will take a thoughtful approach if and before we roll anything out,” Meta said in a statement.",Report: Meta is preparing for a comeback of its facial recognition technology.

China AI rules to protect kids



China’s market watchdog has officially released a new set of anti-monopoly guidelines aimed at limiting the power of internet platforms. The rules, released on Friday (February 13), are designed to ensure fair competition and prevent platforms from charging unfairly high prices to consumers. One of the most significant parts of the new guidelines targets the algorithms of these platforms.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the government has warned companies against using sophisticated technology to coordinate pricing or traffic distribution with their competitors. The watchdog is also said to be putting an end to a common industry tactic known as “all-network lowest price” requirements.This means that dominant platforms can no longer force sellers to lower their prices just because they offered a discount on a rival site. Moreover, the smaller platforms are now on notice, they can also face monopoly charges if they demand that merchants give them “equal or better” deals than their competitors.The new guidelines strictly prohibit forced exclusive partnerships which means that major platforms are now banned from demanding that merchants pledge not to work with competing apps unless there is a justifiable reason.Platforms are also advised against using transaction history, device types, or spending habits to charge different prices to different users for the same service.In December last year, China proposed strict rules for artificial intelligence (AI) to safeguard children and prevent chatbots from offering advice that could lead to self-harm or violence. Under the proposed rules, developers will need to ensure their AI models do not generate content that promotes gambling. Once finalised, the rules will apply to AI products and services in China.","China’s market watchdog has officially released a new set of anti-monopoly guidelines aimed at limiting the power of internet platforms.

What engineers at Spotify really do now as CEO says its developers haven't written a line of code since December,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-engineers-at-spotify-really-do-now-as-ceo-says-its-developers-havent-written-a-line-of-code-since-december/articleshow/128305282.cms,"Spotify's top engineers are no longer writing code, instead directing AI to generate and review it. This shift, powered by an internal system called Honk, has significantly boosted product development, with over 50 new features launched in 2025. Engineers now act as architects and editors, focusing on judgment rather than manual implementation, a move Spotify aims to lead.

Engineers at Spotify are now editors, not coders

Spotify founder Daniel Ek has been warming up to AI for years

Spotify's top engineers have stopped writing code entirely–and the company isn't worried. In fact, it's celebrating the shift as a sign of where software development is headed. During the company's Q4 2025 earnings call, co-CEO and CTO Gustav Söderström dropped a striking claim: Spotify's most senior developers haven't manually written a single line of code since December. Instead, they now describe what they want built, let AI generate the code, and then review the output. It's a fundamental change in how one of the world's biggest tech-driven music platforms operates behind the scenes. ""They actually only generate code and supervise it,"" Söderström told analysts.The shift is powered by an internal system called Honk, which lets engineers request code changes through Slack using Anthropic's Claude Code. The workflow is surprisingly casual—an engineer on their morning commute can ask Claude to fix a bug in the iOS app, receive a working build on their phone, and merge it to production before reaching the office.Spotify says the system has boosted product velocity significantly. The company shipped over 50 new features throughout 2025, with recent launches including AI-powered Prompted Playlists, Page Match for audiobooks, and About This Song.The real change isn't just about speed—it's about what engineers actually spend their time doing. According to Söderström, the bottleneck in software development has shifted from coding capacity to human judgment. Engineers now function more as architects and editors, deciding what should be built rather than physically building it.Think of it as moving from bricklayer to building inspector—except the inspector also picks the blueprint.Spotify began preparing for this roughly 18 months ago by rebuilding its internal systems for what it calls an ""AI-native development environment."" The bet was that software development would eventually be driven by prompting and orchestration rather than manual implementation.Founder Daniel Ek's comfort with AI isn't new. Back in 2023, he called the technology ""huge for creativity"" and resisted calls to ban AI-generated music from the platform. He's consistently argued that AI should enhance human creativity rather than replace it, while acknowledging the murkier questions around voice cloning and artist consent.Söderström made Spotify's current ambitions clear: ""We are absolutely hell-bent on leading that change.""","Engineers at Spotify are now editors, not coders.

We are in the middle of the second month of 2026 and nearly 30,000 jobs have been cut across the global tech sector in the first 40 days of the year. Online retail giant Amazon accounted for the single largest layoff in 2026 after the company announced to cut about 16,000 roles in late January. According to Layoffs.fyi, 26 other major companies that announced workforce reductions include Salesforce, Meta, Workday, Autodesk, Pinterest, Expedia, Zillow, Ericsson, and ASML. Several firms reduced headcount by hundreds of employees, while smaller companies carried out more limited cuts. Here’s a look at some of the biggest tech layoffs announced so far in 2026, based on data compiled by Layoffs.fyi.Amazon said in January that it is laying off 16,000 employees globally, marking the company’s second biggest job cut after October last year when it laid off 14,000 roles.Announcing the job cuts, HR chief Beth Galetti said in a memo that teams that didn't finish restructuring in October have now completed the process. She promised this won't become a recurring pattern, but added that adjustments will continue ""in a world that's changing faster than ever.""A Business Insider report recently said that Salesforce has cut nearly 1,000 jobs. Impacted teams include marketing, product management, data analytics, and Salesforce's Agentforce AI product that the company's CEO Marc Benioff has previously said “is part and parcel of Salesforce”.The report said that many of the laid off employees as part of Salesforce job cuts shared on LinkedIn that their roles had been eliminated. At least nine posts reviewed showed job losses across different teams, it says, adding two employees also confirmed the layoffs while speaking to the publication.Earlier this month, Meta announced to reduce its workforce by around 1,500 employees. In an email (seen by the Silicon Valley Business Journal), a Meta spokesperson said, “We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from metaverse toward wearables. This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year.”The job cuts come as the company shifts investment from its metaverse division to wearable technology.Apart from Amazon and Salesforce, several other major technology companies reported layoffs in the first 40 days of 2026, according to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi. Cloud-based HR and finance software provider Workday has cut about 400 jobs, while Autodesk announced layoffs affecting roughly 1,000 roles. Pinterest, on the other hand, has cut about 700 jobs during the same period.In the travel and consumer internet space, Expedia carried out two rounds of layoffs, cutting a combined 200 jobs, while Zillow reduced its headcount by around 200 employees. Peloton announced job cuts affecting about 11% of its workforce, and Vimeo also reported layoffs.ASML cut around 1,700 jobs in the Netherlands, Ericsson reduced about 1,600 roles in Sweden, and Germany-based AI company Aleph Alpha cut around 50 jobs. In Israel, Playtika announced layoffs affecting about 500 employees, while eToro and StoreDot also reported job cuts.Smaller startups and crypto firms were not spared.

Quote of the day by Tim Cook



“It’s about finding your values, and committing to them. It’s about finding your North Star. It’s about making choices. Some are easy. Some are hard. And some will make you question everything.”

Understanding the meaning of the quote by Apple CEO Tim Cook



How Tim Cook’s leadership reflects this thinking



How to apply Tim Cook’s quote in daily life



First, knowing your own values can help you make decisions every day. Values give you a clear guide when you need to make decisions about your career, deal with problems at work, or manage your relationships.

Second, sticking to those values means being consistent, even when things get tough. This might mean turning down chances that go against your personal beliefs or standing firm when things get tough.

Third, knowing that doubt is a normal part of growth can help you make decisions. Doubting your choices doesn't mean you've failed. It often means that you are learning and thinking about what you have learned.

Why Tim Cook’s words continue to resonate



Other famous quotes by Tim Cook



“Let your joy be in your journey, not in some distant goal.”

“Life is fragile. We’re not guaranteed a tomorrow, so give it everything you’ve got.”

“We see that privacy is a fundamental human right that people have. We are going to do everything that we can to help maintain that trust.”

""Some people see innovation as change, but we have never really seen it like that. It’s making things better.""

In a world where decisions need to be made quickly, things change all the time, and there is more and more pressure to succeed, clear values are often what makes a good leader. Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, has said many times how important it is to stay grounded, especially when you're in charge of one of the world's most powerful tech companies. One of the things he said that made me think the most was about how to make decisions and where to go in life. In this quote, Cook talks about values, commitment, and what he calls a ""North Star,"" which is a guiding principle that helps people stay on track when things get tough.Steve Jobs died in 2011, and Tim Cook became Apple's CEO. Since then, Apple has grown its business in hardware, software, services, and efforts to be more environmentally friendly. Since Cook took over, the company has made privacy, accessibility, environmental responsibility, and ethical supply chains clear priorities. His quote shows this broader view of leadership, where choices aren't just about growth but also about how they will affect things in the long run.The quote points out a truth that many people deal with, whether at work or in their personal lives. Some choices seem easy. Some bring doubt.Some may even make people question what they believe. Cook's message stresses the need to know what your values are before you face these kinds of situations. He says that instead of reacting to trends or pressure, we should make decisions based on principles that stay the same over time.Tim Cook talks about values when he talks about the beliefs and rules that govern behaviour. When things get tough, these values can help you figure things out. People often use the phrase ""North Star"" to mean a constant guide that helps them stay on track, even when things change.The quote also says that not all choices are the same. Some choices are easy to make and don't have much risk. Some people need to make decisions, take responsibility, and deal with the consequences. Cook's words show that sometimes you have to make hard choices, even if they are hard to make. You might start to doubt yourself or your confidence. But having clear values helps people steadily get through these times.The quote says that instead of avoiding hard decisions, you should face them with honesty and purpose. It shows a style of leadership where giving orders is more important than making things easy.Cook has made decisions that are in line with the values he often talks about in public during his time at Apple. One example is that Apple has always been very clear about how important user privacy is to them, even when it meant going against what other people wanted. The company's investments in renewable energy and efforts to cut down on carbon emissions also show that they are committed to the long term, not just the short term.In speeches and interviews, Cook has said that being a leader means making decisions that aren't always popular but are necessary. His quote is like these actions, showing that he does what he says he will do.You can use the ideas in this quote in more than just business or leadership roles.People can make choices that feel more meaningful and stable over time if they focus on the long term instead of the short term.People often pay attention to what Tim Cook says because he connects leadership to personal responsibility. He doesn't just talk about success; he also talks about values, direction, and being careful when you take action. His words help us think about how to make choices in a world where people are always making them.The quote reminds us that we should not seek approval from others to find clarity. This is done by focusing on values and dedication. It stresses that knowing what really matters is the first step to real progress in your personal or professional life.Tim Cook has shared several statements that reflect his views on leadership, responsibility, and purpose. Some of his widely quoted remarks include:","Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, has said many times how important it is to stay grounded, especially when you're in charge of one of the world's most powerful tech companies. In this quote, Cook talks about values, commitment, and what he calls a ""North Star,"" which is a guiding principle that helps people stay on track.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128303562,imgsize-25772,width-400,resizemode-4/apple-ceo-tim-cook.jpg"

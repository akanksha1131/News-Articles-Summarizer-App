One of the world's richest techies 'forced' to rename yacht after told the name's 'embarrassing meaning',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/one-of-the-worlds-richest-techie-forced-to-rename-yacht-after-told-the-names-embarrassing-meaning/articleshow/126591194.cms,"Larry Ellison's Yacht name change draws attention

Larry Ellison’s Yacht name change sparks conversation online





Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, one of the wealthiest people in the technology industry, had named his 191-foot yacht “Izanami,” a reference to a Japanese Shinto deity associated with creation and death. However, the name was later dropped after Ellison was informed that when spelled in reverse, it reads “I’m a Nazi,” a phrase widely considered offensive. The incident was detailed in a profile published by Vulture. Following this discovery, the yacht’s name was changed, the report said.According to the report, Larry Ellison purchased the yacht after investing tens of millions of dollars in a Florida safari park. The vessel is smaller than his earlier 288-foot yacht but remains one of the largest privately owned yachts in the world.The name “Izanami” was chosen for its mythological meaning, but the reversed spelling led to concerns once the issue was pointed out.Larry Ellison reportedly has strong personal and business ties to Israel. His first wife previously described him as “an ardent Zionist”. The Vulture report noted that he has been close to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The yacht name incident gained attention on social media after details from the profile circulated online. As per the report, some users compared the episode to fictional portrayals of wealthy families in popular television dramas.“This is straight out of Succession,” podcast host Rob Pasbani wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).Other users reacted with frustration over repeated reports about the personal lives of billionaires. “I am so tired, y’all,” one Reddit user wrote in response to the story. Another commented, “‘Reality’ is just too on the nose.”Ellison, 80, co-founded Oracle in 1977 and remains one of its largest shareholders. His son, David Ellison, is currently involved in the media industry and is expected to take a leadership role at Paramount Skydance later this year, according to earlier reports.","Ellison named his 191-foot yacht “Izanami,” a reference to a Japanese Shinto deity associated with creation and death.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already shaping daily life, often quietly. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more.In his latest annual letter,, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education. Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks.For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Bill Gates says AI will reshape society and jobs faster than most people expect.

"Quote of the day by Jensen Huang: “I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-jensen-huang-i-very-seldom-fire-people-id-rather-torture-them-to-greatness/articleshow/126489810.cms,"NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang

“I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness.”

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's leadership philosophy on firing and performance



How NVIDIA’s work culture reflects Jensen Huang’s management style



Why Jensen Huang believes discomfort leads to growth



How employees and observers interpret the quote



What Jensen Huang’s quote really says about leadership







When NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang talks about leadership, he doesn’t reach for the usual corporate language. One of his more striking lines is,It sounds odd at first. A boss talking about “torture” rarely lands in polite conversation. But the meaning becomes clearer when you look at how Huang explains what he actually does with his teams. He doesn’t mean cruelty. He means pushing people to grow, learn, and reach a point they might not reach on their own. It’s a style of leadership rooted in belief rather than abandonment. Huang has said he prefers to help people improve instead of simply letting them go when things get tough. He frames this as a belief in potential, a view grounded in his own journey from humble beginnings to the helm of a global tech giant.This quote taps into a broader discussion happening in workplaces today about talent, resilience, and how leaders cultivate performance. Huang’s words are often described as tongue in cheek, yet they point to a real approach many executives wrestle with: should you cut losses and fire someone who’s struggling, or invest time and effort in helping them rise? In Huang’s view, that investment can pay off in unexpected ways.Huang has repeatedly said that firing is not his first instinct. He sees it as a last step, not an early one. In interviews, he has explained that when someone is underperforming, the more important question is why. Is the role wrong? Is the support missing? Is the feedback unclear? His response is usually to lean in, not step away.That approach has shaped NVIDIA’s internal culture. Expectations are high. Feedback is direct. People are expected to learn fast and adapt. Huang believes that struggling inside a demanding environment often teaches more than being comfortable in an easier one. His quote about “torture” reflects that belief. It is about sustained challenge, not humiliation or fear.He has also said that if he hires someone, it means he already believes in their potential. Walking away from that too easily would mean questioning his own judgment. So instead, he stays engaged and pushes for improvement.NVIDIA is widely known as a demanding place to work. Employees have described long hours, intense deadlines, and constant pressure to deliver. At the same time, many stay for years. Compensation, stock rewards, and the chance to work on cutting-edge technology all play a role.Huang’s leadership style is closely tied to that environment. He has said that meaningful work is rarely easy. Progress, especially in advanced computing and artificial intelligence, comes from sustained effort and repeated failure. Teams are expected to confront problems directly, not avoid them.This is where the quote often gets misunderstood. Huang is not celebrating burnout. He is describing a belief that growth happens under pressure, and that leaders should help people through that pressure instead of replacing them at the first sign of difficulty.Huang has spoken openly about discomfort being a teacher. He believes that moments of frustration often come right before breakthroughs. If leaders remove pressure too soon, they may also remove the chance for real learning.In his view, coaching is not about being gentle all the time. It is about being honest. That can mean telling someone their work is not good enough, then staying with them while they fix it. It can mean repeating feedback until it finally lands. That process is hard. For both sides.The phrase “torture them to greatness” sticks because it captures that tension. Growth is rarely smooth. It usually involves moments when quitting feels easier. Huang believes leaders should not make quitting the default option.Reactions to Huang’s words are mixed. Some admire the clarity. Others question whether this level of pressure works for everyone. That debate is common in tech, especially in companies growing as fast as NVIDIA has in recent years.What is clear is that Huang’s quote reflects how he actually operates. NVIDIA’s rise as a dominant force in AI and computing did not happen through cautious leadership. It came from aggressive goals, constant iteration, and teams pushed to deliver more than they thought possible.At its core, this quote is not about suffering. It is about commitment. Huang is saying that he would rather invest time, energy, and effort into developing people than discard them quickly. That choice comes with pressure, discomfort, and high expectations. But it also comes with trust.Not every leader works this way. Not every workplace should. But in Huang’s case, the words align closely with the results and the culture he has built. The quote stands out because it is unpolished, honest, and a little unsettling. Which is often how real leadership conversations sound when they are not filtered for comfort.","Jensen Huang, CEO of tech giant NVIDIA, said he would rather torture people than fire them.

Billionaire Mark Cuban has a ‘success tip’ for students





American billionaire investor Mark Cuban has now issued a stark warning for business leaders about the risks and opportunities of artificial intelligence. Along with this, Cuban has also cautioned that while AI can transform companies, its careless use could expose valuable intellectual property. Speaking during a call with Clipbook founder Adam Joseph, Cuban said that the growth of AI will lead to the creation of “two types of companies: those who are great at AI, and everybody else.” He believed that the companies failing to embrace AI are “doomed to failure” as the technology reshapes industries.Cuban further described AI as ‘stupid’ but likened it to a savant which ‘remembers everything’. He also emphasised that while AI tools can deliver immense benefits, but they are also prone to errors and overconfidence, making it critical for executives to understand the nuances between different platforms rather than trading them as interchangeable.As per Cuban, the misuse of AI could turn a powerful tool into a costly distraction. He also warned the CEOs against indiscriminately sharing proprietary work online, noting that web-scraping chatbots could inadvertently absorb and lead sensitive data. Protecting intellectual property, he said, must be a top priority in the AI era.Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations. He pointed out that businesses often underestimate the potential risk of falling behind.Along with this, he also urged the leaders to adopt AI strategically and combine technological foresight with strong governance and data protection.Recently, Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions”. However, he said that students should not rely much on AI. Instead, they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results,” he said adding “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”.In an interview with CNBC’s Make It last year, Cuban said that tomorrow’s leaders might be today’s AI-obsessed kids. “Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that’s needed in the future workplace,” he said adding: “Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.”",Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations.

How Google founders 'dumping' California 'looks similar' to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos leaving the city he called 'his home' for 30 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-founders-dumping-california-looks-similar-to-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-leaving-the-city-he-called-his-home-for-30-years/articleshow/126498943.cms,"Jeff Bezos often points out that long-term success comes from staying committed to an idea while remaining open to changing the approach.

When Jeff Bezos left Seattle

What is California’s Billionaire's tax





It's almost official that Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have cut ties with California. The two Google Guys have reportedly said Bye to California; joining the billionaires who have left the state, shifting businesses and houses. Page is worth around $270 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. According to a report in Wall Street Journal, Larry Page has bought two massive Miami estates for a combined $173.4 million. The report quotes people familiar with the situation Google co-founder Sergey Brin is also said to be in discussions to purchase a Miami home, according to people familiar with the situation.Some analysts have termed Google founders' move to leave California strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos ’ relocation playbook. According to them, the timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look quite like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But the big difference here is that Jeff Bezos did not leave California. Amazon founder left Seattle, the city where he started the online bookseller that grew into the global tech giant, Amazon.In 2024, Bezos announced on Instagram that he was leaving Seattle after nearly 30 years to move to Miami. He said that the move was to be closer to his parents and his rocket launches at Blue Origin. In his Instagram post, Bezos called Seattle his home since 1994.However, the timing, as some analysts pointed out, also suggested another reason: Taxes. In 2022 Washington state imposed a new, 7% capital gains tax on sales of stocks or bonds of more than $250,000. As Washington state does not have a personal income tax, so the new levy marked the first time that Bezos would face state taxes on his stock sales. As reported by CNBC, in 2022, when the Washington state's Capital gains tax took effect, Bezos stopped selling. He didn’t sell any Amazon stock in 2022 or 2023, gifting only $200 million of shares at the end of that year.After his move to Miami, Bezos reportedly made up for lost time. Quoting an SEC filing, the report says that Bezos launched a pre-scheduled stock-selling plan to unload 50 million shares before January 31, 2025. And since Florida has no state income tax or a tax on capital gains, so on the $2 billion sale that Bezos made, he saved $140 million that he would have paid to Washington state. On the entire sale of 50 million shares over the next year, he saved more than at least 600 million.California’s proposed ballot initiative has been proposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West to offset federal budget cuts that will affect California’s health care system. It would impose a one-time, 5% tax on the assets of billionaires. The tax would retroactively apply to those who were California residents as of January 1, 2026. In December 2025, venture capitalist Peter Thiel announced that he opened an office for his family investment company in Miami. Donald Trump's AI czar David Sacks unveiled a new office for his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in Austin, Texas.","Larry Page has bought two massive Miami estates for a combined $173.4 million.

As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Trump previously threatened of 100% tariff on chips that are not made in the US

Trump govt wants 25% 'cut' on the sale of Nvidia AI chips





The United States Commerce Department’s decision to impose a 25% national security tariff on certain high-end semiconductors is only the “phase one” step, a White House official said. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the move, announced earlier this week is being described as a “phase one” action aimed at protecting the US semiconductor sector.Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said further announcements could follow after talks with other countries and companies. The comments suggest that the tariff policy may expand depending on how negotiations progress.The report said the tariff is part of broader efforts by President Donald Trump to strengthen domestic chip manufacturing. The official noted that Trump has earlier warned of much higher duties (up to 100%) on chips produced outside the United States. In previous statements, Trump had said tariffs could go as high as 100% on semiconductors that are not made in the U.S.The administration has repeatedly said that semiconductors are a matter of national security, given their role in defence systems, artificial intelligence, consumer electronics and industrial equipment.The new tariff applies to selected high-end chips, though details on affected products and companies were not immediately disclosed.Reuters reported that the White House sees the current tariff as an opening measure rather than a final decision. Any additional steps would depend on discussions with trade partners and industry players.In a recent news, Trump announced that his administration will now allow Nvidia’s H200 AI chips to be sold to China, but only under strict conditions including a 25% government cut on sales and export caps designed to protect US supply. For those unaware, H200 is part of Nvidia’s Hopper generation which is a hit-performance chip sold in the US and other global makers. Unlike the earlier H20 chip, which was specifically slowed down for export, the H200 is not a China-only design.Trump has acknowledged that the H200 has already surpassed by Nvidia’s newer Blackwell and Rubin chips, but said the US would still benefit financially, “It’s not the highest level, but it’s a pretty good level, and China wants them and other people want them — and we’re going to be making 25% on the sale of those chips, basically.”","The move is being described as a ‘phase one’ action aimed at protecting the US semiconductor sector.

Why Japan investigation may be problem for X





Japan has become the latest country to launch a formal investigation into X’s Grok after the AI chatbot generated non-consensual sexualised photos. Economic security minister Kimi Onoda announced on Friday (January 16) that the cabinet office has officially demanded that Elon Musk ’s social media platform strengthen its safeguards. xAI, the company behind Grok, is already facing similar probes in the UK, Canada and the European Union.According to news agency Reuters, Onoda said at a press conference that Japanese officials have submitted written questions to X, focusing on the platform's ability to prevent deepfakes that violate privacy and intellectual property rights. She suggested that even though xAI has disabled the ability for users to create sexualised photos of real people, the current measures may not go far enough.“All possibilities, including legal steps, are on the table if there is no improvement,” said Onoda, who also issued a stern warning to the broader tech industry, adding, “If similar problems occur on other platforms, we will also act.”Countries like Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia have banned the platform, while the EU and individual member states like France are investigating whether the Grok has violate people’s right. The comments from Tokyo, however, carry significant weight because Japan remains X’s largest overseas market.Soon after scrutiny, X announced that it has moved the ability to generate photos behind a paywall but Onoda said Japan may seek further measures from xAI.“It’s a problem that people can still create such images,” Onoda said, maintaining a nuanced stance on the technology itself.“If a knife is lying there, do you use it to cook or to hurt someone?” she asked, suggesting that the government’s focus is on the misuse of the tool rather than the AI itself.","Japan has become the latest country to launch a formal investigation into X’s Grok.

“When we buy the studio, we'll be releasing more movies together than we were separately. Our forecast is to grow the content spend of the combined companies several years out.

So it's really good news for the town that we're going to continue to grow the business.”

Donald Trump Attacks $72B Netflix–WBD Deal, Demands CNN Be ‘Sold Or Included’ In Mega Merger

Why Netflix's co-CEO thinks Paramount taking over Warner Bros can be bad for the industry

“On the Paramount side, between the $3 billion that they’ve already cut and the $6 billion they’re proposing, those are real jobs. That’s cutting back on production. That endless search for profit by cutting people, jobs and making fewer movies — that’s not our intention at all.

We need all those movies. We need all those TV shows.”

“If you take a beat and think about who’s been building and who’s been collapsing, it’s the best news possible,”

What Ted Sarandos said about criticism Netflix faced after announcing the Warner Bros deal

“I think it was a lot of loud voices, but not necessarily a lot of them.

I think a lot of it was folks who questioned, rightfully so, our intent with theatrical because we hadn’t said anything about it. A lot of it was the emotions around that more than anything else.”

“I honestly think there would have been reactions like that from anyone who was going to do the deal. What people would like to see is no deal. But that’s not possible.

There are two outcomes of this deal, and we have a signed deal.”

“Reed’s more in the build vs. buy mode. In total, Reed is not an enthusiast about these kinds of deals, but he was very supportive of it.”

“We’ve never been buyers — we’ve always been builders. I’ve said that pretty proudly. And it’s true. Once the company was in play, it would have been reckless for us not to look at it. The opportunity to get into the books and understand the business model better, and what we saw there was that there’s a real there there for us. Their products would work better in our business model, and our business model would work better with their products in it.

And that was very telling for us. We had a lot of assumptions that weren’t necessarily true,”

Italy regulator criticises parental controls







Italy’s competition watchdog has announced that it has opened two investigations into Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard unit. AGCM has alleged that the gaming giant used “misleading and aggressive” practices to drive in-app purchases in its hit mobile titles: Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty: Mobile. These are considered as two of the industry's most lucrative free-to-play franchises. Regulators argue that the company’s tactics may violate consumer protection laws as they may foster gambling-like behaviours.According to news agency Reuters, the AGCM said that the Activision Blizzard division was “operating in a manner that violates consumer protection legislation and, in particular, the professional diligence required in a sector highly sensitive to the risks of developing gambling addiction.”The regulator expressed concern over the use of push notifications and in-app messages that allegedly pressure players to buy extra content both during and outside of active gameplay. A primary focus of the investigation is the use of virtual currencies, which the watchdog claims can obscure the true cost of items.“The use of virtual currencies could lead gamers, including minors, into spending significant sums, even more than those necessary to progress in the game, without fully realising it,” the regulator stated.These currencies are often purchased with real money and are a staple of the mobile gaming economy. However, they have drawn the ire of European regulators.Beyond the currency and sale tactics, the AGCM criticised Activision’s default settings and legal transparency. The regulator claims default parental controls options are insufficient for protecting young players. When it comes to hidden waivers, the information on contractual rights is allegedly presented in a way that leads players to “unknowingly waive” their legal protections.The probe also highlighted a lack of recourse for players whose accounts are blocked, which can result in the loss of “substantial” investments in digital content.",Italy's competition watchdog has announced that it has opened two investigations into Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard unit.

TikTok has said that it will begin deploying advanced age-detection technology across Europe in the coming weeks but has warned that by using this tech will compromise users’ privacy, a report has said. The move comes as a response to regulatory pressure to deactivate accounts of users who are under the age of 13.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the system has been under a pilot programme for a year, and essentially moves away from previous process of self-reporting. The technology will utilise an AI-driven behavioural analysis engine to flag accounts that appear to belong to children under age of 13.TikTok said that the accounts flagged by the technology will be reviewed by moderators and will not be automatically banned.TikTok, however, warned that despite extensive efforts, there is no globally agreed way to confirm a person’s age while preserving privacy. For appeals against bans, the company said that it will use facial-age estimation from verification provider Yoti. These will be along with credit-card checks and government-issued identification.

Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan has ‘hiring’ advice for companies: ‘I learned this the hard way…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/y-combinator-ceo-garry-tan-has-hiring-advice-for-companies-i-learned-this-the-hard-way/articleshow/126565150.cms,"Why Garry Tan wants founders to ‘hire out of pain’

Garry Tan’s warning to students





Garry Tan, the CEO of Y Combinator, has an advice for companies: hire only when you face acute operational pain not because you think you need someone in the future. Tan said that he has learned from both venture capitalists and founders that hiring during operational stress will help companies better define roles and avoid mismatched hires.“Hire out of pain. Don't hire because you think you'll need someone soon or maybe sometime later. Wait until you or your team are actually hurting: working weekends, missing family dinners, dropping balls. That pain is the signal that the role is real,” he said.Tan said that he he “learned this the hard way after watching founders (including myself) hire ahead of need and end up with people in roles that weren't fully formed yet”.According to Tan, the right time to post a job is when the current team is reaching a breaking point which makes the hiring process successful because the new hire will know you’ll back them up.“When you hire out of pain, you know exactly what the job is because you've been doing it yourself. You can evaluate performance because you know what good looks like. And the new hire knows you'll step back in if they fail, because you were just doing it last week,” he pointed out.Last year, Tan warned engineering and business college students, criticising unnamed university entrepreneurship courses. He suggested that they may be fostering an environment where students feel encouraged to bend the truth in their pursuit of startup success.Garry Tan referenced tech founders Sam Bankman-Fried (FTX) and Elizabeth Holmes (Theranos), both convicted for fraud and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. He warned the students that who follow the path of exaggerating traction (like these founders), misleading investors, or fabricating product capabilities they have the risk of ending in jail.","Garry Tan, CEO of Y Combinator, has an advice for companies: hire only when you face acute operational pain not because you need someone in the future.

The Elon Musk and Donald Trump connection

Ross Gerber calls Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) system ‘problematic’





Tesla Bull and investor Ross Gerber is once again criticising Tesla CEO Elon Musk . This time Gerber has targeted the close relationship between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump . Gerber points out Musk’s close relationship with President Donald Trump as a factor in what he calls the “mess” surrounding America’s electric vehicle (EV) rollout. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Gerber accused Musk of being “personally partially responsible” for slowing the US transition to sustainable transportation.“Meanwhile Elon is personally partially responsible for now DECELERATING the transition to sustainable transportation and energy, at least in the US."" - I think this capsulizes many people's thoughts on tesla/elon. $tsla ,” wrote Gerber.He also feels that the political ties of Elon Musk have contributed to the rollback pf EV momentum in the US.Elon Musk donated more than $250 million to Trump’s 2024 campaign, playing a key role in securing his second term. Since returning to office, Trump has rolled back several clean energy initiatives, claiming to end Joe Biden’s “war on internal combustion engines.” His administration has introduced policies that critics say weaken EV adoption while strengthening traditional auto manufacturing.Gerber argues Musk’s alignment with Trump has undermined Tesla’s mission of accelerating sustainable energy, even as the company continues to expand globally.Ross Gerber recently criticised CEO Elon Musk’s claims about its car company’s autonomous driving ambitions. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Gerber accused Musk of making ‘hallucinations’ during conference calls that fail to materialise, pointing Tesla’s missed goal of launching driverless Robotaxis by the end of 2025.Gerber emphasised that Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system remains ‘problematic’, despite offering Level 2 autonomy. While he previously praised improvements in the software, he has since highlighted persistent issues. “The robotaxis are still just Ubers. The robot is far from working. Car sales are falling,” Gerber wrote, adding that Tesla’s lofty valuation — with a price‑to‑earnings ratio near 300 — is unsustainable.",Ross Gerber calls Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) system ‘problematic’ Tesla Bull and investor Ross Gerber is once again criticising Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

How these online shopping sites violated laws by selling walkie-talkies

""100 per cent legal""

""license-free.""

""Intermediary protections are conditional upon the exercise of effective due diligence and do not extend to situations where platforms permit products to be listed or advertised without mandatory statutory disclosures,""

Such interference can disrupt essential operations and compromise communications vital to public order and national security,""





Facebook-parent Meta, Amazon, Flipkart, among online shopping sites facing 44 lakh fine for selling illegal walkie-talkies in India The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has reportedly imposed penalties totalling Rs 44 lakh on eight e-commerce platforms. The list of online shopping platforms includes Amazon, Flipkart, Meta (the parent company of Facebook), Meesho, and others, which are listing and selling unauthorised walkie-talkies in violation of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, and telecom laws.According to a PTI report, Consumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare said the authority imposed penalties of Rs 10 lakh each on Meesho, Meta (for Facebook Marketplace), Flipkart, and Amazon.Meanwhile, a penalty of Rs 1 lakh each was also imposed on Chimiya, JioMart, Talk Pro, and MaskMan Toys for violations of consumer rights, misleading advertisements, and unfair trade practices.First, a notice was issued to 13 e-commerce platforms based on the discovery of more than 16,970 non-compliant product listings. In its assessment, CCPA determined that e-commerce platforms facilitated consumers in buying Personal Mobile Radios that operated outside the licence-free frequency band without Equipment Type Approval or adequate information about licensing.Khare noted that Meesho, Meta, Chimiya, JioMart, and Talk Pro have already paid their penalties. Meanwhile, payments from the remaining platforms are still awaited.Under current regulations, a license exemption applies only to PMRs operating strictly in the 446.0-446.2 MHz band. Rule 5 of the Use of Low Power and Very Low Power Short Range Radio Frequency Devices Rules, 2018, requires that manufacturers and sellers obtain an ETA before importing, selling, or operating such devices.On Flipkart, the number of units that were sold was 65,931. The frequency was either left blank or outside the required range. Additionally, 42,275 units were sold with the required frequency displayed. On Amazon, 2,602 units were sold between January 2023 and May 2025. There were 467 product listings that had inadequate frequency or certification information.Meesho recorded 2,209 units from a single seller, but most sellers did not provide ETA certification or frequency information.JioMart sold 58 units over two years without clear licensing requirements, while Facebook Marketplace had 710 listings removed following a CCPA action.In the case of Facebook Marketplace, the CCPA found walkie-talkies were listed without information about licensing requirements, frequency details, or ETA/WPC certification. Despite removing listings after notices, the platform allowed repeated listing of regulated devices without proper safety measures.The authority said that platforms must exercise proper care based on their size and technology capability, with 710 listings removed following action. Talk Pro (Iconet Services Pvt Ltd) was found listing devices operating across the UHF band 400-1200 MHz, while falsely claiming they wereandSeveral platforms tried to claim intermediary status to avoid responsibility for third-party listings. The CCPA rejected this defence, saying that platforms that help with listing, hosting, finding, and promoting regulated products cannot be treated as passive channels.the authority stated.Following appropriate consultation with the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Home Affairs, the CCPA has published guidelines for the Prevention and Regulation of Illegal Listing and Sale of Radio Equipment, including Walkie-Talkies, on E-Commerce Platforms, 2025, in order to strengthen the sense of platform responsibility.These include showing frequency compliance, the ETA's pre-listing certification, disclosing licensing obligations, the ban on misleading advertisements, and the use of automated monitoring and removal systems.The CCPA directed major e-commerce platforms to conduct self-audits to ensure such violations through misleading listings are not common, publish audit certificates online, and strengthen pre-listing compliance systems to ensure no radio equipment requiring legal approval is listed without full legal compliance.The CCPA warned that unauthorised radio communication devices can cause harmful interference with important national communication networks, including those used by law enforcement, disaster response authorities, and emergency services.the authority said, adding that consumers rely heavily on online descriptions while shopping and the sale of non-compliant devices exposes them to regulatory risks.Five matters involving Antriksh Technologies, IndiaMart, Tradeindia.com, Vardaanmart, and Krishna Mart remain at various stages of investigation or hearing.​","Facebook-parent Meta, Amazon, Flipkart, among online shopping sites facing 44 lakh fine for selling illegal walkie-talkies in India.

Google's TranslateGemma offers open-source translation across 55 languages in three sizes. The 12B model outperforms the larger 27B baseline while using half the computing power, enabling local translation on laptops. The 4B version runs on smartphones. Models were trained using Gemini-generated data and reinforcement learning. They inherited multimodal capabilities, translating text within images. Available now on Kaggle and Hugging Face.

Training process combines human translations with Gemini-generated data

Models can translate text in images without extra training





Google released TranslateGemma, a set of open-source translation models that work across 55 languages. The collection comes in three sizes—4B, 12B, and 27B parameters—designed to run on different devices from smartphones to cloud servers.The 12B model outperforms Google's 27B baseline on the WMT24++ benchmark while using less than half the computing power. For developers, this means you can run quality translation locally on a laptop instead of routing everything through cloud APIs. The 4B version matches the 12B baseline's performance, making it practical for mobile apps that need offline translation.Google built these models by fine-tuning Gemma 3 on a dataset that mixes human translations and synthetic text from Gemini.A second training phase used reinforcement learning with metrics like MetricX-QE and AutoMQM to improve how natural the translations sound.The models cover major languages like Spanish, French, and Mandarin, plus several low-resource options. Google also trained them on nearly 500 additional language pairs, though those haven't been formally tested yet. Testing showed reduced error rates across all 55 core languages compared to the base Gemma models.TranslateGemma inherited the multimodal capabilities from Gemma 3. Testing on the Vistra benchmark shows the models can translate text within images—useful for signs, menus, or document photos. Google didn't specifically train for this feature during development.The models are available on Kaggle and Hugging Face. The 4B version runs on mobile devices, the 12B fits on consumer laptops, and the 27B needs a single H100 GPU for cloud deployment.","Google's TranslateGemma offers open-source translation across 55 languages in three sizes.

Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI gets a trial date

Allegations against OpenAI

OpenAI denies Musk’s allegations





Market commentator and CNBC host Jim Cramer has said that Elon Musk ’s lawsuit against ChatGPT maker OpenAI is not a “good one” for the company. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Cramer wrote that the legal case could become a major issue for OpenAI, especially if the company plans to go public in the future. “This Musk suit against OpenAI is the real deal..and not a good one for OpenAI if and when it wants to go public. It needs to do a private round at a big valuation ahead of the trial. Musk has unlimited firepower,” he wrote in the post.Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 and left the organisation in 2018, is currently suing the company and CEO Sam Altman over what he claims is a shift away from OpenAI’s original non-profit mission.The lawsuit, originally filed in 2024 is now officially headed to trial this spring. During a court hearing earlier this month to consider whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant a jury trial, US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that there was “plenty of evidence”.In a latest, Rogers has set jury selection for April 27, with proceedings starting the following day. As per court filings, the trial is said to last up to four weeks, through May 22.In the 2024 lawsuit, Musk alleges that OpenAI has strayed from its original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity and instead prioritised commercial interests. He further claims that the company’s partnership with software giant Microsoft resulted in significant funding and resources for the company, which is a breach of the company's founding contract.“After Musk lent his name to the venture, invested significant time, tens of millions of dollars in seed capital, and recruited top Al scientists for OpenAI, Inc., Musk and the non-profit's namesake objective were betrayed by Altman and his accomplices. The perfidy and deceit are of Shakespearean proportions,” the lawsuit claimed.“Once OpenAI, Inc.'s technology approached transformative AGI, Altman flipped the narrative and proceeded to cash in,” it added.OpenAI has denied Elon Musk’s allegations. An OpenAI spokesperson previously told Business Insider “Mr Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial”, adding “We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.”","Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI is heading to trial this spring.

The move, alongside two other former colleagues, follows a reported amicable split, with OpenAI stating they ""do not share"" concerns about misconduct. This represents a significant blow to Thinking Machines' ambitious plans.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

The messy truth behind a very public split

Thinking Machines loses its third co-founder in months





Barret Zoph's Wednesday went from career disaster to triumphant return in under an hour. The Thinking Machines Lab co-founder was fired by CEO Mira Murati, only to be welcomed back at OpenAI—where he'd worked before—just 58 minutes later.Murati's terse announcement that she had ""parted ways"" with Zoph barely hit social media before OpenAI 's Fidji Simo posted her own update: Zoph was rejoining the ChatGPT-maker, along with fellow Thinking Machines co-founder Luke Metz and researcher Sam Schoenholz. Simo told staff the move had been weeks in the making, with Zoph telling Murati on Monday he was thinking of leaving, according to Information.What really happened depends on who you ask. Sources told Wired that Thinking Machines fired Zoph for ""unethical conduct,"" including allegations he leaked confidential information to competitors.The startup's leadership reportedly lost trust in him after an earlier incident last year that soured his relationship with Murati, UDN reported.But OpenAI isn't buying it. In her internal memo, Simo dismissed concerns about Zoph's ethics entirely. She framed the departure differently: Zoph wanted out, Murati fired him Wednesday, and OpenAI swooped in. The timing raises eyebrows—Thinking Machines allegedly discovered the information-sharing concerns around the same time they learned about his OpenAI return.For Murati's startup, this stings. Thinking Machines raised $2 billion at a $12 billion valuation less than a year ago, positioning itself as a serious OpenAI rival. Now it's lost three of its four co-founders. Andrew Tulloch jumped to Meta in November, and with Zoph and Metz gone, only Murati remains from the original team.She's handed the CTO role to Soumith Chintala, a respected AI veteran. But losing your technical co-founders—especially one who led OpenAI's post-training teams and another who worked on ChatGPT and the o1 model—is a blow no press release can spin away. Bloomberg reports at least two more Thinking Machines staffers are OpenAI-bound.The whole saga feels distinctly familiar. Murati herself was central to Sam Altman's chaotic 2023 ouster from OpenAI. Now she's on the other side of the drama, watching her company hemorrhage talent to her former employer.","Thinking Machines Lab co-founder Barret Zoph returned to OpenAI just 58 minutes after his exit was announced.

""Irina's expertise in scaling technology businesses and driving enterprise transformation makes her the ideal leader as we expand. As we grow our teams and deepen engagement across India’s public and private sectors, Irina will ensure our approach is grounded in local insight and aligned with our mission.”

“India has a real opportunity to shape how AI is built and deployed at scale. Indian organisations are moving beyond experimentation toward applied AI, where trust, safety, and long-term impact matter as much as innovation. Anthropic’s mission resonates with my belief that technology should empower people, expand access, and create lasting value across India’s diverse languages and communities.”





Anthropic has appointed former Microsoft India Managing Director Irina Ghose as its first Managing Director for India. The appointment comes as the AI startup prepares to establish its first physical office in Bengaluru in early 2026. Ghose, who has three decades of experience in the technology industry, will now be responsible for Anthropic’s regional operations.Ghoshe’s role at Microsoft involved leading the adoption of enterprise AI across key Indian sectors, including banking and financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and government. During her stint at the software behemoth, she worked on building ecosystem partnerships and capabilities in the Indian technology ecosystem, focusing on leveraging technology to create business and societal impact.Anthropic has announced that its India team will work closely with policymakers and academic institutions, strengthen developer engagement, and build partnerships with enterprises and organisations using AI to address local challenges.The company said India ranks second globally in the use of its Claude AI tool.

While Chinese companies rapidly close the gap, Hassabis wonders if they can innovate groundbreaking technologies like the transformer architecture.

Evidence of China’s progress in AI race

Catching up vs innovating

Challenges ahead for China





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has now challenged the prevailing views in the US about China’s artificial intelligence capabilities. Hassabis believes that Chinese AI models are now only ‘a matter of months’ behind Western systems. Speaking at CNBC’s new podcast The Tech Download, Hassabis said China’s progress has been underestimated, “Maybe they’re only a matter of months behind at this point,” he noted, adding that just one or two years ago, many believed China was far further back. The comments made by the Google DeepMind CEO run counter to the widespread assumptions in Washington and Silicon Valley that China lags significantly behind in AI development.Chinese AI lab, DeepSeek shocked the markets last year by introducing a model which performed strongly despite using less-advanced chips. On the other hand tech giants like Alibaba and startups like Moonshot AI and Zhipu have since released competitive models. Also, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has also credited China’s progress, saying the US is ‘not far ahead’ of China in the AI race.Hassabis has acknowledged China’s ability to catch up but also questioned whether its firms can deliver frontier breakthroughs.“They’ve shown they can catch up … and be very close to the frontier. But can they actually innovate something new, like a new transformer … that gets beyond the frontier? I don’t think that’s been shown yet.”The transformer architecture introduced by Google researchers in 2016, underlings today’s large language models which include OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.Hassabis also emphiased on the fact that China may face both cultural and technical challenges. “To invent something is about 100 times harder than it is to copy it. That’s the next frontier really, and I haven’t seen evidence of that yet.”He compared DeepMind’s approach to a “modern-day Bell Labs,” emphasizing exploratory innovation rather than scaling existing methods.China’s AI industry faces hurdles:* U.S. export bans restrict access to Nvidia’s most advanced chips.* The White House recently approved sales of Nvidia’s H200 chip to China, but it is not top-of-the-line.* Domestic chipmakers like Huawei are trying to fill the gap but still lag behind.Analysts warn that over time, superior U.S. infrastructure could widen the gap again. Richard Clode of Janus Henderson told CNBC that current Chinese AI strength may represent “peak relative capability” versus the US.","Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, says China is only a few months behind Western developments in AI.

AI is 'stupid' but remembers everything

Protect your intellectual property or lose it





Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has a stark warning for business leaders: embrace AI the right way, or prepare to fail. Speaking on a call with Clipbook founder Adam Joseph, whose startup secured a seven-figure investment from Cuban, the ""Shark Tank"" star outlined how companies can succeed or stumble in the AI era.""There's going to be two types of companies: those who are great at AI, and everybody else,"" Cuban said, according to Business Insider. ""And the 'everybody else' is going to fail because AI is such a transformative tool."" The celebrity entrepreneur stressed that CEOs need to understand every nuance of new AI tools as they emerge, rather than treating them as interchangeable solutions.Cuban offered a paradoxical take on artificial intelligence itself.""AI is stupid,"" he said. ""But it's somebody who's a savant that remembers everything."" He compared AI chatbots to people with photographic memories—capable of instantly recalling and processing massive amounts of information, but not necessarily understanding context or creativity.Despite the technology being around for years, Cuban believes we're still ""in the first inning of the first preseason game"" of the AI revolution.He cautioned that businesses misusing AI could turn helpful tools into expensive distractions, particularly when employees use standard versions like ChatGPT that might compromise sensitive company information.The billionaire also warned about intellectual property risks in the AI age. Companies that previously posted everything online to showcase expertise must now be careful, as web-scraping chatbots can harvest that data for free. ""Companies are learning now that their IP is incredibly valuable,"" Cuban told Joseph, according to Yahoo Finance.Cuban emphasized that in an AI-driven world, data and information have become more valuable than gold or oil. Academics and researchers must also rethink the traditional ""publish or perish"" mindset, he added, since sharing findings openly could simply train competitors' AI models. At SXSW, Cuban reinforced that AI should amplify existing skills, not replace human judgment and creativity.","Mark Cuban says businesses must master AI or face failure.

"CEO of world’s biggest chipmaker warns America’s ‘favourite’ Intel: You do not worry us, as we have...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ceo-of-worlds-biggest-chipmaker-warns-americas-favourite-intel-you-do-not-worry-us-as-we-have-/articleshow/126560777.cms,"TSMC's CEO C.C. Wei asserts that massive investment alone won't guarantee competitiveness in chip manufacturing, highlighting TSMC's 37 years of perfected production and scale. Despite Intel Foundry's recent gains and significant funding, TSMC's blockbuster earnings and expansion plans underscore its continued dominance in the advanced chip market, even as capacity constraints create opportunities for rivals.

Why TSMC believes it has the edge over rivals

Capacity crunch opens doors for Intel and Samsung





TSMC chief executive C.C. Wei just told Intel Foundry what many in the semiconductor industry have been thinking: throwing billions at chip manufacturing won't automatically make you competitive. The blunt assessment came as Taiwan's chip giant posted blockbuster earnings that explain why it's not exactly shaking in its boots.The world's largest contract chipmaker reported fourth-quarter net profit of NT$505.74 billion ($16 billion), up 35% from last year and well above analyst expectations. Revenue climbed to NT$1.046 trillion for the quarter, pushing the full-year total to NT$3.809 trillion. These aren't just good numbers—they're a statement about who still runs the advanced chip game.Wei's pointed comments weren't unprovoked. Intel Foundry has been making noise lately, securing $8.9 billion from the Trump administration and drawing commitments from Nvidia and SoftBank. The company's 18A process technology has shown real progress, successfully producing Panther Lake chips and reportedly catching the eye of Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm for potential future orders.But Wei argues capital is just the entry fee, not the competitive advantage.""In the development of semiconductor technology to this point, receiving investment has not helped to improve competitiveness,"" he told reporters during the earnings call, according to UDN. He pointed instead to the unglamorous realities: perfecting production lines, certifying partner designs, building capacity at scale.TSMC has spent 37 years figuring out these details. That institutional knowledge can't be purchased overnight, no matter how deep the pockets. Wei said he's ""confident"" TSMC will maintain its growth targets despite competition, and frankly, the numbers suggest he's earned that confidence.The irony is that TSMC's dominance has created its own problem. The Information reports that TSMC has told both Nvidia and Broadcom it simply can't provide all the production capacity they're demanding. When the world's premier chipmaker starts turning away customers, it opens a window for Intel and Samsung to grab the overflow.TSMC isn't ignoring the threat, though. The company plans to pour up to $56 billion into expansion this year, including ramping up 3nm production at its Arizona facility nearly a year ahead of schedule. Demand for its 3nm and 5nm technologies remains fierce, driven by the AI chip frenzy that shows no signs of cooling. Management expects 2026 revenue to jump 30% year-over-year.Wedbush analysts cheered the results, noting TSMC trades at a 30% discount to their price target despite ""firing on all cylinders."" They see competitive threats as still ""years away.""Wei's message is clear: TSMC has thrived in a competitive environment for three decades and isn't about to cede ground just because Intel got a big check. Whether that confidence holds up as Intel's technology improves remains the semiconductor industry's most interesting question of 2026.","TSMC CEO C.C.

Focus on building with safe, scalable AI

Google calls on developers to join local AI communities





Google CEO Sundar Pichai has called on developers around the world to aim higher as they build with the company’s newest artificial intelligence tools. In a message shared by Google for Developers on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Pichai urged participants of DevFest events to “be as ambitious as you can possibly be,” highlighting how AI is becoming central to software development across industries.For those unaware, DevFest is Google’s annual global developer gathering, organised through local Google Developer Groups (GDGs). These community-led events bring together students, professionals and independent developers to learn new tools, experiment with technologies and collaborate on projects. Google used this year’s outreach to underline the importance of safe, scalable AI systems and encourage more developers to adopt its latest models, including Gemini and Gemma.In the video message, Pichai appears alongside Google DeepMind leaders – Logan KilpatrickGroup Product Manager, Google DeepMind and Paige Bailey, DevX Engineering lead, Google DeepMind.“It's this generation of developers that will crack open our most important problems. That's why we are working to put our latest breakthroughs, including our Gemini and Gemma models directly in your hands,” Pichai said adding “All to say, it's an exciting time, and I can't wait to see what we will build together.”“What's possible for you to build, and how ambitious you can be as a developer, is increasing something like 10 to 100 X over what it was a couple of years ago. So be as ambitious as you can possibly be,” Kilpatrick says in the video message.“AI isn't just a concept. It's a practical tool ready to augment your abilities as a developer. All of these tools are designed to be responsible, safe, secure, and scalable. Giving you the confidence to build and to interview. The power to create the next generation of intelligent applications is in your hands,” Paige Bailey stated.The post also encouraged developers to join a Google Developer Group in their region. GDGs organise workshops, hackathons and study groups, often guided by experts who help participants understand the company’s AI ecosystem.“Connect with local developers to learn, build, and innovate,” the post said, linking to a directory that helps users find nearby communities.Google has been increasingly positioning AI as a core part of its developer strategy. Over the past year, it introduced new APIs, expanded access to Gemini models, and rolled out tools such as AI Studio and Gemma to compete more directly with OpenAI and other AI platforms.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai has called on developers around the world to aim higher as they build with the company’s newest artificial intelligence tools.

memory chip shortage

,”

“crisis”

“For an industry that has long been characterised by boom-and-bust cycles, this time is different. This is not just a cyclical shortage driven by a mismatch in supply and demand, but a potentially permanent, strategic reallocation of the world's silicon wafer capacity.”

How rising memory prices affect Apple, HP, Dell and others

“less conviction”

“the most exposed name in our coverage to secular pressures on PC margins and demand,”

“material impact”

“Over the next two years, the rise in the cost of memory components will be so much that it will even ding a company the size of Apple. The good news is that memory prices are cyclical, but there's so much scarcity in supply that I don't expect a reversion back in the other direction anytime soon.”

“They’re [Apple, HP, Dell and others] in a tough position. They basically have two options: They can take a hit to margins, which the market won’t like.

Or they can raise prices to offset the higher memory costs, running the risk of hurting demand.”

“So long as memory prices stay high, and we expect prices to stay high for a while given the AI demand, the market could continue punishing them,”





Investors in Apple , HP, Dell and other major hardware manufacturers may be worried about the rising memory prices. The increase in the cost of memory and storage components is reportedly putting pressure on hardware makers as higher expenses risk hurting margins and profits. The massive demand for memory has led to what IDC callswhich the analytics company sees as afor device makers, as a lack of supply drives sky-high chip prices. A report claims that this trend is unlikely to ease anytime soon.In a December 2025 report, IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo wrote,Memory can account for 10% to 20% of material costs in consumer-facing hardware like smartphones, according to Jeronimo. Last week, Hedgeye Risk Management said it hadin Apple as the memory issue became more worrying.The effects for PC makers are expected to be even worse. In November, HP's profit outlook missed expectations, and during its conference call, company executives estimated that higher memory costs would reduce its 2026 adjusted earnings per share by 30 cents.HP isGoldman Sachs analyst Katherine Murphy wrote in a note to clients earlier this week. She expects increased pricing actions to offset higher input costs, such as memory chips, to have aon PC purchases by lower-end consumers, where HP has more exposure than Dell, in the second half of 2026.The general estimate for HP's 2026 net earnings per share has been cut by 7.1% over the past month, according to Bloomberg data. Dell also noted the impact of rising memory prices in its results, though its estimates have held up better as the company's server business sees strong demand amid the AI buildout.Paul Meeks, managing director and head of technology research at Freedom Capital Markets told Bloomberg:According to a Bloomberg report, Apple shares rose just 8.6% in 2025, which was the company’s worst performance since 2022, and are down 4.2% to start this year, making them among the 20 weakest stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index. Meanwhile, HP shares recently closed at their lowest level since November 2020 after losing nearly a third of their value in 2025 and dropping another 6.8% in the early days of 2026.On the other hand, Dell Technologies Inc. has fallen 26% since its October all-time high. More recently, Apple shares rose 0.1%, while HP shares fell 0.3%. Dell rose 1.7%, helped by TSMC results, which boosted gains in AI-related names.Rising memory prices may also be a risk for chipmakers that provide semiconductors for smartphones, as noted in recent downgrades of Qualcomm by Mizuho Securities and Arm Holdings Plc by Bank of America.Last week, results from Samsung Electronics Co. showed that average selling prices for dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, chips jumped more than 30% from one quarter to the next. To compare, non-volatile flash memory, or NAND, chips rose about 20%. The higher prices, which are expected to continue throughout 2026, if not longer, helped Samsung's profits more than triple.In a statement to Bloomberg, Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital, which has $9.1 billion in assets and runs an exchange-traded fund dedicated to AI infrastructure, said,Thummel added. Among the group, he's only positive on Dell, as growth in its server business offsets the memory headwind.To compare, memory and storage companies have shot ahead in 2026, with Sandisk, Western Digital, Micron and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc building on their 2025 rallies. These companies have benefited from the price surge, becoming some of the market’s top-performing stocks over the past year. Sandisk is leading the S&P 500 to start the year, up about 75%, with Western Digital and Micron among the index's top 20 performers.",Rising memory prices may also be a risk for chipmakers that provide semiconductors for smartphones.

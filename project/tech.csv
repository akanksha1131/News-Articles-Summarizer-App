What Astronomer said on Kristin Cabot's resignation

Astronomer's new CEO on Coldplay ‘kiss cam’ scandal

Astronomer 's former HR head Kristin Cabot was reportedly spotted by Daily Mail. The publication is said to have obtained exclusive photos of Cabot as she watered her plants outside her Rye, New Hampshire, home. It is said to be Kristin Cabot's first sighting since being caught in the Coldplay “Kiss Cam” scandal with Astronomer's former CEO Andy Byron . As per the pictures, Cabot was seen without her wedding ring. Kristin’s ring could be reportedly seen in previous photos.As per reports, Cabot appears to be married to Privateer Rum CEO Andrew Cabot. The two are seen together in family photos shared online with two children. Cabot reportedly shares a $2.2 million New England-style home that they purchased together in February, according to property records obtained by The Post. The loan papers are said to mention them as Husband and Wife. Media reports also claim that Cabot and Andrew have shared the same residence since at least 2023.Reports of her sighting come hours after she resigned from her post as Director of People at Astronomer.A spokesperson confirmed Cabot’s departure in a brief statement from the company. “I can confirm that Kristin Cabot is no longer with Astronomer. She has resigned,” a rep from the AI software company told The Post. TMZ was first to report her departure. Kristin’s resignation came a few days after Andy Byron quit as Astronomer’s CEO on July 19, just a day after their photos at a Coldplay concert went viral. The two were captured hugging very closely on the concert’s “kiss cam” in a moment that almost took over the internet.The Cold Play's frontman, Chris Martin, called out the two former tech execs, saying, “Whoa, look at these two,” as the camera panned to show Byron holding Cabot from behind. “Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy.”Astronomer's new CEO Pete DeJoy broke his silence on the Coldplay “kiss cam” scandal in a post on LinkedIn. “The spotlight has been unusual and surreal for our team and, while I would never have wished for it to happen like this, Astronomer is now a household name,” DeJoy said. “The events of the past few days have received a level of media attention that few companies – let alone startups in our small corner of the data and AI world – ever encounter,” he added.“At Astronomer we have never shied away from challenges,” DeJoy said and went on to add, “From starting a software company in Cincinnati, Ohio, to keeping the lights on through the collapse of the bank that held all our cash, to scaling from 30 to 300 people during a global pandemic that demanded we do it all without ever being in the same room.”","Kristin Cabot was reportedly spotted by Daily Mail as she watered her plants outside her Rye, New Hampshire, home.

Google DeepMind launches AI model that works like ‘virtual satellite’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-deepmind-launches-ai-model-that-works-like-virtual-satellite/articleshow/123003052.cms,"How AlphaEarth Foundations AI model works



Google DeepMind , Google’s AI unit, has introduced an AI model, AlphaEarth Foundations , that integrates a massive cache of Earth observation data and generates a data representation that can help scientists and researchers understand and monitor our planet. The company says that the newest AI model functions like a “virtual satellite,” to provide insights into global changes.According to Google DeepMind, the model accurately and efficiently characterises the planet’s entire terrestrial land and coastal waters by integrating huge amounts of Earth observation data into a unified digital representation, or ""embedding,"" that computer systems can easily process.This allows the model to provide scientists with a more complete and consistent picture of our planet's evolution.According to the company, the data has been taken by satellites that capture information-rich images and measurements, providing scientists and experts with a nearly real-time view of our planet. The data is impactful, however, its complexity, multimodality and refresh rate creates a new challenge of connecting different datasets and making use of them all effectively.The AI model visualises the rich details of the world by assigning the colours red, green and blue to three of the 64 dimensions. For instance, in Ecuador, AlphaEarth Foundations can “see through persistent cloud cover” to detail agricultural plots. In Antarctica, it maps complex surfaces in clear detail, an area notoriously difficult for irregular satellite imaging. It can even reveal variations in Canadian agricultural land use that are invisible to the naked eye. Google says it tested AlphaEarth Foundations, consistently finding it to be the most accurate when compared against traditional methods and other AI mapping systems.To accelerate research and unlock use cases, Google is releasing a collection of AlphaEarth Foundations’ annual embeddings as the Satellite Embedding dataset in Google Earth Engine . The company is currently using the model to generate annual embeddings and believes its utility could be further amplified by combining it with general reasoning LLM agents like Gemini in the future.","Google DeepMind has introduced an AI model, AlphaEarth Foundations.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has unveiled a vision for next-gen AI models and AI-powered smart glasses , hours before Meta's latest earnings call. Zuckerberg shared plans for personalised ""super-smart AI for everyone"" calling it the future of artificial intelligence (AI).In a publicly released letter and video, Zuckerberg outlined his goal for every individual to have an AI tool that “helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be.”“Meta's vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone. We believe in putting this power in people's hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives,” he said.Zuckerberg outlined a distinct vision for the future of AI, sharply contrasting with others in the industry who advocate for a centralised superintelligence that automates all work, leading to humanity living off its output.“At Meta, we believe that people pursuing their individual aspirations is how we have always made progress expanding prosperity, science, health, and culture. This will be increasingly important in the future as well,” Zuckerberg said.Meta's core focus remains the intersection of technology and everyday human life. If current trends persist, Zuckerberg anticipates people will spend less time on traditional productivity software and more time creating and connecting.“Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful. Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices,” he added.The Meta CEO also said that the company believes strongly in building personal superintelligence that empowers everyone."," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says personal superintelligence is the future of artificial intelligence.

Mira Murati’s long-term vision for Thinking Machines Lab



It appears that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ’s aggrieves recruitment drive is not going to end anytime soon. Now an online report reveals that after ScaleAI, Zuckerberg tried to acquire another AI startup — Thinking Machines Lab. As reported by Wired, in a stunning rebuff to one of tech’s biggest names, Mira Murati , former OpenAI CTO and founder of Thinking Machines Lab revealed that none of her team members accepted Meta’s billion-dollar offers to join its newly launched Superintelligence Lab .As reported by Wired, Thinking Machine Labs rejected staggering $1 billion offer from Meta to join its Superintelligence Lab. The compensation packages ranged from $200 million to $1 billion over multiple years—to lure top AI researchers from Murati’s startup. “So far at Thinking Machines Lab, not a single person has taken the offer,” Mira confirmed to Wired.However, on the other hand Meta communications director Andy Stone has disagreed with this statement. As reported by Wired Stone said, “We made offers only to a handful of people at TML and while there was one sizeable offer, the details are off. At the end of the day, this all begs the question who is spinning this narrative and why.”Recently, Thinking Machines Lab raised funds at a billion valuation without launching a product, has quickly become one of the most-watched AI startups. Industry insiders say Mira Murati’s long-term vision and leadership are key reasons her team remains united, even in the face of record-breaking offers.It is also said that researchers at Thinking Machines Lab are said to prioritize their independence and the opportunity to shape the future of AI from the ground up, free from the constraints of a large corporate structure.","Mira Murati, former OpenAI CTO and founder of Thinking Machines Lab revealed that none of her team members accepted Meta’s billion-dollar offers to join its newly launched Superintelligence Lab.

He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company. I’ve got my methods of doing that, and I use machine learning. I sort through all 42,000 employees.”“100% of the time, I increased the company’s spend on OpEx [operating expenses].

AI transformation drives Microsoft’s workforce restructuring strategy

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed the company's massive job cuts in a candid memo to employees, acknowledging that recent layoffs affecting over 15,000 workers this year, have been ""weighing heavily"" on him while defending the cuts as necessary for the Redmond giant’s AI transformation.""Before anything else, I want to speak to what's been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations,"" Nadella wrote to Microsoft's more than 200,000 employees. ""These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we've worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with – our colleagues, teammates, and friends.""The layoffs represent approximately 7% of Microsoft's global workforce, making it the company's largest personnel reduction since 2014. Despite the cuts, Microsoft's stock has soared 21% this year, hitting record highs above $500 per share, while the company reported $75 billion in net income over three fiscal quarters.Nadella directly addressed what he called the ""uncertainty and seeming incongruence"" of cutting jobs while the company thrives financially. ""By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving – our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right,"" he wrote. ""We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.""The CEO described this contradiction as ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value,"" explaining that ""progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.""Nadella emphasised that achieving future success ""will be defined by our ability to go through this difficult process of 'unlearning' and 'learning.'"" He argued this transformation requires Microsoft to ""meet changing customer needs, by continuing to maintain and scale our current business, while also creating new categories with new business models and a new production function.""The memo outlined Microsoft's strategic pivot from a ""software factory to an intelligence engine"" as the company invests $80 billion in AI infrastructure. Nadella envisions a future where ""all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips.""""As we begin a new fiscal year, I've been reflecting on the road we've traveled together and the path ahead,"" Nadella wrote, positioning the layoffs within broader industry shifts toward AI-driven automation that have eliminated over 80,000 tech jobs in 2025.The CEO expressed ""sincere gratitude to those who have left,"" acknowledging that ""their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today.""

Read Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

Bill Gates daughter shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother



Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among tech CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April this year, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment. ""In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Phoebe Gates recently shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni, Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was: ""Get up or get out of the game, sis.""According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Melinda Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced. Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking: ""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""""He's like, ‘Why would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‘You answered your own question,'” she added.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates worked a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup, Phia. Phia is an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly creating a highly secretive, startup-like unit dedicated to advanced AI research within Meta, a report has said. The strange thing about this strategy is that it has largely remained under wraps from investors and many company insiders. This bold move comes as Meta overhauls its AI strategy, with Zuckerberg reportedly offering nine-figure sign-on bonuses to poach top artificial intelligence talent from industry rivals like OpenAI, Apple and Google.Citing sources familiar with Zuckerberg's vision, the Financial Times reported that the CEO aims at fostering a bureaucracy-free environment for developing ‘cutting-edge AI’, all while being backed by Meta's capital. The unit is said to operate from a separate workspace at Meta’s Menlo Park headquarters, deliberately isolated from the company's existing AI efforts.Zuckerberg has reportedly met new team members personally as they’ve joined in recent weeks. The lab is reportedly being led by Alexandr Wang, the former CEO of Scale AI, and Nat Friedman, the former GitHub boss.The secrecy surrounding the lab's work, including its vision and budget, has left investors and even many insiders with limited insight.

Why Facebook has slammed EU AI Act

Google has said yes to European Union's (EU) AI law that Facebook and Instagram parent Meta has almost gone to war over. Google has reportedly said that it will sign the EU’s code of practice for artificial intelligence (AI). Google agreeing to EU AI law is a boost to the bloc as it tries to hold firm on its digital rules in the face of heavy pressure from the Donald Trump government and other Big Tech groups.Kent Walker, president of global affairs and chief legal officer at Google’s parent company Alphabet, said that the company would sign “with the hope that this Code, as applied, will promote European citizens’ and businesses’ access to secure, first-rate AI tools as they become available”.Though Google seems set to sign the Europe's AI Act, it also warned the regional bloc on the same. Kent Walker said that Google would also submit feedback, as the AI Act and the code “risk slowing Europe’s development and deployment of AI”. He added, “Departures from EU copyright law, steps that slow approvals, or requirements that expose trade secrets could chill European model development and deployment, harming Europe’s competitiveness.”With this, Google joins OpenAI and the French artificial intelligence company Mistral in signing the code. Microsoft president Brad Smith recently told Reuters that it was “likely” that Microsoft would sign the code. The AI Act is set to come into force early next month.EU’s AI code requires regular documentation updates for AI tools and it also bans training of AI with paired content. It also needs compliance with content owners’ opt-out requests and systemic risk assessments and post-marketing monitoring.EC president calls AI Act Red line that can't be crossedA statement on the EU-US trade deal signed by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and US President Donald Trump last week said that the two economies “intend to address unjustified digital trade barriers”. However, the EU has said its online rules are a red line and will not be changed. “We are not moving on our right to regulate autonomously in the digital space,” a commission spokesperson said.Facebook owner Meta has vehemently refused to sign the AI code. Meta’s vice president of Global Public Policy, Joel Kaplan said in a LinkedIn post that Europe might be ‘heading down the wrong path’. He said that the code introduces ‘“legal uncertainties for model developers” and also impose requirements that go “far beyond the scope of the AI Act”.“Europe is heading down the wrong path on AI. We have carefully reviewed the European Commission’s Code of Practice for general-purpose AI (GPAI) models and Meta won’t be signing it. This Code introduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act,” wrote Kaplan in a LinkedIn post.Last month, 44 of Europe’s largest businesses – including Bosch, Siemens, SAP, Airbus and BNP – signed a letter calling for the Commission to ‘Stop the Clock’ in its implementation.",Google has reportedly said that it will sign the EU’s code of practice for artificial intelligence (AI) Google joins OpenAI and the French artificial intelligence company Mistral in signing the code.

Bill Gates’ floating “townhouse” never used



Superyacht has luxury without limits

“The one that will change it all”

Canadian billionaire rumored as next owner

A revolutionary superyacht reportedly commissioned by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is now hitting the market with a jaw-dropping $645 million price tag. Known as Breakthrough (also called Project 821), the 390-foot vessel is set to be showcased at the Monaco Yacht Show. Despite its cutting-edge design and green credentials, Gates is said to have never boarded the yacht. Designed to be the world’s first hydrogen-powered “net-zero” superyacht, Breakthrough merges state-of-the-art sustainability with extreme luxury — and is already generating global buzz.The yacht’s most exclusive feature is a four-story private residence reportedly tailored to Gates’ specifications. This secluded section includes two bedrooms, twin bathrooms, two offices with fireplaces, a gym, a pantry, and private elevators. Sea-view terraces and retractable balconies give the space the feel of a floating mansion. Yet, according to reports, Gates has never once boarded the vessel—despite years of planning and investment.Constructed by Dutch shipyard Feadship and designed by RWD, Breakthrough runs on compressed liquid hydrogen stored at -253°C. This zero-emission system powers the yacht entirely, with a backup biofuel platform that cuts emissions by 90% when needed. Excess heat from the power conversion is repurposed to warm pools, guest-room floors, and towel racks, underscoring its eco-engineering marvel.Though sustainable, the yacht is anything but minimalist. Its seven decks house an infinity pool, cinema, basketball court, private hospital, multiple libraries, and hot tubs. It accommodates 30 guests in 15 cabins and has room for 43 crew. The interiors blend leathers, marble, oak, and rattan, designed to evoke a high-end coastal retreat.Jamie Edmiston, CEO of the brokerage handling the sale, called Breakthrough “the one that will change it all.” He emphasized that the vessel meets the challenge of combining luxury and environmental responsibility without compromise. Jan-Bart Verkuyl of Feadship added that hydrogen fuel cells represent the future of yachting, citing their superior efficiency and low environmental impact.While Gates has neither confirmed nor denied involvement, insiders say the yacht was built to his preferences. Now, Canadian billionaire Patrick Dovigi, CEO of Green For Life Environmental, is rumored to be in talks to buy the vessel. Whoever the buyer turns out to be, Breakthrough is already being hailed as a turning point in luxury maritime innovation.","The 390-foot vessel is set to be showcased at the Monaco Yacht Show.

Goldman Sachs exits consumer banking after mounting losses

Deal faces hurdles despite strategic value

JPMorgan Chase is in advanced negotiations to become Apple's new credit card partner, potentially ending Goldman Sachs' troubled five-year relationship with the tech giant. The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple has identified JPMorgan as its preferred choice to replace Goldman Sachs in what could become one of the largest credit card deals in history.The potential agreement would transfer Apple's $20 billion credit card portfolio to the nation's largest bank, cementing JPMorgan's dominance in the credit card market while giving Apple access to a massive consumer banking network. Discussions between the companies have accelerated in recent months, though no final deal has been signed.Goldman Sachs has been seeking to exit its Apple partnership since 2023, following billions in losses from its consumer banking ventures. The investment bank has lost approximately $3 billion on its platform solutions business through 2022, with the Apple Card contributing significantly to these losses. CEO David Solomon acknowledged the partnership could end before its 2030 expiration date.The Apple Card's unique structure has created profitability challenges for Goldman Sachs. The card charges no late fees and offers generous cashback rewards, eliminating key revenue streams that traditional credit card issuers rely on. Additionally, 34% of Goldman's Apple Card balances belong to subprime borrowers with credit scores below 660, compared to just 15% at JPMorgan.Several obstacles remain before the partnership can be finalized. The high concentration of subprime borrowers is affecting the price JPMorgan would pay to acquire the portfolio, according to the WSJ report. Goldman's Apple Card delinquency rate stands at roughly 4%, above the industry average of 3.05%.Apple previously explored partnerships with American Express, Capital One, Synchrony Financial, and Barclays before settling on JPMorgan as its preferred partner. The deal would strengthen JPMorgan's position against competitors like American Express and Capital One while providing Apple with a more stable banking partner for its financial services ambitions.If completed, the agreement would represent a significant victory for JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's strategy of expanding across multiple banking sectors.","JPMorgan Chase is in advanced negotiations to become Apple's new credit card partner, potentially ending Goldman Sachs' troubled five-year relationship with the tech giant.

YouTube’s widespread use among children prompts safety concerns



Public support for age restrictions

Australia is going to ban children under 16 from creating YouTube accounts starting December, expanding its world-first social media restrictions. The ban, which already applies to TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook and X (formerly Twitter), now includes YouTube following recommendations from the eSafety Commissioner. Authorities argue that YouTube, despite being considered primarily a video platform, exposes children to harmful content and risks similar to traditional social media platforms.Under the new rule, minors can still watch YouTube videos without an account but will lose features like personalised recommendations, posting content, and commenting. The move is aimed at protecting young Australians from online harm, cyberbullying and mental health issues linked to excessive social media use, setting an example for stricter global digital safety standards.As reported by Euronews, Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese emphasised that the government is prioritizing children’s safety and mental well-being in the digital era. He stated:“We know that social media is doing social harm. My government and this parliament are ready to take action to protect young Australians.” This move follows mounting evidence that unrestricted access to online platforms can lead to issues such as cyberbullying, exposure to explicit content, online grooming, and excessive screen time that impacts mental health.For years, YouTube was treated differently from other social platforms because it primarily serves as a video streaming service rather than a social networking site. However, its widespread use among children and the presence of harmful content prompted authorities to reconsider.According to the eSafety Commissioner, three out of four Australian children aged 10–15 regularly use YouTube, making it more popular than TikTok and Instagram. Alarmingly, 37% of children who reported exposure to harmful online content said they encountered it on YouTube.The commissioner concluded that providing YouTube with an exemption was inconsistent with the goal of protecting minors, leading to its inclusion in the ban. Children under 16 will still be able to view videos without an account but will lose access to personalised recommendations, commenting, and content creation features.A survey conducted last month involving nearly 4,000 Australians revealed that nine in ten people support some form of “age assurance” for social media platforms. This widespread public backing reflects growing societal concerns about protecting children’s mental health, limiting their exposure to inappropriate content, and reducing online exploitation risks. Australia’s decision is among the strictest social media regulations in the world, potentially influencing other countries to adopt similar measures. It also raises questions about digital freedoms, parental responsibility, and how tech companies will adapt to stricter compliance standards.While critics argue such bans might limit digital learning and social connectivity, supporters believe strong guardrails are necessary in a digital environment dominated by algorithms designed to maximise engagement, often at the expense of young users’ well-being.","Australia is going to ban children under 16 from creating YouTube accounts starting December.

The probe mainly revolves around concerns that embedding Meta AI directly into WhatsApp’s search bar could unfairly push users towards Meta services. This move of the company may potentially distort competition and harm rival AI platforms.“By pairing Meta AI with WhatsApp, Meta appears to be able to steer its user base into the new market not through merit-based competition, but by ‘forcing’ users to accept the availability of two distinct services,” the authority stated.AGCM also suspects that Meta’s move may also violate European Union competition rules, particularly around user autonomy and fair market access. The regulator is also investigating whether the integration was done without explicit user consent, raising privacy and ethical concerns.“Offering free access to our AI features in WhatsApp gives millions of Italians the choice to use AI in a place they already know, trust and understand,” a Meta spokesperson told Reuters.The investigation will focus on whether the AI chatbot's integration into WhatsApp could potentially restrict competition or create an unfair advantage for Meta's other services.

Meta faces investor scrutiny over massive AI spending

Mark Zuckerberg is preparing to defend billions in AI spending as Meta faces its slowest profit growth in two years, with the CEO creating a secretive "" Superintelligence lab "" after the company's latest AI model reportedly failed to meet expectations.Meta's Llama 4 AI model attempted to copy techniques from Chinese startup DeepSeek but received such poor reception from developers, making Zuckerberg authorize a complete overhaul of the company's AI strategy, according to sources cited by CNBC and the Financial Times.Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI, bringing CEO Alexandr Wang aboard as chief AI officer alongside former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, ex-Safe Superintelligence CEO Daniel Gross, and ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao to lead the new Meta Superintelligence Labs. The unit operates in isolation at Meta's Menlo Park headquarters, with Zuckerberg personally meeting new hires as they join the closely guarded project.The catalyst for this dramatic pivot came in January when DeepSeek's R1 model caught Meta off guard. The Chinese lab's mixture-of-experts (MoE) approach appeared cheaper to train and run than traditional dense models, prompting Meta executives to believe they had found a shortcut to leapfrog rivals like OpenAI, sources told CNBC.However, Meta's rush to adopt MoE architecture backfired spectacularly. Developers found Llama 4 more difficult to customize and integrate compared to its predecessor, with many preferring the older Llama 3 model. The disappointing reception led Zuckerberg to lose confidence in his generative AI team's leadership, particularly after controversies over whether Meta had manipulated industry benchmark tests.The new Superintelligence Lab represents Mark Zuckerberg's attempt to create a startup-like environment within Meta's $1.8 trillion structure. ""It's like the Manhattan Project. They are throwing all their cash at AI and trying to work out what to do,"" Uday Cheruvu, portfolio manager at Harding Loevner, told the Financial Times.The hiring blitz began as early as March, when Zuckerberg started drawing up a list of top AI researchers before embarking on his offensive. He has since wielded a $14.8 billion investment in Scale AI that brought CEO Alexandr Wang and nine-figure sign-on bonuses to poach approximately 50 top AI researchers from competitors including OpenAI, xAI, Tesla, Apple, and Google, including some of the biggest names in the industry.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Meta offered some of his employees as much as $100 million, and Wired's reports also indicate the same that Zuckerberg is offering $100 million for the first year, with over $300 million over four years. Although Altman also claimed he was sure no one would leave, since they were dedicated to OpenAI’s mission, he turned out to be wrong. Last week, Meta hired ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao as the lab's chief AI scientist, marking a significant coup in Silicon Valley's intensifying talent war.Despite the extraordinary compensation packages, gains have been limited: only a fraction of high-profile researchers opted to join. Meta also explored acquiring two startups founded by former OpenAI executives, Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machines Lab, but was rebuffed in both cases. Then, acording to Wired, Meta approached more than a dozen staffers at Mira Murati's AI startup to discuss joining the lab. One researcher reportedly received an offer of more than $1 billion, but none accepted the offer, at least as of this writing.Zuckerberg’s spending spree hasn’t been an isolated event. Microsoft poached two dozen Google DeepMind AI researchers, including some working on the company's Gemini model. Meanwhile, Google, close a $2.4 billion deal with WindSurf, which has been on OpenAI’s radar, nvested $2.4 billion into WindSurf, acquiring its CEO, key AI talent, and its core tech, just as Meta did with Scale AI.The recruiting frenzy has kicked off a talent race within the Silicon Valley, and while some believe this AI talent war benefits researchers, DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis called it a rational move for Meta, saying the company is merely trying to catch up. Others, like Sam Altman, are less charitable, he has compared Meta's tactics to those of the mafia.Zuckerberg’s ambitions go beyond catching up. His goal is Superintelligence: AI that surpasses human intelligence across all domains. This includes integrating advanced AI into Meta’s social platforms to offer digital companionship, generate unlimited personalized content, and enhance targeted advertising.The CEO goal believes assembling an elite team is essential to maintain Meta’s position as a top social and advertising platform, especially as rivals like Elon Musk’s X are absorbed into AI-first companies. “You actually kind of want the smallest group of people who can fit the whole thing in their head. So there's just an absolute premium for the best and most talented people,” he told The Information.When Meta reports second-quarter earnings Wednesday, analysts expect the company's slowest revenue growth in seven quarters at 14.7% to $44.80 billion, with profit growth slowing to 11.5% as operating costs jump nearly 9%, according to Reuters data from LSEG. BNP Paribas estimates the Superintelligence hiring spree could drive $1.5 billion to $3.5 billion in additional annual research spending, with Meta already raising its capital expenditure forecast by 10% to between $64 billion and $72 billion for 2025.Despite the massive investments and internal tensions as existing AI staff worry about being sidelined, Meta's stock has risen 20% this year as investors show more patience for AI spending compared to the metaverse push that drew sharp criticism in 2022. However, executives are now questioning Meta's open-source AI strategy, with some considering abandoning the planned release of Llama 4's ""Behemoth"" version in favour of developing proprietary models.Zuckerberg remains confident the bet will pay off, telling The Information that Meta's ""very strong business model that throws off a lot of capital"" can support hundreds of billions in infrastructure and talent investments. The challenge now is convincing Wall Street that this secretive Manhattan Project will deliver the AI breakthrough Meta desperately needs.","Zuckerberg has created a secretive "" Superintelligence lab"" at Meta's Menlo Park headquarters. He has spent $14.3 billion on Scale AI, bringing CEO Alexandr Wang aboard as chief AI officer. Last week, Meta hired ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao as the lab's chief AI scientist. Zuckerberg believes assembling an elite team is essential to maintain Meta's position as a top social advertising platform.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122995948,imgsize-23578,width-400,resizemode-4/Mark-Zuckerberg-is-on-a-spending-spree-to-acquire-the-best-AI-talent-in-the-Silicon-Valley-and-the-reason-may-have-been-Chinas-DeepSeek.jpg"

Google is rolling out a suite of new features for its experimental AI Mode in Search. The update brings multiple new features such as PDF uploads, a dynamic Canvas planner and a deeper integration with Chrome and Google Lens. The company claims that the new features are designed to help users to learn, organise and explore more efficiently.“We’re introducing new features and capabilities for AI Mode in Search, just in time for the back-to-school season. You can already use AI Mode in the Google app on Android and iOS to ask complex questions about images, and this week the same capability is launching on desktop browsers,” said Google in a blog post.Users are now allowed to update PDF files directly into the AI Mode on desktop. This will enable the users to ask detailed questions about lecture slides, research papers or any other document. The AI Mode will analyze the file and cross-reference it with web data to deliver contextual answers and helpful links. Support for additional file types, including Google Drive documents, is expected in the coming months.The new Canvas feature allow the users to create study plans, organise tasks and refine projects over multiple sessions. Accessible via a side panel, Canvas updates dynamically as users interact with AI Mode. “AI Mode will start piecing everything together in the Canvas side panel, and you can use follow-ups to refine the output until it meets your exact requirements. Soon, the new upload feature will also make it possible to customize your study guide (or whatever you need to create) with context from your files, like class notes or a course syllabus.”AI Mode now works seamlessly with Google Lens in Chrome, enabling users to ask questions about anything on their screen—be it a diagram in a PDF or a webpage.Google is also launching Search Live, a real-time video input feature powered by Project Astra. Search Live is fully integrated with Google Lens, our visual search tool. To get started, just open Lens in the Google app, tap the Live icon, and ask whatever’s on your mind while pointing your camera. You can have a free-flowing, back-and-forth conversation with Search in AI Mode, aided by all the visual context from your live camera feed, like different angles or objects in motion.","Google is rolling out a suite of new features for its experimental AI Mode in Search.

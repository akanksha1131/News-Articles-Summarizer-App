Why Bill Gates donated $60 billion

What stopped Bill Gates from becoming a trillionaire



What stopped Bill Gates from becoming a trillionaire

Why Bill Gates is donating nearly all his wealth by 2045



Bill Gates could have become the world’s first trillionaire if he had held on to his original Microsoft shares , according to a new analysis by. Together, he and Melinda French Gates might have amassed a combined fortune of around $1.5 trillion, without selling stock or dedicating large portions of their wealth to philanthropy. Gates alone could have been worth an estimated $1.2 trillion.Back in 1986, when Microsoft went public, Gates owned 11.2 million shares, roughly 49 percent of the company, worth about $200 million at the time. Adjusted for stock splits, that holding would now be about 3.2 billion shares, or 43 percent of Microsoft, valued at approximately $1.4 trillion. With another $100 billion from dividends after tax, his hypothetical net worth would have set a new global record.Instead, Gates chose a different path. He steadily sold off shares and focused on philanthropy through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . Today, he holds just 0.9 percent of Microsoft, worth around $28 billion. Melinda’s current Microsoft stake is valued at about $380,000. This decision reshaped their legacy, from tech billionaires to some of the world’s most influential philanthropists.In 2000, according to Dailymotion, Bill and Melinda established the Gates Foundation with initial funding that has grown over the years. Together, they contributed $60.2 billion, directing $47.7 billion toward global health and poverty initiatives. That made them the second-largest philanthropists in US history at that time.Bill’s 2010 “Giving Pledge,” co-founded with Warren Buffett, committed him to donate nearly all his wealth to charitable causes. Melinda confirmed that she viewed concentrating wealth as counterproductive, believing in redistributing resources more responsibly, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.Forbes estimates Bill’s current net worth at about $113 billion and Melinda’s at $30.4 billion. These figures still placed them among the global elite, though far from the trillion-dollar mark.By comparison, Elon Musk recently topped out with a net worth near $368 billion, according to Bloomberg. Under the hypothetical scenario, Bill would have far eclipsed that peak, marking a wealth level not seen in human history. Melinda, with her estimated stake, would have entered the top three richest individuals worldwide.The central shift began when the Gates Foundation turned into more than just a personal project. It became a formal body focused on health, poverty, education, and equity. The couple poured tens of billions into vaccines, infectious disease prevention, agricultural development, and women’s empowerment globally.In recent years, they have made major commitments. Bill pledged to donate nearly 99 percent of his remaining wealth over the next two decades. Melinda launched Pivotal Philanthropies and directed $12.5 billion toward gender issues.Bill also confirmed that the Gates Foundation will wind down by 2045, the planned endpoint for most philanthropic ventures.","In 1986, when Microsoft went public, Gates owned 11.2 million shares, roughly 49 percent of the company, worth about $200 million at the time.

What is Canada's Digital Services Tax

In a dramatic escalation of tensions, U.S. President Donald Trump announced the immediate termination of trade negotiations with Canada in response to Ottawa’s new digital services tax targeting American tech giants. The move, posted on Trump’s Truth Social platform, marks the revival of a trade war between the two nations, shattering months of improved relations following the election of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.Trump called Canada “a very difficult Country to TRADE with” and labeled the 3% digital services tax a “direct and blatant attack” on American technology companies. The tax, which applies to firms like Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber, and Airbnb, levies a charge on revenue generated from Canadian users and includes a retroactive bill estimated at $2 billion USD due by month’s end. Trump vowed to impose new tariffs on Canadian imports within the next seven days, though specifics remain undisclosed.The digital services tax, enacted despite U.S. objections, targets both Canadian and foreign businesses engaging with online users in Canada. The digital services tax applies to Canadian and foreign businesses that engage with online users in Canada. It will apply to companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It will apply retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion U.S. bill due at the end of the month.Canadian Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne confirmed last week that Ottawa would move forward with the tax, brushing off Silicon Valley’s opposition and U.S. pressure to reconsider.The announcement sent ripples through financial markets, with the Canadian dollar dropping 0.7% against the U.S. dollar on the same day. The decision threatens to disrupt the economic ties between the U.S. and its northern neighbor, reigniting trade hostilities and raising concerns about broader economic fallout.","The move marks the revival of a trade war between the two nations, shattering months of improved relations following the election of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

The US Embassy in India has issued a clear warning for visa applicants. “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas,” the embassy said in a post on microblogging site X (formerly known as Twitter). The post reminded visa applicants to disclose all social media usernames or handles they’ve used over the past five years while filling out the DS-160 visa application form. “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form” the post read. “Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit.”The requirement is part of broader vetting procedures introduced by the US State Department in recent years. As part of the updated rules, applicants must list IDs used on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and others—even if the accounts are no longer active from the last five years.The move comes days after the US government issued a new guideline for those applying for student and exchange visitor visas. Applicable to all applicants of F, M, and J non-immigrant visas, the new rule requires these applicants to set their social media accounts to public. “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under U.S. law,"" the US embassy in India wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post.F, M and J visas are the common types of non-immigrant visas issued by the agency to foreign nationals who wish to study or participate in exchange visitor programs in the U.S. F visa is typically used by academic students, the M visa by vocational students, and the J visa by exchange visitors, including researchers, scholars, and interns.In a related news, USCIS has announced that it will switch to a new phone number for sending text (SMS) messages. “Effective July 1, 2025, USCIS will no longer send text (SMS) messages from the phone number 468-311 (GOV-311).

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) where he said “The real benchmark for AI progress is whether it makes a real difference in people’s lives — in healthcare, education, and productivity.” Nadella recently appeared at Y Combinator AI Startup School where he talked about Microsoft's AI bets, hyperscaling, and quantum computing breakthroughs. His X post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who responded to Satya Nadella's statement, saying “True”.In the post, Nadella also shared a video of him from the event where he said “If there's one lesson history has taught is that if you're gonna use energy, you better have social permission to use energy. So that means you've got to make sure that the output of the AI is still to use”.Adding further, he said “If we really are not creating social surplus (economic surplus) as measured by countries and communities, we just can' consume it. And so that, to me, is the bigger thing. Like, everybody is today, hot and bothered about what do I do about energy production?”During the conversation, Nadella also touched upon challenges for the tech industry in the coming five years. He said “I think the real question in the next five years is we've got to produce enough products that are creating great value, which I'm very confident of, in healthcare and education, in productivity. So there's many, many domains. But that's the real challenge for us as a tech industry, is to prove unequivocally that what we have created is showing up in real stats; that is not just an AGI or AI benchmark.”“Like, in the United States, 18-19% of our cost is healthcare, and everybody talks about the magical drug except all of the cost is in work flow” he said, adding that “the back end of an EMR system with just an LLM and a prompt…is going to save so much time and money and energy that you sort of paper itself.”","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) where he said “The real benchmark for AI progress is whether it makes a real difference in people’s lives — in healthcare, education, and productivity” His X post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who responded to his statement, saying “True”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122084717,imgsize-29886,width-400,resizemode-4/Tesla-CEO-Elon-Musk-agrees-with-Microsofts-Satya-Nadella-on-AI-goals-If-theres-one-lesson.jpg"

Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries , India’s largest private-sector conglomerate, revealed insights into his leadership philosophy and the company’s bold approach to innovation during a recent interview for the Leading Asia series. Speaking to McKinsey, Mukesh Ambani discussed how a clear vision, coupled with the right talent, has helped Reliance grow from a modest textiles business into a global leader in innovation and value creation. The Leading Asia series features in-depth conversations with the region’s most influential leaders, exploring the strategies behind their ambitious goals.Highlighting the company’s willingness to take risks, Ambani pointed to the launch of Reliance Jio as a defining moment. ""We’ve always taken big risks because, for us, scale is important. The biggest risk we have taken so far was Jio. At the time, it was our own money that we were investing, and I was the majority shareholder,"" he said. Despite skepticism from analysts about India’s readiness for advanced digital technology, Ambani invested heavily in Jio, viewing it as a potential game-changer. “In the worst case, we will not earn much return. That’s okay because it’s our own money,” he told his board. “But this will be the best philanthropy we’ve ever done because we will have digitized India and transformed the country.”Ambani said that his leadership idea is rooted in a long-term perspective, inspired by his father’s vision of Reliance as an enduring institution. “You come without anything into this world, and you leave without taking anything with you. What you leave behind is an institution,” he said, recalling his father’s words. With Reliance approaching its golden jubilee in 2027, Ambani expressed confidence that the company will continue to serve India and humanity for a century and beyond.Reflecting on Reliance’s evolution, Ambani noted its ability to adapt to a rapidly changing world. “The Reliance of the 1960s and ’70s is completely different from the Reliance of the 2000s and 2020s,” he said. By challenging traditional business school principles, such as avoiding integration across the value chain, Reliance has seized emerging technological opportunities, often surpassing its existing ventures in scale and impact.","Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, revealed insights into his leadership philosophy and the company’s bold approach to innovation.

How judge Aman Gupta may have agreed with the 70 hour work week



Shark Tank India recently posted a teaser of the upcoming fifth season of the show on Instagram. The now viral teaser takes a sly dig at the 70-hour work week comment made by Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy. The promo can be seen mocking the long working hours, but it also draws parallels with Shark Tank India judge Aman Gupta who recently expressed his views on intense work dedication.Earlier this year, Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy suggested that Indians should work for 70 hours a week as this will boost the country's productivity and economy. Now, the new teaser of Shark Tank India show takes a dig at this viewpoint with its new promo.Shark Tank India season five promo released by SonyLiv features fictional company CEOs who are disappointed with their employees starting their own businesses. The voice over in the background urges viewers to “keep working so your millionaire bosses become billionaires,” and warns them not to apply for the fifth season of the show.The teaser simply conveys the message that don’t give up on your dreams for corporate burnout .The new promo of the show aligns with the viewpoints of some of the judges on show. Recently, Shark Tank India judge Namita Thapar publicly criticized the concept of a 70-hour work week. Thapar said that the idea of a 70-hour work week is unsustainable and is not good for the well-being of the professional. She also advocates the ideal of work-life balance . Anupam Mittal, another judge on the show also weighed in with a sarcastic remark about AI potentially eliminating jobs, easing concerns about long work hours.However, not all the judges on the show disagree with this sentiment of long working hours. Recently, Boat co-founder and Shark Tank India judge Aman Gupta acknowledged the significant time he dedicated to building his business, which inevitably meant less time for his family, particularly during his daughter's formative years.Speaking on the podcast Prakhar Ke Pravachan, Gupta said, “I know I have missed out on many things in my daughter’s life. If I look back now, I realise how many events I have missed. However, I am very much okay with it and I don’t regret it at all.” He added, “Had I not missed out on those occasions, my life would have been much different.”However, Gupta mentioned that these sacrifices were important and necessary for him to succeed. ""I'm very much okay with it. I don't regret it at all. Had I not missed out on those important occasions, my life would have been much different,"" he explained. He further added, ""I worked very hard and that is the reason I'm where I am. I must have missed out on many things in life, but that is what it takes to reach such a level.""","Shark Tank India recently posted a teaser of the upcoming fifth season of the show on Instagram.

Walmart Inc President and CEO Doug McMillon emphasized the company's desire for a level playing field and consistent policies in all countries where it operates, stating that Walmart is well-equipped to navigate the current tariff challenges better than any other retailer. ""We operate in many countries, and we consistently ask for a level playing field everywhere,"" McMillon told the Economic Times when questioned about India. ""We engage with various governments, sharing our views on changes needed to better serve customers, but we don't set the rules—we comply with them.""Talking about the goal for India market, Doug McMillion said, Walmart will announce the next goal for India once it reaches the target of annually sourcing goods worth $10 billion from the country by 2027. He went on to highlight Walmart's preference for local sourcing and job creation, noting, ""We like to buy locally, create jobs, and benefit from shorter lead times, especially for food and consumables."" Media reports suggest that the Trump administration is pushing India to grant full access to its $125 billion e-commerce market for companies like Amazon and Walmart as part of ongoing bilateral trade agreement (BTA) negotiations, expected to conclude by next month. McMillon clarified that Walmart is not directly involved in these government-to-government talks.In India, e-commerce giants like Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart are prohibited from holding inventory or selling directly to consumers, unlike local firms such as Reliance Retail and Tata Group. Doug McMillon stressed the importance of clear and predictable regulations, saying, ""The more things are transparent and consistent, the better it is for business, whether in India or globally.""On the possibility of Flipkart holding inventory in India, McMillon noted, ""We have expertise in inventory management and would be happy if the rules allowed it, but we leave rule-making to others.""Addressing tariffs, Doug McMillon said Walmart's sourcing capabilities give it an edge. ""We've been managing tariffs since 2018, and our experienced merchants can adapt by making different sourcing choices,"" he said. ""We prioritize buying locally to create jobs and reduce lead times, though this is easier for food than general merchandise.""McMillon underscored Walmart's commitment to low prices, stating, ""Keeping the cost of living low is our priority. Low prices are in our DNA, and we aim to maintain a price gap with competitors to deliver value to customers globally.""Regarding India, McMillon expressed optimism about Walmart's sourcing goals, saying, ""We’re on track to source $10 billion annually from India by 2027, with an expanding range of categories. It’s encouraging to see this progress.""

Microsoft ’s plans for its next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) chip, code-named Maia, are reportedly facing a significant setback. According to The Information, citing sources involved in the effort, the chip's mass production has been delayed by at least six months, now pushing its rollout into 2026 instead of the anticipated 2025.When “Braga,” as the chip is also known, eventually enters production, its performance is expected to fall considerably short of Nvidia's Blackwell chip, which was released late last year, the report said.Microsoft had initially aimed to integrate the Maia chip into its data centers as early as this year. However, design changes, staffing constraints and high employee turnover are cited as key factors contributing to the delay.Like its major tech counterparts, Microsoft has been heavily investing in developing custom processors for AI operations and general-purpose applications. This move is intended to lessen the tech giant's dependence on expensive chips from Nvidia, which currently dominates the AI hardware market .Cloud rivals Amazon and Alphabet’s Google have also been pursuing in-house chip development, tailoring processors to their specific needs with the dual goals of boosting performance and cutting costs. Microsoft first introduced the Maia chip in November 2023 but has since lagged behind its peers in scaling up its production.In contrast, Google has seen success with its custom AI chips, known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). In April, Google unveiled its seventh-generation AI chip, designed to accelerate the performance of AI applications.Similarly, Amazon in December revealed its next-generation AI chip, Trainium 3, which is slated for release later this year.Meanwhile, Nvidia is also expected to announce its next-generation chips later this year.

The competition for top artificial intelligence (AI) talent is heating up, and the tech giants are publicly clashing over recruitment tactics. Just days after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed that Meta, Facebook's parent company, was offering as much as $100 million to poach its AI talent, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth directly refuted these assertions during a company-wide all-hands meeting on Thursday (June 26).Asserting it’s winning the recruitment war against OpenAI, Bosworth said, “Sam is just being dishonest here”, highlighting that Meta did not offer “phenomenal deals” and “ridiculous offers,” including ""tens of millions of dollars"" and even ""$100 million signing bonuses,"" to poach his employees.“He’s suggesting that we’re doing this for every single person… Look, you guys, the market’s hot.

And of course, he’s not mentioning what the actual terms of the offer are. It’s not [a] sign-on bonus. It’s all these different things,” he added.Bosworth went on to highlight recent reports of several OpenAI researchers joining Meta, adding that “quite a few more are in the pipeline that I can’t announce or share right now.”He concluded with a direct challenge to Altman's statements: ""Sam is known to exaggerate, and in this case, I know exactly why he’s doing it, which is because we are succeeding at getting talent from OpenAI.

Guests arrive for Jeff Bezos-Lauren Sanchez wedding



Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his fiancée Lauren Sanchez officially kicked off their multi-day wedding celebration in Venice, Italy, with a rehearsal dinner on Thursday (June 26) evening. While the event was expected to be full of glamour, the highlight turned out to be Sanchez’s striking and highly structured gold gown. As the couple boarded a water taxi to the venue, all eyes were on Sanchez’s elaborate outfit — a couture piece from Schiaparelli’s 2025 collection, reportedly worth up to $100,000, reports DailyMail.Sanchez’s dress featured a metallic corset bodice, designed to emphasize waist and toned frame, and a full embroidered skirt. The dress was not custom-made, but its exclusivity and price tag reflected Sanchez’s fashion clout. The neckline was modest — a rare style choice for Sanchez — and the overall look was dramatic, drawing comparisons to masquerade ball attire. “It seems designed to ensure that she will be the soirée’s central attraction,” said one fashion commentator.However, its stiff structure drew comparisons to costume-like fashion and raised eyebrows for its discomfort. “The shimmering gold corset… was as sumptuous as its silhouette was suffocating,” said one observer at the event.Bezos, on the other hand, appeared casual and comfortable in a crisp white shirt and Italian linen suit, Sanchez looked restrained in her couture ensemble. “Bezos looks as comfortable as Sanchez looks contained,” said one onlooker.Just a day earlier, Sanchez had made her Venetian debut in a vintage 2003 Alexander McQueen navy gown — a much subtler look, likely sourced from her favorite Hollywood resale boutique, Timeless Vixen. That understated elegance stood in sharp contrast to the elaborate gold dress worn for Thursday’s celebration.On Thursday (June 26) afternoon, several guests were seen leaving the Gritti Palace Hotel for the evening’s events. According to CNN report, high profile guests at Bezos’ wedding include US President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, Kim Kardashian, Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey among others.Model Vittoria Ceretti, Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, Tom Brady, and Kendall and Kylie Jenner have also arrived.

Philomin, who had been with Amazon for eight years, confirmed his move to another company via email to news agency Reuters.Philomin played a crucial role in leading AWS's generative AI efforts, product strategy, and oversaw the development of Amazon's foundation models known as Amazon Titan. He played aninstrumental role in creating and leading Amazon Bedrock , a central hub for utilising various AI models and a flagship product in AWS's quest for AI dominance.Philomin was also a regular speaker at major AWS events, including the company's annual cloud computing conference in Las Vegas.An Amazon spokesperson confirmed his departure earlier in June and stated that Rajesh Sheth, a vice president formerly in charge of Amazon Elastic Block Store, has assumed some of Philomin's responsibilities. The spokesperson also noted that other vice presidents at AWS are actively working on generative AI projects.This high-profile exit comes as Amazon intensifies its efforts to bolster its standing in the rapidly evolving AI development landscape. Rivals like OpenAI and Google have gained an early lead, particularly with consumer-focused AI models.To compete, the Seattle-based tech giant has made huge investments, including an $8 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic. This partnership has led to the integration of Anthropic's Claude software into Amazon’s own products, notably a revamped version of its voice assistant Alexa , which is being rolled out to customers this year.Amazon has also been expanding its own AI model portfolio, introducing Nova AI models for text, video, and image generation in December, and later adding Sonic for natural-sounding speech this year.","Vasi Philomin, a key vice president overseeing generative AI development and the company's Bedrock service, has left the company.

After a period of four decades, Microsoft is officially bidding farewell to the iconic ""Blue Screen of Death"" (BSoD). Microsoft is now replacing the famous Blue error screen with a redesigned and black interface. The company revealed that the change is part of a broader ‘ Windows Resiliency Initiative ’ which is aimed at making the operating system more robust.The company announced the change in Windows blog post. The company said that with this change it aims to modernise and improve the user experience. The company also wishes to reduce the disruption caused by system crashes. The new screen for Windows comes with a simplified message which does not consists of the sad-face emoji and QR code as it aligns with Windows 11’s design language.“We’re introducing a simplified user interface (UI) that pairs with the shortened experience. The updated UI improves readability and aligns better with Windows 11 design principles, while preserving the technical information on the screen for when it is needed,” said the company.The simplified UI for unexpected restarts will be available starting later this summer on all Windows 11, version 24H2 devices. In the case of consecutive unexpected restarts, devices can get stuck in the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), impacting productivity and often requiring IT teams to spend significant time troubleshooting and restoring affected devices.The Windows update comes a year after Crowdstrike outage , which impacted over 8 million Windows devices globally. Many of the affected devices showed the dreaded blue screen. In response, Microsoft launched the Windows Resiliency Initiative to embed deeper security and recovery features into the OS.“This is where quick machine recovery (QMR) can help. When a widespread outage affects devices from starting properly, Microsoft can broadly deploy targeted remediations to affected devices via Windows RE—automating fixes with QMR and quickly getting users to a productive state without requiring complex manual intervention from IT,” added Microsoft.The Black Screen of Death will roll out with Windows 11 version 24H2 later this summer.",Microsoft is replacing the famous Blue error screen with a redesigned and black interface.

Microsoft is moving ahead of its rivals Amazon and Google in the cloud and hyperscaling sectors, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Speaking to The Street, Ives said Microsoft is ""clearly leading when it comes to hyperscaling and cloud,"" with its Azure platform playing a key role. Citing strong momentum in artificial intelligence and cloud services, Ives raised his price target for Microsoft’s stock to $600. He added that this figure could still be “conservative.”Currently, only about 20% of Microsoft’s business is linked to next-gen cloud and AI technologies. Ives expects this share to increase to 50–60% in the future, which he said could significantly change the company’s overall value. While Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud are still growing, Ives believes Microsoft’s Azure has a clear advantage, helping it outperform its competitors in this space.Microsoft was recently dethroned by chipmaker Nvidia that claimed top spot in global market value. Microsoft has a market value of $3.69 trillion, making it the second most valuable company globally, behind Nvidia which has a market cap of $3.77 trillion currently. The company's stock continues to hit record highs amid optimism over its AI and cloud strategy.Apple is at third with a market value of about $3 trillion.Nvidia's rise has been driven by its dominant position in providing chips used in AI systems, including those that power tools like ChatGPT. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are a key component for training and running large language models.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has often emphasized the AI revolution. Speaking during the company’s earnings report, Huang said “The next industrial revolution has begun — companies and countries are partnering with Nvidia to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center — AI factories — to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence”.","Microsoft is moving ahead of its rivals Amazon and Google in the cloud and hyperscaling sectors, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

How Google is working on stopping scams in Search



Google is improving the security of its Chrome browser by introducing new AI-powered tools to protect users from online scams. “Today, we're releasing a new report on how we fight scams in Search, and sharing the new ways we're using AI to keep you safe across Search, Chrome and Android,” said Google in a blog post. The company claims that the new AI features will work in real time and it will analyse the content of the website, user behaviour and other relevant factors to identify potential scams.Google introduced an Enhanced Protection mode of safe browsing on Chrome. The feature is designed to jeep users twice as safe from pushing and other scams versus the Standard Protection mode.Google reveals that it is now using Gemini Nano to offer Enhanced Protection to users with an additional layer of defence against online scams. “The on-device approach provides instant insight on risky websites and allows us to offer protection, even against scams that haven't been seen before. Gemini Nano's LLM is perfect for this use because of its ability to distill the varied, complex nature of websites, helping us adapt to new scam tactics more quickly,” said Google.Along with this, Google has also introduced new AI-powered warnings for Chrome on Android. When Chrome’s on-device machine learning model flags a notification, you’ll receive a warning with the option to either unsubscribe or view the content that was blocked. And if you decide the warning was shown incorrectly, you can choose to allow future notifications from that website.The company explains that in AI will help in decreeing and blocking hundreds of scammy results in Google Search. “ Our Fighting Scams in Search report showcases how the investments we’ve made in our AI-powered scam detection systems — along with improvements to our classifiers — have enabled us to catch 20-times the number of scammy pages,” said Google.Advancements in AI have bolstered Google’s scam-fighting technologies — enabling the company to analyse vast quantities of text on the web, identify coordinated scam campaigns and detect emerging threats — staying one step ahead to keep you safe on Search.","Google introduced an Enhanced Protection mode of safe browsing on Chrome.

"FTX lawsuit: US judge dismisses claims against Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen, Kevin O’Leary, Stephen Curry and others",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ftx-lawsuit-us-judge-dismisses-claims-against-tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-kevin-oleary-stephen-curry-and-others/articleshow/121008522.cms,"Representative Image

What the US judge said about dismissing the claims against celebrities



A US judge has dismissed most of the claims against several high-profile celebrities and YouTubers who promoted the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which is no longer in use. This includes high-profile celebrities such as Tom Brady , Gisele Bundchen , Kevin O’Leary , and Stephen Curry . The ruling reduces the scope of a large legal action accusing them of using their fame to market a fraudulent platform.In an order filed recently, US District Judge K Michael Moore stated that the plaintiffs, a group of FTX investors, did not demonstrate that the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried ’s misconduct to be held liable for promoting the exchange.The judge dismissed nearly all of the claims against the “Celebrity Defendants,” which included Shohei Ohtani , Larry David , the NBA team Golden State Warriors, Udonis Haslem, David Ortiz, and Naomi Osaka . The court has also cleared the “YouTuber Defendants,” including influencers who allegedly marketed FTX through social media.The lawsuit arose from FTX’s collapse in November 2022, which caused billions of dollars in customer losses and led to investigations worldwide. The plaintiffs alleged that the stars were paid millions of dollars to endorse FTX without disclosing their financial incentives, a violation of federal and state advertising laws.Judge Moore dismissed most claims against the celebrity promoters in the FTX lawsuit , ruling that the plaintiffs did not adequately plead causation or show that the defendants knew of FTX’s fraud. He also rejected the civil conspiracy allegations, noting that merely receiving payment for promotional content does not establish liability.However, only two charges remain: alleged violations of state securities laws in Florida and Oklahoma for selling unregistered securities. The plaintiffs may amend their complaint, but will need stronger evidence linking the celebrities to FTX’s wrongdoing.This decision follows a lawsuit accusing various athletes, celebrities and influencers of promoting FTX’s unregistered securities. Meanwhile, Shaquille O’Neal reached a private settlement with a group of FTX investors late last month.","A US judge has dismissed most of the claims against several high-profile celebrities and YouTubers who promoted FTX.

US wants new facial recognition system for anyone entering the country by car,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-wants-new-facial-recognition-system-for-anyone-entering-the-country-by-car/articleshow/121007563.cms,"Representative Image

How will this new facial-recognition technology work



The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is looking for a new facial recognition system to implement at land border crossings . With this system, the country wants to identify all individuals entering the country via vehicles. Recently, CBP's Office of Field Operations Biometric Program Office issued a Request for Information, seeking vendors who can provide the technology to capture quality facial images of people inside cars at inbound land ports of entry.The intention is to compare these images in real-time with the Traveller Verification System , an existing facial recognition system used by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at various entry points, such as airports and pedestrian border crossings.The CBF is planning to layer new facial-recognition technology on top of its existing “vehicle package” checks, which already record license plate data, scene photos, and traveller biometrics. In the current system, vehicles first enter a Pre-Primary Zone (PPZ), where live photos are matched against any identities already in government databases. Next, they proceed to the Primary Zone, where the system captures and analyses images of anyone who wasn’t biometrically confirmed in the earlier stage.CBP says that the new facial recognition at vehicle crossings will fulfil its congressional mandate to biometrically record all foreign nationals entering and exiting the US and to prevent imposters from using others’ travel documents.A 2022 DHS postmortem of the Anzalduas test, obtained by the EFF, found that while stated objectives were met, photos were only captured 76% of the time and 81% were usable in the existing system. These shortfalls were attributed to human behaviour, multiple passenger rows and environmental obstacles.However, critics warn that expanding real-time facial recognition to moving vehicles raises serious privacy concerns , as it could track not just vehicle movements but also identify occupants.Responding to this, the new RFI proposes augmenting current checks to capture images of 100% of vehicle passengers, with vendors invited to submit proposals by May 30.","US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is looking for a new facial recognition system to implement at land border crossings.

X has received executive orders from the Indian government requiring X to block over 8,000 accounts in India, subject to potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment of the company’s local employees. The orders include demands to block access in India to accounts belonging to international news organizations and prominent X users.

In most cases, the Indian government has not specified which posts from an account have violated India's local laws. For a significant number of accounts, we did not receive any evidence or justification to block the accounts.

To comply with the orders, we will withhold the specified accounts in India alone. We have begun that process. However, we disagree with the Indian government’s demands. Blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship of existing and future content, and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech.

This is not an easy decision, however keeping the platform accessible in India is vital to Indians’ ability to access information.

We believe that making these executive orders public is essential for transparency – lack of disclosure discourages accountability and can contribute to arbitrary decision making. However, due to legal restrictions, we are unable to publish the executive orders at this time.

X is exploring all possible legal avenues available to the company. Unlike users located in India, X is restricted by Indian law in its ability to bring legal challenges against these executive orders. However, we encourage all users who are impacted by these blocking orders to seek appropriate relief from the courts.

The online dating industry may have hit a rough patch



""Product enhancements are the critical lever to return to payer growth,""

Dating app Tinder 's parent company, Match Group, is reportedly taking on major cost-cutting measures. This includes a 13% reduction in the company’s workforce, following a 5% decrease in paying users during the first quarter, a report claims. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, this announcement led to a 7% drop in the company's shares as investors reacted to the decline in subscribers, despite the company's first-quarter results surpassing estimates.The job cuts represent the first major strategic move under the new CEO, Spencer Rascoff, who assumed leadership in February with the primary goal of addressing the slowing pace of user engagement across Match Group 's various dating platforms, the report added. However, the report didn’t confirm the total number of employees or the division in the company that will be affected.As per the report, the online dating sector is struggling as ongoing inflation, lack of new features and overall market stagnation are driving users away from apps like Tinder and Bumble .In Match Group’s latest earnings report, its portfolio of apps—including Tinder, Hinge , and OkCupid—saw its paid user base drop from 14.9 million a year ago to 14.2 million in Q1.The report cited Chandler Willison, a research analyst at M Science, to note that since paid subscribers are key to these apps’ revenue, the recent decline has dampened investor sentiment, even though the company’s overall financial outlook remains solid.Match still projects Q2 revenue of $850–860 million, slightly above the $846.7 million consensus estimate compiled by LSEG, the report adds.Meanwhile, some investors noted that they have spent more than a year asking Match to rethink its capital allocation, cut costs, and possibly review the strategic direction of its MG Asia division.In response, Match and Bumble have been updating their apps and rolling out AI-driven features, like smart discovery tools, to enhance the user experience.Michael Ashley Schulman, CFA at Running Point Capital, said to Reuters.However, the company’s Q1 revenue fell 3% year-over-year to $831 million, surpassing the $827.5 million prediction. To compare, rival Bumble saw its first-quarter revenue drop by over 7%, but still met analysts’ expectations.","Tinder's parent company, Match Group, is reportedly taking on major cost-cutting measures.

Huawei’s AI chip: A direct challenge to Nvidia’s H100

The Street

Jensen Huang’s warning to US lawmakers

The strategic importance of AI chip manufacturing



Impact on Nvidia’s business strategy

The landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware is undergoing a significant shift as Chinese technology companies ramp up efforts to challenge Nvidia’s long-standing dominance in the AI chip market. Nvidia, known for its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) that power some of the world’s most advanced AI systems, has seen its market leadership come under increasing pressure from emerging Chinese players.Recent moves by companies like DeepSeek and Huawei have not only caused jitters among investors but have also prompted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to raise concerns about the long-term impact on US technological leadership.For years, Nvidia has been the undisputed leader in the AI hardware sector, providing the powerful GPUs that fuel machine learning and AI systems for major tech firms like Tesla, Meta, and OpenAI. Its H100 GPUs, part of the Hopper architecture, are considered some of the most advanced AI chips globally, known for their exceptional performance in large-scale deep learning tasks and high-performance computing.Nvidia’s dominance is partly due to its early recognition of the AI boom and the strategic shift from gaming-focused GPUs to AI accelerators. This foresight allowed Nvidia to secure critical partnerships with leading AI firms and establish itself as the backbone of the AI revolution, resulting in soaring revenues and a market capitalization that has crossed the trillion-dollar mark.However, the landscape is changing rapidly as Chinese tech giants, spurred by geopolitical tensions and export restrictions, begin to develop their own AI hardware, potentially undermining Nvidia’s global market share.In January, Chinese startup DeepSeek triggered alarm within the industry when it released an AI model based on older Nvidia chips, according to a report by The Street. Despite utilizing less advanced hardware, the model demonstrated impressive performance, sparking a significant selloff in Nvidia’s stock. This development highlighted the risk that lower-cost, domestically produced alternatives could threaten Nvidia’s dominant position, particularly in the price-sensitive Chinese market.The impact of DeepSeek’s model went beyond a temporary stock drop. It signaled that Chinese companies could potentially close the technological gap with Western chipmakers, leveraging existing hardware to build competitive AI solutions. This move effectively challenged Nvidia’s core business model, which relies on premium pricing for its cutting-edge GPUs.The competitive pressure intensified further when Huawei, a global leader in telecommunications and electronics, announced plans to test its own AI chip, directly challenging Nvidia’s flagship H100 GPUs. Huawei’s new chip, which is designed to compete head-to-head with Nvidia’s most powerful AI hardware, represents a significant technological leap for the Chinese company.According to, the emergence of Huawei’s AI chip has raised concerns within Nvidia, as it threatens to cut into its lucrative AI chip market share. If Huawei’s chips prove to be competitive in both performance and cost, they could attract major customers, especially within China, where companies face restrictions on purchasing US-made chips.In response to these developments, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently met with the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee to express his concerns about the growing competitive threat from China, according to the same report. Huang reportedly emphasized that US export controls, which limit the sale of advanced AI chips to China, could inadvertently accelerate the rise of Chinese chipmakers like Huawei.Huang warned that if US companies are unable to serve the Chinese market, local firms will turn to strategic competitors like Huawei to fill the gap, potentially shifting global demand away from US technologies. He highlighted the risk that Chinese firms could develop highly optimized, open-source AI models designed specifically to run on domestically produced chips, further eroding Nvidia’s competitive edge.As Huang reportedly stated, “If US platforms are absent, companies will turn to strategic competitors like Huawei to fill the gap.” This statement underscores the complex balance Nvidia must strike between complying with US trade restrictions and maintaining its leadership in the global AI market.The stakes in this battle are particularly high, as AI chip manufacturing has become a critical component of national security and economic competitiveness. Advanced AI chips are essential for a wide range of applications, from autonomous vehicles and medical research to military systems and financial trading.By investing heavily in domestic chip production, China aims to reduce its reliance on foreign technology and secure a dominant position in the global AI economy. This strategy is aligned with the Chinese government’s broader ambitions to lead in emerging technologies like 5G, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence.Faced with this growing threat, Nvidia must adapt its business strategy to remain competitive. This includes potentially shifting more manufacturing and R&D to regions less affected by geopolitical tensions, investing in next-generation chip technologies, and forming strategic partnerships to maintain its technological edge.Additionally, Nvidia may need to engage more actively with US policymakers to ensure that export controls are calibrated in a way that protects national security without undermining the competitiveness of American technology firms.",The landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware is undergoing a significant shift as Chinese technology companies ramp up efforts to challenge Nvidia’s dominance in the AI chip market.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently shared his vision of the future of manufacturing, saying factories will soon be run by robots, with humans working alongside them. Speaking at Milken Institute’s Global Conference 2025 event, Huang said:“In the future, the factory will be one gigantic robot orchestrating a whole bunch of robots inside, working with people to build products that are robotics.So you have robots building robots building robots.”A clip from the event was shared by a user on X which caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk . In agreement with Huang’s point, Musk responded to the post, saying “he’s not wrong”.Huang further added that this shift will create a need for what he called ‘physical AI’ – a type of artificial intelligence designed to manage physical machines in factories.“And this nested layer of technology is nearly upon us. That application for manufacturing, industrialization, plants and factories, and that entire area needs this new AI called physical AI” Huang said.“If we can solve that, we're talking about trillions and trillions of dollars of industries,” he added.During the conference, Huang also talked about the impact of AI on jobs. He said “You will not lose your job to AI, but will lose it to someone who uses it”.Suggesting to download softwares like Perplexity and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, he added “I recommend 100% take advantage of AI, don't be that person.”","Jensen Huang said factories will soon be run by robots, with humans working alongside them.

Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-know-about-facebook-founders-viral-rawdog-routine/articleshow/120843936.cms,"Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

‘rawdog’ morning routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well.

Microsoft becomes world's most-valuable company and its No 1 position also has 'Trump Tariff' message on Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-company-and-its-no-1-position-also-has-trump-tariff-message-on-apple/articleshow/120845348.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella



Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools

Google claims breakup ""impossible"" without serious consequences

The US Justice Department have asked a federal judge to break up Google's advertising technology business, marking the second government request within a year that could fundamentally reshape the $2 trillion giant. During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

Advice for startups

Tony Fadell , the inventor of the iPod and founder of smart home company Nest, said Silicon Valley's lavish perks are hurting innovation and urgency in tech companies. Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, Fadell, who has worked with both Google and Apple, shared how the two companies have very different work cultures. “At Apple, you couldn't hide,"" Fadell said.""Everyone was critical.""On the contrary, the culture at Google was much more relax. Fadell, who sold Nest to Google for $3.2 billion, said “You were lucky if they even showed up… They'd take the bus in for lunch, get a massage, grab yogurt, and head home”.Criticizing Google's famous ""20 percent time"" policy that lets engineers work on side projects, he said too much freedom breeds ""mediocrity.""“It will mess up your culture"" if you hire 15-year “career Googlers”,"" Fadell added.When Google acquired Nest in 2014, Nest reportedly struggled under Google’s looser, bottom-up management style. As per a report by the New Yorker, this clash of cultures contributed to Fadell’s departure in 2016 and led Google to rethink how it handles new tech projects.Apple’s strict, top-down management style, on the other hand, has been studied in places like Harvard Business Review as a model for keeping creativity high without losing control.Sharing his advice for startups, Fadell said ""Entitlement everywhere"" is a hidden cost that no amount of funding, wellness programs, or free kombucha can fix. Do not mistake fancy office perks for real productivity, he advised.Fadell’s views on workplace culture go back to his early days at General Magic in the 1990s, where leaders promised not to hire ""East Coast"" executives who expected luxury perks like drivers and special toilets. Fadell believes the tech industry today is full of that same entitlement, which he says can ""kill the hustle"" needed for real breakthroughs.","Tony Fadell, the inventor of the iPod and founder of smart home company Nest, said Silicon Valley's lavish perks are hurting innovation and urgency in tech companies.

Starlink India operations: What changed in the news rules

What next for Starlink

Elon Musk’s Starlink has reportedly cleared a significant regulatory barrier for its entry into the Indian market. According to a report by The Economic Times, the company has obtained a Letter of Intent (LoI) for a license from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to provide satellite internet in the country. The report said that this progress comes after Starlink agreed to a revised set of conditions.Citing an official familiar with the matter, ET reported that the LoI for grant of Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) permit comes after Musk’s company complied with the security conditions issued on Monday (May 5).Starlink's acceptance of the newly released security conditions, a step crucial for its India entry, followed a significant development: the government opted to exclude two proposed rules that Starlink had refused to accept during earlier discussions.Sources familiar with the matter told the publication that Starlink was particularly hesitant about requirements related to special monitoring zones near borders and the mandatory majority Indian shareholding for satellite communication firms.The government ultimately dropped these specific clauses from the final security guidelines. Regarding border monitoring, the initial proposal included zones 10 km across and 50 km within the international border. Starlink had reportedly stated it could not monitor users outside India's territory. The DoT removed the 10 km “across border” rule, citing its inconsistency with the Telegraph Act, but kept the 50 km ""within border"" requirement.The proposed majority Indian shareholding rule was also removed, as the DoT determined that foreign investment should be regulated under existing FDI policy, which allows up to 100% FDI in telecom subject to certain conditions Starlink had already agreed to meet. The exclusion of these contested rules smoothed the path for Starlink to obtain its GMPCS license.The path forward includes securing approval from space regulator IN-SPACe, followed by potential test spectrum allocation and ultimately, commercial spectrum allocation from DoT, a process also awaited by competitors like Eutelsat OneWeb and Jio-SES.With the nod, Starlink will soon join satcom permit holders Bharti Group-backed OneWeb Eutelsat and Jio-SES. Startlink will likely offer mobility services along with the GMPCS licence while Eutelsat OneWeb and Jio-SES will have to seek the permission separately.The updated security framework, applicable to all market entrants and existing players, includes stringent measures covering data localisation, tracking, and potential local manufacturing commitments, all within a burgeoning Indian space economy projected for substantial growth.","Elon Musk’s Starlink has reportedly cleared a significant regulatory barrier for its entry into the Indian market.

""But it's not their fault.It's the way these technologies were designed.""Druga, who created the AI education platform Cognimates , argues that students should be developing AI literacy ""as early as they can speak"" and learning to use AI tools as creative partners rather than homework solvers.According to Druga, the problem lies partly in outdated educational frameworks. ""We should be changing the whole framework. First of all, if an AI can solve a test, it's the wrong test,"" she said.She believes assignments should be redesigned to be less cut-and-dried, making them more resistant to AI completion while encouraging critical thinking and creative problem-solving.""We need to change how we teach and assess,"" Druga emphasized. ""But we also need to change how we design these tools in order to make room for young people's agency, young people's creativity.""Despite concerns that ""coding is dead,"" Druga maintains that coding education remains valuable but requires a refresh. Rather than preparing students for specific tech roles that may soon be obsolete, she advocates teaching transferable skills that help people adapt to ambiguity.""What we're seeing with AI right now — in large language models and other architectures that are coming after large language models — is that the technology is changing so fast,"" she explained.Druga's platform, Cognimates, takes a Socratic approach, posing questions to guide users without providing direct answers. This encourages children to develop their own projects and solutions, fostering a sense of ownership and pride in their work.""The goal is to make sure that everyone feels like this is for me,"" she said, emphasizing the importance of making AI accessible to all young people r","Google DeepMind research scientist Stefania Druga believes young people are using artificial intelligence in disappointing ways.

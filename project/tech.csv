Shark Tank India Judge Anupam Mittal on why AI won’t replace humans anytime soon: ‘The brain runs on 20 watts’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/shark-tank-india-judge-anupam-mittal-on-why-ai-wont-replace-humans-anytime-soon-the-brain-runs-on-20-watts/articleshow/126068827.cms,"Read Anupam Mittal’s complete post here



‘Is AI about to replace humans?’

Short answer: Not anytime soon

To match a single human brain using today’s AI approaches, you’d need something close to a football-field-sized data centre running flat out - just to mimic how one person sees, thinks, learns, and decides in real time.

All that to replicate what your brain does on 20 watts.

If you go further and try to replicate the brain 𝘣𝘪𝘰𝘭𝘰𝘨𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺- neurons, synapses, chemistry, plasticity - you’re no longer talking about a data center.

Theoretically, it can be done but you need a computer the size of planet Earth 🌍

That’s the gap people forget 🤷

AI is exceptional at automation, repetition, and pattern extraction at scale.

But judgment, creativity, context, taste, and knowing when 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘢𝘤𝘵 aren’t just more parameters.

They’ve evolved over millions of years & are emergent properties of a system that learns continuously, reasons across domains, and compresses reality with extreme efficiency.

Until we see a fundamental shift in how intelligence is computed - not just bigger models and more GPUs - replacing human creativity isn’t a near-term threat.

The real miracle of the brain isn’t intelligence.

It’s all the complexity that fits inside your skull, runs on sugar and oxygen, and dissipates less heat than a light bulb.

That’s the human flex AI can’t replicate 😅





Shark Tank India judge and Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal has now shared his opinion on the ongoing debate of whether AI will replace human or not. Mittal argues that the technology is still far from replicating the complexity of the human bran. In a widely shared post titled “Is AI about to replace humans?”, Mittal offered a short answer: “Not anytime soon.” In a lengthy post shared on professional networking platform LinkedIn, Mittal explained that to match a single human brain using today’s AI approaches, one would need a football-field-sized data center running at full capacity—just to mimic how one person sees, thinks, learns, and decides in real time. He emphasised that by contrast the human brain performs all these tasks on just 20 watts of energy which is less than that of a household light bulb.Mittal also noted that replicating the human brain biologically neurons, synapses, chemistry, and plasticity would actually need a computer the size of planet Earth. “That’s the gap people forget,” he wrote. Mittal does acknowledge the fact that AI is exceptional at the tasks like automation, repetition and pattern extraction at scale but believes that qualities like creativity, judgement, context, resistant and taster are not the parameters to compute.“These have evolved over millions of years and are emergent properties of a system that learns continuously, reasons across domains, and compresses reality with extreme efficiency,” he said.As per Mittal, replacing the human creativity would require a fundamental shift in how intelligence is computed, not just bigger models and more GPUs. Until then, he believes AI will remain a powerful tool but not a substitute for human ingenuity. “The real miracle of the brain isn’t intelligence,” he concluded. “It’s all the complexity that fits inside your skull, runs on sugar and oxygen, and dissipates less heat than a light bulb. That’s the human flex AI can’t replicate.”",Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal has shared his opinion on whether AI will replace human or not.

Texas seeks penalties and restrictions over ACR data collection





Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has sued five large TV manufacturers in the US. Including LG, Samsung, Sony, TCL and Hisense, the lawsuit claims that their smart TVs spy on users without their consent. Paxton’s office released an official release where it said: “These companies have been unlawfully collecting personal data through Automated Content Recognition (‘ACR’) technology.” It stated that ACR in its simplest terms is an uninvited, invisible digital invader. This software, the lawsuit alleges, can capture screenshots of a user’s television display every 500 milliseconds, monitor viewing activity in real time, and transmit that information back to the company without the user’s knowledge or consent.“The companies then sell that consumer information to target ads across platforms for a profit. This technology puts users’ privacy and sensitive information, such as passwords, bank information, and other personal information at risk,” the lawsuit claims.“This conduct is invasive, deceptive, and unlawful,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said adding “The fundamental right to privacy will be protected in Texas because owning a television does not mean surrendering your personal information to Big Tech or foreign adversaries.”The lawsuits alleges the companies violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and ask for damages of up to $10,000 for each violation, and up to $250,000 for violations involving people aged 65 or older. Texas is also seeking restraining orders that would stop the companies from collecting, sharing, or selling ACR data while the cases move forward.The release also pointed out that Hisense and TCl based China-based companies. “Chinese ties pose serious concerns about consumer data harvesting and are exacerbated by China’s National Security Law, which gives its government the capability to get its hands on US consumer data,” the lawsuit claims.“Companies, especially those connected to the Chinese Communist Party, have no business illegally recording Americans’ devices inside their own homes,” Paxton said. “This conduct is invasive, deceptive, and unlawful. The fundamental right to privacy will be protected in Texas because owning a television does not mean surrendering your personal information to Big Tech or foreign adversaries.”","Texas seeks penalties and restrictions over ACR data collection technology.

Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, storied chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang, while his longer-term research was hit hard by the recent cuts.",Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard at Facebook-parent Meta Platforms.

Mustafa Suleyman’s AI system warning





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.He warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.",Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ He also said that Copilot is “amazing for vision.

What made Greer Stone take on city's Billionaires





Palo Alto, the city known as the birthplace of Silicon Valley, seems to be upset with its Billionaires. According to a report in New York Times, Palo Alto is planning to confront its billionaire residents over their housing compounds. As a report in New York Times says, ""The town used to house just your average well-to-do people. Doctors, lawyers, executives and Stanford University professors lived in comfortable bungalows on tree-lined streets, and one house per family was considered enough. Then the tech boom created tremendous wealth, and the billionaires moved in. Some bought several homes on adjacent plots and left a few empty, or turned them into office spaces for their employees. Some hired security guards to shoo people away from public sidewalks. Construction work seemed endless."" Now, it seems the city had enough.Greer Stone, a Palo Alto City Council member, reportedly plans to introduce legislation that would restrict the way the town’s richest homeowners can operate. A high school teacher, Stone told NYT that his aim is to ensure that city is as much about protecting residents from neighborhood chaos as it is about addressing the wealth disparity that is claims has forced middle-class residents out of his city.“To see other people take housing out of the housing stock in such a flippant way is frustrating,” Stone said in an interview. “The growing discrepancy between the top 1% and the rest of us has never been more clear.”Stone added that his legislation would aim to stop billionaires. His list of Not-To-Dos for the city's billionaires include:* Cannot take over the streets with construction equipment and delivery trucks.* Demolition, rebuilding and remodeling cannot continue in perpetuity.* Cannot leave spare homes permanently empty, and no more unmarked security vehicles.Stone said that he had heard neighborhood complaints for years, but he sought to address the situation in earnest after The New York Times in August published two articles on the ruckus caused by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Palo Alto compound. In August this year, NYT published a scathing story on how neighbors of Mark Zuckerberg are furious that he has forced them to endure years of construction, surveillance, noise, traffic blockages and a loss of street parking as assembled a compound of 11 homes in Palo Alto’s Crescent Park neighborhood. The eight years of ongoing construction have clogged streets with heavy equipment, blocked driveways, and, residents say, knocked mirrors off parked cars, according to the Times.They claim that he has benefitted from preferential treatment from the city. Since arriving in 2011, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have reportedly amassed at least 11 properties in the city. Five homes were folded into an expansive private compound for the couple and their three daughters, outfitted with guesthouses, lush gardens, a pickleball court and a pool with a hydrofloor cover, according to the New York Post.","Palo Alto City Council member Greer Stone plans to introduce legislation that would restrict the way the town's richest homeowners can operate.

USTR's complete post targetting EU





America seems to be staring at another rocky relationship with the European Union. In a social media post, US officials slammed the European Union for discriminating against American technology companies and threatened to penalize European tech companies in return. The post comes from the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTP). For those unaware, USTR stands for the Office of the United States Trade Representative, a US government agency within the Executive Office of the President, responsible for advising the President and developing/implementing U.S. international trade policy, negotiating trade agreements, and resolving trade disputes.In the post, US officials have complained that the EU has not walked back broader regulation of company business practices while also proceeding with investigations of major American technology companies such as Google, Twitter, Apple, Amazon and Meta. The post specifically names certain European companies that it said enjoy access to the huge American market without any restrictions whatsoever. The European companies that face America ire include: Accenture, Amadeus, Capgemini, DHL, Mistral, Publicis, SAP, Siemens and Spotify.USTR's long post blamed EU of “persisted in a continuing course of discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives” against American companies. It singled out potential European service providers that could be targeted by name. Here's the complete post:""The European Union and certain EU Member States have persisted in a continuing course of discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines, and directives against U.S.service providers. U.S. services companies provide substantial free services to EU citizens and reliable enterprise services to EU companies, and they support millions of jobs and more than $100 billion in direct investment in Europe. The United States has raised concerns with the EU for years on these matters without meaningful engagement or basic acknowledgement of U.S. concerns.In stark contrast, EU service providers have been able to operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field. Some of the largest EU service providers that have hitherto enjoyed this expansive market access include, among others:— Accenture— Amadeus— Capgemini— DHL— Mistral— Publicis— SAP— Siemens— SpotifyIf the EU and EU Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures. Should responsive measures be necessary, U. law permits the assessment of fees or restrictions on foreign services, among other actions. The United States will take a similar approach to other countries that pursue an EU-style strategy in this area.""","US officials slammed the European Union for discriminating against American technology companies and threatened to penalize European tech companies in return.

Kristin Cabot says she got death threats







Kristin Cabot, the former Head of HR at tech firm Astronomer, has spoken on the viral scandal that cost her a career. After months of silence she addressed the “Kiss Cam” moment, blaming the incident on a “bad decision” fueled by “a couple of High Noons. ” Cabot admitted she acted inappropriately with her then-CEO, Andy Byron . The 16-second public display of affection, captured on a giant screen of a Coldplay concert and broadcast to millions online, left the 53-year-old executive a “meme” and, by her own admission, “unemployable.”In an interview published in The New York Times on Thursday, Cabot described what led to the viral movement and how she was treated after she was seen cuddling with her boss, saying it was a lapse in judgment. She admitted that she developed a “big happy crush” on Byron, particularly after learning he was in the midst of a marital split.“I made a bad decision and had a couple of High Noons and danced and acted inappropriately with my boss,” she told the publication, adding, “And it’s not nothing. And I took accountability and I gave up my career for that. That’s the price I chose to pay.”“I wanted to put a cute outfit on and go out and dance and laugh and have a great night.And that’s how it was tracking,” Cabot said in the interview.Despite a “part of my brain jumping up and down” warning her to stop, Cabot says she was “on top of the world” in the moments before the camera panned to them.“I took accountability and I gave up my career for that. That’s the price I chose to pay,” she added.Cabot also said that she was doxxed and received 500 or 600 calls a day for weeks. She said she had to face the ‘paparazzi’ who camped across the street from her house, and cars ‘parade’ in her block. She also claimed that she got death threats: “Not 900. That showed up in People magazine. I got 50 or 60,” she said.“I want my kids to know that you can make mistakes, and you can really screw up. But you don’t have to be threatened to be killed for them,” she added.","Kristin Cabot, the former Head of HR at tech firm Astronomer, has spoken on the viral scandal that cost her a career.

TikTok to mandate five-day office return for US staff next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktok-to-mandate-five-day-office-return-for-us-staff-next-year/articleshow/126061268.cms,"



TikTok is directing many of its US employees to return to the office five days a week starting next year, reports Business Insider. Citing employees familiar with the company’s plans, the report says TikTok has told staff across several large divisions that they will need to return to the office from September 2026. The move marks one of the company’s most significant return-to-office (RTO) requirements to date and will apply across several large teams. TikTok and its parent company ByteDance set office attendance rules by team. As previously reported by the publication, the company's e-commerce division, TikTok Shop, already has a five-day return-to-office requirement and has previously tracked the number of hours workers spent on site.TikTok employees said the five-day RTO requirement will begin in September and will affect staff working in advertising sales, marketing, product and other functions. One employee said they expect most of TikTok’s US workforce to return full-time.The BI report says that TikTok’s long-term RTO plans could shift depending on the potential sale of its US operations. ByteDance is required to divest most of its US business under a 2024 law.The Trump administration said in September it was prepared to approve a $14 billion sale to a consortium that could include Oracle, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch.The shift comes as more major companies tighten in-person attendance rules after years of flexible and remote work. Industry-wide, RTO mandates are increasing, with firms such as Dell, JPMorgan and Amazon also pushing employees back into physical offices.Instagram has already announced that it plans to require US employees to return five days a week starting in February next year. ""I believe that we are more creative and collaborative when we are together in-person,"" Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri wrote in a memo. Amazon has also taken a more aggressive approach to RTO mandating its employees to relocate to hubs.AT&T has also insisted on a five-day RTO earlier this year. CEO John Stankey said in August earlier this year said that workers who felt virtual or hybrid work was ""essential"" would have trouble aligning their priorities with the company and its culture.Other firms, like Spotify, have maintained more flexible policies. In 2024, the company’s former HR chief said that its work-from-anywhere policy was rooted in the idea that ""you can't spend a lot of time hiring grown-ups and then treat them like children.""",TikTok is directing many of its US employees to return to the office five days a week starting next year.

When it is finalized, this new company will be able to pursue its aim of starting plant construction in 2026.Fusion power plants would produce electricity using the same process that powers the Sun, an objective that researchers have pursued for years.However, no commercially viable facility has been built despite decades of development.This uncommon partnership emerges as the Trump administration promotes energy-intensive AI technology that will necessitate a substantial expansion of power generation capacity.AI data centres are putting growing pressure on US electrical grids, and the White House is advocating expedited approval of energy projects to meet demand.TAE Technologies, established in 1998, claims its fusion technology could provide abundant electricity to support AI infrastructure.The California-headquartered company has constructed five fusion reactors and has a workforce of more than 400 people, including 62 individuals with PhD degrees, according to a statement.The firm has managed to raise over $1.3 billion from investors such as Google , Chevron, and Goldman Sachs. It has also promised to provide a cash contribution of a maximum of $300 million to TAE.Trump Media has also launched various projects in the past few months, such as financial services based on cryptocurrency and online video streaming, though their revenue during the first half-year period of 2025 was merely $1.7 million.","The parent firm of US President Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social, Trump Media, a fusion energy firm called TAE, has merged.

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis recently shared his long-standing passion: World models and simulations. While the AI industry largely remains fixated on developing Large Language Models (LLMs), Hassabis is looking toward a different system to advance AI technology. Hassabis argues that while AI has mastered human language, it still lacks the “intuitive physics” required to function effectively in the physical world – something that is necessary for robotics to thrive.Speaking at an interview, Hassabis noted that language models like Gemini or GPT have exceeded expectations in their understanding of the world, proving that human language is far richer than even linguists imagined. However, he pointed out a fundamental gap: the physical world cannot be fully described in words.“There's still a lot about the spatial dynamics of the world, spatial awareness, and the physical context we're in – and how that works mechanically – that is hard to describe in words,” Hassabis explained.He cited sensory experiences such as motor angles, smell and the subtle mechanics of movement as elements that are nearly impossible to capture in a text data, pushing for beyond reading and start “experiencing.”“One way to show how do you test you have that kind of understanding? Well, can you generate realistic worlds? Because if you can generate it, then in a sense, the system must have encapsulated a lot of the mechanics of the world,” he said.Recently, Rodney Brooks, the roboticist who co-founded iRobot also said that current AI technology faces a biological barrier and for robotics to succeed as envisioned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, robots must replicate human function, like mastering the complexity of human touch.He said that while today’s AI has mastered speech recognition and image processing due to vast available datasets, sensing touch cannot be learnt through these datasets.“We do not have such a tradition for touch data. Today's humanoid robots will not learn how to be dexterous despite the hundreds of millions, or perhaps many billions of dollars, being donated by VCs and major tech companies to pay for their training,"" Brooks said in a blog post.","Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says AI lacks the physics required to function effectively in the physical world.

Two important words that make Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman reject Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's 'high-flying pay packages',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/two-important-words-that-make-microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-reject-meta-ceo-mark-zuckerbergs-high-flying-pay-packages/articleshow/126059869.cms,"Mustafa Suleyman’s hiring mantra: Culture over compensation







Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has distanced the company’s hiring process from the multi-million-dollar spending of his rivals like Facebook-parent Meta as Silicon Valley witnesses an increasing “talent war” to gain momentum in the AI space. Specifically, Suleyman has identified two words that define his recruitment strategy of AI talent, rejecting the idea of astronomical pay packages: Team and Culture.Speaking on a recent Bloomberg Podcast, Suleyman addressed the industry’s soaring compensation trends, where Meta has offered signing bonuses and salary packages that have reached as much as $250 million and offering engineers $100 million signing bonuses.While these figures have dominated headlines, Suleyman remains unimpressed, suggesting that throwing money at individuals is not a substitute for building a cohesive unit.“I think that Zuck's taken a particular approach that involves sort of hiring a lot of individuals rather than maybe creating a team. I don't really think that's the right approach,” Suleyman said.Instead, he said that Microsoft AI focuses on “selective hiring”, prioritising candidates who align with the team’s specific culture and mission – a practice he honed during his tenure at DeepMind.The top executive also pointed out that the company doesn’t want to outbid competitors for the most famous names in the field.While talking about companies hiring people from competitors, Suleyman acknowledged that shortage of AI talent pool. He noted that due to small number of talent, a constant “rotation” of experts between the “Big Five” tech firms is being seen.“There's certainly no 'no-poach' agreements; that would not be legal. People can go work for whoever they want to work for,"" Suleyman clarified.Notably, Meta has invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI and then secured the expertise of CEO Alexandr Wang. Google also acquired the leadership of AI coding platform Windsurf in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman previously revealed that Meta tried to poach his staff with $100 million bonuses.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has distanced the company’s hiring process from the multi-million-dollar spending of his rivals like Facebook-parent Meta.

Apple has announced that it will allow alternative app stores on iPhones in Japan. The change is driven by the new competition laws which are aimed at curbing the dominance of major tech platforms. This move also mirrors similar regulatory pressures in the European Union and represents one of the most significant shifts in Apple’s tightly controlled ecosystem.As part of the new framework, the Japanese developers will now be able to launchtheir own app marketplace on iPhones. Apple will charge 5% of the sales made via those marketplaces and apps as compared with its longstanding 30% commission on in-app purchases. Along with this developers will also be permitted to offer their in-app payment systems along with Apple’s proprietary payment option.This change comes in response to Japan’s Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA), which was enacted to foster innovation and reduce costs for consumers by breaking Apple’s monopoly over app distribution.Japan joins the EU and other jurisdictions in challenging Apple’s App Store model.For years, developers criticized Apple’s high commission fees and restrictions on alternative payment systems. Regulators argued that such practices stifled competition and inflated costs for consumers.By opening iPhones to alternative app stores, Japan hopes to stimulate competition in the digital economy, giving smaller developers more freedom and potentially lowering app prices.Apple emphasized that while it is complying with the new law, it remains focused on user safety and privacy. The company warned that alternative app marketplaces could introduce new risks, including malware, fraud, and scams. Apple said it has implemented safeguards to minimize these risks while still meeting regulatory requirements.",Apple has announced that it will allow alternative app stores on iPhones in Japan.

Paramount offer to Warner Bros: The trust debate

Netflix Drops A $72b Bombshell On Hollywood With Mega Warner Bros Discovery Move | WHAT IT MEANS

The Battle Ahead

Warner Bros Discovery writes letter to shareholders, calls Paramount offer ‘misleading’

Read the full letter Warner Bros Discovery board sent to its shareholders

In the letter sent to WBD’s shareholders, the company’s board of directors wrote:

“Dear Fellow Shareholders,As your Board of Directors, we are committed to acting in your best interest. In this spirit, in October, we launched a public review of strategic alternatives to maximise shareholder value. This followed three separate proposals from Paramount Skydance (“PSKY”), as well as interest from multiple other parties.

That thorough process, overseen by the Board with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors, as well as our management team, led to the company entering into a merger agreement with Netflix on December 4, with the substantial benefits to WBD shareholders described below. Having failed to submit the best proposal for you, our shareholders,

PSKY

launched an offer nearly identical to its most recently rejected proposal.

As a Board, we have now conducted another review and determined that PSKY’s tender offer remains inferior to the Netflix merger. The Board continues to unanimously recommend the Netflix merger, and that you reject the PSKY offer and not tender your shares.

Below, and in more detail in our 14D-9 filing, we highlight the many reasons for the Board’s determination. None of these reasons will be a surprise to PSKY given our clear, and oft-repeated, feedback on their six prior proposals.

The terms of the Netflix merger are superior. The PSKY offer provides inadequate value and imposes numerous, significant risks and costs on WBD.

The value we have secured for shareholders through the Netflix merger is extraordinary by any measure.

Our agreement with Netflix gives WBD shareholders $23.25 in cash, plus $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock (based on a collar range of $97.91 - $119.67 in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing), plus the additional value of the shares of Discovery Global and the opportunity to participate in future potential upside following Discovery Global’s separation from WBD. The entire Board is confident in our recommendation that Netflix represents the best value-creating path for shareholders.

PSKY has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a “full backstop” from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has.

PSKY’s most recent proposal includes a $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind. Instead, they propose that you rely on an unknown and opaque revocable trust for the certainty of this crucial deal funding. Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was – and despite their own ample resources, as well as multiple assurances by PSKY during our strategic review process that such a commitment was forthcoming – the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer.

And a revocable trust is no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling stockholder. The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change. As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time. And the documents provided by PSKY for this conditional commitment contain gaps, loopholes and limitations that put you, our shareholders, and our company at risk.

Amplifying the concerns about the credibility of the equity commitment being offered by PSKY, the revocable trust and PSKY have agreed that the trust’s liability for damages, even in the case of a willful breach, would be capped at 7% of its commitment ($2.8 billion on a $108.4 billion transaction). Of course, the damage to WBD and its stockholders were the trust or PSKY to breach their obligations to close a transaction would likely be many multiples of this amount.

WBD’s merger agreement with Netflix is a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments. The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet. The debt financing for the PSKY bid relies on an unsecure revocable trust commitment as well as the credit worthiness of a $15 billion market cap company with a credit rating at or only a notch above “junk” status from the two leading rating agencies. The financial condition and creditworthiness of PSKY, which, if its proposed transaction were to close, would have a high gross leverage ratio of 6.8x 2026E debt to EBITDA with virtually no current free cash flow generation before synergies, raise substantial risks for its acquisition of WBD. Such debt levels reflect a risky capital structure that is vulnerable to even potentially small changes in the PSKY or WBD business between signing and closing.

Additionally, PSKY contemplates $9 billion in synergies from the mergers of Paramount/Skydance and their offer for WBD. These targets are both ambitious from an operational perspective and would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.

The Board’s review was full, transparent and competitive – establishing a level playing field that fostered a rigorous and fair process.

The Board repeatedly engaged with all parties, including extensive engagement with PSKY and its advisors over the course of nearly three months. We held dozens of calls and meetings with its principals and advisors including four in-person meetings and meals between David Zaslav and David and/or Larry Ellison and provided multiple opportunities for PSKY to offer a proposal that was superior to those of the other bidders, which PSKY never did.

After each bid, we informed PSKY of the material deficiencies and offered potential solutions. Despite this feedback, PSKY has never submitted a proposal that is superior to the Netflix merger agreement.

Despite PSKY’s media statements to the contrary, the Board does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk between the PSKY offer and the Netflix merger.

The Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the PSKY offer with its regulatory advisors. The Board believes that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material. The Board also notes that Netflix has agreed to a record-setting regulatory termination cash fee of $5.8 billion, significantly higher than PSKY’s $5 billion break fee.

The PSKY offer is illusory.

The offer can be terminated or amended by PSKY at any time prior to its completion; it is not the same thing as a binding merger agreement. The first paragraph of the offer states it is “subject to the conditions set forth in this offer to purchase (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time)” and continues on the next page, “we reserve the right to amend the Offer in any respect (including amending the Offer Price)”. In addition, the offer is not capable of being completed by its current expiration date, due to the need for, among other things, global regulatory approvals, which PSKY indicates may take 12-18 months. Nothing in this structure offers WBD shareholders any deal certainty.

The PSKY offer provides an untenable degree of risk and potential downside for WBD shareholders.

There will be additional costs associated with PSKY’s offer that could impact shareholders.

When considering the PSKY offer at this juncture, it is important to note that its acceptance could incur significant additional costs to shareholders – all of which PSKY has ignored in their communications. WBD would have to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee, which PSKY has not offered to reimburse. In addition, WBD would incur approximately $1.5 billion in financing costs if we do not complete our planned debt exchange as agreed to with certain of our debtholders, which would not be permitted by the PSKY offer. This additional $4.3 billion in potential costs represents approximately $1.66 per share to be borne by WBD shareholders if the offer does not close.

We look forward to moving ahead with our combination with Netflix and delivering the compelling and certain value it will create for shareholders. We urge you to carefully read the 14D-9 filed with the SEC this morning and available on our website, which more fully details the strategic review process and the Board’s reasons for its recommendation to you.

Sincerely,

The Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors”





Warner Brothers Discovery (WBD) has pushed back against Paramount Skydance’s $77.9 billion hostile takeover bid, telling Oracle founder Larry Ellison that his family trust is now sufficient assurance. As reported by The Wall Street Journal the company has urged the shareholders to reject Ellison-led proposal, citing financial concerns and calling Ellison himself to sign a stronger personal guarantee for the deal to happen. Warner said that Ellison family’s use of a revocable trust to backstop the equity portion of the bid left “gaps, loopholes and limitations.” The company further stressed that it cannot know if Paramount’s all-cash offer will close unless Ellison himself provides deeper commitment. “If you want to buy our company, sign on the dotted line yourself,” Warner’s message to Ellison read.* In order to acquire WBD Paramount made the big of$77.9 billion. The bid made by the David Ellison company tops Netflix’s $72 billion offer.* After the hostile bidding done by Paramount, Waner claims that the offer made by Netflix is more transparent: Netflix would acquire Warner’s studio and HBO Max streaming businesses, while shareholders would retain ownership of a spinoff housing cable networks like CNN and TNT.* Paramount’s financing includes $40.7 billion in equity commitments and $54 billion in debt from Bank of America, Citigroup, and Apollo. Of that, the Ellison family pledged $11.8 billion, alongside $24 billion from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds and RedBird Capital Partners.Paramount insists that Warner is misleading the shareholders saying the Ellison family trust is well-capitalized with over $250 billion in assets, including 1.16 billion Oracle shares and “tens of billions” in other holdings. It noted the trust has been a counterparty in major deals before, including Twitter.Warner, however, remains skeptical, arguing that only a direct personal guarantee from Larry Ellison would ensure the bid’s credibility.Paramount is lobbying shareholders and lawmakers, with David Ellison and chief legal officer Makan Delrahim recently meeting White House representatives and Sen. Ted Cruz. Meanwhile, Warner continues to highlight Netflix’s bid as superior. Analysts expect the fight to drag on. “We expect this roller coaster has many twists and turns and the winner will reshape the media landscape as we know it,” said Mark Boidman of Solomon Partners.Warner Bros Discovery’s (WBD) board of directors have unanimously rejected a $108 billion hostile takeover bid bid worth $108 billion from Paramount Skydance. In an almost 1,400-word letter to its shareholders (as reviewed by ScreenDaily), WBD's board described Paramount's proposal as “misleading” and “inadequate,” while reiterating its commitment to a merger agreement with Netflix, that was announced last week.","Warner Bros Discovery board calls Paramount Skydance offer ‘misleading’ The terms of the Netflix merger are superior.

This zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2025-20393, affects specific configurations and remains unpatched, forcing a rebuild of compromised systems. The US government has flagged it as a major threat, urging immediate action despite the lack of a fix.

Zero-day remains unpatched as attackers maintain persistence

CISA adds vulnerability to known exploited list





Cisco has issued an urgent security advisory after discovering Chinese state-sponsored hackers are actively exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability in its email security products, allowing attackers to execute commands with root privileges and install persistent backdoors on compromised systems.The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-20393 with a maximum CVSS score of 10.0, affects Cisco Secure Email Gateway and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager appliances running AsyncOS software. Cisco became aware of the attack campaign on December 10, though evidence suggests the attacks have been ongoing since at least late November 2025.According to Cisco Talos, the company's threat intelligence division, the campaign is attributed to UAT-9686, a threat actor assessed with moderate confidence to be a Chinese-nexus advanced persistent threat group. The attackers have deployed custom malware including AquaShell, a Python-based backdoor that provides persistent access to compromised systems.The vulnerability specifically targets appliances with the Spam Quarantine feature enabled and exposed to the internet. While this feature is not enabled by default and deployment guides do not recommend internet exposure, affected organizations face a significant challenge: no patches are currently available.Cisco's advisory explicitly states that rebuilding compromised appliances is ""currently, the only viable option to eradicate the threat actors persistence mechanism."" The company is working on a permanent remediation but has not provided a timeline for patch availability.The attackers' toolkit includes AquaTunnel for establishing reverse SSH connections, Chisel for traffic proxying that enables pivoting into internal networks, and AquaPurge for removing traces from log files. Security researcher Kevin Beaumont described the campaign as particularly problematic given that many large organizations use the affected products.The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has added CVE-2025-20393 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, instructing federal agencies to address the threat by December 24. However, without available patches, agencies face limited options beyond implementing Cisco's recommended hardening measures.Cisco strongly recommends organizations restrict appliance access to trusted hosts only, deploy filtering devices such as firewalls, separate mail and management functionality onto different network interfaces, and disable unnecessary network services including HTTP and FTP. Organizations should also verify whether their appliances have been compromised by checking if Spam Quarantine is enabled and internet-facing.Michael Taggart, senior cybersecurity researcher at UCLA Health Sciences, noted that the specific configuration requirements ""will limit the attack surface,"" though the severity remains critical for affected systems. Cisco has not disclosed the number of affected customers but encourages organizations to open Technical Assistance Center cases for compromise verification.All indicators of compromise, including IP addresses and file hashes associated with the campaign, have been blocked across Cisco's security portfolio and are available through the company's GitHub repository.","Chinese hackers are exploiting a critical Cisco email security flaw, gaining root access and installing backdoors.

Not a first when Elon Musk called money ‘irrelevant’





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has predicted that “there will be no poverty in the future”. Instead, he said that there will be universal high income. The tech billionaire also said that people would no longer need to save money. Elon Musk was responding on X (formerly Twitter) to a post by investor Ray Dalio about the newly announced Trump accounts initiative. Dalio had praised the effort, calling it a bipartisan move aimed at helping young Americans build financial knowledge and invest early. He also thanked Michael and Susan Dell for supporting the programme and said the initiative aligns with the ideas he shared six years ago in “Why and How Capitalism Needs To Be Reformed.”Dalio wrote that the Trump accounts are valuable because they introduce young people to basic financial skills and help them understand how markets and companies operate. He added that financial literacy and the ability to manage money well are essential for a strong economy, and that he plans to support both the accounts and related education efforts.Replying to Dalio’s message, Musk said: “It is certainly a nice gesture of the Dells, but there will be no poverty in the future and so no need to save money.There will be universal high income.”However, Elon Musk did not elaborate on how such a system would be achieved. The comments come amid separate discussions Musk has previously led about artificial intelligence, automation and the long-term economic effects of technology.This is not the first time when Elon Musk has shared his views on the relevance of money in the future. Speaking at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, D.C last month, Musk said that “assuming there’s a continued improvement in AI and robotics, which seems likely—money will stop being relevant.”He then also said that in the next 10 to 20 years, work will be optional. “My prediction is that work will be optional. It’ll be like playing sports or a video game or something like that,” Elon Musk said.“If you want to work, [it’s] the same way you can go to the store and just buy some vegetables, or you can grow vegetables in your backyard. It’s much harder to grow vegetables in your backyard, and some people still do it because they like growing vegetables,” he stated.","Elon Musk has predicted that “there will be no poverty in the future” Instead, he said that there will be universal high income.

The outage led to intermittent login failures, slow loading times and degraded app performance for several hours. Microsoft engineers deployed mitigation steps throughout the morning, rebalancing traffic across backup systems to stabilize services.The outage began around 12:00 am UTC (5:30 amIST), according to Microsoft’s status page. Users across Japan and China reported being unable to sign in to Microsoft 365 apps, with some experiencing repeated timeouts when accessing cloud-based files or using Copilot features.Microsoft confirmed that the disruption was limited to the Asia-Pacific region and said there was no indication of a cyberattack. Early assessments pointed to a routing misconfiguration that isolated parts of otherwise healthy infrastructure.Throughout the morning, Microsoft shared successive updates as mitigation progressed. At around 12:10 PM JST, engineers reported that traffic had been rebalanced across redundant systems and that services were returning to normal.In its latest post on X via Microsoft 365 Status, the company said: “After an extended period of monitoring, we confirmed that our mitigating actions resolved impact for users. For more information, please see MO1198797 in the admin center.”No data loss or security issues were reported. However, the downtime affected organizations dependent on Microsoft’s cloud tools for daily operations. Copilot-powered workflows, email access, file sync and internal communication channels experienced the most disruption.","Microsoft 365 services in Japan and China have been fully restored after widespread access and sign-in failures early Thursday. The regional outage affected essential tools including Outlook, Teams, OneDrive and Microsoft’s AI assistant Copilot. The outage led to intermittent login failures, slow loading times and degraded app performance for several hours.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126051050,imgsize-44888,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-365-services-restored.jpg"

Amazon Announces Landmark $35B Investment In India To Drive Digital Transformation

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s blog post





Amazon AI chief Rohit Prasad is leaving the company at the end of year. Confirming his exit, CEO Andy Jassy shared a blog post where he said that the e-commerce company is reorganizing the artificial generative intelligence (AGI) unit. Jassy also said that Amazon is adding an expansive division that will also include its silicon development and quantum computing teams. The new unit, he said, will be led by Peter DeSantis, a 27-year Amazon veteran currently serving as a senior vice president in its cloud unit.Rohit joined Amazon in 2013 during the early days of Alexa, and has helped build Alexa as a conversational AI. Recognizing Rohit Prasad’s work tenure, Jassy said he helped Alexa grow from an ambitious idea into a service that now touches hundreds of millions of customers' lives every day. “Rohit has built a strong team, differentiated technology, growing customer momentum, and a culture of ambitious invention. He’s been missionary, passionate, and selfless, and I'm grateful for his leadership, his technical vision, and everything he's built here. Thank you, Rohit,” he said in the post.“At Amazon, we often start new businesses in parts of the company where there’s an initial customer need, and as they grow and get momentum, we assess where they’re best situated to maximize potential for customers and Amazon over the long term.I believe we are at this inflection point with several of our new technologies that will power a significant amount of our future customer experiences,” Andy Jassy writes in the post.“I’ve asked Peter DeSantis to lead a new organization that drives our most expansive AI models (e.g. Nova—and the team we’ve called “AGI”), silicon development (e.g. Graviton, Trainium, Nitro), and quantum computing,” he added.At Amazon, we often start new businesses in parts of the company where there’s an initial customer need, and as they grow and get momentum, we assess where they’re best situated to maximize potential for customers and Amazon over the long term. I believe we are at this inflection point with several of our new technologies that will power a significant amount of our future customer experiences.I’ve asked Peter DeSantis to lead a new organization that drives our most expansive AI models (e.g. Nova—and the team we’ve called “AGI”), silicon development (e.g. Graviton, Trainium, Nitro), and quantum computing.I cannot think of a better leader for this organization than Peter. Peter has been at Amazon for over 27 years, and led some of the most transformative technologies in computing history. Peter was the leader of Amazon EC2 when we launched this revolutionary service in 2006, and built out that excellent team over many years. Under his leadership, we launched Block Storage, File Storage, Load Balancing, Networking, and Monitoring services that AWS customers continue to rely on to run their infrastructure. In 2015, Peter spearheaded the acquisition of Annapurna Labs, our outstanding team that builds our custom silicon, and continues to manage that team. In 2016, we asked Peter to lead our AWS Infrastructure team, who’s responsible for all of our data centers, networking, hardware, and associated supply chain. To give you an idea of scale, our infrastructure stretches across 38 geographic regions and 120 Availability Zones around the world. In 2021, Peter moved to lead all of our AWS Utility Computing services (e.g., compute, storage, database, analytics, various AI services, messaging, etc.), the combination of which is widely recognized as the industry leader and standard-setter in the cloud.Peter combines unusual technical depth with a track record of solving problems at the edge of what’s technically possible—and delivering technologies that operate reliably at massive scale. Peter embodies our leadership principles. His ability to invent, think big but be neck-deep in the details, insist on the highest standards, learn and be curious, focus on what matters to customers, and be right much of the time are among the many traits that make him so effective. With our Nova 2 models just launched at re:Invent, our custom silicon growing rapidly, and the advantages of optimizing across models, chips, and cloud software and infrastructure, we wanted to free Peter up to focus his energy, invention cycles, and leadership on these new areas. Peter will report directly to me.As part of this organizational change, Pieter Abbeel will lead our frontier model research team (the team that builds the base model) in AGI. Pieter is one of the world's leading AI researchers, and co-founder of Covariant, which pioneered the first commercial foundation model for robotics. His deep expertise in generative AI and reinforcement learning makes him well-suited to advance Amazon's AI research as we push the boundaries of what's possible for customers. Pieter will also continue his ongoing work with our Robotics team. Peter will share the rest of the organizational design shortly.Peter’s very strong leaders in AWS Utility Computing will continue to lead what they’ve been leading, with a few additional responsibilities. Matt Garman will share the new AWS structure in a follow-up note.Finally, I want to recognize Rohit Prasad, who has decided to leave Amazon at the end of this year. Rohit joined Amazon in 2013, during the early days of Alexa, to help us build a conversational AI that could make customers' lives easier. Rohit helped Alexa grow from an ambitious idea into a service that now touches hundreds of millions of customers' lives every day. For the past two years, Rohit has led the creation of Amazon Nova and our AGI organization, building twelve state-of-the-art foundation models with industry-leading price-performance that are now being used by tens of thousands of companies across almost all industries and use cases. Rohit has built a strong team, differentiated technology, growing customer momentum, and a culture of ambitious invention. He’s been missionary, passionate, and selfless, and I'm grateful for his leadership, his technical vision, and everything he's built here. Thank you, Rohit.The path ahead is full of opportunity. With the foundation that's been built, the traction we’re seeing, and Peter's leadership bringing unified focus to these technologies, we're well-positioned to lead and deliver meaningful capabilities for our customers. I'm excited about what this team will build and how these foundational technologies will help shape Amazon's future.Andy",Amazon AI chief Rohit Prasad is leaving the company at the end of year.

Bill Gates to AI companies: You are over valued and a reasonable percentage will ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-to-ai-companies-you-are-over-valued-and-a-reasonable-percentage-will-/articleshow/126049687.cms,"Bill Gates on AI valuations



Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Bill Gates emphasised that AI remains a transformative force







Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has once again cautioned that many artificial intelligence companies with very-high valuations will not survive in what he described as a “hyper competitive” industry. As reported by CNBC, speaking at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week in an interview with CNBC’s Tanya Bryer, Gates said that the investors should brace themselves for corrections as the fear of an AI bubble is intensifying day-by-day. Gates also highlighted that the hyper-competitive nature of AI means that only a fraction of companies will emerge as long-term winners. Gates said that “a reasonable percentage of those companies won’t be worth that much.”“AI is the most important thing going on,” Gates said, but stressed that inflated valuations do not guarantee success. “Does it mean all of these companies with high valuations will be winners? No, it’s going to be hyper competitive,” he explained. He added: “AI is only a bubble in the sense that not all of these valuations will end up going up. Some of them will go down… A reasonable percentage of those companies won’t be worth that much.Companies like Tesla, Palantir presently trade at price-to-earnings ratios above 200 compared with an S&P 500 average of about 25. The disparity has fueled investor concerns, with global markets dipping in November amid fears of an AI bubble.“AI is a deeply profound technology that will reshape the world. There’s not the slightest doubt about that,” he said. He pointed to AI’s potential in healthcare, education, and agriculture, areas where his foundation is actively investing.Despite all these concerns, Gates has reaffirmed his belief in the transformative potential of AI. He also described it as “a deeply profound technology that will reshape the world,” with applications across health, education, and agriculture.“Is this profound and real and is going to provide all of these benefits? Absolutely, nobody should have any doubt about that,” Gates said. As 2026 approaches, Gates’ vision is clear: AI must be used not just to drive profits, but to deliver tangible benefits for humanity.",Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has once again cautioned that many artificial intelligence companies with very-high valuations will not survive in what he described as a “hyper competitive” industry.

Roblox confirms it contacted Russian Communications watchdog

Why Roblox is banned





US gaming platform Roblox said it is prepared to change some of its features in Russia, reports news agency Reuters. This comes as the company seeks to reverse a ban imposed earlier this month by Russian Communications watchdog Roskomnadzor citing safety concerns. As per the report, Roskomnadzor said the company has now reached out to discuss compliance with Russian regulations.Interfax news agency quoted the watchdog saying “If this isn't just a statement, but a genuine willingness on the platform to change its approach to ensuring children's safety online, then Roskomnadzor will interact with the platform as it does with any other service that complies with Russian law”.In a statement to Reuters, a Roblox spokesperson said it was ready “to temporarily limit communication features in Russia and to revise our content moderation processes to address the legal requirements necessary to restore our community’s access to the platform”.""Roblox intends to continue dialogue with Roskomnadzor as access to the platform is restored, including discussions around additional compliance measures that may be considered over time,"" the spokesperson added.Roskomnadzor said Roblox had promised to take the necessary measures ""to remove destructive and dangerous information and prevent criminal activity and user communications on the platform"".The Roblox spokesperson said: ""Roblox is deeply committed to the safety of our users, with a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform.""Russia is not the only country that has banned Roblox. The gaming platform has been banned by several countries including Iraq and Turkey over child safety. The countries have expressed concerns about predators exploiting the platform to abuse children.Russian officials say the ban is meant to protect against what they describe as an “information war” from Western countries and culture that undermines traditional Russian values.",US gaming platform Roblox said it is prepared to change some of its features in Russia.

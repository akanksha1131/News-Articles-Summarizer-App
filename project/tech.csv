Why and how Google ‚Äòbreak up order‚Äô is also $20 billion-plus ‚Äòloss‚Äô for Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-and-how-google-break-up-order-is-also-20-billion-plus-loss-for-apple/articleshow/115540555.cms,"Google paid $20 billion to Apple in 2022

What Apple said about Google Search

The US Justice Department 's recent antitrust lawsuit against Google has sparked concerns over the potential consequences of its proposed remedies. The Department of Justice (DoJ) recommended, among multiple other measures, that the tech giant sells Chrome and cuts an exclusive search deal with Apple.This means that Google will be prevented from paying billions to Apple to maintain its default search position on iPhones.In May, a report by Bloomberg said that Google‚Äôs parent company Alphabet paid $20 billion to Apple in 2022 to be the default search engine on Safari, Apple‚Äôs web browser. The sum Google paid to Apple in 2021 was around $15 billion.Court documents from the US Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against Google revealed the staggering sums the tech giant pays Apple to remain the default search engine on its devices. While Apple does provide users with the option to switch to alternative search engines like Bing or DuckDuckGo, Google remains the pre-selected default in Safari across iPhones, iPads, and Macs.This default setting grants Google access to billions of Apple users, giving it a significant advantage in the search market. The Justice Department's antitrust case centres on the argument that Google's agreement with Apple has helped it create an unfair monopoly in the online search business.During the testimony in the case, Eddy Cue, the senior vice president of services at Apple, told the court that the company went with Google because there was not a better choice at the time. He added that they have ‚Äúalways thought it [Google] was the best‚Äù.Interestingly, reports indicate that Apple explored alternatives to Google, engaging in discussions with Microsoft and DuckDuckGo about potentially using their search engines on Apple devices. Apple even contemplated acquiring Microsoft's Bing search engine but ultimately opted to maintain its partnership with Google.","Google paid $20 billion to Apple in 2022 to be the default search engine on Safari, Apple‚Äôs web browser.

When Bezos-owned Washington Post decided not to endorse Kamala Harris for president

Bezos' support for Trump's victory

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos are publicly known not to be on great terms. The two have often made subtle jibes at each other. In latest dig, Musk said that the Amazon founder had urged people to sell their Tesla, SpaceX shares because Donald Trump would lose. A claim that Jeff Bezos has strictly denied in a rare post on X, formerly Twitter.In a Twitter post, Musk wrote, ""Just learned tonight at Mar-a-Lago that Jeff Bezos was telling everyone that @realDonaldTrump would lose for sure, so they should sell all their Tesla and SpaceX stock ü§≠"". Musk did not add as to who was present during the conversation or any other additional context.To this, Bezos replied back: ""Nope. 100% not true"". Musk then responded to Bezos, ‚ÄúWell, then, I stand corrected,‚Äù adding a laughter emoji.Incidentally, the two are currently ranked in the top 5 richest men in the world. According to Bloomberg Billionaires Index , Musk ranks at No. 1 with a net worth of $331 billion; Bezos is at No. 2 on the list, with a net worth of $226 billion. The duo have often exchanged positions.For those wondering the open jibes, this is not the first time that the two richest men on the planet have sparred publicly. Musk owns SpaceX, which holds a dominant position in the rocket launch industry and operates the Starlink satellite internet service. Bezos, on the other hand, founded Blue Origin, a space tourism and exploration company, and is heavily invested in Amazon's Project Kuiper, a rival satellite network. Amazon is also the biggest shareholder in Tesla rival Rivian Automotive Inc.The latest public exchange comes as Musk, who spent more than $130 million on Donald Trump's campaign, enjoys a prominent role in US President elect's inner circle, with some calling him First Buddy. Tesla‚Äôs shares have jumped more than 30% since November. 5 election, helping Musk‚Äôs net worth balloon to more than $340 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.In late October, the Bezos-owned Washington Post, which was publicly known to endorse vice president Kamala Harris for President ‚Äî controversially broke from tradition by deciding that its opinion editors would not support a candidate. The Amazon founder defended the decision as a ""principled"" one. However, critics slammed the move as ""cowardice"" terming it an effort to avoid antagonising Trump should he get elected. Several prominent journalists at the paper also reportedly quit due to this.Bezos congratulated Trump on his ""decisive victory"" in the US elections. In a post on X on November 6, Bezos wrote, ""Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory. No nation has bigger opportunities. Wishing @realDonaldTrump all success in leading and uniting the America we all love"".","Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are two of the richest men on the planet.

Consumer electronics company Arzooo goes for distress sale: What went wrong for the 8-year-old startup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/consumer-electronics-company-arzooo-goes-for-distress-sale-what-went-wrong-for-the-8-year-old-startup/articleshow/115540631.cms,"Arzooo cofounders Rishi Raj Rathore (L) and Khushnud Khan (R)

What went wrong with Arzooo

What Moksha Group may do with Arzooo's assets

Mumbai-based Moksha Group has acquired the assets of struggling B2B consumer electronics startup Arzooo. The deal, finalized without disclosing financial details, marks a significant development for both companies. Arzooo, founded by former Flipkart executives Khushnud Khan and Rishi Raj Rathore in 2016, had raised substantial funding but faced challenges including mounting losses and cash flow issues.As part of the acquisition, Moksha Group will gain access to Arzooo's technology platform, intellectual property, and private label brand. The company has also appointed Rehan Shaikh, a former Cloudtail and Amazon executive, to lead the acquired business.The company's aggressive expansion strategy, coupled with heavy discounts and incentives, reportedly led to a financial crunch. According to a report in Economic Times, over the past year, the startup laid off hundreds of employees and its losses mounted. It reportedly blocked payments to its sellers on account of a funding crunch.‚ÄúThe company‚Äôs troubles started after they overspent last year during the Diwali sales, giving heavy discounts and incentives to retailers,‚Äù told a person in the know, who did not wish to be identified to ET. ‚ÄúFollowing this, one of their lenders pulled the credit line, seeing the business was on shaky grounds without additional funding. This led to a capital crunch and the company spiralled into issues, with the only option being to find a buyer,‚Äù the source further added.Moksha Group aims to leverage Arzooo's technology and distribution network to empower small retailers with digital tools, fintech solutions, and affordable financing options. This strategic move is expected to strengthen the position of smaller retailers in the competitive market.The acquisition highlights the challenges faced by many Indian startups, particularly those in the e-commerce sector. As the industry matures, companies must focus on sustainable growth and prudent financial management to avoid similar pitfalls.","Moksha Group has acquired struggling B2B consumer electronics startup Arzooo.

""Zepto is not a rival to Kirana stores""

Success mantra is convenience and efficiency, not pricing

Zepto's monthly cash burn rate is high

Zepto, the fastest-growing quick-commerce startup in the Indian market, has raised an additional $350 million from domestic investors. CEO Aadit Palicha aims to make Zepto a majority Indian-owned company and eventually list it on Indian stock exchanges. In an interview with Economic Times, CEO Palicha said that Zepto is not an ‚ÄúAmazon or Walmart‚Äù but an Indian firm with plans to go public on Indian bourses. Palicha claimed that Zepto‚Äôs latest funding is one of the largest domestic-only rounds for an Indian startup.Founded by Stanford University dropouts Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, Zepto has emerged as one of the fastest-growing consumer internet firms in India. According to a recent report by Motilal Oswal, Zepto is the second largest player in the sector with a 29% share in the quarter ended June 30, after Blinkit which had a 46% share. The report ‚Äì which did not include Tata Group BigBasket and Flipkart Minutes ‚Äì pegged Swiggy Instamart‚Äôs market share at 24%.The company's focus on domestic ownership is driven by a desire to build trust with policymakers, the public, and shareholders. This move also aligns with the government's increasing scrutiny of foreign-owned quick-commerce firms and their operations in India. After the latest funding, more than 30% of Zepto's stake is with Indian shareholders. These include Manipal group‚Äôs Ranjan Pai, Ramesh and Rajeev Juneja of Mankind Pharma and the Motilal Oswal group. The company‚Äôs overseas investors include General Catalyst, Y Combinator and Nexus Venture Partners.Palicha stressed that Zepto is not a competitor to traditional Kirana stores but rather a complementary service that caters to specific consumer needs, particularly impulse and last-minute purchases. He asserts that the company is a net job creator and contributes to India's growing consumption story.""We don‚Äôt accept claims made without real data. The allegations of predatory pricing are not true. Only 0.2% of units sold on our platform in FY24 were below-cost price. 99.8% of units were sold above the cost price given by the manufacturer, with 80% sold at a margin above 20%,‚Äù he said. ""If anyone doubts this, we invite them to check our books, which are audited by Ernst & Young.""He said that what is happening is a shift in consumer behaviour, where certain categories ‚Äî like impulse or last-minute purchases ‚Äî are coming to quick commerce,‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúBulk and routine purchases remain with Kiranas.‚ÄùTo address concerns about predatory pricing and its impact on Kirana stores, Palicha said that Zepto adheres to fair pricing practices and that the majority of its products are sold at a significant margin. He attributes the shift in consumer behavior, particularly towards quick commerce, to the convenience and efficiency offered by platforms like Zepto.While Zepto has achieved rapid growth, it has also incurred significant costs, including high cash burn rates for dark store expansion and customer acquisition. Palicha acknowledges these costs but expresses confidence in the long-term profitability of the business, citing the increasing profitability of existing dark stores and the decreasing timeline for new stores to break even.","Zepto, the fastest-growing quick-commerce startup in the Indian market, has raised an additional $350 million from domestic investors.

"Spotify has 'pirated software, cheat codes and adult entertainment' problem",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotify-has-pirated-software-cheat-codes-and-adult-entertainment-problem/articleshow/115540550.cms,"See the posts here

Security issues are spread deep inside

Security researchers have uncovered a concerning trend on Spotify: Playlists and podcasts promoting malware and pirated software. According to a report in 404 Media, people are using Spotify playlist and podcast descriptions to distribute spam, malware, pirated software and cheat codes for video games .One example, highlighted by security researcher Karol Paciorek, involved a playlist titled ""Sony Vegas Pro13 Crack Free Download 2024 mysoftwarefree.com."" This playlist blatantly advertised a website (mysoftwarefree.com) known to host malicious software.While Spotify reportedly removed the specific playlist in question, Paciorek warns that the problem is widespread. He claimed that users can easily find links to ""Vbucks generators"" (used to cheat in Fortnite) and ""license key cracks"" (used to activate pirated software) hidden within playlists and podcast descriptions. ""The playlist title in question has been removed,"" a spokesperson for Spotify told 404 Media in a statement. ""Spotify's Platform Rules prohibit posting, sharing, or providing instructions on implementing malware or related malicious practices that seek to harm or gain unauthorized access to computers, networks, systems, or other technologies.""The report claims that these listings often exploit Spotify's search engine optimization. Even if Spotify blocks certain keywords within the platform, searching for those keywords on Google still surfaces the malicious links hosted on Spotify.Spammers further manipulate the system by using irrelevant audio content and misleading titles related to popular topics, like TikTok or adult entertainment, to increase search visibility. One example is a podcast named ""forlinks"" with numerous short episodes that only contain descriptions linking to Turkish gambling sites. Podcast episode titles for such spam accounts often contain popular keywords about TikTok personalities or porn, boosting their search engine reach.","Security researchers have uncovered a concerning trend on Spotify.

The problem with remix culture



Legacy of originality and innovation

Call for ethical practices in music

Renowned music composer A.R. Rahman, celebrated for his iconic contributions to Indian and global music, recently shared his thoughts on the evolving landscape of the music industry, focusing on the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the trend of remixing songs. In an interview, Rahman acknowledged the benefits of AI in enhancing technical processes but warned against its potential misuse. He also expressed disapproval of the increasing prevalence of remixes and reimagined tracks, emphasising the ethical and creative challenges these trends pose.In his interview with The Week, Rahman highlighted how AI has found a place in the music industry, particularly in areas like sound mastering and production. However, he cautioned that AI cannot replicate the human touch and emotional depth required to compose original music.‚ÄúAI helps in the mastering process, but creating a tune still requires a human heart and a philosophical mind,‚Äù Rahman stated. He expressed confidence that live, authentic performances by real musicians will remain irreplaceable, adding, ‚ÄúThe future will belong to real musicians going on stage with a guitar and a song.‚ÄùRahman further elaborated on the potential dangers of AI misuse. ‚ÄúAn even bigger evil is people misusing AI and not paying the composer even if they are borrowing their style. We need to bell this cat because it could lead to major ethical issues. People could lose jobs,‚Äù he warned.The music maestro also took a firm stance against the rising trend of remixing and reimagining songs, a practice that has gained momentum in recent years. While acknowledging that remixes have existed in Indian music since the late 1990s, Rahman pointed out that the practice has evolved to include even recent tracks, some only a few years old.Rahman criticised this development, saying, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt reimagine people‚Äôs work without their permission. A reimagined song may be suitable for social media, but it should not be used for commercial purposes. You could post it on Instagram, but certainly not make it mainstream.‚ÄùThe composer expressed his belief that this trend undermines the creative integrity of original compositions and raises ethical concerns about intellectual property rights.Despite his concerns, Rahman continues to remain at the forefront of the music industry with his innovative projects. His recent works include the score for the Tamil film Raayan and Imtiaz Ali‚Äôs Amar Singh Chamkila, both of which received widespread acclaim. These projects showcase Rahman‚Äôs ability to blend traditional and modern elements, a hallmark of his career.Upcoming projects for Rahman include the highly anticipated films Chhava and Thug Life, further cementing his reputation as a visionary composer.A.R. Rahman‚Äôs remarks serve as a wake-up call for the industry to adopt ethical practices in both AI integration and the remixing of existing works. As technology continues to shape the creative landscape, his insights highlight the need for preserving the integrity of original compositions and respecting the contributions of artists.By addressing these pressing issues, Rahman has once again positioned himself as a thought leader, advocating for the future of music as a domain of authentic and meaningful creativity.","Renowned music composer A.R.

Explained: 5 'demands' that are part of the US government's call to break-up Google,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-5-demands-that-are-part-of-the-us-governments-call-to-break-up-google/articleshow/115535739.cms,"What Google said on the DoJ order

Here are some of the demands that the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) lawyers have made in the case:

Sell Chrome Browser

Sell Android as Last Resort

Five-Year Ban on Browser Ownership

End Exclusive Deals with Apple and Publishers

Mandate Data Sharing and Search Result Licensing

US prosecutors have filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Google, seeking to dismantle the tech giant's dominance in online search. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has proposed a series of drastic measures, including the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser and Android operating system. The DOJ argues that Google has abused its market power to stifle competition and harm consumers. The proposed remedies aim to level the playing field and promote fair competition in the online search market. The outcome of this lawsuit could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry and the broader economy.Responding to DoJ's ruling, Kent Walker, President of Global Affairs, Google & Alphabet, wrote in a blog post, ""DOJ had a chance to propose remedies related to the issue in this case: search distribution agreements with Apple, Mozilla, smartphone OEMs, and wireless carriers. Instead, DOJ chose to push a radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America‚Äôs global technology leadership. DOJ‚Äôs wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the Court‚Äôs decision. It would break a range of Google products ‚Äî even beyond Search ‚Äî that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives.""US prosecutors have proposed that Google divest its Chrome browser to an approved buyer. The DOJ argues that Google's dominance in both Chrome and Android creates significant barriers for competitors, as they are the primary channels for distributing search engines to users.The DOJ has also suggested that Google could divest its Android operating system if other remedies prove ineffective. This drastic measure underscores the severity of the government's concerns about Google's market power.To further level the playing field, the DOJ proposes a five-year ban on Google owning or investing in a browser, search engine, or related technologies. This would prevent Google from re-establishing its dominance through future acquisitions or investments.The DOJ seeks to end Google's practice of paying billions of dollars annually to Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones and iPads. Additionally, Google would be prohibited from entering into exclusive contracts with publishers that limit competitors' access to valuable content.The most far-reaching proposal requires Google to license its search results to competitors at a nominal cost and share user data with them, subject to privacy constraints. This would allow rivals to better compete with Google's powerful search engine.","US prosecutors have filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Google, seeking to dismantle the tech giant's dominance in online search.

Having babies rips you apart and puts you back together. Babies are ten thousand philosophy classes of shit you can only learn from that experience. Spent a year locked in battle in a state with terrible mothers rights having my instagram posts and modeling used as reasons I shouldn't have my kids and fighting and detaching from the love of my life as he becomes unrecognizable to me, with a fraction of his resources (or iq/ strategy experience), all the while I didn't see one of my babies for 5 months. And this is only what can be said publicly, since most of my experience these last years should remain behind closed doors. Poetry and pure raw emotion are pouring out of my soul at a rate I've never known, and Im improving deeply as a producer past the technical and back to the art after now knowing my craft so much better. + I've found the creative partners I've always wanted. So I hate to waste everyone's time, but I have to make what I'm making right now. And it might be upsetting and provocative to many, but it's real and the people who will feel me will feel me. And all that said I'm grateful for every bullet I caught. Cuz I feel on top of the world right now. And everything that used to give me anxiety feels like child's play after all this.

Clothes, electronics on quick commerce

Online platforms have dramatically reportedly reshaped consumer buying habits, particularly in metro cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai. The surge in quick commerce companies like Swiggy Instamart , Blinkit , Zepto and BigBasket too is playing an important part in this changing consumer behaviour.As Kanaka Bhagwat, head of ecommerce at NielsenIQ, told Economic Times that there has been a significant shift from ""top-up"" to ""stock-up"" purchases, driven by the convenience and assortment offered by quick commerce and e-commerce platforms.Ready-to-eat foods have seen exceptional growth on e-commerce channels, with sales soaring 52% year-over-year. Salty snacks, refined edible oils, biscuits, and packaged atta also experienced substantial growth, with sales increasing by 41%, 41%, 40%, and 39%, respectively.Leading FMCG companies like Nestle, ITC, Hindustan Unilever, Dabur, and Emami have reported significant growth, especially in large cities, through platforms like Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, Zepto, Big Basket's BBNow, and Flipkart Minutes. Consumers are increasingly opting to purchase monthly essentials, including bulk packs of staples, on these platforms for convenience.E-commerce dominates metros, Kiranas still strong beyond metro citiesIn the September 2024 quarter, quick commerce and e-commerce contributed 85% to incremental sales in metro markets, a stark contrast to the previous year when offline channels dominated. This shift underscores the growing importance of e-commerce in urban areas.While traditional trade (Kirana stores) still accounts for 85% of FMCG sales nationally, the rapid rise of quick commerce is impacting urban markets. Companies like Dabur and Nestle are adjusting their inventory strategies in traditional trade channels to adapt to this shift.In the last few months, quick-commerce platforms have expanded their offerings beyond FMCG to include apparel, durables, smartphones, footwear, and jewelry. However, the sustainability of this model for categories like apparel and durables, still remains uncertain.

The federation had alleged that near-expiry stock had burdened distributors with a significant financial loss of Rs 300 crore.In a regulatory filing, Honasa Consumer dismissed these allegations as inaccurate. The company stated that the total inventory value in the distribution chain was significantly lower, amounting to Rs 40.69 crore. Moreover, the pending market scheme settlements were valued at Rs 4.73 crore, far below the AICPDF's estimate of Rs 50 crore.Honasa Consumer is currently undergoing a major restructuring of its general trade strategy, transitioning from a super stockist model to a direct distributor model. This transition, while aimed at improving efficiency, has had a negative impact on the company's recent financial performance. In the September quarter, the company reported a net loss of Rs 19 crore and a 7% decline in operating revenue.The company has acknowledged that the restructuring process has been more challenging than anticipated. However, it remains committed to executing the strategy and mitigating the associated costs.

Of this, a significant portion has already been received, with the remaining amount expected to be recovered from distributors.In an interview to Economic Times, Honasa Consumer CEO Varun Alagh said, ‚ÄúThe impact (of the restructuring) was higher than what we had planned and expected. We initially had certain assumptions in place, which were based on a certain level of inventory, but as we reached the execution stage, it turned out to be relatively higher.‚ÄùThe controversy surrounding inventory levels and the ongoing restructuring have led to a significant decline in Honasa Consumer's stock price, resulting in a loss of over $400 million in market capitalization.","Honasa Consumer has refuted claims by the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation ( AICPDF ) regarding excessive unsold inventory.

Google breakup: How the prediction of this tech inventor has come true,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-breakup-how-the-prediction-of-this-tech-inventor-has-come-true/articleshow/115532588.cms,"The US Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against Google, seeking to break up the tech giant, aligns with a prediction made by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee. Berners-Lee foresaw the potential need to dismantle large tech companies due to their AI monopolies. Google plans to challenge the ruling, arguing that such a move would hinder innovation.

What Berners-Lee said in his prediction

Google CEO Sundar Pichai on courts ruling

The US Justice Department 's antitrust lawsuit against Google has sparked widespread concern over the potential consequences of its proposed remedies, including a major breakup of the tech giant to curb its search engine dominance. This action aligns with a prediction made earlier this year by the inventor of the World Wide Web (www).On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the invention of the World Wide Web ‚Äì an information system that enables sharing and accessing of content over the Internet ‚Äì Tim Berners-Lee made three predictions.These included AI working for humans, data ownership and breaking up of at least one Big Tech company. With the DoJ‚Äôs proposal on the table, Berners-Lee‚Äôs prediction from March appears to be coming true.In March, Berners-Lee said that a Big Tech company may be forced to break up.‚ÄúThings are changing so quickly. AI is changing very, very quickly. There are monopolies in AI. Monopolies changed pretty quickly back on the web,‚Äù Berners-Lee said, as per an interview by CNBC.‚ÄúMaybe at some point in the future, agencies will have to work to break up big companies, but we don‚Äôt know which company that will be,‚Äù he added.Google said in its statement that breaking up the company will ‚Äúchill our investment in artificial intelligence, perhaps the most important innovation of our time, where Google plays a leading role.‚ÄùGoogle is set to file its own proposals next month and plans to make a broader case next year, which means that there is no surety that the company will sell Chrome.Last month, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that given the company‚Äôs ‚Äúscale and size, I think scrutiny is inevitable.‚Äù‚ÄúWe're still in the middle of the remedies phase, and we will appeal, and this process will likely take many years,‚Äù Pichai told host David Rubenstein when talking about the ruling, which labelled Google a ‚Äúmonopolist.‚Äù","The US Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against Google aligns with a prediction made by the inventor of the World Wide Web.

Zomato update on 'fraud restaurant' listing: As policy we block items such as,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zomato-update-on-fraud-restaurant-listing-as-policy-we-block-items-such-as/articleshow/115530104.cms,"Representative image

Here‚Äôs Zomato‚Äôs full response on ‚Äòfraud restaurant‚Äô listing

We have noticed social media conversations around

single-dish restaurants

listed on Zomato.

We have identified all such restaurants that were potentially fraudulent and have delisted them from our platform. To solve this more comprehensively, we have also investigated all other restaurants which have a very limited menu on Zomato and might have listed prohibited items or worked around a way to list prohibited items.

As per our policy, all restaurants listed on Zomato need to have a FSSAI license and we also actively block items such as alcohol, cigarettes/cigars/vapes from being listed on our platform. However, the restaurants highlighted were able to game our checks by using generic food names such as, ‚ÄòNaughty strawberry‚Äô, ‚ÄòMerry Berry‚Äô.

We have further strengthened our fraud checks to proactively identify such cases to avoid similar incidents in the future.

How Zomato found about suspicious ‚Äúone-dish‚Äù restaurants

Zomato has taken action against suspicious ‚Äúone-dish‚Äù restaurants listed on its platform. Following a social media uproar, the food delivery platform said that it has identified and delisted all potentially fraudulent restaurants.Earlier this week, several social media users raised concerns about some restaurant listings that have been offering single items with unusual names and prices.A Reddit post highlighted restaurants in Chandigarh offering single dishes with peculiar names like ‚ÄúCitrus Punch,‚Äù ‚ÄúNaughty Strawberry,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlue Adventure‚Äù at exorbitant prices. Social media users speculated that these listings could be a cover for drug dealing or other illicit activities.Zomato also acknowledged that the suspicious restaurants had bypassed its checks by using generic food names to disguise prohibited items.",Zomato has taken action against suspicious ‚Äúone-dish‚Äù restaurants listed on its platform.

Why Google reportedly told employees to 'CC' company's legal team in all important internal communication,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-google-reportedly-told-employees-to-cc-companys-legal-team-in-internal-all-important-communications/articleshow/115528379.cms,"What the memo urged employees to do

Google also put technological measures

How Google‚Äôs communication practice came to fore

Google, in a confidential memo to employees in 2008, outlined its long-standing efforts to minimise and control its internal communications, a report has said. The memo also urged the employees to add a Google lawyer to the list of recipients ‚Äì a practice aimed at shielding the tech giant from potential legal challenges.A report by The New York Times highlighted that this ‚Äòculture of deletion‚Äô within the company has come to light through recent antitrust lawsuits. This practice reportedly started from 2008, when Google faced antitrust scrutiny over an advertising deal with its rival Yahoo, the report cited a memo as saying.Facing antitrust scrutiny and various legal battles, Google executives urged employees to exercise caution in their internal communications, warning that casual remarks could be used against the company in court. They encouraged employees to avoid speculation, sarcasm, and discussions on sensitive topics, the report added.‚ÄúWe believe that information is good,‚Äù the executives told employees in the memo, adding that employees should refrain from speculation and sarcasm as well as ‚Äúthink twice‚Äù before writing one another to minimise the odds that a lawsuit may flush out comments that may be incriminating.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt comment before you have all the facts,‚Äù the employees were told, as per the New York Times report. The company also encouraged employees to mark documents as ‚Äúattorney-client privileged‚Äù and include lawyers as recipients, even in non-legal discussions.To further limit potential legal exposure, Google reportedly implemented technological measures, including making its instant messaging tool ‚Äúoff the record‚Äù and automatically deleting chat histories. This practice of minimising internal records has continued for over 15 years, the report highlighted.The company exempted instant messaging from automatic legal holds, requiring employees to manually preserve their chat history if involved in litigation. This practice effectively minimised the availability of such communications in legal proceedings, the report said.Evidence from recent antitrust trials against Google, brought by Epic Games and the Department of Justice (DoJ), has shed light on Google's efforts to suppress internal communications. In fact, during its trials, Google faced criticism for its actions as all the judges in all three antitrust cases pulled up the company for its communications practices.While Judge James Donato who presided over the case brought by Epic Games Epic said there was ‚Äúan ingrained systemic culture of suppression of relevant evidence within Google‚Äù and that the company‚Äôs behaviour was ‚Äúa frontal assault on the fair administration of justice.‚ÄùSimailry, Judge Leonie Brinkema, who is overseeing Google‚Äôs antitrust case involving advertising technology, said in August that the company‚Äôs document retention policies were ‚Äúnot the way in which a responsible corporate entity should function.‚Äù‚ÄúAn awful lot of evidence has likely been destroyed,‚Äù she added.Google responded by saying that it had provided ‚Äúmillions of documents‚Äù in the Justice Department cases alone.Google said in a statement that it took ‚Äúseriously our obligations to preserve and produce relevant documents. We have for years responded to inquiries and litigation, and we educate our employees about legal privilege.‚Äù","Google executives urged employees to exercise caution in their internal communications, warning that casual remarks could be used against the company in court.

A retired lecturer in Hyderabad fell victim to a ""digital arrest"" scam, losing Rs 45 lakh. Posing as a CBI officer, the scammer claimed Sharma's Aadhaar card was linked to illegal activities. Through video calls and threats of arrest, the fraudster manipulated Sharma into transferring funds to various accounts, using fake receipts to maintain the facade.The victim, 73-year-old Ch Purshotham Sharma received a call from someone who claimed to have intercepted a parcel containing banned drugs linked to Sharma's Aadhaar card number, implicating him in a money laundering case. To prevent his alleged ""arrest,"" the caller provided Sharma with a contact number for a purported CBI officer in Ahmedabad and instructed him to cooperate with the investigation.The scammer then conducted a video call with Sharma while dressed in a police uniform. The scammer then pressured Sharma into sharing his bank account details and tricked him into making multiple payments through Google Pay, Paytm, net banking, and RTGS (Real-Time Gross Settlement) to various accounts. The transactions, made over multiple days, totalled Rs 45.5 lakh.To further convince Sharma, the fraudsters even sent him fake receipts, supposedly from the Supreme Court and signed by the registrar, as confirmation of his payments.Sharma eventually realised he had been deceived and approached the Rachakonda Cyber Crime Police to file a complaint. A case was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Information Technology Act, including charges of identity theft and cheating by personation.This incident highlights the increasing sophistication of cyber scams targeting unsuspecting individuals.

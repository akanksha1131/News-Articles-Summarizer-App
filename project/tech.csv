"Job cuts at Infosys and other tech companies, bring these firms in focus",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/job-cuts-at-infosys-and-other-tech-companies-bring-these-firms-in-focus/articleshow/120535210.cms,"Tech layoffs: Outplacement services in high demand

Broader industry impact

The wave of layoffs in the tech industry continues to make headlines, with Infosys and other major companies downsizing their workforce amid challenging economic conditions and structural shifts. Infosys recently let go of 240 trainees who failed internal assessments, advising them to explore opportunities outside the company. The terminated employees, hired as System Engineers and Digital Specialist Engineers, were unable to meet the qualifying criteria in the 'Generic foundation training program' despite receiving additional preparation time, doubt-clearing sessions, multiple mock assessments, and three testing attempts.To support affected employees, Infosys is providing a range of transition assistance options. These include one month's pay, accommodation at the Mysore training center, and a travel allowance to either Bengaluru or their hometown. Along with this, the IT company is also offering professional outplacement services .""As you explore opportunities outside of Infosys, we have planned professional outplacement services to help you on that journey,"" stated the termination email sent to affected trainees. The email continued, ""We also wish to offer you another career pathway, by taking an Infosys sponsored external training to prepare for potential roles in the BPM industry.""According to a report by Economic Times, as layoffs increase, companies are turning to outplacement firms to assist retrenched employees in finding new roles. Providers like Persolkelly Consulting, LHH, Right Management India, and ABC Consultants have reported a 20-40% rise in demand for career transition services. These firms are helping employees navigate the tough job market, which has been further strained by digital transformation and workforce restructuring.According to Viraj Kocharekar, Country Manager at LHH India, the surge in outplacement demand is driven by factors such as mergers and acquisitions, talent refresh initiatives, and technological advancements. Similarly, Hardeep Singh, President of Right Management India, noted that the current trend mirrors the sub-prime crisis of 2008, with companies restructuring to adapt to macroeconomic conditions and the rise of AI.The layoffs are not limited to Infosys. Other tech giants, including TCS and Wipro, have also slowed down hiring, reflecting the broader challenges faced by the industry. The demand for outplacement services has extended beyond IT to sectors like pharma, food processing, and shared services, as global business shutdowns and restructuring take a toll.Experts like Archana Uniyal of Persolkelly Consulting emphasise that the job market remains tough, with many employees worried about finding new opportunities. Companies are increasingly using outplacement services as a way to support laid-off workers, recognising the emotional and professional challenges they face.","Infosys recently let go 240 trainees, advising them to explore opportunities outside the company.

"Americans, government may want you to get paid not to use Google search",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/americans-government-may-want-you-to-get-paid-not-to-use-google-search/articleshow/120529939.cms,"Google says it dominates search as it offers 'best product'

A research team has uncovered a key reason behind Google’s dominance in web searches: Most users haven’t seriously tried alternatives, according to a study cited by Bloomberg. The researchers found that Google’s popularity stems partly from a belief in its superiority, akin to preferring a favorite soda, even if untested options might compare favorably.The study, conducted by academics from Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania, and MIT, showed that Google’s grip on search habits can be loosened with incentives, such as paying users to try alternatives like Microsoft Bing. This finding is influencing a trial that began Monday to address Google’s illegal search monopoly, as ruled last year, Bloomberg reports. Google plans to appeal the decision.In the experiment, nearly 2,500 participants were monitored for months, with some paid $10 to use Bing instead of Google for two weeks. After payments stopped, 78% reverted to Google, but 22% stuck with Bing, surprising researchers. “I realized Bing was not as bad as I thought it was,” one participant said, per Bloomberg. Assistant professor Leon Musolff from the University of Pennsylvania told Bloomberg the results suggest users’ belief in Google’s unmatched quality persists because few explore alternatives.The study, which didn’t test other search engines, informed legal strategies in the Google case. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, leading states that sued Google alongside the Justice Department, cited the research in proposing a court-ordered consumer campaign to promote search alternatives, including “short-term incentive payments,” the report notes.The government also seeks broader remedies, like forcing Google to sell Chrome.Google argues its search engine’s dominance reflects superior innovation and user choice, not coercion. It highlighted the study’s finding that defaulting users to Bing would reduce “consumer surplus,” implying dissatisfaction, per Bloomberg. However, the researchers proposed a two-step solution: nudge users to try alternatives temporarily, then let them choose. They estimated Google would still capture 75% of searches, down from 90% in 2020 data.Google has lost all three major U.S. monopoly lawsuits—covering search, ad tech, and its Android app store—and plans to appeal, Bloomberg reports. The researchers’ findings suggest that breaking Google’s hold may require unconventional measures, like incentives, to reshape a market shaped by monopolistic practices.","Researchers found that Google’s popularity stems partly from a belief in its superiority.

Why ChatGPT maker wants to buy Google Chrome

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is reportedly interested in acquiring Google ’s Chrome browser if a federal court mandates its divestiture, according to Nick Turley , head of ChatGPT , during a Tuesday court hearing. “Yes, we would, as would many other parties,” Turley said when asked about OpenAI’s interest in purchasing Chrome, as reported by Bloomberg.Turley testified for the Justice Department in a three-week trial to determine remedies for Google’s search market monopoly, following a 2024 ruling by Judge Amit Mehta. The Justice Department seeks to force Google to sell Chrome, with Mehta’s decision due by August. The Justice Department has asked that Google be forced to divest Chrome.OpenAI’s ChatGPT currently offers a Chrome extension, but Turley said deeper integration could create “a really incredible experience” and showcase “what an AI-first experience looks like.” He highlighted distribution challenges, citing a successful iPhone integration deal but no progress with Android manufacturers like Samsung, where Google’s payments to pre-install its Gemini AI app since January have hindered OpenAI’s efforts. “It was not a lack of trying,” Turley said, per Bloomberg. “We never got to a point where we could discuss concrete terms.”The Justice Department, alongside state attorneys general, proposes remedies including Chrome’s sale, licensing search data, and ending exclusive contracts. Google argues these would harm consumers and U.S. tech leadership, Bloomberg reports. A court-ordered Chrome divestiture would be the first major U.S. company breakup since AT&T in the 1980s.ChatGPT, launched in November 2022, has over 400 million weekly active users as of February 2025, exceeding OpenAI’s 2024 goals, Turley said, according to Bloomberg.",ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is reportedly interested in acquiring Google’s Chrome browser.

"Glad that Meghan’s ‘Pearl’ show dropped, says author Mel Elliott as Netflix cancels Meghan Markle's animated series",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-may-have-cancelled-meghan-markles-animated-series-after-receiving-legal-notice/articleshow/120526568.cms,"What Mel Elliott said about Meghan Markle’s animated show on Netflix



“Meghan is a feminist who sticks up for other women, so I was disappointed and confused to see how similar Netflix’s proposed show ‘Pearl’ was to my own Pearl Power, who had been created seven years earlier. Of course, I can’t know if anyone on her team had seen it and been inspired by it, but the similarities were too great for me to ignore. The world of arts and media are very competitive, and I’m afraid it’s quite common for powerful to people to rip off the work of less well-known creatives — although I’m not saying that’s what happened here.”

“It also appears that there is a risk that your proposed series may infringe intellectual property rights belonging to my client and/or may give rise to a claim in passing off (or in the US, some form of unfair competition).”

“In that listing, my client says: ‘I would love to turn Pearl Power into an animated series someday, educating children about inspirational women from modern history (as well as a few men),'”

Netflix may have cancelled Meghan Markle’s animated series Pearl after receiving a legal letter from British author Mel Elliott, who claimed the show bore “striking similarities” to her children’s books. The author has now claimed that the letter could have influenced the streaming giant’s decision to drop the project, which was announced in 2021 as part of Markle and Prince Harry’s $100 million deal with Netflix. The show, which was set to follow a young girl inspired by influential women in history, was officially scrapped by Netflix in May 2022, a year after the initial announcement was made.In a recent interview with the Daily Mail, Elliott said:In 2021, Elliott’s legal team sent a letter to the Duchess of Sussex, raising concerns about “numerous and notable similarities” between Markle’s proposed animated series on Netflix and Elliott’s work, suggesting they were unlikely to be a coincidence.In the letter (seen by Daily Mail), Elliott’s legal team wrote:Elliott found success with her children’s book series Pearl Power, centred on themes of female empowerment and equality in the 2010s. She released three books between 2014 and 2016, then pitched an animated adaptation in 2019 that aimed to include historical elements.Elliott claimed that she planned for the main character to “present a project about one famous woman, such as Billie Jean King, Maya Angelou and Amelia Earhart” in each episode. She even allegedly shared a test animation online and posted her concept on a platform connecting creators with film and TV producers.the legal letter further noted.The letter added that Elliott had “been discussing this proposed series with her agent for more than two years” before Markle revealed her version.Elliott mentioned that her legal team sent three letters to Markle and Netflix—first in mid-2021, then in October 2021, and again in February 2022—raising concerns about the show. However, the author claimed that she never received a reply. Elliott even claimed to have sent several personal letters to Markle without hearing back.Netflix cancelled Pearl less than three months after the final letter, which the company claimed was due to “budget cuts”.“I’m glad that Meghan’s ‘Pearl’ show was dropped,” Elliot added while hoping that she “had something to do with it.”","British author Mel Elliott claims her legal team sent three letters to Meghan Markle and Netflix raising concerns about her proposed animated series.

The Kardashians gave Sanchez a Judith Leiber handbag shaped like an UFO, valued at $6,995 (approx. Rs 5.9 lakh).

Tesla stocks declined 33% year-to-date

Tesla investor Ross Gerber, who publicly called for Elon Musk’s exit from the EV company, has once again criticised him. In an interview with Bloomberg Technology, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, said that Musk “doesn’t care” about the electric car manufacturer. He went on to claim that the tech billionaire Elon Musk is not returning 'his focus' to Tesla anytime soon. He has found his next Big Focus and that it is not Tesla. “It’s clear that he just doesn’t care. His next move is X AI… So if you have any confusion that he’s coming back to Tesla, he’s not,” he said during the interview. In March, Gerber said that Musk has lost focus given his widening interests and has become too ‘divisive’. Blaming social media posts and involvement with the president Donald Trump for bringing negative publicity to the company, he then said that “the company's reputation has just been destroyed by Elon Musk”.He then stated that Musk would need to choose between backing Trump and safeguarding Tesla. He said : “It's time for somebody to run Tesla. The business has been neglected for too long. There are too many important things Tesla is doing, so either Elon should come back to Tesla and be the CEO of Tesla and give up his other jobs or he should focus on the government and keep doing what he is doing but find a suitable CEO of Tesla.”In his interview with Bloomberg, Gerber stood by his Tesla comments, addressing criticism from retail investors. He said “I understand why retail investors at Tesla are frustrated with me for voicing my views” adding that he’s “getting attacked because of Elon’s behavior.”However, Gerber said that his firm will continue to manage Tesla shares. He said “We still own Tesla because I do think something fixes itself at some point, and they have the best products”.Despite maintaining its lead in the US EV market, Tesla's stock has dropped 33% year-to-date. According to Cox Automotive data, Tesla sales fell 8.6% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, while the market expanded 11.4% as a whole. Meanwhile, the EV company is set to announce its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, April 22.Stock market worldwide has been volatile amidst the US-China tariff trade war.

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has issued a statement addressing the ongoing week-long boycott organised by the People’s Union USA . The boycott, dubbed the "" Walmart Blackout ,"" began on April 7 and targets the company’s rollback of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as broader concerns over corporate influence and tax policies .The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity. The group’s founder, John Schwarz, urged consumers to avoid shopping at Walmart stores, using its online services, or purchasing from its subsidiaries like Sam’s Club. Schwarz stated, “We are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.”Walmart responded to the boycott, defending its contributions to communities and the US economy. “Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,” the company said in a statement. “As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year"", it added further.The boycott follows Walmart’s decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households—a trend that contrasts with another retail chain Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. In comparison, Walmart observed a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw the smallest decrease, at just 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further stated that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how an applicant identifies his/her sex. USCIS confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

What Bill Gates said about his ties with Jeffrey Epstein



“In retrospect, I was foolish to spend any time with him. I think I was quite stupid. I thought it would help me with global health philanthropy. In fact, it failed to do that. It was just a huge mistake.”

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates’ ex-wife and founder of the Gates Foundation, Melinda French Gates, has made a major revelation about her husband’s ties with Jeffrey Epstein.

The Trump administration is leveraging tariff threats to push India to open its $125 billion e-commerce market fully to American giants like Amazon and Walmart 's Flipkart , according to recent trade discussions.Under current Indian regulations, US ecommerce companies can only operate as online marketplaces for third-party sellers, while their Indian competitors can produce, own, and sell goods directly through their platforms. This restriction, which Washington labels a ""non-tariff barrier,"" has long frustrated American retail giants seeking greater access to the world's most populous consumer market.As the Financial Times reports, Vice President JD Vance met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week, with both acknowledging ""significant progress"" in trade agreement negotiations. These talks are taking place under pressure of potential 26% tariffs on Indian exports to the US, which President Trump has temporarily paused for 90 days.Industry executives familiar with the discussions told the FT that Walmart CEO Doug McMillon raised concerns about India's ecommerce barriers during a recent meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who contributed to Trump's inauguration in January, also appears to have the administration's ear on this issue.The push for market access puts American retail giants in direct competition with Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani , whose Reliance group dominates India's retail sector with multiple ecommerce platforms.Indian trade representatives argue that protecting their retail ecosystem is vital for the country's estimated 90 million small traders. Praveen Khandelwal, an MP with Modi's party, emphasized that while foreign investment is welcome, it ""must not come at the cost of distorting India's retail ecosystem.""If successful, these negotiations could dramatically reshape India's ecommerce landscape, potentially benefiting American companies that have sought full market access since 2006.","US Vice President JD Vance met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week.

Sir Demis Hassabis, co-founder of Google DeepMind and a knighted British AI pioneer, isn't breaking ground in AI or cracking the codes of protein structures, he's playing intellectual games like chess and poker. Even after cracking the code of life's most profound secrets, Hassabis continues to be fueled by an unquenchable thirst for humanity's deepest secrets. His relentless drive has not only reshaped the fields of artificial intelligence and biology, but it could also signal the dawn of the end of human disease.According to the ET reports, in a CBS 60 minute interview on artificialintelligencenews.in (Instagram) with Scott Pelley, Hassabis shared an insight that it sounds more like science fiction than science fact. He also boldly forecasted that AI can eradicate all illnesses in the coming decade. ""It takes, on average, ten years and billions of dollars to develop just one drug,"" Hassabis told us. ""We could maybe reduce that down to months, or even weeks."" His remarks are a manifestation of his sheer confidence in AI's ability to transform medicine.The credibility of Hassabis in coming up with such broad statements lies in his career in cracking the code of protein structures—the very fabric of life. In an incredible feat, DeepMind's artificial intelligence model unraveled the secrets of over 200 million protein structures in a span of just one year. Previous to this AI breakthrough, only a paltry 1% of these structures had been unraveled, each taking years of laborious effort. This innovation has opened the door to equivalent developments in the field of drug discovery, which could accelerate the identification of life-saving drugs by decades.While current AI systems remain constrained by limitations in curiosity and intuition, Hassabis envisions a future where AI doesn’t just solve scientific problems—it identifies them. “In the next five to ten years,” he predicts, “we’ll have systems that are capable of coming up with new hypotheses in science on their own.” This kind of innovation marks a turning point in scientific discovery, shifting the role of AI from a tool to a co-discoverer.Hassabis' research in the realm of AI has already led him and his research partner, John Jumper, to win the esteemed 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry as a recognition for their work on AI-based protein structure prediction. Their research has unveiled new realms in both medicine and biology and paved the way for AI to achieve historic progress in every area of science. Hassabis is convinced that AI will rapidly develop to the stage where it can provide novel, creative ideas—bringing humanity closer to an era of ""radical abundance"" and a disease-free world.Yet Hassabis is not oblivious to the risks that AI may pose. He recognizes two key issues: the abuse of AI by harmful actors and the difficulty of keeping AI aligned with human values. ""Can we ensure they remain on the guardrails? "" he asks, using the terms of safety systems necessary to handle autonomous AI systems.In his dual capacity as the UK Government's AI Advisor and a DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs leader, Hassabis is not just defining the future of AI research but also shaping policy to ensure that AI's power is exercised safely and for the good of humanity.Sir Demis Hassabis occupies a special position of intersection between scientific insight and technological innovation. His precocity as a child genius has transformed into cutting-edge work that is remapping the boundaries of AI and medicine. His forecasts are informed by established advancements, not science fiction. At a time when the world is grappling with novel challenges such as pandemics, healthcare inequalities, and increasing medical expenses, Hassabis' future vision of disease eradication with the help of AI is an exhilarating and revolutionary potentiality.The potential of AI in Medicine AI is already changing healthcare in the present day. Artificial intelligence-powered tools are improving diagnostics, speeding up drug discovery, and tailoring patient treatment. AI technologies now aid clinicians in reading medical images, detecting diseases like cancer and sepsis, and making real-time therapy choices. In the COVID-19 crisis, AI-enabled systems played a critical role in tracking patients and performing screening procedures.","Sir Demis Hassabis is the co-founder of Google DeepMind and a knighted British AI pioneer.

How antitrust case against Google may hurt company’s AI products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-antitrust-case-against-google-may-hurt-companys-ai-products/articleshow/120517731.cms,"Google says AI products fall outside the current case purview

Google’s bet on artificial intelligence (AI) may be under threat as the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has argued that Google’s alleged dominance in online search poses a significant threat to fair competition in the flourishing AI market. A DOJ attorney asserted that without stringent measures, the tech giant could leverage its AI products to further establish its search monopoly.According to news agency Reuters, DOJ attorney David Dahlquist is pushing for remedies designed to foster competition in the evolving search environment, particularly as it increasingly intersects with generative AI products such as ChatGPT.“This court's remedy should be forward-looking and not ignore what is on the horizon,” Dahlquist said, adding that Google's established search monopoly provides an unfair advantage in the development and improvement of its AI products.Conversely, these AI products can also serve as a strategic avenue to funnel users back to its dominant search engine, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of market control, he added.Countering the DOJ's arguments, Google's lawyer, John Schmidtlein, dismissed the proposed remedies as “a wishlist for competitors looking to get the benefits of Google's extraordinary innovations.” He argued that AI competitors are “competing just fine” and are seeking “handouts.”AI competitors “would like handouts as well even though they are competing just fine,” he said.Google contends that its AI products fall outside the purview of the current antitrust case, which primarily focuses on traditional search engines.In a blog post published on Sunday, Google executive Lee-Anne Mulholland asserted that adopting the proposed remedies “would hold back American innovation at a critical juncture.”Antitrust enforcers have put forward a series of potentially transformative measures aimed at rapidly opening up the search market and providing a competitive edge to newcomers. These proposals include terminating Google's exclusive default search agreements with major tablet and smartphone manufacturers like Apple.","US Department of Justice argues that Google's dominance in online search poses a significant threat to fair competition in the flourishing AI market.

Perplexity CEO says don’t breakup Google, but Android needs to open up to choices

Perplexity AI CEO Aravind Srinivas has been asked to testify in the ongoing Department of Justice antitrust case against Google, where he will advocate for consumer choice on Android while opposing the breakup of Google 's Chrome browser business.""Perplexity has been asked to testify in the Google DOJ case,"" Srinivas posted on X. ""Our core points: Google should not be broken up. Chrome should remain within and continue to be run by Google.""The testimony comes as Google faces a critical three-week hearing beginning Monday to determine penalties for operating what a federal judge ruled last year was an illegal search monopoly. The US Department of Justice is pushing for radical changes including forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser and banning exclusive search deals with companies like Apple.Srinivas believes breaking up Chrome would be counterproductive, stating, ""We don't believe anyone else can run a browser at that scale without a hit on quality, nor the business model to be able to serve that many users profitably by keeping the browser free.""Instead, Perplexity's testimony will focus on increasing consumer choice on Android devices. ""Android should become more open to consumer choice,"" Srinivas argued. ""Consumers should have the choice to pick who they want as a default search and default voice assistant, and OEMs should be able to offer consumers this choice.""In a blog post titled ""Choice is the Remedy,"" Perplexity criticized Google's restrictive contracts with phone manufacturers, stating that ""mobile companies are forced to give their customers a subpar experience that Google demands to preserve its monopoly.""Srinivas finds particularly frustrating ""how hard it is to change anything on Android. OEMs can only use a Google-approved version of Android, if they want to have core Google apps like PlayStore, Maps, etc.""According to Perplexity's blog, the remedy should focus on ""eliminating restrictive contracts that limit OEMs and carriers from giving consumers real choice"" rather than breaking up Google .The court proceedings, expected to last three weeks, will include testimony from Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Judge Amit Mehta plans to make his decision on remedies before Labor Day, with Google intending to appeal the original ruling after the hearings conclude.",Perplexity AI CEO Aravind Srinivas has been asked to testify in the ongoing Department of Justice antitrust case against Google.

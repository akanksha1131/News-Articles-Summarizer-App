What OpenAI is doing

Sam Altman-led OpenAI has accused Chinese DeepSeek of free-riding on the capabilities developed by OpenAI and other US frontier to replicate models and use them for its own training. The ChatGPT-maker has written a letter to the US House Select Committee warning them of DeepSeek using unfair and increasingly sophisticated methods to target OpenAI and America’s other leading AI companies. “Ahead of DeepSeek’s expected Lunar New Year release of a new, more powerful model, we are providing the Committee with an updated assessment of its evolving distillation tactics,” OpenAI writes in the memo.“OpenAI believes that infrastructure is destiny: chip development, power generation, transmission, and data center capacity will determine which countries can train and deploy frontier systems. This is why we’re investing through our Stargate Project to expand US AI infrastructure to 10 GW by 2029, and just one year in, we’re already over halfway toward that Goal,” the memo stated.“But we are equally focused on ensuring a level playing field, one where the People’s Republic of China (PRC) can’t advance autocratic AI by appropriating and repackaging American innovation”.Distillation tactic that OpenAI is accusing Chinese DeepSeek of involves using an older and more established AI model to review and judge the responses produced by a newer model. Through this process, knowledge and patterns learned by the older system are passed on to the newer one, helping it improve the quality of its answers.“We have observed usage patterns from several major Chinese LLM providers and some university research lab usage that are consistent with, and would be highly beneficial for, creating competitor models through Distillation,” OpenAI says in the memo.In the memo, OpenAI says that it has observed accounts associated with DeepSeek employees developing methods to circumvent OpenAI’s access restrictions and access models through obfuscated third-party routers and other ways that mask their source. “We also know that DeepSeek employees developed code to access US AI models and obtain outputs for distillation in programmatic ways. We believe that DeepSeek also uses third-party routers to access frontier models from other US labs,” it added.OpenAI says that it believes the best defense is offense: “the best way to ward off a fast-oncoming PRC making headway around the world for autocratic AI is continued investment in American AI leadership and global adoption of responsibly developed, democratic AI.”“We continue to lead in responsible frontier model innovation, invest across the full AI stack to train and deploy our systems safely, and make powerful AI tools available for free. Adoption of our latest agentic coding model, GPT-5.3-Codex, is up 60% week-over-week. Adoption of ChatGPT is at ~10% monthly growth,” the company added.",Sam Altman-led OpenAI has accused Chinese DeepSeek of free-riding on the capabilities developed by OpenAI and other US frontier to replicate models and use them for its own training.

Anxiety in the industry over AI and jobs



IBM has reportedly announced that it will triple the entry-level hiring in the US in 2026, even as artificial intelligence raises concerns about the future of early-career jobs. According to a report by Bloomberg, the IBM chief human resources officer Nickel LaMoreaux said that the expansion will cut across departments. Speaking at the Charter’s Leading with AI Summit in New York, LaMoreaux said, “And yes, it’s for all these jobs that we’re being told AI can do,” underscoring the company’s commitment to investing in human talent despite the increasing automation pressures.LaMoreaux further explained that IBM has revamped the job descriptions for junior positions such as software developers. Since AI tools can now handle the routine coding tasks, entry-level developers spend less time in writing code and more time working directly with customers. In HR, the junior staffers are tasked with intervening when chatbots fall short and correcting outputs and engaging with managers rather hand handling every inquiry themselves. “The entry-level jobs that you had two to three years ago, AI can do most of them,” LaMoreaux said.“So, if you’re going to convince your business leaders that you need to make this investment, then you need to be able to show the real value these individuals can bring now.”The announcement made by IBM comes at a time when fears of job cuts are lingering on the industry. The industry fear that AI could wipe out opportunities for the new graduates. Last year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei also warned that half of entry-level jobs may vanish by 2030. Advances in generative AI have already stoked anxiety among college students facing a tough job market.Some companies have cut back on early-career recruitment to save costs, but LaMoreaux cautioned that this could backfire. Without a pipeline of junior hires, firms risk a shortage of mid-level managers in the future, forcing them to poach talent from competitors — a more expensive and slower process.Melanie Rosenwasser, Chief People Officer at Dropbox also believe that younger workers are uniquely positioned to thrive in the AI era. “It’s like they’re biking in the Tour de France and the rest of us still have training wheels.”",IBM has reportedly announced that it will triple the entry-level hiring in the US in 2026.

Apple launches Vision Pro with M5 chip and Dual Knit Band

YouTube has finally released a dedicated app for Apple Vision Pro after the wait of two years. When the headset was launched, users had to rely on Safari to access YouTube but users missed out on features like offline downloads and optimised playback. The third-party apps briefly filled the gap but were removed for violating YouTube’s terms of service.The YouTube app for Apple Vision Pro enable users to watch standard videos and YouTube Shorts on a theatre-sized virtual screen. A standout addition is the Spatial tab, which highlights immersive formats such as 3D, VR180, and 360-degree videos. For suers with the latest Vision Pro models powered by the M5 chip, the app also support 8K playback, offering a significant update in visual fidelity. Gesture controls let viewers resize windows, scrub through video and interact more naturally with content.Some of the big streaming services such as Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount and Peacock launched native VisionOS apps ay the headset debut. YouTube’s delay raised qestions about its commitment to the platform, especially as early hype around Vision Pro cooled. Recent reports suggest sales have slowed, with only about 45,000 units shipped in Q4 2025, and production scaled back due to weak demand.The YouTube app is now available in the VisionOS App Store and it is compatible with both M2 and M5 chip models. Its arrival marks a significant step in expanding the Vision Pro’s content ecosystem, giving users access to one of the world’s largest video platforms in a fully immersive environment.Last year, Apple introduced an upgraded version of its Vision Pro. Coming after two years, the new headset comes equipped with the latest M5 chipset and runs VisionOS 26. The Cupertino-based company claims that the new M5 processor promises improved performance and even faster, smoother, and more responsive experience for Apple Vision Pro users, while introducing new opportunities for developers to create more advanced spatial and immersive experiences. Another key change coming with the new Apple Vision Pro is the dual knit band which, the company claims, helps users achieve an even more comfortable fit.Price of Apple Vision Pro with the M5 chip and Dual Knit Band starts at $3,499. Apple Vision Pro is available in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage capacities.","The YouTube app for Apple Vision Pro enable users to watch standard videos and YouTube Shorts on a theatre-sized virtual screen.

Here's the full text of the letter:

Dear Secretaries Rubio and Lutnick,

Thank you for your attention to this critical national security matter.

House Select Committee on China Chairman John Moolenaar and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick on the need for closer cooperation with partners and allies to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment. In addition to Chairmen Moolenaar and Mast, cosigners of the letter include House Foreign Affairs Ranking Member Meeks, South and Central Asia Subcommittee Chairman Bill Huizenga, South and Central Asia Subcommittee Ranking Member Sydney Kamlager-Dove, and Congressmen Greg Stanton, Michael Baumgartner, and Johnny Olszewski.The letter urges the State and Commerce Departments to restrict China's access to advanced chipmaking equipment, warning that gaps in export controls threaten national security. Lawmakers also asked U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to provide a briefing within the next month outlining its strategy for securing allied cooperation on broad, countrywide controls targeting critical semiconductor manufacturing equipment and components.We write to express our strong bipartisan support for robust export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) and to urge the State Department to urgently work to close the remaining critical gaps in our control regime through vigorous engagement with our allies.Export controls on SME represent one of America's most significant points of leverage in our strategic competition with the People's Republic of China. These tools are essential not only for producing the advanced AI chips that will shape the future of both economic and military power, but also for manufacturing the legacy chips that go into PLA weapons systems and intelligence platforms. Maintaining restrictions on this equipment is critical to U.S. national security.SME controls have also been a bipartisan priority across administrations. The first Trump administration successfully pressed the Netherlands to restrict exports of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tools to China—a decision that remains the single most consequential chokepoint restriction to date. The Biden administration issued expansive new controls to cover additional equipment categories and solicited additional complementary controls from allies. This continuity reflects a shared recognition across party lines that protecting America's semiconductor advantage is essential to our national security.Despite meaningful progress, however, critical gaps persist in our export control regime. Of particular concern, certain foreign-produced chokepoint SME is controlled only for certain specified entities in China, rather than on a countrywide basis. This matters because once equipment crosses the border into China, the U.S. government has extremely limited ability to enforce end-use and end-user restrictions. Verification visits require advance permission from PRC authorities, can take weeks or months to arrange, and are conducted under escort by PRC security personnel. Entity-specific controls, while valuable, cannot substitute for countrywide restrictions on the most critical chokepoint tools.As documented in the Select Committee on China's recent bipartisan report, Selling the Forges of the Future, and as highlighted in the House Foreign Affairs Committee's hearing, “Export Control Loopholes: Chipmaking Tools and their Subcomponents,” China has significantly accelerated imports of foreign-produced chokepoint equipment in recent years. Dutch sales to China of advanced lithography equipment – the most important chokepoint in the supply chain – doubled from 2022 to 2023, and again from 2023 to 2024.Recent reporting from the Financial Times suggests that China is upgrading these imported tools to a level that likely exceeds export control thresholds. Each chokepoint tool that enters China represents a permanent loss of American leverage.Additionally, China is working to build domestic SME by exploiting access to U.S. and allied subcomponents required to produce tools, such as electrostatic chucks. Left unchecked, China could render U.S. and allied export controls irrelevant by replacing foreign chipmaking tools entirely.We believe the most effective path forward is vigorous diplomatic engagement with our allies, coupled with clear expectations and timelines. Our allies share our interest in preventing the PRC from achieving semiconductor self-sufficiency, and many have already demonstrated willingness to align with U.S. controls. But time is not on our side.We urge the Administration to press allies to implement countrywide controls on key chokepoint semiconductor manufacturing equipment and subcomponents: that is, all equipment and subcomponents that China cannot produce indigenously. This engagement should include clear and reasonable deadlines, after which the United States should be prepared to act to close remaining gaps itself if necessary, including by prohibiting the use of U.S. -origin components in the production of chokepoint tools destined to China. We also encourage the Administration to work with allies to restrict servicing of chokepoint equipment countrywide, to the extent feasible, since many chokepoint tools have already reached restricted chipmaking facilities but still require extensive servicing to maintain.The window to secure America's semiconductor advantage is narrowing. We request a briefing within the next month on the Administration's strategy for securing allied cooperation on countrywide controls on chokepoint semiconductor manufacturing equipment and components and the timeline for achieving this goal. We stand ready to work with you on a bipartisan basis to ensure our export control regime and the alliances that support it are equal to this challenge.",House Select Committee on China Chairman John Moolenaar and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. The letter urges the State and Commerce Departments to restrict China's access to advanced chipmaking equipment. Lawmakers also asked U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to provide a briefing within the next month.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128273285,imgsize-1102160,width-400,resizemode-4/us-china.jpg"

Despite a significant selloff in software stocks triggered by Anthropic's legal AI tools, they argue AI will enhance, not replace, existing software, enabling greater productivity and innovation.

Nvidia's Huang chimes in with Pichai, calls selloff 'most illogical thing in the world'

What exactly triggered the selloff

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

Why the fear runs deeper than one plugin

Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't buying the panic. During the company's earnings call, Pichai pushed back against the market hysteria triggered by Anthropic's new AI plugins, calling it overblown. AI is ""an enabling tool,"" he said, just as it has been for Google 's own products—Search, YouTube and others. Companies ""seizing the moment"" will find the same opportunity ahead, he added.His comments come as software stocks worldwide nurse heavy losses. Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugins, wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single session. Analysts dubbed it a 'SaaSpocalypse'. Pichai's view? The scramble is overdone.Pichai isn't alone in questioning the market reaction. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was even more direct at a Cisco event, calling the selloff ""the most illogical thing in the world."" His take: AI will use existing software tools, not reinvent them. ""Would you use a screwdriver or invent a new screwdriver?"" he asked. Huang added that Nvidia itself has adopted such tools extensively, freeing up employees to focus on designing chips and computer systems.Software company executives have also pushed back, arguing they do far more than just build code. Their offerings include data management and purpose-built solutions that are difficult to replicate, especially for enterprises outside the tech world like retail and oil and gas.Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its agentic AI assistant for non-technical professionals. Most covered standard enterprise functions—sales, marketing, finance, customer support. But the legal plugin rattled nerves. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings.Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan called it ""a sign of intensifying competition"" that could hurt big players in the legal space. The fallout was swift. Thomson Reuters and RELX both closed down around 15%. LegalZoom crashed nearly 20%. Indian IT stocks weren't spared—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5%, Wipro fell nearly 5%.The concern isn't just about legal workflows. There's a dawning realisation that AI tools can now do far more than most non-techies realise. With relatively simple prompts, they can take over a user's computer, write software, analyse stock market data, manage emails and countless other tasks. People have taken to social media describing how they built their first software program without ever learning to code. Shopify's CEO built software that could interpret his recent MRI.Meta's CFO Susan Li told investors last week that the company has seen a 30% year-over-year increase in output per engineer driven by AI coding tools. Power users have seen an 80% boost.Anthropic's numbers back up the concern. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualised recurring revenue by November, months after launch. The company is reportedly raising $20 billion at a $350 billion valuation. Jefferies noted that OpenAI is losing corporate ground to Claude, with enterprises now making up 80% of Anthropic's business.Pichai and Huang are betting the panic subsides. Wall Street isn't so sure yet.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismiss market panic over AI plugins, calling it overblown.

Oracle’s risky AI bet

Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has now seen an unprecedented $50 billion wiped off his net worth in less than forty days this year, as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison’s fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January. A single-day slump of 5% in Oracle’s stock erased about $9 billion from this wealth, deepening the decline.The round in software stocks was triggered by Anthropic’s release of plugins for its Claude Cowork AI agent, which can easily automate corporate tasks in legal, scales, finance, marketing and data analysis. Investors now fear that such tools could lead to reduction in the demand for external software from established giants such as Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit and Atlassian. Shares of all these companies tumbled earlier this week before staging a particle rebound, but Oracle’s loses remained steep.Ellison was not along in facing the sharp decline in net worth. Along with him, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also saw his net worth fall by around $11 billion, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost around $8 billion. On the other hand, other tech leaders like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang each shed around $5 billion as the stocks of the companies dropped by at least 2%.For those unaware, Oracle has aggressively positioned itself as an important player in the AI boom, the company has signed deals with Nvidia and OpenAI in order to offer data centers powering next-generation technology. However, its heavy spending and increasing debt have raised concerns among analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations — contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue — surged 438% year-over-year to $523 billion as of November 30, nearly ten times its annual revenue of $53 billion.Critics believe that Oracle may be overspending. Popular American investor Michael Burry has publicly bet against Oracle. Burry has warned that the company’s debt-fueled expansion tied to AI contracts was unnecessary, calling the moves “hard to explain” and suggesting that “ego” might be driving decisions.","Ellison's fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January.

Why Microsoft needs a quality czar right now

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre. Charlie Bell, who led the company's security operations since 2021, is stepping down from that role to become what's effectively an engineering quality czar—reporting directly to Nadella.""Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo shared on Wednesday. ""And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!""Bell's replacement? Hayete Gallot, who's returning to Microsoft after an 18-month stint as Google Cloud's President of Customer Experience. She previously spent over 15 years at Redmond, climbing to the rank of corporate vice president across Windows, Office, and security teams.The shift is significant. Bell oversaw a team of roughly 10,000 people and was the driving force behind Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative—a company-wide push launched after Chinese hackers breached US government email accounts through a Microsoft Cloud exploit in 2023. That incident triggered a scathing review from the Department of Homeland Security, which called Microsoft's security culture ""inadequate.Now, Bell will work closely with cloud and AI chief Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on what Nadella calls the ""Quality Excellence Initiative."" The initiative is aimed at delivering ""durable, high-quality experiences at global scale""—corporate speak that likely translates to fewer Azure outages, fewer broken Windows patches, and fewer out-of-band emergency fixes.Gallot's appointment signals a shift in how Microsoft thinks about its security business. Nadella specifically highlighted her ability to combine ""product building with value realization for customers."" She'll also oversee Ales Holecek, who takes on a newly created Chief Architect for Security role.The timing isn't random. During last week's earnings call, Nadella talked up momentum in security products like Security Copilot agents and Purview. The company clearly wants someone who can sell security as aggressively as they build it.Nadella's memo doesn't spell out exactly why engineering quality needs its own dedicated leader at this moment. But the clues aren't hard to find. Microsoft now uses AI to write around 30 percent of its own code, Azure outages remain a recurring headache, and Copilot adoption sits at a modest 3.3 percent among Microsoft 365 users. Bell's got his work cut out.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre.

Why Amazon is shutting down Amazon Go and Fresh stores

Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain. The decision of the company to shut down the Amazon Fresh stores will lead to thousands of job cuts across the US. Last week, the e-commerce major announced that it will close around 60 Fresh stores which will put an end to the effort of six-years. As reported by Business Insider, the WARN notices filed in various states confirm the sale of layoffs. As aper the filling, in California only the company will shut down 20 Fresh stores which will affect around 3,900 workers. Most Fresh locations closed to the public on February 1, though California stores will remain open until mid-March due to state law.As Amazon is shutting down the Fresh stores, it has outlined two main options for the affected employees. The company is giving a choice to the employees in which they can either choose the severance pay or can take transfer within the company. The workers will continue to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after the closure announcement, or until April 28. The compensation offered by the company will be based on either the minimum pay for their employee class of their average hours worked over the past 60 days whichever is higher.The report further adds that employees who do not secure another role within the company by late April will then receive severance packages, calculated as one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh. Workers are guaranteed a minimum of four weeks’ pay, with the possibility of up to 20 weeks depending on tenure.For those seeking to remain within Amazon, the company is encouraging Fresh workers to apply for similar positions at Whole Foods Stores or Amazon grocery warehouse via its internal A to Z portal. An Amazon spokesperson said: “All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we’re providing career transition services to help them explore options.”Amazon Fresh associates typically earned between $16 and $20 per hour, according to data from job site Indeed. Their responsibilities ranged from picking delivery orders to handling checkout operations.Amazon Go and Fresh stores were introduced as Just Walk Out technology, but they struggled to establish a distinctive customer experience and sustainable economic model. On the other hand, Whole Food Market acquired in 2017 by Amazon say strong growth with sales rising more than 40% in recent years. Also, Amazon’s online grocery business also witnessed a surge with perishable grocery sales through Same-Day Delivery growing 40x since January 2025, making fresh groceries one of the most-ordered categories on its platform.",Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s academic background and early career path



Dario Amodei’s rise at OpenAI and the birth of GPT models



Dario Amodei leaves OpenAI and builds Anthropic



Dario Amodei’s cautious leadership style



Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now. He is not a loud public figure, and he rarely chases attention, but his work has quietly shaped how modern AI systems are built and controlled. Before running a multi-billion-dollar company, Amodei spent years in labs and research roles, studying complex systems and how they behave under pressure. That background still shows in how he talks about artificial intelligence today. While others focus on speed and scale, he appears more concerned with safety, limits, and long-term risks. As AI moves faster than regulation, Amodei’s cautious approach is becoming harder to ignore.Before AI became the world’s favourite buzzword, Amodei was deep in academia. He studied physics at Stanford University and later earned a PhD in biophysics from Princeton. At the time, he was focused on understanding complex biological systems. Cells. Signals. Patterns that emerge rather than being designed. Looking back, that mindset fits AI almost too well.After completing his doctorate, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine.There was no clear path to becoming a tech billionaire. That part came later. Almost accidentally, it seems. Amodei eventually moved into machine learning research, joining companies like Baidu and Google Brain. At Google, he worked on neural networks and AI safety.Colleagues from that period say he already seemed concerned about failure modes. In 2016, he joined OpenAI. Things moved fast after that.At OpenAI, Amodei rose quickly. By 2019, he was Vice President of Research, helping set the organisation’s overall research direction. He led work on GPT-2 and GPT-3, models that changed public perception of AI almost overnight.These systems could write essays, answer questions, and even mimic conversation. Sometimes convincingly. Sometimes awkwardly. During this time, Amodei also co-invented reinforcement learning from human feedback. RLHF sounds technical, but the idea is simple. Teach AI systems by showing them what humans actually prefer, not just what scores well mathematically.In 2021, Amodei left OpenAI along with six others, including his sister Daniela Amodei. They founded Anthropic. Some people were sceptical at first. But Anthropic took a different route. It became a public benefit corporation. That detail mattered. It signalled that profit would not be the only priority. At least in theory. Their AI model, Claude, leaned into being cautious. Less dramatic. More restrained. That tone appealed to companies worried about reputational risk.By September 2025, Anthropic was reportedly valued at $183 billion by private investors. That number raised eyebrows. Especially for a company without much public hype.Partnerships with Alphabet and Amazon helped fuel that growth. So did rising concerns about AI safety across governments and corporations. As Anthropic’s valuation climbed, so did Amodei’s wealth. His real-time net worth now sits around $3.7 billion, ranking among the world’s richest people.Amodei does not sound like most tech CEOs. He hedges. A lot. “It seems.” “It might.” “We’re not fully sure yet.” That language annoys some people. Others trust it more. He avoids grand predictions. No promises of utopia. No claims that AI will solve everything.Experts say his influence shows up in quieter ways. Safety research is becoming mainstream. Alignment discussions moving from fringe to boardroom. Competitors are copying ideas they once ignored. No one really knows what comes next for Dario Amodei. AI is moving fast. Faster than regulation.","Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now.

'OpenAI deal is eating Oracle alive financially'

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

US banks are pulling back—and that's a big problem

A possible Cerner sale and 40% upfront customer deposits show how tight things have gotten

Oracle is staring down the possibility of its largest-ever workforce reduction—and at the heart of it is a $300 billion partnership with OpenAI that's proving far more expensive than anyone initially let on.Investment bank TD Cowen reported this week that Oracle is weighing cuts of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs. The move would free up an estimated $8 to $10 billion in cash flow, money the company desperately needs as it tries to bankroll a sprawling network of AI data centers built largely to serve Sam Altman 's company.TD Cowen puts the OpenAI commitment alone at around $156 billion in capital spending—and roughly 3 million GPUs to back it up. Oracle has already burned through $58 billion in debt in just two months. That's $38 billion for data centers in Texas and Wisconsin, $20 billion for a campus in New Mexico. Total debt now sits north of $100 billion.The kicker? That $58 billion covers only a slice of what's actually needed. Since its September 2025 peak, Oracle's stock has shed more than half its value—about $463 billion in market cap, gone.The financing crunch isn't just an Oracle internal issue anymore.Multiple US banks have quietly retreated from lending on Oracle-linked data center projects. TD Cowen noted that lenders have roughly doubled the interest rate premiums they charge Oracle since September, pushing borrowing costs into territory usually reserved for junk-rated companies.The result? Several data center leases Oracle had been negotiating simply stalled. Private operators couldn't get the funding to build, which means Oracle can't deliver the capacity its customers—especially OpenAI—are counting on. Some Asian banks are still willing to step in, but that doesn't solve the immediate problem in the US, where most of Oracle's expansion is planned.Oracle isn't sitting idle. The company is now requiring new customers to pay up to 40% of contract value upfront—essentially asking clients to co-fund the infrastructure. It's also exploring ""bring your own chip"" arrangements, where customers supply their own hardware.On the table too is a potential sale of Cerner, the healthcare software unit Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in 2022. That would be a significant strategic pivot, signaling that AI infrastructure is now the clear priority—everything else is up for grabs.TD Cowen also flagged that OpenAI has already begun shifting some near-term capacity needs over to Microsoft and Amazon, which is not exactly a vote of confidence in Oracle's ability to deliver on schedule.The company has not publicly commented on the layoff reports or the financing difficulties.","Oracle faces massive job cuts, potentially 20,000-30,000, to fund its costly $300 billion OpenAI partnership.

"Egypt bans Roblox nationwide over child safety concerns, raising global questions about kids' online freedom",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/egypt-bans-roblox-nationwide-over-child-safety-concerns-raising-global-questions-about-kids-online-freedom/articleshow/127935398.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Roblox faces a government ban in Egypt: Here’s why



What this ban means for kids and parents



Roblox going dark in Egypt, the platform that lives almost entirely on screens, the sudden loss felt very real. With games loading, Avatars running around blocky worlds. And then Egypt has officially banned Roblox, saying the move is about protecting children from harmful online content. The story underneath feels layered, political, and a little messy. Roblox looks harmless on the surface but experts say the risk is not the visuals but the interaction. The platform allows users to create games, chat with strangers, and move freely between user-generated worlds.A spokesperson confirmed the company has reached out to Egyptian authorities, offering dialogue to resolve the issue and restore access. The company says it has worked with regulators in other regions to build localised safety systems that align with cultural values. Last year, the company restricted some features across parts of the Middle East to address safety concerns. This ban did not come out of nowhere. Roblox has already been blocked or restricted in countries like Qatar and Turkey with other nations watching closely.The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.According to state-run media, the ban will be coordinated with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. That means internet providers are expected to block access nationwide with no single official explanation was released at first. Later, state outlets pointed to growing concerns about children’s exposure to inappropriate content, online interactions, and psychological risks as reported by Bloomberg. An Egyptian senator had already called for regulating Roblox to protect children’s moral and educational values.President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi recently called for limits on children’s phone use, pointing to similar moves abroad. Australia has banned social media for certain age groups. France is moving in the same direction. Egypt’s parliament is now discussing broader rules for digital platforms including unified age classifications, stronger verification, penalties and possibly forcing companies to have local representatives inside the country.For children, the ban feels abrupt and confusing. For parents, reactions are mixed. Some welcome the move, while others worry it pushes kids toward less visible, less regulated platforms, potentially exposing them to more risks. That is the irony experts often point out. When one door closes, another usually opens. Sometimes darker, more unpredictable, and harder to monitor.Still, supporters of the ban argue that Roblox’s scale makes it different. Millions of users. Constant interaction. Endless content that cannot realistically be watched, moderated, or controlled by humans alone, leaving significant safety and privacy concerns for young players and families.","The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive.

Russia has confirmed ban on Meta's WhatsApp. Russia said that it has blocked the messaging service WhatsApp over its failure to comply with local legislation. Kremlin urged WhatsApp's 100 million Russian users to switch to a domestic alternative. ""As for the blocking of WhatsApp... such a decision was indeed made and implemented,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov said the decision was due to WhatsApp's ""reluctance to comply with the norms and letter of Russian law"".The government has asked citizens to use country's own Max app, calling it a good alternative. ""Max is an accessible alternative, a developing messenger, a national messenger. And it is an alternative available on the market for citizens,"" he said. The Russian government directed manufacturers to include Max on all new phones and tablets starting September last year. Released by Russian social media giant VK in early 2025, it has been touted as a ""super app"" similar to China's WeChat or Alipay, capable of doing everything from accessing government services to ordering a Burger.Russian authorities reportedly removed the Meta-owned app, which had at least 100 million users in the country until recently, from the equivalent of an online directory run by Roskomnadzor, the internet regulator.That step is said to essentially erase WhatsApp from Russia’s internet, making it nearly impossible to access the service without extensive workarounds. Moscow also removed Meta’s Facebook and Instagram from the directory, leaving them accessible only via VPNs (virtual private networks) after they had been designated as “extremist”.In a statement, WhatsApp said: “Today the Russian government has attempted to fully block WhatsApp in an effort to drive users to a state-owned surveillance app. Trying to isolate over 100mn people from private and secure communication is a backwards step and can only lead to less safety for people in Russia.”Earlier this week, Russia's internet watchdog said that it would also slap ""phased restrictions"" on messaging platform, Telegram, which it also accused of not complying with local legislation.

After that, law enforcement can ask for location data through the courts.

Is IMEI tracking guaranteed to recover your phone



It can feel like losing a part of your daily life when you lose your phone. Smartphones can hold a lot more than just contacts and pictures these days. They have apps for banking, work emails, personal chats, digital IDs, and even access to government services. The first thing a lot of people want to know when their phone is stolen or lost is if they can find it using its IMEI number.The International Mobile Equipment Identity number, or IMEI, is often called a ""fingerprint"" for each mobile device. Many people believe that if they have this number, the police or phone companies can quickly locate a stolen phone. People often say on social media and in casual advice that the IMEI number is all you need to find a device anywhere in the world.But how true is this idea? Can you really find a lost or stolen phone just by using the IMEI number? What do the police, telecom companies, and government systems do? And what should a person do after they lose a device?Know how IMEI tracking works, what it can do, and what it can't do here.The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a number that identifies a mobile device. Every mobile device that connects to a cellular network has a 15-digit IMEI number.It is a unique identifier for the physical device, not the SIM card. The IMEI number of a phone stays the same even if the user changes their SIM.You can find your phone’s IMEI number by:Telecom companies use the IMEI to tell devices apart on their networks. Police can also use this number to look into stolen phones.The short answer is: not by an ordinary user.According to information published by telecom regulators and law enforcement agencies in several countries, an individual cannot directly track a phone using its IMEI number. There is no public website or app that allows users to type in an IMEI and see the phone’s location.But in some situations, authorities and telecom service providers can use the IMEI number to help find a device that connects to a mobile network.Here is how it works in practice:Police and telecom companies need to work together for this process to work. It doesn't happen right away; the phone needs to be turned on and connected to a cellular network.The police say that the first thing you should do if your phone is stolen is to report it. People in India are told to file a First Information Report or an online complaint through official websites.The Central Equipment Identity Register, or CEIR, is run by the Department of Telecommunications. The Government of India's official CEIR portal says that this system lets users block a lost or stolen phone using its IMEI number.Once blocked:But blocking a phone through CEIR doesn't automatically show the user where it is. Tracking someone's location is still a part of the legal process.If the SIM card is removed and the phone is not connected to a mobile network, it cannot be tracked through telecom tower records. IMEI-based detection depends on the device connecting to a cellular network.If the phone is switched off, placed in aeroplane mode, or never connected to a network again, telecom systems cannot detect its presence.However, if a thief inserts a new SIM card and turns on the phone, the IMEI can be recorded again when it connects to the network.A lot of people confuse IMEI tracking with GPS tracking.Apps and services like these let you track GPS:These services connect to the internet and link accounts on different devices. Find My Device can show the last known location of an Android phone if:Apple also says in its support documents that Find My can find devices that are linked to an Apple ID.IMEI numbers are not needed for these services. They keep track of things using cloud-based tracking that is linked to user accounts.In a lot of cases, these tools are better and faster for immediate tracking than waiting for an IMEI-based investigation.Sharing your IMEI number publicly is not recommended.According to cybersecurity experts and telecom operators, criminals can sometimes attempt to clone IMEI numbers. IMEI cloning involves copying a valid IMEI number onto another device to mask its identity. This is illegal in many countries.The Government of India has stated through the Department of Telecommunications that tampering with or altering IMEI numbers is a punishable offence.For this reason, users should avoid posting screenshots or photos that reveal their IMEI numbers on social media.Based on advisories from police departments and telecom operators, the recommended steps are:IMEI tracking doesn't always work to find a stolen phone. Authorities can use the IMEI as a technical identifier during an investigation, but it only works if the device reconnects to a network and stays intact.IMEI tracking is best thought of as a tool that helps stop abuse and help with investigations, not as a way to track people in real time.","The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a number that identifies a mobile device. Every mobile device that connects to a cellular network has a 15-digit IMEI number. It is a unique identifier for the physical device, not the SIM card.

German trade union says Tesla’s allegation is a lie

""calculated lie""

""Influencing elections with fabricated accusations reminds us of the tactics of authoritarian regimes,""

'India Must Find Its Own Elon Musk': Ex-DGMO Emphasises Superiority In Space Tech To Win Future Wars

Tesla has filed a criminal complaint against a member of Germany's IG Metall trade union. A report by the news agency Reuters cited an internal company memo to claim that the Elon Musk-led EV maker has accused the German trade union representative of trying to secretly record a meeting at the company's factory near Berlin. Earlier this week, the external IG Metall representative, who was participating in a Tesla works council meeting as a guest, was spotted recording the gathering on their laptop; local company management said in a memo to staff, seen by Reuters.According to the Reuters report, the union member was excluded from the meeting, which had been convened to discuss issues affecting the 11,000 employees at the German factory, and police confiscated the computer, the memo said. In a written message to staff, Tesla management said that this week’s works council meeting was not held in public and that recording non-public statements with a device is a crime under German law. However, the IG Metall external representative accused of attempting to record the meeting secretly was not named in the memo or by the union.In a statement to Reuters, IG Metall described Tesla's statement as aahead of works council elections scheduled for March, repeating that plant management wanted to keep the union at bay in favour of an obedient labour representation.At the last works council elections two years ago, the majority of Tesla's staff in Germany chose not to join the IG Metall Union and opted for a non-unionised works council.The criminal complaint marks the latest escalation in tensions between local Tesla management in Germany and IG Metall ahead of key elections to the works council next month. IG Metall, Germany's industrial union, is campaigning to gain control of the works council at what is Tesla's only European factory. The carmaker's plant is the only vehicle factory in Germany where wages are not set through a collective bargaining agreement.However, IG Metall failed to secure a majority on the works council in the 2024 elections, despite receiving the most votes among employees. A coalition of independent groups leads the workers' body. Gaining a majority on the works council would represent a step towards IG Metall's aim to negotiate a pay deal for employees at Tesla's German factory. IG Metall accused Tesla of using the criminal complaint as an election manoeuvre.regional IG Metall chief Jan Otto told the Financial Times. Meanwhile, Elon Musk , Tesla's chief executive, has been a critic of unionisation.Tesla has also been involved in a dispute with unions in Sweden since 2023 over its refusal to sign a collective bargaining agreement with mechanics. In the US, it has been accused of alleged anti-union conduct. Tesla's German management has argued that a union-negotiated agreement on wages and working hours would undermine the company's competitiveness, as many carmakers in the country are cutting jobs amid high production costs.André Thierig, manager of Tesla's Germany factory, told the press agency DPA late last year that he could notThe frictions with the trade unions come at a time when Tesla is reeling under the impact of falling sales of cars, notably in Europe, where the company has come under criticism for the political activities of Musk, especially his support for far-right parties like Alternative for Germany.Last year, Tesla lost its global position as the top electric-car maker to Chinese manufacturer BYD after the US company's sales declined 9% to 1.6 million vehicles. The drop was larger for the European market, where Tesla sales fell 27% to 239,000 units in 2025, according to ACEA, a European trade body for the car industry.Currently, Tesla's German factory produces about 5,000 units a week, according to management statements, which is equivalent to about 250,000 cars a year.",Tesla has filed a criminal complaint against a member of Germany's IG Metall trade union.

What allegations have the Italian tax police brought against Amazon



The Italian tax police recently raided Amazon 's Milan headquarters. A report by the news agency Reuters, citing two sources with direct knowledge of the matter, claimed that the raid was part of a new tax-evasion investigation into the e-commerce major. Italy’s tax police are reportedly investigating whether the US-based tech giant maintained an undisclosed permanent establishment in Italy from 2019 to 2024 and whether it should have paid more taxes in the country.The Guardia di Finanza also searched the homes of seven Amazon managers and the offices of auditing firm KPMG, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Milan prosecutors have opened an investigation into Amazon EU Sarl, based in Luxembourg, and its director, Barbara Scarafia, on suspicion of failing to declare income, according to a search warrant seen by Reuters.According to the warrant (seen by Reuters), Amazon had an official business presence in Italy before August 2024, when it entered into an agreement with Italy's tax agency and began paying taxes there.The warrant added that in 2024 alone, Amazon EU Sarl had fired and then rehired 159 workers who were assigned to another Amazon company, which the investigators take as proof of the fact that in that period, Amazon was doing business in Italy.Italian tax police seized computers and other devices belonging to managers, including hard drives that store employee emails after they are deleted from Amazon systems every three months, sources said.The search at KPMG, which is not being investigated, occurred because the firm was among those that provided an opinion on the actions under investigation.This is just one of several tax cases involving Amazon in Italy. In December, the company agreed with Italy's tax collection agency to pay 510 million euros ($605.88 million) to settle a tax dispute.In that dispute, Milan prosecutors suspect tax evasion of about 1.2 billion euros for 2019-2021 and expect to conclude their investigation early this year, according to a source familiar with the matter.Apart from this, Italian prosecutors are conducting two other investigations into the company. One into Amazon’s suspected tax evasion for 2021-2024 and another into suspected customs and tax fraud involving Chinese imports.",The Italian tax police recently raided Amazon's Milan headquarters.

Softbank 'drops' plan to spend $50 billion on buying American company after pursuing the deal for months

It seems Japanese giant Softbank's OpenAI investment is paying off. SoftBank posted a $2.4 billion gain at its Vision Fund in the December quarter as a jump in the value of its OpenAI investment helped offset losses in some of its other bets. The Japanese giant, owned by one of the Japan's richest man Masayoshi Son, said that it made a $4.2 billion gain on the value of its OpenAI investment in its fiscal third quarter, which runs to the end of December, offsetting losses stemming from the share price declines of Coupang and Chinese ride-hailing app Didi. With its Vision Fund, SoftBank has invested in AI companies it believes will be category winners, seeking to position itself at the center of the technology’s development. SoftBank’s AI push has involved a $30 billion-plus investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, it now owns approximately 11% of OpenAI. OpenAI now represents one of SoftBank’s biggest holdings, alongside a roughly 90% stake in chip designer Arm Holdings Plc.OpenAI is reportedly raising a new funding round of around $100 billion. However, despite the numbers, Softbank is not as yet sure of further joining OpenAI's funding round.SoftBank’s bet in OpenAI is based on its visibility into the startup’s technology and business model, as well as communication with top management, SoftBank Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto said. “We are investing in OpenAI with high conviction that the company will lead in developing AI,” he said. Regarding further commitments to the startup, “nothing concrete has been decided,” he said. SoftBank will stick to its policy of keeping enough liquidity on hand to cover two-years’ worth of bond repayments, Goto said.Late last year, SoftBank Group reportedly raced to finalize a $22.5 billion funding commitment to ChaGPT-maker OpenAI. According to a report in Reuters, the company used a complex array of cash-raising methods that include liquidating major stakes and potentially tapping billions in margin loans. Investors have been focused on how SoftBank will fund its continued investments, particularly in OpenAI, which currently remains unprofitable. The Japanese investment giant has been reducing its stakes in other companies to funnel money toward OpenAI. In October, SoftBank sold its entire stake in Nvidia for $5.83 billion and between June and December, it sold $12.73 billion worth of T-Mobile stock. SoftBank has also taken out loans backed by its other holdings, such as chip designer Arm.Last month, Softbank signed a $3 billion deal to buy private equity firm DigitalBridge Group Inc, whose portfolio includes digital infrastructure companies such as AtlasEdge, DataBank, Switch and Vantage Data Centers. Prior to that announcement, SoftBank bought US chip designer Ampere Computing LLC for $6.5 billion and announced a $5.4 billion acquisition of ABB Ltd.’s robotics unit.In January 2026, SoftBank Group chairman Masayoshi Son reportedly 'dropped' plans to buy the US data center operator Switch Inc. According to a report by Bloomberg, SoftBank Group halted acquisition talks of the American data center operator Switch. Analysts term the same as a setback to founder Masayoshi Son’s ambition to roll out Stargate AI infrastructure. SoftBank's Masayoshi is said to have pursued the Switch deal, valued at around $50 billion, for many months. Masayoshi is said to believe that direct control of Switch's network of energy-efficient data centers would help Donald Trump's $500 billion Stargate project to generate computing power for partner OpenAI. As per analysts, the deal would have given a much-needed boost to the Stargate Project to build US data centers. In January 2025, soon after Donald Trump's swearing in, Softbank founder Masayoshi had pledged to deploy $100 billion “immediately” alongside OpenAI, Oracle and Abu Dhabi’s MGX.","SoftBank posted a $2.4 billion gain at its Vision Fund in the December quarter as a jump in the value of its OpenAI investment helped offset losses in some of its other bets.

"What the big 'urgency' in Microsoft, Anthropic and OpenAI's electricity pledge shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-the-big-urgency-in-microsoft-anthropic-and-openais-electricity-pledge-shows/articleshow/128259997.cms,"Major AI firms like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic are pledging to cover data center electricity costs, anticipating a White House proposal. This proactive move aims to preempt government mandates as AI's power demand surges, potentially tripling by 2028 and driving up consumer costs. Companies are acting to shape terms before legislation forces their hand.

Data centre power demand could triple by 2028, and consumers are already paying

Data centre electricity costs are now an election issue in the US

The pledges sound generous—until you see the alternative

Three of the world's biggest AI companies made nearly identical promises within 30 days. Microsoft kicked things off on January 13, pledging to cover the full electricity costs of its data centres. OpenAI followed on January 21. Anthropic joined on February 11. Same playbook. Same month.The reason? A White House draft compact, obtained by Politico, reveals the Trump administration is preparing a voluntary agreement that would require AI companies to pay 100% of new power generation costs tied to their data centres. The companies aren't leading—they're getting ahead of the announcement while they still get to set the terms.The numbers behind this rush are stark. Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found data centres consumed 4.4% of US electricity in 2024 and could hit 12% by 2028. Carnegie Mellon researchers estimated this demand surge could push electricity generation prices up by 25% in data centre-heavy markets by 2030. Consumers on the largest US grid, PJM Interconnection, face a $16.6 billion bill from 2025 through 2027 just to secure future power supply for these facilities.That kind of math turns into a political problem fast. And it already has.New York state senators introduced a bill to pause data centre permits entirely. Senator Van Hollen pushed legislation requiring AI companies to cover expansion costs. Virginia's new governor campaigned specifically on making data centres pay their own way. When elected officials build campaigns around your energy footprint, voluntary pledges start looking like a survival strategy.AEP Ohio offered a preview of what forced accountability looks like. When the utility required data centres to pay 85% of claimed capacity upfront, speculative requests dropped by more than half—from 26 GW to 13 GW. Real financial commitment filtered out projects that were never serious to begin with.Microsoft said it would pay full property taxes and refuse local tax breaks. OpenAI promised to fund grid upgrades for its Stargate data centres. Anthropic committed to covering 100% of interconnection costs. All three said they'd cut power usage during demand peaks.It reads like corporate responsibility. But the alternative was legislation forcing all of it anyway—plus permit freezes, exit fees, and binding capacity contracts.The AI industry didn't suddenly discover civic duty. It discovered a closing window. And it jumped through before someone else shut it.","Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic are pledging to cover data centre electricity costs, anticipating a White House proposal.

Apptronik secures $520 million to scale Apollo robots



Apptronik teams up with big names to build collaborative robots



Apptronik builds on experience to expand Apollo’s reach



The Austin-based robotics company Apptronik just closed a massive funding round, reportedly bringing its total Series A to over $935 million. Investors are lining up. Old names like Google, Mercedes-Benz, B Capital, and PEAK6 stayed on board. New ones, including AT&T Ventures, John Deere, and Qatar Investment Authority, reportedly joined in. They’re building Apollo, a humanoid robot designed to work alongside humans, but not to replace them. Production and deployment are about to get a serious boost, and the company appears to be gearing up for a very busy 2026, with expanded manufacturing facilities, new enterprise partnerships, and accelerated pilot programmes across logistics, retail, and industrial sectors.As reported by the Apptronik official website, the recent $520 million Series A-X round follows an already oversubscribed $415 million Series A in 2025. That brought the total to nearly $1 billion. Experts say the extension round was opened at a 3x multiple of the original valuation. That suggests investors are betting big on Apptronik’s vision. The company plans to use the capital to ramp up production of Apollo and expand its network of commercial and pilot deployments worldwide.The funding will reportedly support new facilities for robot training and data collection. This could be crucial for improving performance in real-world settings. The goal seems to be faster time-to-market and smoother integration into industries that really need automation, like logistics and manufacturing.Apptronik isn’t working alone but has signed deals with some serious players, including Mercedes-Benz, GXO Logistics, Jabil and Google DeepMind, which is also on board, reportedly helping develop the next generation of humanoid robots using Gemini Robotics. It seems the strategy is to combine robotics hardware with cutting-edge AI to create machines that are genuinely collaborative.Jeff Cardenas, co-founder and CEO, said the company is aiming for robots that aren’t just tools, but trusted collaborators. That’s an interesting shift from traditional industrial robots, which mostly work separately from humans. Apollo is designed to carry out physically demanding and repetitive tasks, working alongside people to transport components, sort items, kit products, and more.The robot reportedly focuses on logistics and manufacturing first. That makes sense. These industries have the most physically intense and repetitive processes. Apollo could free up human workers for more strategic tasks. Experts say that once proven in these sectors, expansion into retail, healthcare, and eventually the home seems likely. The ambition is clearly big. And it might not be far off.Apptronik has been around for nearly a decade, building on previous work, including NASA’s Valkyrie robot. Apollo is the culmination of 15 prior robots. Nearly 300 employees are reportedly contributing to design, testing, and deployment. The company began at the University of Texas at Austin’s Human Centered Robotics Lab, which seems fitting for a business focused on robots that work closely with humans.","Austin-based robotics company Apptronik just closed a massive funding round, reportedly bringing its total Series A to over $935 million.

The practice of decades



Tech leaders and their sleeping patterns



Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has admitted that his sleep routine is far from typical in a video interview with Fortune. Hassabis said he sleeps ‘very little’ aiming for about six houses and added that he divides his waking hours into two distinct workdays. “I do try and get six, but I have unusual sleeping habits. I sort of manage during the day,” he explained. Hassabis added that his schedule includes packing his office hours with back-to-back meetings, then returning home for family time and dinner.Around 10 p.m., Hassabis begins what he calls a ‘second day of work’, often continuing until 4 a.m. This late-night block is reserved for creative thinking and research. “I can’t imagine being creative at four in the morning. But, I come alive at about 1 a.m.,” he told Fortune.Despite his unusual routine, Hassabis stressed on the importance of rest and sleep. He warned people that getting less than six hours of sleep can become harmful for the brain and could also lead to chronic sleep deprivation. The comments made by Google DeepMind CEO stress on the importance of balance between acknowledging his own habits and warning others about the cognitive downsides of insufficient sleep.Hassabis said that he has followed this unusual schedule for about a decade. He said that this routine has now become a part of his rhythm as he leads Google DeepMind, the AI lab he co-founded in 2010, which Google acquired in 2014. DeepMind merged with Google Brain in 2023 to form Google DeepMind, the team behind AI systems like Gemini and Nano Banana. Hassabis and colleague John Jumper were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their groundbreaking work on protein structure prediction.Hassabis’ unusual schedule mirrors what other tech leaders have shared about their own sleep routines. Elon Musk has said he functions best with about six hours of sleep, warning that less affects his performance. During Tesla’s production crunch in 2018, Musk even slept on the factory floor. By contrast, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has emphasized the importance of rest, saying in a 2023 interview that he averages about eight hours of sleep.",Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has admitted that his sleep routine is far from typical in a video interview with Fortune.

Hyperwrite CEO warns: ‘Something Big Is Happening’



What once felt messy now feels impressive



COVID-19 vs AI: CEO compares AI growth to February 2020



Why learning AI now could change your career



Artificial intelligence has triggered plenty of bold predictions over the past few years. Some sounded exaggerated, but out of them few even became reality. Now a tech CEO is warning that what’s coming next could be “much bigger” than COVID-19. That comparison alone is enough to make people pause and think. Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer published a long essay on X titled ‘Something Big Is Happening’, and it quickly went viral. His message was blunt. AI is no longer a future threat. It’s already reshaping jobs, including his own. And he believes many people still haven’t grasped how quickly things are moving.Matt Shumer wrote that artificial intelligence can now handle all of his technical work. A notable warning from someone who himself runs an AI company.He wrote the essay for friends and family who keep asking what’s really happening with AI. Apparently, the usual polite answers didn’t feel honest anymore. His post reportedly gathered more than 30 million views within a day. Tech figures like Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and venture capital investors publicly agreed with him. “We’re not predicting. It already happened.”One of Shumer’s strongest claims is that people in tech are not speculating about the future. They’re describing what has already happened inside their own workplaces.He argued that many outside the industry dismissed AI after experimenting with early versions of ChatGPT. Still, recent releases from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic do suggest rapid improvements. OpenAI’s GPT-5.3 Codex, aimed at software engineering, was even described by the company as instrumental in helping build itself. That detail raised eyebrows across the sector, fueling debate about recursive AI development, productivity leaps, and whether machines are beginning to meaningfully accelerate their own advancement at scale.Shumer says this moment feels like early 2020. Back when news of a virus spreading overseas seemed distant. Then suddenly, everything changed. He believes ‘AI’s impact might be even bigger than COVID.’The pandemic reshaped how and where people work. AI could reshape who works at all. Thats what he concluded, why he compared AI growth now with February 2020 pandemic.He described giving OpenAI’s latest coding model a task and then walking away from his computer for four hours. When he returned, the work was finished. Done well, he said. Not just technically correct. He’s urging them to learn fast AI and quotes this might be “the most important year of your career”. Not because layoffs are guaranteed tomorrow. But there’s a brief window where many companies still underestimate AI’s capabilities. In his view, the person who uses AI to complete a three-day task in one hour will suddenly look indispensable.Artificial Intelligence is no longer a niche topic for engineers. It’s entering boardrooms, HR meetings, Family dinner conversations and in our day-to-day lives.And that shift alone suggests something big is happening.",Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that artificial intelligence can now handle all of his technical work.

CEO Jensen Huang says AI isn't shrinking Nvidia's workforce—it's growing it

Nvidia has rolled out OpenAI's agentic coding tool Codex to all 30,000 of its engineers, months after CEO Jensen Huang told employees he wanted ""every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated. "" The company-wide deployment, announced by OpenAI, is one of the largest enterprise rollouts of an AI coding assistant to date. OpenAI said it worked closely with Nvidia to deliver cloud-managed admin controls and US-only processing with fail-safes.The latest version of Codex runs on the GPT-5.3-codex model, which engineers inside Nvidia are already praising for its ability to handle complex, multi-step workflows without losing context mid-session.Dennis Hannusch, an engineer at Nvidia, said he started using the new model this week and called it ""reaaally good."" ""I keep expecting quality to drop deep into a session, but it doesn't,"" he wrote on X. Another Nvidia engineer, Benjamin Klieger, said he was particularly impressed with the tool's context management and token efficiency—""probably the two most important advances for agents right now.""The Codex deployment traces back to a November 2025 all-hands meeting where Huang reacted sharply to reports that some managers were discouraging AI use internally.""Are you insane?"" he told staff, urging them to lean into AI tools even when they fall short.Huang has repeatedly argued that AI automates tasks, not jobs. In his view, a software engineer's purpose isn't writing code—it's solving problems. AI just gets them there faster. He's pointed to radiology as proof: despite predictions that AI would gut the field, there are now more radiologists employed at higher salaries than before AI entered the picture.That philosophy now has infrastructure behind it. Nvidia set an engineering mandate last year to embed AI across every phase of its software development lifecycle. The company also uses Cursor, another AI coding platform, across its engineering teams.Despite the aggressive push toward automation, Nvidia continues to hire. Huang told employees the company added several thousand people in a recent quarter and is still roughly 10,000 short of where it needs to be. New offices are being set up across the US and Asia, including in Shanghai and Taipei.""I promise you, you will have work to do,"" he told staff.","N Nvidia has deployed OpenAI's Codex AI coding tool to all 30,000 engineers.

Oracle's $300 billion OpenAI gamble keeps spooking investors

Why Oracle keeps talking—and why Wall Street keeps flinching

Oracle is back on social media doing damage control—again. This time, it's posting about construction progress at its AI data centres, insisting everything is ""on schedule and on plan. "" The company also said it's rolling out workforce training programmes and subcontractor engagement efforts to fill ""thousands of good-paying jobs"" with local workers. It's the kind of upbeat corporate update that wouldn't raise eyebrows in normal times. But these are not normal times for Oracle.The post comes amid a brutal stock slide that has wiped out over $400 billion in market value since October. Shares have nearly halved from their September peak of $345, dragged down by mounting investor anxiety over Oracle's massive—and massively risky—bet on OpenAI At the heart of the sell-off is a single deal: a $300 billion, five-year cloud computing contract with OpenAI, signed in September 2025. The agreement made Oracle the backbone of OpenAI's Stargate data centre initiative, but it also tied the company's future to a startup that's still burning billions and isn't expected to turn a profit until at least 2029.Oracle's debt has ballooned past $100 billion. S&P Global has flagged a possible credit downgrade.Credit default swaps—essentially insurance against Oracle defaulting—spiked in November and haven't come back down. Investor Michael Burry has publicly revealed an options bet against the stock.And the deal's biggest backer isn't exactly reassuring markets either. Nvidia recently walked back what was described as a $100 billion investment commitment in OpenAI, with CEO Jensen Huang clarifying the funding was ""never a commitment.""Oracle's recent communications have backfired more than once. In early February, the company posted on X that it remained ""highly confident in OpenAI's ability to raise funds and meet its commitments."" The stock promptly fell nearly 3%. One venture capitalist called it ""literally bank-run language.""The company has also announced plans to raise $50 billion in debt and equity this year. While that initially boosted shares, the rally fizzled within hours.Now, with the latest construction update, Oracle is clearly trying to shift the conversation toward execution and job creation. But every time it speaks, it reminds investors of the one thing they can't stop worrying about—just how deep it's in on OpenAI.","Oracle is promoting its AI data center progress and job creation efforts.

The lawmakers says that the presidential order allows DHS to grant sector-wide exemption as long as it “is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States.” In the letter, the lawmakers argued that health care qualifies for such exemption.The lawmakers further cited federal data showing widespread shortages of doctors, laboratory professionals, and other skilled workers. They also warned that hospitals and clinics, particularly in rural areas and urban communities, rely heavily on international health workers to maintain services. “These shortages cannot be filled by the domestic workforce alone,” the letter says, further stating that the added cost could leave critical roles unfilled and reduce access to care for millions of Americans.""Dear Secretary NoemWe are deeply concerned about the impact of the September 19 Presidential Proclamation, “Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers,” on the health care workforce.The Proclamation imposes a $100,000 fee on employers that petition for a new H-1B visa, but also recognizes the Department of Homeland Security Secretary’s authority to grant sector-wide exemptions, so long as it “is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States. ” We urge you to create a health care sector exemption to prevent additional strain on the health care workforce.Worsening workforce shortages across all health care professions are significantly diminishing access to care in rural and urban communities across the nation. According to the Health Resources and Services Administration, nearly 87 million Americans live in areas Federally designated as lacking enough medical professionals to address the community’s health care needs.Physician demand could exceed supply by up to 86,000 in the next decade and clinical laboratory science programs are educating less than half the number of clinical laboratory professionals needed. These shortages cannot be filled by the domestic workforce alone, and projections will worsen if health care employers cannot continue to recruit and retain international health care workers.For over 30 years, health care employers have used the H-1B visa program to recruit and retain the finest international talent, positioning the US as a global leader in health care delivery and innovation. Many members of the care team—including highly skilled physicians, advanced practice professionals, clinical laboratory workers, and researchers—come to the U.S. from around the world to offer specialized services, deliver care in underserved areas, and contribute to cutting-edge biomedical research.Health care organizations must be able to recruit staff in the most cost-effective manner so they can use their financial resources to hire as many caregivers as possible to take care of their communities. Rural hospitals and urban safety net hospitals face uncommon recruitment and retention issues and will most acutely feel the effects of the $100,000 fee. These hospitals rely heavily on the H-1B visa to maintain adequate staffing and offer comprehensive services in high-need areas. 21 million Americans live in areas where foreign-trained physicians account for at least half of all practicing physicians.Imposing a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa petitions will exacerbate hospitals’ existing staffing challenges and could push chronically underfunded hospitals to their financial brink. If these hospitals cannot petition for new H-1B visas to address their staffing needs without also having to pay this fee, it will further damage their financial viability. Critically needed open positions will simply go unfilled, leaving rural and high-poverty urban areas without adequate access to care.We strongly urge you to exempt the health care sector from this burdensome fee. Thank you for considering our request.""","A group of 100 US lawmakers have urged Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem to exempt the health care sector from new restrictions linked to the H-1B visa programme.

Browser engine vulnerability

Microsoft has warned against multiple flaws in Windows and Office software that the company says are being actively used by hackers. The vulnerabilities, the company says, allow attackers to break into computers through simple actions such as clicking a link or opening a file. Some of the flaws were already being exploited before fixes were available, making them especially risky. Microsoft said details about how the flaws could be abused were made public, which may increase the chances of attacks. The company has released security updates to fix the bugs and has also urged users to install updates as soon as possible to reduce the risk of system compromise.The flaws fixed by Microsoft are classified as zero-day vulnerabilities. This means attackers found and used the bugs before Microsoft could release security patches. At least two of the flaws allow one-click attacks, where minimal user action is needed for an attack to succeed.As explained by Microsoft, some of the vulnerabilities can be triggered when a user clicks a malicious link on a Windows computer. Another flaw can be exploited when a user opens a harmful Microsoft Office file. These attacks can allow hackers to install malware or gain control of a system without further warning.One of the bugs, tracked as CVE-2026-21510, was found in the Windows shell, which controls parts of the user interface. Microsoft said the issue affects all supported versions of Windows. The flaw allows attackers to bypass the SmartScreen security feature, which normally checks links and files for threats. Security experts said this bug can be used to remotely install malware after a single click.Another flaw, tracked as CVE-2026-21513, was found in MSHTML, a browser engine originally used by Internet Explorer. Although the browser is no longer supported, the engine remains in Windows for older software compatibility. Microsoft said this bug can be used to bypass security protections and install malicious code.","Microsoft has warned against multiple flaws in Windows and Office software that the company says are being actively used by hackers.

Meta-owned WhatsApp has claimed that Russia has “attempted to fully block” the messaging platform. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), WhatsApp alleged that the country is trying to “isolate over 100 million users from private and secure communication”.

Cheaper EVs on the horizon

Ford expects its EV business to remain unprofitable

Ford’s electric vehicle unit posted a $4.8 billion loss in 2025, as sales of its Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning, and E-Transit fell 14% year-ver-year. According to a report by Business Insider, on Tuesday’s earnings call (February 10), CEO Jim Farley acknowledged the setback, saying, “So I think the customer has spoken. That’s the punchline.” For those unaware, Ford was the first legacy company that challenged Elon Musk’s Tesla with mass-market EVs. The company began in 2020 with the launch of Mustang Mach‑E. After this Ford introduced the F-150 Lightning in 2022. The company witnessed strong initial enthusiasm as it received200,000 Lightning reservations and projected 150,000 annual sales.However, the momentum faded. In the year 2025, Ford managed to sold just 27,307 F‑150 Lightnings, down 18.5% from 2024, and 51,620 Mach‑Es, flat year‑over‑year. The expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit last September further hurt demand, with Lightning sales plunging from 5,197 units in December 2024 to just 1,724 a year later.With US EV sales slowing and hybrid demand rising, Ford is reshaping its strategy. Hybrid F‑150 sales climbed 15% last year to 84,934 units, underscoring consumer preference for flexibility.Ford has ended production of the all‑electric Lightning and plans to relaunch it as an extended‑range electric vehicle (EREV) — a battery‑powered truck with a gas generator onboard.Farley said the new model will address concerns about range and towing capacity: “We’re betting on hybrid across our lineup, and EREV where it makes sense. Like a large truck, where towing is a really important application, and both PHEV and pure electric will definitely not work. ”At the same time, Ford is developing new “universal” EV platform aimed at lower‑cost, high‑volume vehicles. The first model, a midsize pickup priced around $30,000, is expected in 2027. Ford plans at least five vehicles off the platform, including SUVs and commercial vans.Farley emphasized profitability: “We aren’t just building compliance vehicles at Ford. We’re launching a cost‑efficient, universal EV platform that will drive profitable growth. Tesla’s shown that they could, we can make money in that market, even without subsidy from the government at the right cost level.”Ford expects its EV business to remain unprofitable until around 2029, according to CFO Sherry House. The company missed earnings estimates for the quarter, reporting 13 cents adjusted EPS versus analysts’ expectations of 19 cents.Still, analysts see reasons for optimism. John Rosevear of The Motley Fool told Business Insider: “On paper, it’s a big miss, but I don’t think it’s a big deal. Ford’s guidance for 2026 anticipates nice year‑over‑year increases in cash flow, as well as higher capital expenditures — all stuff that the market will almost certainly like.”","Ford's electric vehicle unit posted a $4.8 billion loss in 2025.

An open letter demands Benioff take a public stand against ICE



Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff’s remarks at the company’s annual “Company Kickoff” town hall are drawing scrutiny after employees noticed that jokes he made about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were edited out of the official recording. As reported by Business Insider, the internal Slack messages reveal that the employees were told the keynote video was posted, but those looking for the ICEO jokes would find they had been removed. An excerpt of the recording reportedly highlighted a jump cut during Benioff’s introduction, skipping over the controversial moment.For those unaware, Salesforce employees are circulating an internal open letter urging CEO Marc Benioff to publicly denounce US Immigration and Customs Enforcement after he cracked jokes about ICE agents surveilling international workers at a major company event in Las Vegas this week. During his opening keynote at Salesforce's annual Company Kickoff on Tuesday, Benioff asked employees who had traveled from outside the US to stand up—then quipped that ICE agents were in the building keeping tabs on them, according to reports from Wired, Business Insider, and 404 Media, all of which viewed internal Slack messages.Along with this, Benioff also reportedly complained about Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl performance, adding to the awkwardness of the exchange.As per the BI report, the Salesforce executives have since addressed the incident internally. Slack general manager Rob Seaman in a message to employees wrote, “I cannot defend or explain them. They do not align with my personal values and I know this to be the case for many of you as well.” Some of the staff members also said that they received emails asking them to explain their absence from the event following Benioff’s remarks, adding to frustration.Beyond the jokes, employees are pushing for something more concrete. The open letter, first reported by Wired, calls on Benioff to issue a public statement condemning what it describes as ICE's ""unconstitutional conduct"" and to draw clear ""red lines"" barring the use of Salesforce's cloud and AI products for immigration enforcement. It specifically flags leaked documentation showing Salesforce pitched its Agentforce AI technology to help ICE rapidly hire 10,000 new agents and process tip-line reports.The letter also references the recent killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, calling them a ""devastating indictment of a system that has discarded human decency.""Salesforce has not responded to multiple requests for comment about Benioff’s jokes or the decision to edit them out of the recording.","Salesforce employees are circulating an internal open letter urging CEO Marc Benioff to publicly denounce US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Elon Musk held an all-hands meeting with xAI employees hours after co-founders Tony Wu and Jimmy Ba announced their exits—the fifth and sixth from the 12-person founding team. Instead of addressing the departures head-on, Musk pitched a lunar satellite factory, a self-sustaining Moon city, a path to 1 billion daily active X users, and a company restructuring into four product teams. The meeting was later posted publicly on X.

Musk wants to build an AI satellite factory on the Moon

A self-sustaining lunar city before Mars

X is gunning for 1 billion daily active users

xAI is being restructured into four product teams

Elon Musk held an all-hands meeting with xAI employees on Tuesday night, just hours after co-founders Yuhuai (Tony) Wu and Jimmy Ba announced they were leaving the company. What followed was a 45-minute presentation that veered from product updates to lunar manufacturing plants.The meeting came at a sensitive moment. Wu and Ba are the fifth and sixth members of xAI's 12-person founding team to walk out the door, with five departures in the past year alone. Rather than dwell on the exits, Musk used the stage to lay out a series of ambitious promises for the company's future.The headline promise was a lunar facility that would manufacture AI-powered satellites and launch them into deep space using electromagnetic catapults, or ""mass drivers."" Musk painted a picture of satellites firing off the Moon's surface one after another, beaming data back to Earth or running compute locally. ""You have to go to the moon,"" he told employees. He described the Moon's low gravity, lack of atmosphere, and constant solar exposure as ideal conditions for this kind of infrastructure.Musk also outlined a stepping-stone approach to his long-standing Mars obsession. First, xAI and SpaceX would establish what he called ""a self-sustaining city on the moon,"" then push outward to Mars, and eventually to other star systems.He even floated the idea of finding ""remnants of ancient alien civilizations"" along the way.Back on Earth, Musk shared that X currently has around 600 million monthly active users and set a target of ""well over a billion"" daily active users. To get there, the company is planning new features including X Money, a banking tool, and a standalone chat app. Nikita Bier, X's head of product, added that the platform had just crossed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue from subscriptions.Musk acknowledged the co-founder departures as part of a broader reorganisation. The company is now split into four teams: Grok (the chatbot), a coding division, the Imagine video generator, and a project called Macrohard—described as a system that can ""do anything on a computer that a computer is able to do."" Toby Pohlen, who will lead Macrohard, told colleagues the goal is to have ""rocket engines fully designed by AI. ""The all-hands was later published as a video on X, possibly in response to The New York Times reporting details from the meeting earlier that evening.

Social media addiction

CEO pay and profits

Instagram head Adam Mosseri became the first tech executive to testify in a landmark social media addiction trial against Instagram parent company Meta, YouTube and others alleging app's design fuels social media action in youth. During the trial Mosseri said that he does not think users can be ""clinically addicted” to social media. He was also grilled about his pay, stating that he is paid around $900,000 a year. Additionally he gets rewarded with stock-based compensation and annual performance-based bonuses that can be as high as half of his salary. In a Los Angeles state court, Mosseri revealed that his stock-based pay varies year to year but that it has been in the ""tens of millions of dollars.""Filed by a 20-year-old woman who is identified by the initials KGM. The lawsuit alleges the social media platform’s addictive design features, including endless scrolling, aggravated her depression and suicidal thoughts.The lawsuit is the first of more than 1,500 similar cases to go to trial. Mosseri is the first executive to testify in a series of trials in which hundreds of families and school districts have sued Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube.Adam Mosseri became head of Instagram in 2018. A major focus of the questioning was Instagram’s use of beauty filters that alter facial features. Lawyers referenced internal Meta documents from 2019 that discussed potential harm from such filters, including concerns about body image issues among young users.Mosseri said Instagram initially decided to ban all face-distorting filters but later revised the policy. Filters that promoted cosmetic surgery were banned, he said, while other appearance-altering filters were no longer actively recommended.When asked whether banning filters could have hurt Mosseri's bottom line by limiting the company's growth, he said: “I was never worried about this affecting our stock price”.During questioning, Mosseri said he did not think addiction to Instagram was possible in a clinical sense, though he acknowledged that “problematic use” could occur. He compared excessive use of Instagram to watching television for longer than intended. Mosseri said usage patterns vary by individual and confirmed that he is not a medical professional.Lawyers for the plaintiff highlighted claims that Instagram’s features were designed to keep young users engaged. When asked about a case where the plaintiff allegedly spent more than 16 hours on Instagram in a single day, Mosseri described the behaviour as problematic use. He denied claims that Instagram targets teens to increase profits, saying the company earns less revenue from teenage users than from other age groups.During the trial, lawyers suggested decisions on product features could be linked to company growth and executive pay. Mosseri denied that his decisions were influenced by stock price or personal compensation. He said he was not concerned about how product changes might affect Meta’s financial performance.","Instagram head Adam Mosseri became the first tech executive to testify in a landmark social media addiction trial against Instagram parent company Meta.

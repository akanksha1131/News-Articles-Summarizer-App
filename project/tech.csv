Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates shared personal insights about his childhood, revealing that he likely would have been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) if he were growing up today, in a recent interview. Gates, one of the most influential figures in the tech industry, discussed his early struggles in school, his extraordinary focus on subjects that engaged him, and the unconventional learning path that ultimately led to the creation of Microsoft. His comments are part of a broader reflection found in Source Code: My Beginnings, the first installment of his memoir trilogy, which explores his early years, his entrepreneurial journey, and the formative experiences that shaped his career.During the interview, Gates described his childhood as one filled with energy and an intense ability to focus—though only on topics that captivated him. He recalled how some teachers struggled to categorize him, with some suggesting he skip ahead a grade while others thought he should be held back. Despite these challenges, one thing was clear—Gates had a natural talent for mathematics.Gates said. He credited his love for learning and problem-solving as key factors that led him toward computer science and software development.Gates’ memoir delves into his early experiments with technology, particularly his high school years, where he and his childhood friend Paul Allen began exploring the potential of computer programming. One of their earliest ventures, Traf-O-Data, was designed to create software for the Altair computer—an early microcomputer built by Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS).Traf-O-Data laid the foundation for what would eventually become Microsoft in 1975. That year, the fledgling company generated $16,005 in revenue while Gates and Allen earned just $9 per hour. However, their vision extended far beyond a single software product.Gates explained. He believed that hiring the best minds and utilizing cutting-edge tools would allow Microsoft to move faster than its competitors, giving it a strategic edge in the industry.By 1977, Microsoft's growing success gave Gates the confidence to drop out of Harvard University. Two years later, in 1979, he relocated Microsoft to the Seattle area, where the company would grow into one of the most dominant forces in the technology world.Although Gates stepped down as Microsoft's CEO in 2000, the company’s impact under his leadership remains evident today. The Windows operating system and other software developed during his tenure continue to be central to Microsoft’s business model. The company, which now generates $212 billion in annual revenue and holds a market value of $3.1 trillion, has solidified its place as a global technology leader. Microsoft’s success also accounts for a significant portion of Gates' estimated $100 billion fortune.Gates' memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, concludes in 1979, before his personal life—including his 1994 marriage to Melinda French and their 2021 divorce—becomes part of the narrative. The book focuses instead on his early experiences, the development of Microsoft, and the challenges he faced in shaping a company that revolutionized the software industry.As Gates continues his philanthropic efforts through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, his reflections on childhood, education, and entrepreneurship offer valuable insights into how unconventional thinking and relentless curiosity can lead to groundbreaking achievements.","Gates' memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, explores his early years, his entrepreneurial journey, and the formative experiences that shaped his career.

"TikTok’s return ‘crushes’ Chinese competitors on Apple, Google app stores in US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktoks-return-crushes-chinese-competitors-on-apple-google-app-stores-in-us/articleshow/118456366.cms,"Why was TikTok removed from Apple App Store and Google Play Store

TikTok's reinstatement in US app stores following a temporary ban has negatively impacted Chinese competitors that had gained traction during the platform's absence, according to a recent report. These competitors saw a surge in popularity after TikTok was removed from Apple and Google app stores, but have experienced a decline since TikTok's return.Citing Sensor Tower data, Bloomberg reported that downloads of apps like Xiaohongshu plummeted 91% since TikTok’s reinstatement five days ago.The Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu, which translates to ""little red book,"" saw a surge in popularity in the US, becoming the most downloaded free app in the Apple App Store on January 15th. This surge occurred despite the platform's predominantly Chinese user base of over 300 million.American users are increasingly turning to Xiaohongshu, with some expressing their disagreement with the US government's concerns about the Chinese ownership of TikTok.TikTok, owned by ByteDance, was temporarily removed from app stores on January 18 due to government pressure to divest the app over national security concerns. This led to a surge in popularity for Chinese rival Xiaohongshu (Red), which gained nearly 500,000 US users.Other platforms like YouTube, Snap, Facebook, and Instagram also saw increased usage during TikTok's absence. However, with TikTok's return to the Apple App Store and Google Play on February 14, the app has reportedly seen more than double its usual download rate, the report said.The app’s reinstatement followed intervention by President Donald Trump , who provided assurances to TikTok and its partners that they would not face penalties for continued operation. While TikTok's app and website remained accessible during the ban, they were unavailable for download until recently.Prior to the reinstatement, Trump had publicly suggested the possibility of the US government taking a significant stake in TikTok, potentially including a role in content moderation. Numerous parties have expressed interest in acquiring the platform, but no sale has been finalised.","TikTok, owned by ByteDance, was temporarily removed from app stores on January 18 due to government pressure to divest the app over national security concerns.

""Kumar had championed Infosys Helix from his senior position at Infosys, lauding it as a next-generation challenger to the traditional platforms.' But Kumar's optimism and excitement for the Infosys Helix product suddenly changed in the spring of 2022. He began to withdraw support for Infosys Helix, declining requests for necessary resources, which delayed its completion by at least 18 months. In October 2022, Kumar resigned from Infosys and, shortly thereafter, was announced as CTS's new Chief Executive Officer,"" reads a para in Infosys lawsuit, as it first appeared in Fortune.

""Kumar continued to ignore requests for additional engineering support for Infosys Helix in the spring of 2022, with the assistance of Arora and Kuchibhotla, cancelling meetings to discuss the issue, even though the lack of staffing had resulted in 'a situation where the client is shaming us on the delays' and concerns within Infosys that the client might cancel the contract due to these delays,"" reportedly reads another Paragraph of the lawsuit filed by Infosys.

""Caught red handed"" stealing trade secrets and more.... Sharp barbs continue to be exchanged in the lawsuit between Infosys and Cognizant. In the very recent charges, Cognizant claimed that Infosys was caught ""Red handed"" stealing trade secrets of its healthcare software TriZetto. Infosys on its part named its former President and now Cognizant CEO in the counter lawsuit. Ravi Kumar held the position of President in Infosys when he resigned in October 2022. He replaced Brian Humphries as Cognizant CEO in January 2023.The US headquartered company said in its 22-page court response to Infosys lawsuit filed earlier this month: “Infosys was caught red-handed misappropriating TriZetto trade secrets that Infosys originally had access to through non-disclosure and access agreements (NDAAs).""Cognizant's latest reply made in a Dallas (US) court comes a month after Infosys filed a lawsuit against Cognizant in January, stating that its CEO Ravi Kumar engaged in misuse of trade secrets to obstruct the company's healthcare software platform, Infosys Helix.In its January 9 counter lawsuit filed with the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Infosys accused Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar of delaying the launch of the company's Helix platform when he was heading the project and negotiating for a job with Cognizant.The lawsuit names two more Infosys' former employees.The legal dispute between Infosys and Cognizant started in August 2024 when Cognizant alleged that Infosys had stolen its trade secrets from TriZetto. Infosys rejected the allegation in January this year asking the Dallas court to compel Cognizant to properly identify the trade secrets in question.Responding to Infosys’ lawsuit, Cognizant had said it was committed to “upholding the highest standards of integrity in all business operations” and “encourages competition”, “but competitors cannot use Cognizant's IP to unfairly compete, as Infosys has done”. In a news release, Cognizant said it “will take decisive action to address any allegations that compromise competitive standing”.","Cognizant claims that Infosys was caught ""Red handed"" stealing trade secrets of its healthcare software TriZetto.

Zerodha co-founder Nithin Kamath recently shared his thoughts on Indian badminton national coach Pullela Gopichand’s statement: ""Unless you are rich, don't make your child a sportsperson."" Taking to microblogging site X (formerly Twitter), Kamath wrote “While I understand Pullela Gopichand 's concern…I have a different view”.Gopichand, in a recent interview with The Times of India, advised parents not to push their children toward professional sports unless they had strong financial support. Gopichand said “I advise parents not to put their children in sports. We are not in a position to offer sports as a career. Unless the children are from rich backgrounds or have a family business, it is not advisable for children to take up sport.”While Kamath acknowledged the challenges highlighted by Gopichand, he pointed out that studying something one doesn't like can be more problematic in terms of job security, especially in the AI-era.Kamath also pointed out that the landscape of sports in India is evolving, with more avenues for athletes beyond just competing—such as coaching, sports science, content creation, and entrepreneurship. He encouraged parents and aspiring athletes to look at the broader picture, where financial success in sports is no longer limited to just a handful of top players.While I understand Pullela Gopichand's concern that ""Unless you are rich, don't make your child a sportsperson,"" I have a different view.Imagine studying something you don't like or being stuck in a field when you know that your skills are useful elsewhere. Odds are, you may end up being less than average compared to people who are more suited to the field you hate. In this case, how can you expect job security? This is all more problematic in the AI-first world we are entering.This applies to sports as well. If someone is passionate about sports, takes a shot at being a professional and fails, there are more alternatives today than ever. You can become a coach or a personal trainer. There's more demand for such folks today than at any point.We are seeing a trend with some of @Rainmatterin's partners, like @FITTRwithsquats, @gametheoryindia, etc. People are willing to pay for personal training and coaching. We need a few of these to scale well, such as what @urbanclap has been able to do for professionals for home services.",Badminton coach Pullela Gopichand recently advised parents not to push their children toward professional sports unless they had strong financial support.

Unreleased Phone (3a) vs iPhone 16 Pro Max

Nothing apologises

Smartphone brand Nothing recently faced backlash over a misleading camera comparison between its upcoming Phone 3a and Apple’s iPhone 16 Pro Max . In a promotional video, the company claimed that its phone had better video stabilization than Apple’s latest flagship. But viewers were quickly able to spot a problem.Nothing Phone 3a is scheduled to launch on March 4, 2025. The company is expected to introduce both the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro.Many pointed out that the footage used to represent the iPhone was taken with its ultrawide lens instead of the main camera. This, viewers said, made the iPhone’s stabilization look worse than it actually is, giving an unfair advantage to the Nothing Phone 3a.“At 5:54 shooting video using 0.5x on iPhone vs normal 1x on Nothing is not a fair comparison. Apple is miles ahead in video currently. Try better next time. This little gimmick is not good for your PR,” commented one user on the teaser video on YouTube. “At 5:54, it looks like you shot the iPhone video using 0.5x instead of 1x, and Nothing was recorded in 1x. That’s why Nothing looks better,” pointed another.This has prompted a response from Nothing. In a pinned comment, the company acknowledged the mistake. They explained that footage from different lenses was used throughout the shoot, and during editing, they mistakenly included a clip from the iPhone’s ultrawide lens instead of its main one.“Hey everyone, we shot across all lenses throughout the day (sometimes cycling one-handed on a bumpy road), and in editing, a clip shot using the iPhone 16 Pro Max’s ultrawide lens was mistakenly used in the video stabilisation comparison instead of one shot using its standard lens. There was no intent to mislead, and we’ll be more careful to ensure even greater scrutiny in future comparisons. Appreciate you all keeping us accountable!”, the comment reads.","Nothing Phone 3a is scheduled to launch on March 4, 2025. The company is expected to introduce both the Phone 3A and Phone 3 a Pro.

Concerns over workplace culture and family-friendliness

Scale and impact of the Meta layoffs

Meta’s latest round of layoffs has triggered widespread dissatisfaction among employees, with many publicly challenging the company’s justification for job cuts. While Meta claims the layoffs were based on employee performance, several affected workers insist they had strong track records and met company expectations. The layoffs, which impacted over 3,000 employees, have raised concerns about transparency, fairness, and corporate ethics. Employees have taken to anonymous platforms and media outlets to express their frustration, arguing that financial motives, rather than performance, were the primary driving force behind the decision. As Meta continues to navigate financial challenges and invest in AI and metaverse projects, the controversy surrounding its workforce reductions highlights the difficulties faced by even the biggest tech firms in maintaining profitability.Meta’s leadership, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg , has repeatedly emphasized the need to “raise the bar on performance” and eliminate underperforming employees. However, numerous affected workers dispute this narrative, arguing that their performance ratings were satisfactory or even exceptional.An anonymous former Meta employee told Business Insider, “The hardest part is Meta publicly stating they’re cutting low performers, so it feels like we have the scarlet letter on our backs. People need to know we’re not underperformers.”On Blind, a platform where verified tech employees discuss workplace issues anonymously, a recently laid-off Meta worker revealed that even individuals with nearly a decade of experience were among those terminated. The post alleged that “dozens of people with pristine history and ‘exceeds expectations’ ratings” were laid off, including those who had recently taken parental or medical leave.Another former employee called the layoffs “cruel” and “ruthless,” stating that many long-tenured workers, some with eight to ten years of experience, were suddenly removed despite their strong performance history. Some employees claimed that the selection criteria for layoffs seemed arbitrary, leading to speculation that cost-cutting measures, rather than merit-based assessments, were the true motivation behind the job cuts.Adding to the controversy, employees from other major tech firms have criticized Meta’s corporate culture post-layoffs. One Amazon employee commented that Meta now appears to prioritize younger workers without families—those who can fully commit to demanding schedules and corporate expectations without external obligations.Another laid-off Meta employee described the company as “the cruelest tech company out there,” reinforcing the perception that the organization is shifting toward a more aggressive, high-pressure work environment.Earlier this month, Meta announced its plans to cut over 3,000 jobs, affecting nearly 5% of its global workforce. Before the layoffs, Meta employed around 72,400 people as of September 2024. The cuts were primarily directed at employees who had received lower performance ratings, according to official company statements.CEO Mark Zuckerberg has warned that 2024 and 2025 will be “challenging years” for Meta, as the company continues to navigate economic uncertainty, competition in the AI space, and its long-term metaverse ambitions. While the company remains committed to these projects, the workforce reductions reflect the increasing pressure on even the most successful tech firms to streamline operations and remain profitable.","Earlier this month, Meta announced its plans to cut over 3,000 jobs, affecting nearly 5% of its global workforce.

Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath want you to know this about SEBI’s new circular on API usage and algorithmic trading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamath-want-you-to-know-this-about-sebis-new-circular-on-api-usage-and-algorithmic-trading/articleshow/118020989.cms,"Take a look at the post here



“The SEBI circular on

API usage

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

SEBI's latest ALGO trading rules | The Daily Brief #163

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle



Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

As per an AP report, the ruling stated that X refused to provide registration data for a profile linked to Allan dos Santos , a Bolsonaro ally accused of spreading falsehoods.In July last year, De Moraes had directed X and Meta to block the account and submit the requested data. While X complied with the account ban, it argued that it couldn’t provide the data, claiming the user had “no technical connection point with Brazil.” De Moraes dismissed the argument and, in August, imposed a daily fine of 100,000 Brazilian reais ($17,500) for noncompliance. By October, the total penalty had reached 8.1 million reais.X initially appealed but later notified the court that it would pay the fine. This week, De Moraes ordered immediate payment, though it remains unclear whether X ultimately provided the requested data.This ruling follows a tense history between X and Brazil’s Supreme Court. In 2024, De Moraes temporarily blocked the platform nationwide after X attempted to remove its Brazilian staff, citing threats of legal action against its representative. X was reinstated a month later after complying with court orders to block specific accounts, appoint a legal representative, and pay outstanding fines.Musk and De Moraes have clashed repeatedly over issues of free speech, misinformation, and far-right accounts. Musk has labeled De Moraes an “enemy of free speech” and a “criminal,” but the judge’s rulings— including the nationwide block of X— have been consistently upheld by Brazil’s top court.","X has been ordered to pay 8.1 million Brazilian reais ($1.4 million) in fines for failing to comply with judicial orders.

Plan change not for CEO Mark Zuckerberg

Meta executives are set to receive significantly larger bonuses this year, according to a recent company filing. This comes soon after the company laid off around 5%, or 4000, employees, impacting its lowest performers.The company has announced an increase in the target bonus percentage for its executive annual bonus plan, raising the potential bonus to 200% of base salary, up from the previous 75%, as per CNBC.This change, approved by a Meta board committee on February 13, was implemented after an analysis revealed that the company's executive compensation was lagging behind that of similar companies. The increased bonus targets bring Meta's executive compensation closer to the median for its peer group.The report said that the committee approved the change after determining that the “target total cash compensation” for its executives “was at or below the 15th percentile of the target total cash compensation of executives holding similar positions” at peer companies.Notably, this bonus plan change does not apply to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, this means that the top executive will not be eligible for the increased bonus payouts that other Meta executives will receive.This news comes on the heels of recent layoffs affecting 5% of Meta's workforce, primarily targeting low performers. Additionally, the Financial Times reported that Meta reduced its annual stock option distribution by approximately 10% for thousands of employees, with variations based on location and position.Despite these cost-cutting measures, Meta's stock performance has been strong, with shares up over 47% in the past year. This reflects investor confidence in the company's growing digital advertising revenue and the potential of its AI investments .Meta reported a 21% year-over-year increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, reaching $48.39 billion."," Meta executives are set to receive significantly larger bonuses this year, according to a recent company filing.

On Wednesday evening, a large group of activists gathered outside SpaceX 's Washington, D.C., office to protest recent federal job cuts announced by the Trump administration. The demonstration, which blocked traffic in front of the aerospace company's headquarters, was a result of mounting frustration over government layoffs. The protest followed a march that began at Federal Triangle and concluded at 11th and F Street Northwest.The demonstrators, including former federal employees and labor union members, held signs criticizing Elon Musk’s influence in the current administration. One protester’s sign read, ""No one voted for Elon Musk ,"" referencing his role in establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been central to recent budget cuts. These layoffs have disproportionately affected employees in various government agencies, including the National Park Service.Union organizers have called for continued protests, highlighting the adverse impact of these job cuts on essential public services such as housing, environmental conservation, and historical preservation. As tensions escalate, the movement against these workforce reductions continues to gain traction.The primary catalyst for Wednesday’s demonstration was the Trump administration’s implementation of extensive federal job cuts. These layoffs, reportedly part of a broader effort to reduce government spending, have led to uncertainty and distress among public sector employees.Tiffany Montes, a former National Park Service worker, shared her frustration and disappointment after being unexpectedly dismissed from her role in historic preservation. Despite two years of dedicated service as an intern and securing a permanent position, she received a termination email on Friday.Montes told NBC News. She further expressed disbelief at the justification for her termination.Montes was among hundreds of National Park Service employees dismissed under the new measures. The National Park Service plays a crucial role in maintaining historical landmarks, including the White House, and the job cuts have raised concerns about the potential neglect of these important sites.Paul Osadebe, a representative of the Federal Unionists Network, emphasized the risks posed by these job losses.he stated.Union leaders have warned that these cuts could have severe consequences for government services, affecting infrastructure, housing, and public safety.Elon Musk has gained significant influence within the Trump administration since Donald Trump assumed the presidency last month. One of his most controversial moves was the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an agency tasked with reducing federal spending.DOGE's primary goal is to streamline government operations and eliminate what it deems unnecessary expenditures. However, critics argue that its aggressive cost-cutting measures have led to the indiscriminate removal of employees essential to public services.Protesters outside SpaceX's office held Musk accountable for his role in implementing these workforce reductions. Many view his growing political influence as a concern, particularly since the agency’s budget reduction strategy has resulted in widespread job insecurity.The Trump administration has justified the job cuts as necessary for achieving fiscal responsibility. DOGE has outlined a plan to reduce federal spending by $2 trillion within the next year.To facilitate this process, DOGE previously sent mass emails to over two million federal employees, offering a voluntary resignation program. Those who accepted the offer were promised continued salary and benefits through September of this year. However, the administration had warned that if an insufficient number of employees opted for voluntary resignation, involuntary layoffs would follow.As a result, mass terminations were implemented across multiple agencies, affecting thousands of workers. The administration argues that these cuts will lead to a leaner, more efficient government, though critics contend that the measures disproportionately impact lower-level employees while leaving higher-ranking officials unaffected.In response to the job cuts, activist groups and labor unions have vowed to continue their demonstrations. The Federal Unionists Network, the organization behind Wednesday’s protest, has planned a mutual aid event on Friday evening to provide support for affected workers.Union leaders anticipate further demonstrations in the coming weeks, particularly as more workers begin to feel the effects of the layoffs. Protesters have also urged lawmakers to intervene and reconsider the restructuring efforts led by DOGE.","Demonstrators gathered outside SpaceX's Washington, D.C., office to protest recent federal job cuts announced by the Trump administration.

Call merging scam: What is the new fraud that NPCI has warned about,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/call-merging-scam-what-is-the-new-fraud-that-npci-has-warned-about/articleshow/118444907.cms,"How the call merging scam works

How to stay safe

Avoid merging calls with unknown numbers. Be cautious if someone insists on merging a call, especially from an unfamiliar source.

Verify caller identity. If someone claims to be from your bank, confirm their identity before sharing any information.

Banks never ask for OTPs over calls. If someone requests your OTP, it's likely a scam.

Report suspicious activity. If you receive an OTP for a transaction you didn’t initiate, call 1930 (the national cybercrime helpline ) and inform your bank immediately.

National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a warning online, alerting users about a new rising scam. Named the call merging scam , fraudsters are exploiting a phone’s call merge feature to steal one-time passwords (OTPs) and commit financial fraud . In a post on microblogging site X (formerly Twitter), NPCI wrote “Scammers are using call merging to trick you into revealing OTPs. Don’t fall for it! Stay alert and protect your money. 🚨💳 Share this post to spread awareness!”Scammers call unsuspecting victims about an event or an opportunity, claiming they got their number from a friend, the post explains. They then request to merge the call with this ""friend,"" who is actually another fraudster.Once merged, the victim unknowingly connects to an OTP verification call from their bank. The scammer manipulates the user into revealing the OTP, enabling unauthorized transactions. “The moment OTP is shared, scammers complete the transaction, and your money is gone!”.NPCI has shared key precautions to avoid falling for this scam:","National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a warning online, alerting users about a new scam.

The decision to discontinue Chime comes after the service saw limited adoption outside of Amazon itself.In a blog post, Amazon confirmed that it will end support for Chime, including its Business Calling features, on February 20, 2026. The company stopped accepting new Chime accounts as of February 19, 2025, and existing customers will still be able to schedule and host meetings, add and manage users, and use features in the Amazon Chime administration console until the shutdown date.“After February 20, 2026, you will no longer be able to host Amazon Chime meetings, manage users, or use any of the Business Calling features. If you cannot delete your data prior to February 20, 2026, please reach out to us via Amazon Support for help,” said the company.Amazon recommended that customers transition to other web meeting services such as AWS Wickr , Zoom, or Salesforce’s Slack. The company also stated that Zoom will become its official meeting app going forward.“Organizations with at least one Amazon Chime Team or Enterprise account can continue to use Amazon Chime and Business Calling features until February 20, 2026, when support for the service will end. Features that will no longer be supported include scheduling and hosting meetings, adding and managing users, and other capabilities available using the Amazon Chime console,” added Amazon.Launched in 2017, Chime was designed for business usage but failed to gain significant traction outside of Amazon. An Amazon spokesperson explained that the decision to retire Chime was due to the limited use of the service and the availability of better collaboration solutions from partners.","Amazon has announced the shutdown of Chime, its video conferencing service.

Meta has ‘Donald Trump warning’ for EU on WhatsApp and Instagram



Apple removes hundreds of apps in EU, reason: DSA



Apple, Google and Microsoft share one common problem in Europe and it is their Size. The same problem or tough challenges in Europe now seems set to haunt Facebook-owned WhatsApp. Reason: The instant messaging platform WhatsApp has surpassed a key user threshold outlined in the European Union’s tech regulations, requiring it to take greater action against illegal and harmful online content. The messaging service, owned by Meta Platforms , disclosed in a February 14 filing that it averaged 46.8 million monthly active users in the EU over the six-month period ending December 2024—exceeding the 45 million user benchmark set by the Digital Services Act (DSA).According to a report by news agency Reuters, European Commission spokesperson, Thomas Regnier, confirmed the milestone, stating, ""WhatsApp has published user numbers above the threshold for designation as a Very Large Online Platform under the Digital Services Act.""With this classification, WhatsApp now has four months to comply with stricter regulations under the DSA. These include identifying and assessing risks related to illegal content, fundamental rights, public security, and child protection. Companies that fail to meet these requirements could face fines of up to 6% of their global annual revenue.Meta’s other major platforms, Facebook and Instagram, are already subject to these regulations. Meanwhile, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Meta's global policy director Joel Kaplan have been vocal critics of the EU’s tech policies, even seeking backing from former US President Donald Trump.Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Kaplan said Meta will not hesitate to seek the US President Trump's intervention if the European Union unfairly targets the company with its digital regulations. Kaplan emphasized Meta's commitment to fighting misinformation while acknowledging differing perspectives on what constitutes false information. The company has introduced Community Notes to enable user-driven fact-checking across its platforms.Meta has already faced over €2 billion in EU penalties for violating antitrust and data protection rules, and is currently under investigation for potential breaches of the Digital Services Act regarding minor protection.Earlier this week, Apple removed the apps that have not so far complied with the trader requirement in the European Union from the App Store. The company said that the apps that have been removed will not be allowed back in the ‌App Store‌ until trader status is provided and verified by Apple.","WhatsApp now has four months to comply with stricter regulations under the DSA.

Microsoft's new chip gives 'hope' quantum computing companies after Nvidia CEO's one sentence wiped billions for them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-new-chip-gives-hope-quantum-computing-companies-after-nvidia-ceos-one-sentence-wiped-billions-for-them/articleshow/118430378.cms,"What is Quantum computing



The Big Debate on Quantum computing timeline



What Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said



Quantum computing stocks rallied on Thursday, February 20, after software giant Microsoft revealed its new Majorana 1 chip, reigniting the debate about the technology's timeline. Microsoft asserts this chip demonstrates that practical quantum computing is ""years, not decades"" away, contradicting recent claims from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang that it's still two decades off. This announcement aligns Microsoft with Google and IBM, who also predict a much sooner arrival for widespread quantum computing applications.The Majorana 1 chip, nearly two decades in development, utilizes the elusive Majorana fermion, a subatomic particle theorized in the 1930s. This particle's unique properties make it less susceptible to the errors that plague current quantum computers, a significant hurdle in the technology's advancement. Microsoft's claims of reduced error rates are supported by a forthcoming paper in the journal Nature.Quantum computing promises to revolutionize computation by performing calculations currently impossible for even the most powerful supercomputers. This potential includes the ability to crack existing encryption methods, posing both opportunities and risks for cybersecurity. The core challenge lies in controlling qubits, the quantum equivalent of classical bits, which are highly unstable and error-prone.The contrasting timelines offered by tech leaders have created uncertainty in the market. Nvidia's CEO's January prediction of a two-decade timeline caused turmoil for quantum computing stocks, wiping out billions in market cap -- ending a year-long rally. The stocks of Quantum Computing companies witnessed monthly losses in January, ending a year-long rally that saw them outperform the tech-focused Nasdaq, as well as that of Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft.During Nvidia's analyst day at CES trade show in Las Vegas (US) in January this year, CEO Jensen Huang said that “very useful” quantum computers are likely decades away and may take 15-30 years. He told analysts that quantum computers would need 1 million times the number of quantum processing units, called qubits, that they currently have. This one sentence of his sent shock waves, throwing stocks of Quantum computing companies in a free fall. So much so that the selling frenzy even took toll on companies with similar names: Quantum Corp, a data management company, gained more than 670% last year, only to drop about 60% so far in 2025. Quantum-Si Inc, a life science company developing protein sequencing platforms, too witnessed a fall.Nvidia CEO's comments contrasted with Google's assertion that commercial applications are only five years away, and IBM's projection of large-scale quantum computers by 2033. Microsoft's new chip and its accompanying claims now bolster the argument for a more imminent arrival of practical quantum computing.","Quantum computing stocks rallied on Thursday, February 20, after Microsoft revealed its new Majorana 1 chip.

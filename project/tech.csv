Study links these 'Everywhere Chemicals' to thousands of global deaths from heart disease,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/study-links-these-everywhere-chemicals-to-thousands-of-global-deaths-from-heart-disease/articleshow/120742812.cms,"Minimizing Phthalate Exposure: Expert Advice

Simple tips to protect yourself from these Dangerous Chemicals



A groundbreaking new study has uncovered a potentially significant link between phthalates, synthetic chemicals prevalent in numerous consumer products, and mortality from heart disease. Researchers estimate that exposure to these ""everywhere chemicals,"" found in items ranging from food storage containers to cosmetics and children's toys, may have contributed to over 10% of all global heart disease deaths in 2018 among individuals aged 55 to 64.The study's senior author, Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a professor at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, explained the mechanism behind this connection to CNN. ""Phthalates contribute to inflammation and systemic inflammation in the coronary arteries, which can accelerate existing disease and lead to acute events including mortality,"" he stated. Dr. Trasande also directs NYU Langone’s Division of Environmental Pediatrics and the Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards.Prior research has already associated phthalate exposure with various health issues, including reproductive problems, such as genital malformations in male infants and reduced sperm counts and testosterone levels in adult men. Furthermore, studies have linked these chemicals to asthma, childhood obesity, and cancer.David Andrews, acting chief science officer at the Environmental Working Group, a consumer advocacy organization focused on chemical exposure, commented on the new findings. In an email to CNN, he stated, ""The new study underscores the potentially enormous health and economic burden of DEHP exposure, which aligns with existing concerns about its risks."" Andrews was not involved in the research.The American Chemistry Council, representing the industry, declined to offer specific comments on the study. However, they informed CNN via email about the High Phthalates Panel's dedication to promoting the benefits of certain high phthalates like DINP and DIDP.Phthalates are widely used to enhance the flexibility and durability of plastics found in PVC pipes, vinyl flooring, rainwear, medical tubing, garden hoses, and some children's toys. Additionally, they are commonly found in food packaging, detergents, clothing, furniture, and automotive plastics. These chemicals are also added to personal care products such as shampoo, soap, hair spray, and cosmetics to extend the longevity of fragrances.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, human exposure occurs primarily through inhalation of contaminated air and the ingestion of food and beverages that have come into contact with plastic containing phthalates.Health experts emphasize that individuals can take proactive steps to reduce their exposure to phthalates and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals.Dr. Trasande advised, ""Avoid plastics as much as you can. Reducing your use of ultraprocessed foods can reduce the levels of the chemical exposures you come in contact with. Never put plastic containers in the microwave or dishwasher, where the heat can break down the linings so they might be absorbed more readily.""* Opting for unscented lotions and laundry detergents.* Choosing cleaning supplies without added fragrances.* Using glass, stainless steel, ceramic, or wood containers for food storage and consumption.* Prioritizing fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables over canned and processed alternatives.* Practicing frequent handwashing to remove potential chemical residues.","Phthalates may have contributed to over 10% of all global heart disease deaths in 2018 among individuals aged 55 to 64. Phthalates contribute to inflammation and systemic inflammation in the coronary arteries, which can accelerate existing disease and lead to acute events including mortality.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120742811,imgsize-1549968,width-400,resizemode-4/Heart-disease.jpg"

White House blasts Amazon over Tariff Labels; Amazon replies: This was ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/white-house-blasts-amazon-over-tariff-label-plans-amazon-replies-this-was-/articleshow/120740479.cms,"Angry White House terms it Hostile Act

Amazon launched Haul to take on Temu and Shein

What made the Tariff listing plan unfair

Amazon.com Inc has denied reported plan to display the cost of U.S. tariffs on its product listings, following a sharp rebuke from the White House and a reported direct phone call from President Donald Trump to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The e-commerce giant issued a statement saying that the idea was only under consideration for its ""ultra low cost Amazon Haul store "" and ""was never a consideration for the main Amazon site,"" adding that ""nothing has been implemented on any Amazon properties.""""This was never approved and is not going to happen,"" reads Amazon's statement.This denial came after a brief report by Punchbowl News suggesting Amazon would ""soon"" begin itemizing U.S. tariff costs next to the listed price of individual products. The White House reacted with immediate and strong condemnation.""This is a hostile and political act,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during a briefing. She questioned the timing of the purported move, asking, ""Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?""Leavitt also revealed that she had spoken with President Trump about the report and criticized Amazon's compliance with Chinese government censorship demands. Adding to the pressure, a person familiar with the situation confirmed that President Trump called Jeff Bezos on Tuesday morning, a report first carried by CNN.The immediate fallout from the White House's comments was felt in the stock market, with Amazon shares briefly dipping by as much as 2.1% at the start of trading in New York. The stock later pared some of those losses. The company is scheduled to release its earnings report after the market closes on Thursday, with its stock already down over 20% from its February peak.The context of the potential tariff display involves the U.S. government's recent decision to end the ""de minimis"" exemption for small packages arriving from mainland China and Hong Kong. This exemption had allowed goods valued under $800 to enter the U.S. without tariffs. Companies like Temu and Shein, which rely heavily on direct-to-consumer shipping of lower-cost goods, are expected to face a significant 120% tariff on many of their products as a result. While some Amazon shipments also qualified for this exemption, the company also imports goods in bulk for its U.S. warehouses.Amazon's Haul service, launched last year as a direct response to the growing popularity of low-cost platforms like Temu, ships items directly from sellers, including those in China. Sources familiar with the matter indicated that the now-abandoned import charge disclosure was linked to the end of the de minimis exemption, rather than a direct response to the White House's broader tariff policies.When asked if the incident had strained the relationship between President Trump and Jeff Bezos, who has reportedly sought to improve his standing with the former president recently, Leavitt declined to comment. ""I will not speak to the president’s relationships with Jeff Bezos,"" she stated. Notably, Bezos and Trump had a frequently contentious relationship during Trump's first term, largely stemming from Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post.According to Bloomberg report, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was present at the press briefing, argued that singling out tariff costs was unfair when the costs associated with other government policies, such as regulations, were not similarly itemized. ""The big tax on consumers that goes unnoticed is deregulation or regulation, and we are deregulating and bringing that down,"" Bessent asserted. ""So you know, from a household income point of view, we would expect real purchasing increases that we’ve seen over the first 100 days, and we would expect that to accelerate.""The controversy unfolds against a backdrop of public concern regarding the economy. A CNN poll released this week revealed that 59% of the public believe Trump's policies have worsened the economy, with 60% feeling his efforts have increased their cost of living. Furthermore, nearly 70% of survey respondents anticipate an economic recession within the next year.","Amazon.com Inc has denied reported plan to display the cost of U.S. tariffs on its product listings.

"UPS to lay off 20,000 employees, shut down facilities as it reduces Amazon shipments",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ups-to-lay-off-20000-employees-shut-down-facilities-as-it-reduces-amazon-shipments/articleshow/120739052.cms,"What UPS said about the job cuts



“The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier. The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS.”

""The world hasn't been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years,""

""These actions will enable us to expand our US Domestic operating margin and increase profitability.”

“Amazon is our largest customer but it’s not our most profitable customer. Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business,”

“Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision.”

United Parcel Service (UPS) has announced its plans to cut nearly 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by the end of June. This move comes after the biggest package delivery company in the world decided to sharply cut back on the shipments from its largest customer, Amazon . The company announced that it expects the job cuts to take place this year and the facility closures, across both leased and owned sites, by June 30. UPS is still reviewing its network and may identify additional locations for shutdown. As per FactSet data, the company employs about 490,000 workers. The upcoming job cuts will reduce UPS’ workforce by slightly over 4%. This decision follows the company's announcement to cut 12,000 positions last year.In a statement to the news agency Reuters, a UPS spokesman said the job cuts reflect a 50% reduction in shipping volume from Amazon, its largest customer, combined with broader cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives as part of a major operational restructuring.In its recent regulatory filing, the company said that cuts are in ""connection with our anticipation of lower volumes from our largest customer.”UPS CEO Carol Tome said:This decision follows a slowdown in economic growth and mounting recession fears driven by Trump’s aggressive trade policies.Tome noted during the company's latest earnings call.UPS CFO Brian Dykes added:In January, UPS agreed with Amazon to reduce the volume it handles by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. Speaking on the fourth-quarter earnings call, Tome noted that after nearly 30 years of partnership, the renewal of Amazon’s contract this year prompted a reassessment of the relationship.Tomé said at the time.Meanwhile, an Amazon spokesperson said to Reuters:","United Parcel Service (UPS) has announced its plans to cut nearly 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by the end of June.

What US DoJ said about Minh Phuong Ngoc Vong



A US-based man is facing decades of jail time for allegedly working with China-based foreign nationals to fraudulently obtain remote IT jobs with American companies. The Department of Justice (DoJ) claims that the 40-year-old Maryland resident, Minh Phuong Ngoc Vong , secured remote IT jobs with at least 13 US companies between 2021 and 2024 in a scheme where he received over $970,000 in salary for software development tasks. The DoJ alleged that these tasks were actually performed by operatives in Shenyang, China, who are said to be North Korean. The China-based developers then used these company IT jobs to gain access to sensitive US government systems from overseas. Some of these jobs involved contracting out software services to agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)The DoJ has also claimed that this scheme is part of a larger fraud operation. As per the agency, trained North Korean nationals collaborate with American facilitators to fraudulently obtain remote IT jobs under various identities in this operation. The DoJ also stated that the work is conducted from Russia or China, and the illegally obtained salaries are then remitted to Kim Jong Un , the leader of North Korea.In this case, several Americans have also been indicted for running “computer farms,” where company-issued laptops were hosted domestically for a fee to mask North Korean involvement. The UN estimates the scheme brings in $250–$600 million annually, funding North Korea’s illicit nuclear program. US authorities even claimed that thousands of DPRK IT workers have been placed in hundreds of Fortune 500 companies in recent years.During the trial, Vong admitted plotting with China- and North Korea-linked developers to fraudulently land IT contracts at US companies. Posing as a seasoned software engineer, he submitted a fake résume—claiming a University of Hawaii degree, 16 years’ experience, and secret-clearance credentials—and secured roles at 13 firms, including a Virginia contractor on an FAA project used by multiple federal agencies. According to the DOJ, Vong—who was employed at a nail and spa salon—possessed neither a degree nor any development experience.Vong received a company-issued MacBook Pro and PIV card, then installed remote-access software so his overseas co-conspirators could do the work; between March and July 2023 alone, he was paid over $28,000. He has pleaded guilty to wire-fraud conspiracy and faces up to 20 years in prison.","Minh Phuong Ngoc Vong secured remote IT jobs with at least 13 US companies between 2021 and 2024.

Mark Zuckkerberg’s wife Priscilla Chan-funded free Silicon Valley School to shut down next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/trump-effect-mark-zuckerberg-funded-silicon-valley-school-to-shut-down-next-year-read-what-the-note-on-the-schools-website-says/articleshow/120497475.cms,"What the note on the school's website says

Mark Zuckerberg's Education Ventures

The Primary School , a no-cost private institution in the Bay Area co-founded by Priscilla Chan , wife of Facebook parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , will reportedly cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students. First reported by Bloomberg, the impending closure was disclosed in a statement posted on the school's website recently. In a move aimed at preserving its legacy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the billionaire couple's philanthropic arm, has committed $50 million to invest in the communities the school serves -— specifically East Palo Alto, Belle Haven, and the East Bay region near San Francisco -- over the subsequent few years.""This was a very difficult decision, and we are committed to ensuring a thoughtful and supportive transition for students and families over the next year,"" the online statement conveyed. Carson Cook, a spokesperson for The Primary School, stated there would be no further comment beyond the official announcement.Pediatrician Priscilla Chan, 40, co-established The Primary School in 2016, implementing an ""integrated health and education model"" designed to support families and children from birth through high school, according to the organization's tax filings. The school's inaugural middle school cohort commenced in 2023.The most recent tax documentation indicates that over 95% of The Primary School's students in East Palo Alto identify as under-represented minorities. The filing also revealed the nonprofit held assets exceeding $30 million as of the end of June 2023.The Primary School is among several educational endeavors recently initiated by prominent billionaires. Elon Musk , Jeff Bezos, and Larry Ellison have all established schools in recent years. Musk's nonprofit, the Musk Foundation, has contributed $237 million to his technology-focused primary and secondary school in Austin, named Ad Astra, with future aspirations for a university. Ad Astra collaborates with the same entity that assisted Ellison in establishing his Hala Kahiki Montessori school in Lanai, Hawaii, an island largely owned by the Oracle co-founder. Amazon.com founder Bezos has created a network of Montessori-inspired preschools catering to children in underserved communities.The closure of The Primary School coincides with significant strategic shifts within Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms Inc. as the 40-year-old founder appears to be aligning his business interests more closely with the Trump administration. Recent appointments to Meta's board include longtime Trump allies Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, and Dina Powell McCormick, who served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser during his first term.Furthermore, Zuckerberg has appointed a Republican strategist as chief of global affairs, eliminated Meta’s US fact-checking program, rolled back the company’s hate-speech policies, and discontinued key diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at both Meta and CZI. This contrasts with The Primary School's documented commitment to diversity, which included conducting a diversity audit in June 2020 following the Black Lives Matter protests and forming a DEI task force in the fall of that year.","The Primary School will cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students.

The REAL ID Act was enacted by Congress in 2005 in response to security concerns following the September 11 attacks. It requires the establishment of minimum security standards for the issuance of state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards. Beginning May 7, 2025, US residents aged 18 and older will be required to present a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or state ID, or another acceptable form of identification, to board federally regulated domestic flights or gain access to certain federal facilities.Although originally set to take effect earlier, the enforcement deadline was postponed multiple times to allow states and residents more time to comply. As the deadline approaches, it is crucial to understand what REAL ID is, how to check if your ID is compliant, and how to apply for one, including eligibility for online application.Not all states allow REAL ID applications online. Many require an in-person visit for the initial issuance due to document verification requirements. However, some states permit online upgrades if:Check your state DMV or licensing agency website to confirm if online application or renewal is available.To apply for a REAL ID, you must provide original or certified copies of the following:Some states may have additional documentation requirements, so consult your local DMV for specifics.The REAL ID Act was a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, intended to enhance security by making it harder to forge state-issued identification. It mandates that states verify specific documentation and use secure card production and issuance practices before issuing IDs.After May 7, 2025, a REAL ID or an acceptable alternative will be required for the following purposes:It’s important to note that a REAL ID is not required for voting, driving, banking, or applying for federal benefits such as Social Security.Yes. Beginning May 7, 2025, you must present a REAL ID-compliant license or an approved alternative identification to pass through TSA security checkpoints at US airports for domestic flights.If you do not have a REAL ID, you may use one of the following acceptable alternatives to board domestic flights or access secure federal facilities:A REAL ID-compliant card has a star in the upper-right corner. If your card lacks this star, it is not compliant and will not be accepted for REAL ID purposes. However, Enhanced Driver’s Licenses (EDLs)—issued by a few states—are acceptable even without the star marking, as they comply with federal security requirements.Only five states currently issue EDLs:EDLs are REAL ID-compliant and also allow land and sea border crossings between the US and Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative.Yes. States continue to offer non-REAL ID-compliant cards, often labeled “Not for Federal Identification.” These can still be used for driving and other non-federal purposes but will not be accepted for air travel or entry into certain federal buildings after May 7, 2025.The final enforcement date is May 7, 2025. After this date, only REAL ID-compliant cards or approved alternatives will be accepted for TSA screening and federal facility access. Starting May 7, 2025, TSA and other federal agencies will only accept IDs that meet REAL ID security standards. Travelers presenting non-compliant IDs will be denied access to domestic flights and certain government buildings unless they provide an acceptable alternative.Yes. As of now, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and US territories including Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands are compliant and issuing REAL ID cards.No. A REAL ID cannot be used for international land, air, or sea travel. A US passport is still required for:No. REAL IDs are not valid for international cruise departures. Cruise travelers must carry a valid passport or passport card for identification.Yes, but only for international travel. If traveling within the US, you need either a REAL ID-compliant license or an acceptable alternative—not both. However, a passport remains mandatory for traveling abroad.Yes. Enhanced Driver’s Licenses (EDLs) issued by the five eligible states (MI, MN, NY, VT, WA) are considered acceptable for all REAL ID purposes, including air travel, accessing federal facilities, and entering nuclear power plants—even though they may not bear the star marking.As of December 17, 2018, states are permitted to issue REAL ID-compliant cards to citizens of the Freely Associated States (FAS), which include:To qualify, FAS citizens must be lawfully admitted under the Compact of Free Association and meet all identity and residency requirements set forth by the REAL ID Act.","The REAL ID Act was enacted by Congress in 2005 in response to security concerns following the September 11 attacks.

Implications for global research

Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law, which restricts the sharing of “important data” with overseas partners without approval. The suspension impacts joint research in fields like health and environmental studies , raising questions about the future of international scientific cooperation .Implemented in 2021, China’s Data Security Law broadly defines “important data” as information that could threaten national or economic interests or affect the rights of individuals or organisations. European agencies, including the German Research Foundation , Swedish Research Council, and Swiss National Science Foundation, have expressed concerns over the law’s vague provisions, which make it difficult to assess compliance and avoid legal liabilities.The law requires security clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China to export data classified as “important,” effectively making cross-border data sharing extremely challenging. This has led to the suspension of new co-funded projects with China’s National Natural Science Foundation.The halt in collaborations could delay progress in critical areas like pandemic response and air quality studies, where data sharing is essential. Experts warn that the restrictions may hinder the ability to address global health challenges effectively.Jan Palmowski, Secretary-General of the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities, emphasised the need for responsible and safe data sharing to tackle future pandemics and other health crises.","Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law.

How a ‘mistake’ by Oracle engineers caused software outage in US hospitals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-a-mistake-by-oracle-engineers-caused-software-outage-in-us-hospitals/articleshow/120737117.cms,"Representative Image

What CHS said about the Oracle software outage



“Despite this being a major outage, our hospitals were able to maintain services with no material impact. We are proud of our clinical and support teams who worked through the multi-day outage with professionalism and a commitment to delivering high-quality, safe care for patients.”

Oracle engineers mistakenly triggered a five‐day software outage at multiple Community Health Systems (CHS) hospitals. The outage was tracked to the company’s Oracle Health electronic health record (EHR) system, forcing affected facilities to revert to paper‐based patient records. The incident started last week, when routine maintenance work led engineers to accidentally delete critical storage tied to a core database. CHS activated its downtime procedures as “several” hospitals went offline, with trade outlet Becker’s Hospital Review later reporting that 45 of CHS’s 72 hospitals were impacted. A CHS spokesperson has also confirmed the outage and has clarified that it stemmed solely from a maintenance error and was neither a cyberattack nor a security breach.The spokesperson added that Oracle fully restored the system this week after rebuilding the deleted storage and confirming data integrity. Based in Tennessee, CHS operates 72 hospitals across 14 states. The chain relies on Oracle Health’s EHR platform for digital patient records, scheduling, and clinical workflows. The EHR, which is a digital record of a patient’s medical history, is continuously updated by doctors and nurses. As a critical component of the US health-care infrastructure, any outage can severely disrupt patient care. Oracle cemented its position in the EHR market by acquiring Cerner for $28.3 billion in 2022, making it the second-largest provider after Epic Systems.In a statement to CNBC, a CHS spokesperson said:With Oracle’s systems now restored, CHS added that the affected hospitals are working to fully reinstate functionality and resume standard operations and procedures.This CHS incident comes just weeks after Oracle’s federal EHR platform suffered a nationwide outage. The company has also grappled with a protracted, problem-plagued deployment of its EHR system at the Department of Veterans Affairs, where patient safety concerns prompted the VA to launch a strategic review of Cerner in 2021 (before Oracle’s acquisition) and to temporarily halt the software’s rollout in 2023.","Oracle engineers mistakenly triggered a five-day software outage at multiple Community Health Systems (CHS) hospitals.

Donald Trump administration accuses Amazon of 'hostile act’ over tariff display plan: ‘This is another reason why…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-administration-accuses-amazon-of-hostile-act-over-tariff-display-plan-this-is-another-reason-why/articleshow/120737053.cms,"Amazon responds: ‘This was never…’

Donald Trump's administration has reacted strongly to a report that Amazon planned to show consumers the impact of his tariffs by displaying the added costs next to product prices on their site. In a sharp criticism, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt labeled the reported plan as a “hostile and political act.”“This is a hostile and political act by Amazon. Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?” Leavitt said, questioning the timing of Amazon’s reported move.Citing a person familiar with the plan, the report by Punchbowl News claimed that Amazon “will soon show how much Trump’s tariffs are adding to the price of each product”, displaying “how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs – right next to the product’s total listed price.”Leavitt concluded her remarks by urging Americans to “buy American”.“This is another reason why Americans should buy American,” she added.However, an Amazon spokesperson clarified the scope of the reported plan to CNBC. The spokesperson stated that the company had only considered displaying import charges on select products within its budget-focused shopping section, Amazon Haul.“The team that runs our ultra-low-cost Amazon Haul store has considered listing import charges on certain products,” the spokesperson explained, adding, “This was never a consideration for the main Amazon site, and nothing has been implemented on any Amazon properties.”During the press briefing, Leavitt and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent were questioned by a reporter about whether they agreed that Amazon's move would demonstrate that American consumers, rather than China, bear the brunt of tariff costs.Leavitt responded by stating that she had “just got off the phone with the president about Amazon’s announcement,” indicating the high level of concern within the administration.Leavitt also suggested that Amazon's reported decision was “not a surprise,” citing a Reuters report that Amazon had “partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm.”",A report by Punchbowl News claimed that Amazon planned to show consumers the impact of his tariffs by displaying the added costs next to product prices on their site.

Chinese company designated as 'National Security Threat' in the US takes on Nvidia with AI chip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinese-company-designated-as-national-security-threat-in-the-us-takes-on-nvidia-with-ai-chip/articleshow/120734564.cms,"Huawei to give competition to Nvidia

Huawei on track with Ascend chipset manufacturing

Here’s why was Huawei labeled as national security threat in the US



Chinese manufacturer Huawei was labeled as a ‘national security threat’ by the US in 2020. Now, according to a report by WSJ, Huawei is now developing a new and powerful artificial intelligence processor which will compete with some of the high-end AI chips produced by American chip manufacturer Nvidia. The report also adds that Huawei is preparing to test the latest series chip, the 910D. Huawei aims for its latest processor, the Ascend 910D , to match the performance of Nvidia's widely acclaimed H100 AI training chip, launched in 2022. The company has reportedly engaged several Chinese tech firms to assess the processor's capabilities, with initial samples anticipated by late May.This development underscores the resilience of China's semiconductor industry despite ongoing efforts by the US government to impede its progress through trade restrictions and limitations on access to Western chip-making technology. Huawei, despite being on a US trade blacklist for nearly six years, has emerged as a key player in China's push for self-sufficiency in critical technology sectors. The company previously demonstrated its ability to overcome some US sanctions with the release of its advanced Mate 60 smartphone in 2023, powered by a domestically produced processor.The report also mentions that the Huawei Ascend 910D uses some advanced packaging technologies which integrate multiple silicon dies resulting in a faster and better performance. Huawei aims that its new chip will surpass the H100 chipset from Nvidia in terms of power. The report also adds that the Huawei 910D is more power-intensive and energy efficient as compared to Nvidia.The move comes at a time when the US continues to tighten restrictions on semiconductor exports to China. Earlier this month, Nvidia's H20 chip, the most advanced processor the company could sell in China without a license, was added to the list of restricted semiconductors. This creates an opportunity for Chinese rivals like Huawei and Cambricon Technologies to gain ground in the domestic market.Despite facing manufacturing hurdles and being cut off from key global suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for advanced chip production, Huawei is reportedly on track to ship over 800,000 of its earlier Ascend 910B and 910C chips this year to major customers, including state-owned telecommunications companies and AI developers like ByteDance (TikTok's parent company). Sources also indicate increased interest in Huawei's 910C chips following recent US restrictions on Nvidia's H20.While previous Huawei AI chips , including the 910C which was marketed as comparable to the H100, have reportedly fallen short of Nvidia's performance in real-world testing, the development of the 910D signifies China's continued determination to close the gap in the crucial AI chip sector.Analysts suggest that while Chinese AI chips may currently lag behind Nvidia's top-tier offerings in individual performance and power efficiency, the ability to deploy them in large clusters could provide a competitive edge within China's domestic market, especially given Beijing's push for local AI developers to prioritize domestic chip procurement.Huawei was banned in the US primarily due to national security concerns. The US government alleged that Huawei's close ties to the Chinese government and military posed risks, including potential espionage and unauthorised data access. These concerns were heightened by Huawei's role in developing telecommunications infrastructure, such as 5G networks, which could be exploited for surveillance.Additionally, Huawei faced accusations of violating US sanctions by conducting business with Iran and engaging in intellectual property theft. In 2019, the US placed Huawei on its ""Entity List,"" restricting American companies from doing business with Huawei without government approval.In 2020, FCC also affirmed the designation of Huawei as a national security threat. In an order passed on June 30, 2020, FCC designated Huawei as well as its parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries, as posing a national security threat to the safety of communications networks and the communications supply chain. In the June order, the Commission’s Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau formally designated Huawei as a covered company for purposes of the agency’s November 2019 ban on the use of support from the Commission’s Universal Service Fund to purchase equipment or services from companies posing a national security threat.","Huawei is developing a new and powerful artificial intelligence processor which will compete with some of the high-end AI chips produced by American chip manufacturer Nvidia.

Headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work

Most functions will have specific initiatives to fundamentally change how they work

Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn has announced a significant strategic shift for the company, declaring a move towards an “AI-first” operational model. In a memo to employees, shared on LinkedIn, Von Ahn underscored Duolingo’s commitment to the swift and comprehensive integration of artificial intelligence into its workflows. He also clarified that this transition will lead to the elimination of certain job roles that can be effectively automated by AI.“We can't wait until the technology is 100% perfect. We'd rather move with urgency and take occasional small hits on quality than move slowly and miss the moment,” he said in the memo.“Al isn't just a productivity boost. It helps us get closer to our mission. To teach well, we need to create a massive amount of content, and doing that manually doesn't scale. One of the best decisions we made recently was replacing a slow, manual content creation process with one powered by Al. Without Al, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners. We owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP,” he added.As per the CEO’s memo, the strategic shift will affect three key areas: a “gradual” cessation of reliance on contractors for tasks automatable by AI, the incorporation of employees' AI proficiency into hiring processes and performance evaluations, and a policy where team expansion will only be considered if further automation proves insufficient.We'll be rolling out a few constructive constraints to help guide this shift:This move towards AI-driven efficiency isn't new for Duolingo.

Elon Musk's connection to Ozempic

In a major crackdown, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seized hundreds of counterfeit Ozempic injections on April 9, 2025, amid growing concerns over unregulated and fake versions of the popular diabetes and weight-loss drug. Europe’s largest drugmaker, Novo Nordisk, warned that these counterfeit units were circulating outside its authorized supply chain in the United States, posing potential risks to patients. Ozempic, chemically known as semaglutide, has skyrocketed in demand due to its effectiveness in treating diabetes and aiding weight loss. Novo Nordisk is also Europe's largest company by market cap.The drug, also the active ingredient in Novo’s weight-loss drug Wegovy, gained further attention when Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk revealed on Christmas 2024 that he used a similar medication, Mounjaro, to shed pounds. In a festive social media post captioned “Ozempic Santa,” Musk joined a growing list of public figures openly discussing their use of GLP-1 agonists, a class of drugs hailed as a breakthrough for obesity and diabetes management.The FDA is now investigating the seized counterfeit Ozempic injections, conducting visual examinations and chemical testing to determine their identity, quality, and safety. Neither the FDA nor Novo Nordisk has released further details about the fake drugs’ composition or potential dangers. Novo Nordisk has urged pharmacies to source Ozempic only from authorized distributors and advised patients to inspect their medication for signs of tampering or counterfeiting before use.The rise in counterfeit Ozempic comes amid a broader surge in unregulated and compounded versions of semaglutide-based drugs, fueled by their popularity. On April 24, 2025, Novo Nordisk won a significant legal battle to halt certain compounding pharmacies from selling knockoff versions of its GLP-1 drugs, reinforcing its efforts to protect patients and maintain supply chain integrity.As the investigation continues, the FDA and Novo Nordisk are emphasizing the importance of vigilance to ensure the safety of patients relying on these life-changing medicatioOn Christmas 2024, Elon Musk posted a photo of himself on Twitter dressed up in a Santa costume, captioning the picture, ""Ozempic Santa."" ""Technically, Mounjaro, but that doesn't have the same ring to it,"" he added. Musk's post highlighted just how mainstream weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy have become in recent years as public figures openly admit to using them, helping transform perceptions and conversations around weight loss.Mounjaro, Ozempic, and Wegovy belong to a trending class of medications called GLP-1 agonists, widely regarded as transformative for those battling obesity and diabetes, and at risk of heart attack or stroke.

"US makes sharing Revenge Porn 'criminal offense' as the US House passes bill, just a step left",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-makes-sharing-revenge-porn-criminal-offense-as-the-us-house-passes-bill-just-a-step-left/articleshow/120729744.cms,"What is the legislation around revenge porn

What Melania Trump said about the Take it Down Act and how it will impact the users

The US House of Representatives has passed a bill that would make the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images , often referred to as ""revenge porn,"" a federal offense. A New York Times report indicates that a bill supported by Melania Trump, aiming to establish strict penalties and guidelines for publishing and promoting revenge porn, has been introduced. This represents a significant move towards criminalising the harmful practice federally. Currently, while many states have laws against ""revenge porn,"" a federal law would provide a more consistent and comprehensive approach to addressing the issue across the country. The bill passed the House with a decisive 409-2 vote, sending it to the then-President Donald Trump, who was widely anticipated to sign it quickly.The legislation to address the issue of revenge porn was first introduced by ens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn in 2018. Take It Down Act , is the legislation passed by the US House of Representatives. This legislation aims to aggressively combat the sharing of revenge porn, mandating that social media companies and online platforms remove such content within two days of notification.Klobuchar stated that she discussed the bill with President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump during an Inauguration Day lunch.Both the conservative and liberals voted in favour of the measure and the legislation was unanimously passed in February in the Senate. Also, President Trump's endorsement of the bill, including a mention during his joint address to Congress the previous month, likely facilitated its progress through Congress.""It’s heartbreaking to witness young teens, especially girls, grappling with the overwhelming challenges posed by malicious online content, like deepfakes,"" Melania said during a roundtable discussion about the ""Take It Down Act"" at the US Capitol.""This toxic environment can be severely damaging. We must prioritise their well-being by equipping them with the support and tools necessary to navigate this hostile digital landscape. Every young person deserves a safe online space to express themselves freely, without the looming threat of exploitation or harm,"" she added.The Take It Down Act is receiving immense support is an example of growing frustration among lawmakers against social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and X for hosting harmful content which has a negative impact on children and teenagers.Rep. María Elvira Salazar told NYT, “It is outrageously sick to use images -- the face, the voice, the likeness -- of a young, vulnerable female, to manipulate them, to extort them and to humiliate them publicly just for fun, just for revenge.”This federal bill aligns with existing efforts in nearly every state; only South Carolina lacks a law criminalising revenge porn, and a significant number – at least 20 – have already addressed sexually explicit deepfakes.","The US House of Representatives has passed a bill that would make the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images a federal offense.

RIP Temu ...: Amazon's China rival adds import charges signalling end of dream run,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/rip-temu-amazons-china-rival-adds-import-charges-signalling-end-of-dream-run/articleshow/120727668.cms,"What Temu said about the price hike

Poll Do you think the import charges added by Temu are justified? No, it's too high. Yes, they are necessary.

Impact of tariff changes on Shien and Temu

Popular Chinese e-tailer Temu has reportedly started adding import charges of about 145% in response to the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump. According to a report by CNBC, Amazon’s China rival has added substantial ""import charges"" to its orders, significantly increasing the cost of many items for consumers. This change introduced by Temu has doubled the price of various products on the platform. The report also adds that the change is impacting the budget-conscious Temu buyers. Also, the newly added fees is raising concerns about the affordability of goods sourced through the platform. Consumers are now facing a sharp increase in the final price at checkout.Addressing the price hike issue, Temu has explained that the products imported into the US are subject import charges. The Chinese e-tailer also said that the charges will cover all the customs-related costs including the import fees paid to customs on behalf of the customers.“Items imported into the US may be subject to import charges. These charges cover all customs-related processes and costs, including import fees paid to customs authorities on your behalf. The amount listed may not represent the actual amount paid to customs authorities,” said Temu on its website.Temu and Shein announced price increases earlier this month following the imposition of a 145% tariff on many Chinese imports and the planned end of the de minimis exemption on May 2. Recently, Shein also announced significant price increases across its product categories in the United States, with some items seeing hikes as high as 377%.The elimination of the de minimis provision on May 2, which currently allows duty-free entry for goods under $800, will significantly impact Shein and Temu. This exemption has been central to their ultra-low price strategy for clothing, accessories, and household goods, and its removal will likely force a revision of their pricing due to increased operating costs.The tariff changes are expected to impact 4 million low-value parcels arriving in the US daily, many of which originate from China. US retailers, including Amazon, have already begun adapting to the new landscape by introducing low-cost storefronts featuring American brands like Adidas, Levi’s, and Gap.","Chinese e-tailer Temu has reportedly started adding import charges of about 145% in response to the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump.

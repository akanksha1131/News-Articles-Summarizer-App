"Intellect Design targets Rs 1,000 crore from Purple Fabric AI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intellect-design-targets-rs-1000-crore-from-purple-fabric-ai/articleshow/126195208.cms,"



Intellect Design Arena is aiming to generate Rs 1,000 crore in revenue over the next four years from its artificial intelligence platform, Purple Fabric. According to the company, Purple Fabric has been built as a decision-grade AI platform rather than a standalone generative AI tool. It is designed to help banking, financial services and insurance companies deploy custom-built AI agents trained on their own proprietary enterprise data, with governance and auditability built in. The company claims that Purple Fabric is positioned to address a common enterprise problem: AI initiatives that stall at pilot stages and fail to deliver measurable financial impact.Arun Jain, founder and chairman and managing director of Intellect Design Arena and chief architect of Purple Fabric, said India has a chance to move beyond consuming global AI tools to building enterprise-grade platforms for the world. He argued that AI should act as a co-strategist rather than a replacement for human judgement, freeing leaders to focus on imagination, empathy and decision-making.The platform is claimed to rest on four pillars: an enterprise knowledge garden, digital experts, governance and model optimisation. At its core are close to 70 ready-to-deploy digital experts that can be customised and combined based on client needs. The architecture follows a microservices approach, allowing enterprises to use individual components or stitch them together across workflows such as credit, fraud, liquidity and compliance.Intellect Design reported revenue of Rs 2,577 crore in the last financial year, up 11 percent year on year. Licence revenue grew 13 percent, while product maintenance revenue rose 12 percent.","Intellect Design Arena is aiming to generate Rs 1,000 crore in revenue over the next four years.

Former Samsung employees who ‘leaked’ chip tech to China and cost company 5 trillion won arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-samsung-employees-who-leaked-chip-tech-to-china-and-cost-company-5-trillion-won-arrested/articleshow/126190089.cms,"How Samsung’s allegedly leaked tech may have helped China’s CXMT

“the assumption that the National Intelligence Service is nearby”





South Korean prosecutors have arrested 10 former Samsung employees. These ex-employees of the tech giant were charged with allegedly leaking 10-nanometre (nm) DRAM technology to the Chinese firm ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT). According to a report by The Asia Business Daily, the group, which includes a former executive and five key development staff, is accused of violating the Industrial Technology Protection Act. Authorities estimate the intellectual property theft has already contributed to a 5 trillion won decline in Samsung Electronics’ sales last year and threatens trillions more in future national economic losses.​​The investigation found that CXMT began aggressively recruiting key personnel from Samsung Electronics shortly after its founding in 2016. At that time, Samsung was the only company in the world mass-producing 10-nm DRAM. The arrested individuals include section heads who were directly responsible for research and development, providing CXMT with the critical technical expertise required to bridge the gap with South Korean manufacturers.Leaked information from Samsung reportedly enabled CXMT to manufacture China’s first 10 nm DRAM chip in 2023.The prosecutors feel that this stolen IP laid the groundwork for the Chinese firm to begin volume production of HBM2 memory in 2024. Market research indicates that CXMT aims to take up to 15% of the market for this speciality memory, competing with market leader Samsung.A former Samsung executive, referred to as “Mr A,” reportedly led work on 10-nm DRAM technology for CXMT. Another key employee, “Mr B,” who was involved in research on the technology, allegedly copied information on DRAM manufacturing.According to The Chosun Daily, “Mr B” manually transcribed 12 pages of information to avoid detection, as semiconductor companies heavily protect their data, and copying files from computers or photographing them with smartphones could lead to discovery.This is not the first time South Korean tech employees have been arrested for sharing information with Chinese firms. Earlier this year, a former SK hynix employee was caught before boarding a flight to China. Meanwhile, another engineer was later sentenced to 18 months in prison for trying to sell information to Huawei. In 2024, two former Samsung executives were also arrested for allegedly stealing confidential information and using it to set up a chip factory in China.However, this case is said to involve more people than the earlier incidents. The Samsung group reportedly used shell companies to pass information and frequently changed office locations to avoid detection.Prosecutors also said the group worked underand used cryptography for emergency communication.",10 former Samsung employees have been arrested in South Korea.

What are China’s new rules for AI companies to operate in the country

“to subtly question and deny the legitimacy of the country's leadership”

“to implant potential separatist ideas into educational courses.""





A new ""cottage industry"" of specialised agencies for artificial intelligence (AI) companies has reportedly emerged in China. These agencies are helping AI companies to pass rigorous government ideological tests required for public launch, a report claims. This test falls under rules formalised in November that require AI models to handle a 2,000-question exam correctly and to refuse to answer at least 95% of prompts designed to trigger politically sensitive or subversive content.According to a Wall Street Journal report, these agencies operate like test-prep services, helping companies train their chatbots to navigate the Chinese government’s strict censorship requirements.The rules are intended to ensure that the AI does not create answers in a manner which might destabilise society or call into question the legitimacy of the Chinese state, the report notes.To complete the examination, chatbots will have to be trained to disregard some of these questions, includingandThis is because Beijing regards AI as an economic and technological priority but fears its unpredictable content, which may spark popular dissent.However, the first examination result is not the only factor in maintaining continuous operations, as the government is constantly monitoring through several enforcement mechanisms. Cyberspace Administration of China offices have random pop quizzes on operating chatbots to ensure they continue to reflect the nation's ideology.Additionally, all AI-generated text, images, and videos must be explicitly labelled so that any undesirable content can be traced back to its source for potential punishment. To keep pace with shifting political priorities, the official test bank of 2,000 questions is updated at least once a month to include new sensitive topics.The government has demonstrated its willingness to shut down non-compliant programmes immediately. Between April and June, authorities reported taking down 3,500 AI products that failed to meet labelling or content standards. While these regulations ensure political stability from the party's perspective, analysts note they create a daunting, expensive technical hurdle for developers competing in the global AI race.To compare, American AI companies also control content to reduce the spread of violent or inappropriate material, partly to avoid lawsuits and negative publicity. However, researchers say Beijing’s approach, at least for AI models used inside China, goes much further. It reflects China’s long-standing efforts to tightly manage public discussion, including the creation of the Great Firewall in the early 2000s.Chinese authorities now seem more confident that their strategy for managing AI will work. After years of taking a cautious stance, the Chinese government adopted a more enthusiastic approach in August, launching an “AI Plus” initiative that aims to deploy AI across 70% of key sectors by 2027.In September, China also released an AI roadmap developed with input from major tech companies such as Alibaba and Huawei, underscoring the government’s confidence in working closely with industry.Due to the Great Firewall, the Chinese government knows that if a chatbot produces content deemed a threat, it is unlikely to spread widely, as state censorship will limit how far it can travel on social media.","A new 'cottage industry' of specialised agencies for artificial intelligence (AI) companies has reportedly emerged in China.

Humanoid robot startups on machines replacing humans: Don’t get your expectations high,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/humanoid-robot-startups-on-machines-replacing-humans-dont-get-your-expectations-high/articleshow/126192653.cms,"Safety and costs are two biggest reasons in humanoid robots







Humanoid robots, like Tesla Optimus, are already ruling the social media. They can be seen dancing or folding laundry but despite a massive influx of capital and viral videos of these machines, the leaders of the most prominent robotics startups have said that robots replacing humans at work is still a work in progress. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, industry veterans admit that moving from a “science experiment” to a “useful worker” is facing a technical hurdle.Citing Pras Velagapudi, CTO of Agility Robotics – the company that is currently testing its ""Digit"" robots with giants like Amazon – remains skeptical of the “robot butler” narrative. According to him, Digit can successfully move boxes in a warehouse but performing complex, varied household tasks is currently beyond the industry's reach due to extreme unreliability.“We’ve been trying to figure out how do we not just make a humanoid robot, but also make a humanoid robot that does useful work,” Velagapudi was quoted as saying.The report highlighted that a major barrier is not just intelligence, but the physical danger they pose to humans. Ani Kelkar, a partner at McKinsey, told the publication that the actual machine accounts for only $20 of every $100 spent on a robotic deployment.The remaining $80 is spent on specialised equipment and systems designed to keep human workers from being injured.“We’re doing a big extrapolation from watching videos of robots doing laundry to a butler in my house that can do everything,” Kelkar cautioned, adding that while companies like Tesla and Unitree are building smaller, lighter robots that are theoretically safer than heavy industrial arms.For several startups, the focus is now mastering one specific job rather than “doing everything”. As per Isaac Qureshi, CEO of Gatlin Robotics, the company is training a prototype to clean office spaces. While the robot is currently learning to scrub walls and dust, Qureshi identified the ultimate goal for the sector: “Toilet’s a big North Star.”","Industry veterans admit that moving from a ‘science experiment’ to a “useful worker’ is facing a technical hurdle.

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business.""

“self-driving technology could be useful in ways the world has yet to imagine, creating many new types of products, jobs, and services.”

""new jobs""

What Americans said about earning from this Waymo ‘gig work’

“$22 to $24”

“$60 to $80”

“We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services given the broad power outage in San Francisco. We are focused on keeping our riders safe and ensuring emergency personnel have the clear access they need to do their work,”

""We've always focused on developing the Waymo Driver for the world as it is, including when infrastructure fails.

We are analysing the event and are already integrating the lessons from this weekend's PG&E outage.”

""immediate steps""





A new type of gig work has emerged in the US self-driving car industry. The Google-owned Waymo robotaxi service is paying Americans roughly $22 just to close the doors of autonomous vehicles. While Waymo was initially launched to eliminate the need for human drivers, the technology has created unexpected manual labour tasks for local workers. According to a report by The Washington Post, tow truck operators are now using an app called Honk to pick up small maintenance jobs for the autonomous fleet.These new roles fulfil a prediction made nearly a decade ago. In a 2016 press release, Waymo’s ex-CEO John Krafcik wrote thatNine years later, thoseinclude simple physical tasks that the robot cars cannot perform themselves, such as securing a door that a passenger left open or moving a vehicle that has stalled.Despite the convenience of app-based work, some business owners describe it as difficult. Tow company owner Evangelica Cuevas explained that her drivers are offeredto close Waymo doors and betweento tow the vehicles when they run out of power or experience technical issues.This specialised work often arises when a vehicle gets stuck while looking for a charging station, leaving workers to handle the physical problems the software cannot solve. These situations also occur when the robotaxis become inoperable due to technical faults or natural calamities.Earlier this week, a massive power outage affected nearly 30% of San Francisco, plunging the city into darkness for hours, paralysing its infrastructure and leaving hundreds of Google-owned Waymo self-driving vehicles stranded in the middle of busy roads. Social media users posted videos and photos of Waymo vehicles stuck in the middle of roads and disrupting traffic flows.According to a report by SFGate, Waymo was forced to suspend operations for several hours after the vehicles became unable to safely navigate intersections without functioning traffic signals.a Waymo spokesperson said at that time.Later, the company announced that it would implement a fleet-wide update to help its cars make safer, quicker decisions during power outages like the one in San Francisco. This came after many Waymo cars were spotted stranded on the road, while Elon Musk claimed that rival Tesla cars kept rolling during that outage.In the blog post, the company wrote,Waymo also outlined the threeit was taking to avoid such situations in the coming days. This includes integrating more information about outages, updating emergency preparedness and response, and expanding first responder engagement.More recently, Waymo paused its robotaxi service in San Francisco once again. This time, the company reportedly sent a notification to customers through its app stating, “Service temporarily paused due to National Weather Service flash flood warning.” The National Weather Service had extended a flood watch for the entire San Francisco Bay Area through Friday, December 26, at 10 pm local time.","Google-owned Waymo robotaxi service is paying Americans roughly $22 just to close the doors of autonomous vehicles.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt may have agreed with Elon Musk's warning to US government on China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-google-ceo-eric-schmidt-may-have-agreed-with-elon-musks-warning-to-us-government-on-china/articleshow/126191827.cms,"Elon Musk’s ‘electricity warning’ to US



‘US losing renewables race to China’, warns Eric Schmidt







Google’s former CEO, Eric Schmidt, has raised questions on the power generation capacity of the United States even as the tech industry is accelerating towards the AI-first model. He also emphasised that China is making huge investments in renewable energy sources, like nuclear and solar energy – something that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously warned about.While speaking at Institute of Politics Harvard Kennedy School, Schmidt said that the US has not produced new electricity while China has surplus power.“In America, we have essentially produced no new electricity because it's very hard to provision electricity. China has infinite electricity because of their incredible investment in renewables and so forth,” he said.“They built something like 120 gigawatts of new renewable energy in the last five years, and some number like that,” Schmidt pointed out, only to be interrupted by Graham Allison, an American political scientist and professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, who said that “every day in China, another gigawatt of electricity is added to the grid” and that happens all year.In May this year, Musk responded to a post which claimed, “If China's 888 GW of installed solar operated at U.S. capacity factors, it would generate 44% of U.S. electricity.” The Tesla CEO said that “Most people don't realize how much solar power China has installed. Enough to power half of America!”Recently, Musk sounded the alarm on America’s energy infrastructure crisis, saying that the US is lagging power generation capacity is a “major competitive disadvantage” as China races ahead in the global power race.He was responding to market analyst Adam Kobeissi's analysis in which he claimed that China now commands 3.75 terawatts of power generation capacity – nearly three times the United States' 1.30 terawatts.Schmidt also raised questions on US’ nuclear power generation. He said that as compared to China, US is not generating any nuclear energy.“How big is a nuclear power plant? About 1.5 gigawatts. So that’s the scale of electricity revolution is taking place in China. How many of those plants have been built in America? Zero. And we are certainly losing the renewables race to China, for the reason that everybody here knows. So they have a lot of power, we don't. We have a lot of chips, they don't,” he said.Similar arguments have also been shared by market analysts. China is said to be aggressively expanding its nuclear infrastructure with 34 reactors currently under construction, which is more than the next nine countries combined. It has also been reported that nearly 200 additional reactors are either planned or proposed for future development. The US, in stark contrast, has no large commercial nuclear reactors under construction.","Schmidt said that the US has not produced new electricity while China has surplus power.

Panos Panay: Shift to ‘ ambient intelligence ’ coming soon







Panos Panay, Amazon ’s head of devices and services, has predicted a big change in consumer technology. According to the executive, the current tech like smartphones and apps is approaching a tipping point due to social media and the rise of generative AI. He said that young generation will consume technology ‘without screens’ and defined by “ambient intelligence”.Speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm AI conference, Panay said Panay says we are looking at “ambient” future where technology fades into the background of daily life as the next generation of users is growing tired of “doom scrolling”.“There’s a whole younger generation coming up that I think at some point they get tired of doom scrolling,” he said, adding, “They’re going to just think differently. You’ve got to make sure you have products in their pockets, on their bodies, in their homes that they don’t expect… [but] expect to connect seamlessly.”According to Panay, the future of AI isn't about building a better app but about making the app experience disappear entirely.“It’s such a joy because there’s no opening a phone, opening the app, clicking, finding… none of it. You just ask the question and you get it back,” Panay observed.Panay said that Amazon is working towards that future by incorporating a better Alexa into its products while suggesting that the ultimate form factor for an AI assistant has not yet been created for public.“I don’t think we’ve seen the next form factor yet on where AI devices are going to go,” he said, adding that Amazon has a “lab full of ideas.”When questioned about potential competitors, like the rumored AI hardware by OpenAI and legendary designer Jony Ive, Panay pointed to Amazon’s existing portfolio of wearables, including the Echo Frames and earbuds.“I think you’re going to want your assistant with you everywhere you go,” he added.While talking on security, Panay said that this is an aspect that is non-negotiable.“I feel like it’s a contract with our customers, period. We break that contract, we lose our customers,” he emphasised.","Panos Panay, Amazon’s head of devices and services, has predicted a big change in consumer technology.

Experimentation, Risk, and Regret

Bill Gates journey from rebellion to a billionaire status





Microsoft founder Bill Gates has opened up about the profound and sometimes provocative role of his fellow Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. In his memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, which was released on February 4, 2025, Gates has credited Allen not only with sparking his passion for computers but also with nudging him into teenage experimentation with drugs and alcohol. Speaking in an interview with Geekwire, Gates joked that Allen was ‘a problem’ who got him drunk and also gave him marijuana. He further added that Allen was the one who got him introduced to LSD and legendary musician Jimi Hendrix’s music. While Gates’ parents provided discipline and structure, Allen embodied a different influence which constantly dared Gates to push boundaries.“He got me drunk, he gave me pot. This guy was a problem… he made me listen to Jimi Hendrix,” Gates recalled.In his memoir, Gates admitted that he tried LSD ‘four to five times’ when he was in his teens. He further described that getting drunk and passing out and experimenting with marijuana in hopes of impressing girls and realizing those attempts “didn’t work out.”In his interview with People, Gates talked how curiosity and risk-taking drove those experiences, but youthful insecurity played a role too. While some moments felt profound at the time, Gates now views them with skepticism, saying he eventually gave up drugs to preserve mental clarity and avoid long-term effects.Interestingly, Gates noted that Steve Jobs once told him he should have tried hallucinogens to make Microsoft products more appealing, a suggestion Gates ultimately rejected.Despite all these experiments, Gates went ahead to build Microsoft. He along with Allen co-founded Microsoft in 1975 and the company went public in 1986 at $21 per share Gates retained a 45% stake, instantly becoming a millionaire.Microsoft grew rapidly under the leadership of Bill Gates. He also attained the title of world’s richest person in 1993. Gates stepped down from the position of Microsoft CEO in 2000 and Steve Ballmer stepped in to fill the position. After stepping down from the position of Microsoft CEO, Gates shifted his focus towardsphilanthropy via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Today, Gates’ net worth stands at $118 billion, ranking him 18th on the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. Microsoft itself has a market capitalization of $3.6 trillion.","Bill Gates has opened up about the profound and sometimes provocative role of his fellow Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.

American billionaire Mark Cuban to new grads: You need to join small companies and teach them how to use AI agents as big companies don’t ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/american-billionaire-mark-cuban-to-new-grads-you-need-to-join-small-companies-and-teach-them-how-to-use-ai-agents-as-big-companies-dont-/articleshow/126190364.cms,"Why AI agents matter

A Jellyfish study found adoption of agentic AI among 400 companies jumped from 50% in December 2024 to 82% in May 2025.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared earlier this year that “the age of agentic AI is here.”

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman likened AI agents to “junior employees.”

Morgan Stanley projects AI shopping agents could add $115 billion to U.S. e-commerce by 2030.

Mark Cuban advice young engineers to not go behind big companies





American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has now shared a new message for the fresh graduates: skip the big corporations and head to small and medium sized businesses. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Cuban argued that small companies are the place where fresh graduates can add most value mainly by them in adopting AI agents. “New grads can teach SMBs how to use agents to optimize processes they couldn’t take the time or afford to do manually,” Cuban wrote. “Big companies don’t need new grads for this. Entrepreneurial companies will love the value you add.”AI agents are autonomous digital assistants capable of completing tasks end-to-end without constant user prompts. They’re increasingly seen as transformative for business operations:Cuban believes this is precisely where new graduates can step in, teaching smaller firms how to integrate AI agents into workflows they previously lacked the resources to optimize.Recently, Cuban urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI).Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects. “Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.","Mark Cuban urges young engineers to not go behind big companies for AI opportunities.

Integrating more information about outages: While our Driver already handles dark traffic signals as four-way stops, we are now rolling out fleet-wide updates that give our vehicles even more context about regional outages, allowing them to navigate these intersections more decisively.

Updating our emergency preparedness and response: We will improve our emergency response protocols, incorporating lessons from this event.

In San Francisco, we’ll continue to coordinate with Mayor Lurie’s team to identify areas of greater collaboration in our existing emergency preparedness plans.

Expanding our first responder engagement: To date, we’ve trained more than 25,000 first responders in the U.S. and around the world on how to interact with Waymo. As we discover learnings from this and other widespread events, we’ll continue updating our first responder training.

Undaunted in our mission to make our streets safer

We live and work in San Francisco, and we are grateful to the city’s first responders for their tireless work, and to Mayor Lurie for his leadership.”





Google-owned Waymo has paused its robotaxi service in San Francisco, reports CNBC. According to the report, the company has sent a customer notification in its app which says “Service temporarily paused due to National Weather Service flash flood warning”. The National Weather Service has extended a flood watch for the entire San Francisco Bay Area through Friday, December 26 10 p.m. local time.Waymo previously reported a halt in its service after a temporary power outage hit the city last week. The disruption then left multiple Waymo cars stranded across the San Francisco Bay area. Days after the incident, the company shared a blog where the EV maker said it will implement a fleet-wide update to help its cars make safer, quicker decisions during power outage incidents.In its official statement, the company said: “At Waymo, our mission is to be the world’s most trusted driver. We know trust is built through consistent behavior over time—earned through every mile we drive and every interaction we have with the community. This past Saturday, as a widespread PG&E outage cut power to nearly one-third of San Francisco, our service was put to the test. With power now restored, we want to share an account of our operations during the outage and how we are evolving to better serve the city.“The scale of the outage and the sheer number of disabled traffic lights were the primary contributors to city-wide gridlock. As signals went dark across major corridors, the resulting congestion required law enforcement to manually manage intersections. The situation was severe enough that the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management advised residents to stay home, underscoring the extraordinary nature of the weekend’s disruptions. ”It further stated:","Google-owned Waymo has paused its robotaxi service in San Francisco, reports CNBC.

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has delivered his first New Year's message since taking the helm of the struggling chipmaker, reflecting on a turbulent nine months that saw mass layoffs, billion-dollar bailouts, and a dramatic White House intervention. ""Just 9 months ago, I was deeply humbled to take on the incredibly important task of leading this iconic American company at a pivotal moment,"" Tan wrote Thursday, expressing gratitude to customers, partners and employees who stood by Intel through its most challenging year in decades.The 65-year-old semiconductor veteran struck an optimistic tone despite presiding over one of tech's most aggressive restructuring efforts. ""I am encouraged by the changes I am seeing within Intel as we embrace our roots as an innovative, data-driven, engineering-centric and execution-focused company,"" Tan stated, signaling confidence in the company's transformation from bureaucratic giant to nimble competitor.Lip Bu Tan's tenure has been defined by ruthless cost-cutting paired with strategic deal-making. Intel slashed roughly 24,000 positions—a quarter of its workforce—eliminated half its management layers, and canceled factory expansions in Germany and Poland.The company posted an $18.8 billion loss for 2024, its first annual loss since 1986, while bleeding market share to rivals like Nvidia and AMD.Yet Tan simultaneously orchestrated critical lifelines. Intel secured $7.865 billion in CHIPS Act funding, with the US government becoming its largest shareholder at 9.9%. SoftBank injected $2 billion in August, followed by a stunning $5 billion investment from Nvidia—the same company Intel rejected buying for $20 billion in 2005, now worth over $4 trillion.Tan's defining moment came in August when President Donald Trump publicly called for his resignation over investments in Chinese companies, posting on Truth Social that the CEO ""is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately."" What followed was a masterclass in crisis management and political maneuvering.Within two weeks, Tan had orchestrated a carefully planned Oval Office meeting, enlisting Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to vouch for him beforehand. The 40-minute session with Trump, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent proved pivotal. Tan addressed concerns about his China ties while positioning himself as an American patriot committed to domestic semiconductor manufacturing.Trump's reversal was complete and public. ""His success and rise is an amazing story,"" the president wrote on Truth Social after the meeting, abandoning his resignation demand. The breakthrough came when Tan agreed to give the US government equity in exchange for CHIPS Act funding—a deal that delivered $8.9 billion and made Intel ""too-strategic-to-fail."" Intel's stock has surged 80% since Tan's March appointment.In his holiday letter, Tan deliberately shifted focus from survival mode to growth opportunities. ""I am excited and inspired by the tremendous opportunities ahead of us and I am looking forward to building and shipping great products and delighting our customers and partners,"" he wrote, closing with wishes for ""a joyful holiday season and a happy, healthy and prosperous new year as we continue our journey in 2026.

How 'Google fear and threat' just made Nvidia spend $20 billion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-fear-and-threat-just-made-nvidia-just-spend-20-billion/articleshow/126188810.cms,"Difference between Nvidia GPU vs Google TPU

Why Nvidia struck deal with Groq

Groq builds fast AI inference. Groq LPU AI inference technology delivers exceptional AI compute speed, quality, and affordability at scale. Groq AI inference infrastructure, specifically GroqCloud, is powered by the Language Processing Unit (LPU), a new category of processor. Groq created and built the LPU from the ground up to meet the unique needs of AI. LPUs run Large Language Models (LLMs) and other leading models at substantially faster speeds and, on an architectural level, up to 10x more efficiently from an energy perspective compared to GPUs.





Nvidia has acquired the assets of AI chip startup Groq in a $20 billion. The deal represents a 3x premium over Groq’s valuation just months ago and it is being viewed as a defensive play to protect Nvidia’s dominance against a rising trend of tech companies preferring custom silicon, specifically Google TPUs. The move is said to be driven by two key factors: the need for cost efficiency and the demand for higher processing speeds. Nvidia is currently struggling to meet the overwhelming global demand for its GPUs, and tech companies are looking for specialised alternatives as AI race hots up.Nvidia lost billions after Meta reportedly struck deal with Google for TPUsEarlier this year, Nvidia issued a statement defending its market position after a report claimed that one of its biggest customers, Facebook parent company Meta, is in advanced talks to spend billions on Google's competing AI chips. This hit Nvidia's stock, erasing roughly $250 billion in market value.Before we jump on to Nvidia vs Google debate, it must be understood the difference between the products offered by both the companies. Nvidia GPUs have are ‘General Purpose’, which means they can be utilised for AI, gaming, crypto mining and scientific simulations. Google TPUs, however, are specialised chips designed for speeding up the “tensor” math that powers machine learning.Apart from flexibility, other differences include speed and efficiency. While Nvidia’s GPUs offer excellent speed, it has overhead for general tasks and are costly. Google’s TPUs are ultra-fast for specific AI training/inference (running an AI model and getting an answer with less lag), and can be mixed-and-matched with Nvidia GPUs to increase efficiency and lower cost.Groq offers a technology similar to Google’s TPUs. According to the company’s website:By acquiring Groq’s fast and efficient LPU technology to complement its powerful GPUs, Nvidia is trying to neutralise the risk of a rival offering a low-cost alternative that could have ‘shrunk’ the company’s dominance to the “training-only” market.The strategic deal will allow Nvidia to capture the entire customer lifecycle through a tiered offering – directing premium clients toward high-end GPUs for heavy-duty model training and steering price-sensitive users toward LPUs for high-speed inference.","Groq builds fast AI inference.

In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk mocked LeCun, sarcastically suggesting that Yann LeCun lacks the general intelligence that he dismisses as ""complete BS"". It all started when Yann LeCun during a recent podcast appearance said that there is no such thing as general intelligence, arguing that human intelligence itself is not truly general.clip from the podcast was shared on X. Responding to the video post, Elon Musk wrote:LeCun, who has been a vocal critic of Elon Musk in the past, has not replied to Musk’s comments.Interestingly, the feud between Elon Musk and Yann LeCum is not new and began years ago.

Microsoft Teams strengthens messaging security with secure-by-default changes in 2026



What is changing in Microsoft Teams in 2026



Weaponisable file type protection

Malicious URL Protection

Report false detections of security

Blocking weaponisable file types at the messaging level



Real-time detection of malicious and phishing links



Balancing security with usability through user reporting



How the changes will affect everyday users



What IT administrators should do before January 2026







Microsoft is about to roll out a significant security update to Microsoft Teams that is going to change how organisations share messages and content. From 12 January 2026, a number of key messaging safety features will be turned on by default for tenants relying on standard configurations. It is the latest move in Microsoft's push towards a secure-by-default philosophy, where core protections are turned on even if administrators have failed to configure them. With collaboration platforms now emerging as prime targets for phishing, malware, and lateral attacks, Microsoft aims to reduce the level of exposure at the platform level. Organisations relying on standard settings can expect to notice some changes, although those with a more bespoke policy in place will not be affected. For IT teams, this means both an enhancement in security and proactive preparation ahead of the rollout.In recent years, collaboration platforms like Microsoft Teams have become integral parts of business infrastructure. However, this has inevitably led to them becoming an attractive target for cybercriminals due to their growing pervasiveness. Microsoft itself has admitted that many organisations still use default settings for messaging, leaving open unintended and often exploitable gaps.Microsoft mandates messaging safety defaults to reduce reliance on manual security hardening. The update also brings Teams closer in line with zero-trust principles, where protection is baked in rather than optional. It's part of a strategic shift across Microsoft's security ecosystem, focusing on protecting organisations that may lack dedicated security expertise.According to Cyber Security News, starting in January 2026, the following messaging safety protections will be set to on by default for customers who have not customised their settings:Blocks exfiltration of file extensions commonly used to deliver malware or cause the execution of malicious code.Scans links shared in Teams messages in real-time against known phishing sites and malicious domains.Enables the reporting of false positives, making it easier for Microsoft to increase accuracy without disrupting legitimate flows.Organisations that have already adjusted and saved their messaging safety settings will not be impacted, since their existing configurations will take precedence.Among them is the automatic turning on of the weaponised file type protection: some file formats are commonly used by the attackers to proliferate malware and spread, especially when shared within trusted environments. Microsoft is trying to stop these threats from ever reaching the devices of its users by blocking such files right within Teams messages.Any attempt to send a message by users for the mentioned type of file should not be delivered. Such an approach, though it might require changing some groups' behavior of exchanging files, greatly reduces the chance of accidental malware execution through collaboration channels.Another important enhancement is the enforcement of malicious URL scanning. Links shared in Teams chats and channels will be analysed in real time against Microsoft's threat intelligence systems. If a link is flagged as suspicious or malicious, users will see warning labels before interacting with it.That's particularly important because attackers are increasingly using collaboration platforms as a phishing vector, knowing internal trust often allows those messages to sail through email security filters. For Microsoft, the same scrutiny will be applied to Teams messages, meaning it closes a critical security gap in the process.Microsoft is also activating a built-in reporting tool to help streamline processes when there are incorrect detections to prevent these security measures from becoming too invasive. In such cases, when valid files or links get blocked, users can report the incidents directly.This sets up a feedback loop where Microsoft is able to train its detection models, but in a very real way, ensures that business-critical activities are not permanently disrupted. For organisations, this provides comfort in knowing that their security controls will evolve and change, rather than be concrete.In the event of a suspicious link in a message, users may see a warning identifier once the new defaults are in place. Users' attempts to share files of a blocked file type will result in message delivery failure. Both these interruptions may be some more considerable inconvenience initially, but the alternative being prevented is far worse: ransomware infections and credential theft. Quite logically, clear internal communication is required so that employees understand why such blocks occur and also understand how to work within such an updated security framework.IT administrators should verify that, Microsoft has given enough time for the change to be examined by the administrators and for preparations to be made accordingly. It is recommended that the IT teams look into their messaging safety settings and check whether the new settings meet their requirements or not. Those administrators who do not prefer the change and would instead opt for the old version will have to make the necessary amendments themselves before 12 January 2026. It is recommended that the security team also update their internal manuals and brief the help desk staff about acceptable methods for the exchange of files.","Microsoft Teams strengthens messaging security with secure-by-default changes in 2026.

"Tech in 2025: Rise of Agentic AI, hardware shifts and breakthroughs that redefined the year",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-in-2025-rise-of-agentic-ai-hardware-shifts-and-breakthroughs-that-redefined-the-year/articleshow/126184606.cms,"AI-generated image for representation purpose

“India is entering a pivotal moment in its AI journey, one defined by how deeply intelligence is being embedded into everyday work and public life.

AI is moving beyond experimentation and becoming a foundational capability for enterprises, governments, and people building new skills for the future. At Microsoft, we focus on pairing innovation with responsibility by investing in the infrastructure needed to run AI at scale and in the people who can apply it well.

""

The rise of Agentic AI

“is the rise of agentic AI, not as a concept, but as something organizations can finally operationalize at scale.”

“This has unlocked a new level of productivity, with business tasks like data processing, customer query responses, and problem resolution now automated, enabling teams to focus on higher-value, strategic work,”

“With AI systems becoming increasingly autonomous and interacting with real-time data, governance, security, compliance, and auditability become just as important as innovation. Companies are no longer asking ‘How fast can we adopt AI?’ Instead, the question has shifted to, ‘How do we adopt it responsibly, securely, and in alignment with regulations and business integrity?’.

The unprecedented efficiency enabled by AI agents is also driving a transformation in the types of AI tools organisations seek.

”

“However, it is crucial to note that agentic AI will not replace people; rather, it is re-humanizing work by removing the mundane and enabling developers and business teams to focus on strategy, creativity, and outcomes. It is this potential in bringing about scalable capability, business impact, and workflow transformation that makes agentic AI the defining technological innovation of 2025,"" he stated.

“Indian enterprises are re-architecting their digital foundations as AI becomes the dominant workload of 2025. What we are witnessing is a decisive shift in compute placement where performance, latency, and data sovereignty are forcing workloads to move closer to the point of creation. Advances in decentralized cloud infrastructure, edge inference, and real-time IoT analytics are collapsing the distance between data and decision-making.

As a result, industries like smart manufacturing, logistics, telecommunications, and modern retail are achieving millisecond-level responsiveness, autonomous operations, and unprecedented continuity across distributed environments.”

as agentic AI integrates into workflows, APIs will become the primary control layer, requiring continuous behavioral security and real-time governance.”

“Preparing for long-term ‘harvest now, decrypt later’ threats will also accelerate post-quantum cryptography planning and early deployment in critical systems. This shift from reactive controls to a unified, platform-driven approach will be central to protecting digital infrastructure. In 2026, the organizations that lead will be those that strengthen API resilience and build security into every layer of their application ecosystem, turning resilience into a durable foundation for innovation and trust,”

AI moved from smartphone apps to OS

“One defining milestone of 2025 was the shift of AI from standalone apps and tools to deep system-level integration. AI moved beyond being something users actively opened to becoming an always-present layer across operating systems, devices, and workflows.

This transition will shape the next decade by redefining the personal computing landscape. It will transform how people interact with technology, from manually issuing commands for each task to now having systems that can understand context, automate multi-step workflows, and proactively assist users across learning, work, and creation.

”

“One of the defining tech milestones of 2025 was AI evolving from an optional feature to a core part of how smartphones work.

Across the industry, intelligence has moved on-device, working quietly in the background to power smarter imaging, adaptive performance, and personalised experiences. At realme, this shift is reflected in innovations like our segment-first dual-chip systems and NEXT AI capabilities, which enable smoother gaming, advanced computational photography, and real-time optimisation based on user behaviour.

”

“Guided by the NEXT AI pillars, we focused on making AI practical, intuitive, and deeply embedded into everyday experiences. Instead of AI for novelty, we used it to remove friction across core use cases. Industry-first, on-device innovations like AI Edit Genie, AI Inspiration, and AI Party Mode enable effortless creation, while AI works seamlessly in the background to optimise imaging, gaming performance, thermal efficiency, and battery life across our GT, Number, and Narzo series.

”

AI PCs become mainstream



“2025 marked a pivotal moment where technology in India moved from adoption to acceleration. AI became deeply practical - powering how India’s workforce learns, creates, and collaborates at scale. We saw a strong shift toward AI personal computing, where intelligence lives on the device, enabling faster performance, better security, and more personalized experiences.”

“At HP, this evolution was especially visible. The rise of AI PCs helped redefine productivity for India’s hybrid workforce; whether it was a creator in a metro city, an SMB owner or a student in a Tier 2 city. On-device AI reduced reliance on constant connectivity, improved data privacy, and unlocked smarter workflows, making advanced computing more accessible and relevant.”

“2025 reminded us that when innovation is built with local context and global intent, it makes a meaningful difference,”

“The rise of AI-powered personal devices in 2025 reinforced a fundamental shift in user expectations: people no longer see AI as a feature, but as a default layer of interaction. Devices like those powered by Gemini or the latest iPhone capabilities showed that users now expect systems to understand intent, context, and continuity across tasks.”

“This shift influenced our roadmap to design computing as a layered experience where AI is deeply integrated into the operating system alongside Cloud PC.

AI simplifies everyday interactions by guiding users, reducing friction, and supporting workflows in real time, while Cloud PC extends computing power when tasks exceed local hardware limits and helps maintain continuity across tasks and devices, thereby preserving context as work scales or shifts.

Together, they enable capable, future-ready computing, without depending on expensive devices, aligning with how users learn, work, and create over time.”

""As the year draws to a close, Indian enterprises are entering a more exacting phase of their AI journey, one defined less by aspiration and far more by outcomes. As per the Lenovo CIO Playbook 2025, AI spending in India is increasing 2.7 times, yet 49% of organizations remain in pilot mode, constrained by the imperative to demonstrate sustained returns. This inflection point is sharpening CIO focus, accelerating a shift from isolated experimentation toward stronger governance, infrastructure readiness, and AI deployments that can withstand scale, scrutiny, and regulatory expectation.

”

“Equally consequential is where AI is deployed. With 63 percent of Indian organizations operating AI workloads on hybrid or on-prem environments, priorities around data sovereignty, compliance, and cost control are clearly shaping infrastructure strategy. As adoption deepens, limitations tied to power availability, transparency, and data locality will increasingly distinguish those that simply connect systems from those that fundamentally advance capability.

”

Subind Kumar, Country Manager & Vice President of Engineering, Sandisk

A year of big hardware shifts

Security takes centre stage

“The key lesson from 2025 was that fragmented security stacks and checklist-based compliance are no longer viable.

Enterprises recognised the need for platform-agnostic, crypto-agile architectures that ensure absolute data residency while enabling hybrid work at scale”.

“2025 marked a clear inflection point for digital advertising. Fraud and media quality risks no longer looked abnormal—they increasingly resembled genuine user behaviour, making traditional metrics like clicks, impressions, and even basic viewability insufficient,” Dhiraj Gupta, CTO & Co-founder, mFilterIt said.

“This is why our focus was on building deep, full-funnel visibility—tracking users from first exposure through conversion, validating intent, attention, and outcomes, and using AI-ML to proactively make optimizing decisions with transparency and confidence. By combining event-level intelligence, behavioural analysis, and self-learning algorithms, we enabled brands to block low-quality and fraudulent traffic early, protect brand safety across automated environments, and optimize campaigns based on what truly drove value,” he added.

“The broader industry takeaway is clear: brands that prioritised transparency, independent validation, and AI-led intelligence were better equipped to navigate uneven performance, identify gaps in traffic quality, and increasingly sophisticated threats.”





2025 was a year when technology didn't just move forward. It accelerated in ways how people learn, work, and build. If the past few years were about the rise of smartphones and personal gadgets, 2025 was something more deeper – the emergence of AI – not just for professional usage but as personal assistants. Across industries, a new class of AI system known as Agentic AI developed from early experiments to real deployment. These systems didn’t just generate texts or respond to questions the way traditional chatbots did. Instead, they could take actions, manage tasks, make decisions and operate autonomously across business workflows. Enterprises began using agentic AI to process data, respond to customer queries, monitor systems, and resolve problems in real-time. For the first time, AI wasn’t just assisting humans. Instead, it was starting to work alongside them.At the same time, AI-generated photos and videos flooded the internet. Developing realistic photos and videos with just a simple prompt became a reality, with tools capable of producing full scenes, dynamic characters, and complex lighting without a camera. Brands, influencers and even media organisations began using AI-generated media in marketing, storytelling and production.While this triggered a wave of scrutiny and privacy concerns, the result was a new race not only among brands and organisations, but among consumers switching from OpenAI’s ChatGPT to Google Nano Banana to other tools.Rajiv Kumar, President and Managing Director, Microsoft IDC, shed light on India's AI journey.Vivek Ganesh, Regional Vice President at OutSystems India said that the most important shift seen in enterprise technology in 2025he added.Amit Agrawal, President, Techno Digital believes thatPratik Shah, Managing Director, India & SAARC, F5 said that “he told TOI.Integration of AI into smartphones picked pace, moving from app into operating system integration. From Google Gemini directly integrated into Android phones to Apple’s iPhone 17 line-up, and Windows devices running native AI assistants, these weren’t simple Q&A tools. AI is now used to edit photos, draft emails, summarize long reads, plan trips and much more – all with one hand access on smartphones.Chitranshu Mahant, CEO and co-founder of Primebook India, told TOI that 2025 marked AI’s transition from a tool users open to “an always-present layer across operating systems, devices and workflows.” He said:A Realme spokesperson echoed Mahant’s view who saidExplaining how companies are making AI more practical and useful for consumers, the spokesperson said2025 also saw AI PCs becoming mainstream, driven by the need for faster processing, privacy and offline intelligence. Vineet Gehani, Senior Director – Personal Systems, HP India said thatHe continuedhe concluded.Mahant, CEO and Co-Founder, Primebook India said:Amit Luthra, MD, Lenovo ISG India said:Continuing further, Luthra said:A central unit that kept AI 'running' is storage., said that AI in 2025 pushed the boundries of storgae componenets.""This year, we witnessed technologies like generative AI push the boundaries of storage systems. The rise of AI workloads meant redefining performance across speed, capacity, reliability, and power-efficiency. In the last few years, storage has evolved from a supporting role to the center stage. Our high-performance enterprise class SSDs moved terabytes of data for training models, and innovations in flash memory helped customers do more with data at the edge and in the cloud,"" he noted.""As we look ahead, there is a lot of excitement about what’s next, from ultra-fast NVMe SSDs to new breakthroughs in storage-class memory. At Sandisk, we are focused on delivering high density, fast storage devices. Whether it's powering India’s next-gen data centers or helping creators store and access their work faster than ever, we are committed to delivering storage that meets today’s demands and tomorrow’s opportunities,"" Kumar added.This shift coincided with a major leap in hardware. Nvidia’s Blackwell chips, unveiled earlier this year, became the defining symbol of AI acceleration. The AI chip race escalated with both traditional and new players joining in to build bigger, faster, more autonomous AI systems. While Intel seems to be struggling to compete with Nvidia, tech giant Google developed Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for AI/ML as an alternative credible to Nvidia’s stranglehold on AI hardware.Mahant of Primebook told TOI that global investment in AI infrastructure “distorted the memory and storage ecosystem.” As large AI data centers absorbed high-end hardware, availability for consumer devices tightened.“Hardware costs increased without corresponding gains in everyday user experience, and affordability worsened, especially outside premium markets where price sensitivity is highest. It exposed a growing imbalance where cutting-edge hardware increasingly serves large-scale AI systems rather than end users. Addressing this will require better long-term planning across the industry, balancing the surge in AI data-centre spending with more thoughtful forecasting and capacity allocation for consumer devices, and using software and system design to deliver performance without pushing cost and access pressures onto end users,” he said.The year also changed how enterprises handle digital frauds and security threats.

AI boom drives unprecedented demand for memory chips







Microsoft and Google are reportedly threatening their procurement executives with termination if they fail to secure critical memory chip supplies from Samsung and SK Hynix, according to industry analyst reports. The intense pressure reflects the severity of the global memory shortage that has sent RAM prices soaring and left AI companies scrambling for components.Citrini Research analyst Jukan (@jukan05 on Twitter) highlighted reports that purchasing executives from major tech companies are now ""practically stationed"" in South Korea, desperately negotiating with the country's semiconductor giants. The stakes are extraordinarily high: Google has already reportedly fired executives responsible for procurement after they failed to secure additional memory supplies, according to Korean industry sources.The reported firings at Google came after the company's AI accelerator chip demand exceeded expectations, creating a supply shortage. When Google approached SK Hynix and Micron seeking additional high-bandwidth memory (HBM) volume, both manufacturers responded that securing more supply was ""impossible."" Google's management subsequently dismissed the procurement personnel, holding them accountable for failing to sign long-term agreements in advance and creating supply chain risks.The desperation has reached new levels, with one incident involving Microsoft executives reportedly storming out of a meeting with SK Hynix after being told the company ""could not supply under the conditions MS wants."" Industry insiders describe big tech companies placing ""open-ended orders"" with memory manufacturers, essentially demanding ""all the volume you can afford, regardless of price.""The global RAM shortage stems from AI companies' massive appetite for memory components needed to power their data centers. With only three companies worldwide capable of producing high-performance HBM and advanced DRAM—SK Hynix, Samsung Electronics, and Micron—the supply situation has become critical. Both Samsung and SK Hynix have reportedly sold out their entire HBM and DRAM production capacity through next year.Tech companies are now fundamentally restructuring their hiring practices to manage Asian supply chains more effectively. Memory procurement managers traditionally based in Silicon Valley or Seattle are increasingly being hired for positions in Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, placing experts with engineering knowledge on the ground to simultaneously conduct technical coordination and volume acquisition.The International Data Corporation forecasts the memory shortage will ""persist well into 2027,"" signaling what the research firm calls ""the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage.""",Microsoft and Google are reportedly threatening their procurement executives with termination if they fail to secure critical memory chip supplies.

"Layoffs due to AI are no longer making Wall Street and investors happy, says Goldman Sachs; and also makes a prediction for 2026",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/layoffs-due-to-ai-are-no-longer-making-wall-street-and-investors-happy-says-goldman-sachs-and-also-makes-a-prediction-for-2026/articleshow/126184051.cms,"Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more

But why this does not mean end of layoffs in 2026





Layoffs can be called as one of the 'biggest' words of 2025. Companies across sectors cut jobs. Some reasoned them on automation and some on restructuring or other factors. However, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, the era of Wall Street rewarding companies for cutting staff in the name of artificial intelligence may be coming to an end. A new report from Goldman Sachs analysts reveals a significant shift in market sentiment: Investors are beginning to punish firms that announce layoffs, even when those cuts are framed as strategic pivots toward automation and technological efficiency.Historically, layoff announcements were often met with stock price bumps as investors anticipated leaner operations and higher margins. However, Goldman analysts found that recent layoff announcements resulted in an average stock price decline of 2%. Companies specifically citing ""restructuring"" were punished even more severely by the market.While CEOs have spent months framing layoffs as a strategic shift toward AI-driven efficiency, Goldman analysts suggest investors aren't buying the narrative any longer. ""This suggests that, despite the benign justifications offered, the equity market has perceived recent layoff announcements as a negative signal about these companies’ prospects,"" the analysts wrote.In short, investors suspect that ""AI restructuring"" is often a convenient cover for desperate cost-cutting necessitated by declining profitability.The shift is said to mark a pivot from the trend of ""efficiency flexing"" seen earlier this year. Executives like Amazon’s Andy Jassy and JPMorgan Chase’s Jeremy Barnum have been vocal about how AI might limit future hiring needs.However, the ""human-free"" narrative is already showing signs of overextension. Fortune recently highlighted Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, who famously touted AI’s ability to replace workers before abruptly reversing a hiring freeze. Siemiatkowski noted that maintaining a human touch is ""critical"" for brand integrity, signaling that the rush to automate may have reached a point of diminishing returns.Despite the cool reception from the stock market, Goldman Sachs predicts a “potential rise” in layoffs through the remainder of the year. Commentary from recent earnings calls suggests that many firms remain committed to using AI to reduce labor costs, even as the market grows increasingly skeptical of the underlying motives.Also, a recent economic analysis by Goldman Sachs revealed a bifurcated picture of artificial intelligence’s impact on the workforce, finding that while the technology’s role in current layoffs remains modest and unproven across the broader economy, companies focusing on AI in their workforce discussions have sharply curtailed their job openings in the last few months.The findings, drawn from an analysis of third quarter corporate earnings commentary and results by senior economist Ronnie Walker, were drawn from management commentary and results across nearly all the S&P 500. It showed that a relationship between the overall labour market outcomes and AI exposure at the economy-wide level has yet to be established.","Investors are beginning to punish firms that announce layoffs, even when those cuts are framed as strategic pivots toward automation and technological efficiency.

The estate of Robert Brockman, the Texas software businessman accused of masterminding what the government had called the biggest US tax-fraud case ever filed involving an individual, has reached a conclusion this week. Brockman’s estate has agreed to pay $750 million in back taxes and penalties to settle a long-running civil suit with the IRS.Brockman was indicted in 2020 on criminal charges. The government accused him of using a “web of offshore entities” to conceal more than $2 billion in income between 2004 and 2018. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the founder of an automotive-software powerhouse maintained the secrecy of his financial empire by utilising encrypted servers and code names, where communications were disguised.The report further says that the wealth was tied to Brockman’s early investments in Vista Equity Partners. It is to be noted that Vista’s CEO, Robert Smith, previously settled his own related tax-evasion case. The civil pursuit of Brockman’s estate continued even after the billionaire’s death in 2022 at age 81.The estate will pay: $456 million in unpaid back taxes for the 14-year period and $294 million in civil penalties for the fraud.The filing does not explicitly state the final amount of interest the estate may still owe, which could potentially push the total higher.According to the report, despite his multi-billion-dollar net worth, Brockman was known for “penny-pinching” habits, such as staying at budget hotels and eating frozen dinners during business trips.Former associates described him as having a fierce “anti-government streak.” He reportedly viewed the IRS as a “corrupt organisation” that unfairly targeted taxpayers.",Brockman was indicted in 2020 on criminal charges.

Amazon mandated its employees to return five days per week to office at the start of 2025. Over the next few months, many more technology companies including Dell, IBM, Meta, Salesforce, Snap, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Disney, AT&T and others too joined in with the same or similar mandate for employees. And the year ends with Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri telling employees to be back in the office five days a week. according to a companywide memo sent by Mosseri, starting February 2, US employees will need to return to the office full-time.As Sander van ’t Noordende, the global CEO of Randstad, which places around half a million workers in jobs every week and can be termed as the biggest recruiter across the world, said in an interview to Fortune, that the great return-to-office war is effectively over -- and a new pecking order has emerged. While rank-and-file staff are called back to their desks, the CEO of the world’s biggest talent company says that only star performers will be able to hold on to fully remote roles. “You have to be very special to be able to demand a 100% remote job,” van ’t Noordende tells Fortune. “That’s increasingly the story. You have to have very special technology skills or some expertise.”“The whole phenomenon of freelance work has been coming up, of course, over the last decades… but that also requires also special skills -- good commercial skills or networking skills, which not everybody has.”What van ’t Noordende reportedly claims to be seeing on the ground is something similar to what Korn Ferry predicted at the start of this year: As companies increasingly upped the dial on in-office working, the consulting firm forecasted a “new hybrid hierarchy” where flexibility becomes a perk reserved only for star performers. “2025’s Haves and Have-Nots will be divided not by economics, but by talent and how much the company wants them,” the report outlined.Essentially at the top, workers with scarce skills can still negotiate for fully remote or ultra-flexible setups. But at the bottom, workers with the least leverage—often in more junior or commoditized roles—are more likely to be expected to show face.Covid-19 pandemic ushered in a new way of working remotely in 2020. However, almost all the companies that initially championed the model changed or are changing their tune in 2025. In recent months, employees across corporate world, from Inosys to TCS, Amazon to Dell have been told that their days of working remotely are over. Instead, select employees have been called back into offices five days a week, a reversal of conversations in 2020 that touted remote and hybrid options as the future of work.Some companies have been very strict. Amazon cloud boss Matt Garman reportedly told employees who don’t agree with the work from office rule that they can leave. Similarly, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and counterparts at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been strong advocates of working from the office, saying it fosters better learning, innovation and culture. More than half of JPMorgan's employees already come into the office full-time, according to the memo from the bank's operating committee. It has more than 316,000 staff worldwide.""Now is the right time to solidify our full-time in-office approach,"" the executives wrote.

Tesla’s transition from automaker to and energy giant

Since Tesla’s founding, each iteration of our master plan has focused on our north star: to deliver unconstrained sustainability without compromise.

Humans are toolmakers. At Tesla, we make physical products at scale and at a low cost with the goal of making life better for everyone. As the influence and impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology increases, the mission set forth in Master Plan Part IV should come as no surprise.

This next chapter in Tesla’s story will help create a world we've only just begun to imagine and will do so at a scale that we have yet to see. We are building the products and services that bring AI into the physical world.

We have been working tirelessly for nearly two decades to create the foundation for this technological renaissance through the development of electric vehicles, energy products and humanoid robots.

Now, we are combining our manufacturing capabilities with our autonomous prowess to deliver new products and services that will accelerate global prosperity and human thriving driven by economic growth shared by all. We are unifying our hardware and software at scale, and in doing so, we are creating a safer, cleaner and more enjoyable world.

This is sustainable abundance.

Interior Department's complete order on the ban

Trump CUTS OFF Future Of Chinese Drones In US, Angry Beijing Breathes Fire | ‘…Discrimination’





The US Department of the Interior recently announced that it is pausing the leases on all five offshore wind sites currently under construction in the country. The move reportedly comes despite the fact that these projects already have installed significant hardware in the water and on land; one of them is nearly complete. The order says that decisions is based on a classified report from the Department of Defense. In the order, the Interior department says that it is pausing the permits for all five Wind projects. It claims that offshore wind creates ""national security risks"" that were revealed in a recent analysis performed by the Department of Defense. What exactly are these risks? The Interior Department notes that offshore wind turbines can interfere with radar sensing. In announcing the decision, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum also said, ""the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies."" At the same time, the announcement adds that the Defense Department analysis is classified, which means that nobody is likely to know what the actual reason is.The Department of the Interior announced today that it is pausing—effective immediately—the leases for all large-scale offshore wind projects under construction in the United States due to national security risks identified by the Department of War in recently completed classified reports.This pause will give the Department, along with the Department of War and other relevant government agencies, time to work with leaseholders and state partners to assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects.“The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “Today’s action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers. The Trump administration will always prioritize the security of the American people. ”The following leases are paused:* Vineyard Wind 1 (OCS-A 0501)* Revolution Wind (OCS-A 0486)* CVOW – Commercial (OCS-A 0483)* Sunrise Wind (OCS-A 0487)* Empire Wind 1 (OCS-A 0512)As for the national security risks inherent to large-scale offshore wind projects, unclassified reports from the U.S. Government have long found that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers create radar interference called “clutter.” The clutter caused by offshore wind projects obscures legitimate moving targets and generates false targets in the vicinity of the wind projects.The Department of Energy in a 2024 report stated that a radar’s threshold for false alarm detection can be increased to reduce some clutter, but an increased detection threshold could cause the radar to “miss actual targets.”Today’s action ensures that national security risks posed by offshore wind projects are appropriately addressed and that the United States government retains its ability to effectively defend the American people.","The US Department of the Interior recently announced that it is pausing the leases on all five offshore wind sites currently under construction in the country.

Italy's antitrust authority (AGCM) has reportedly ordered Facebook-parent Meta to suspend certain contract terms linked to WhatsApp . According to a report by news agency Reuters, the move comes as the antitrust agency investigates the company for a possible abuse of market power. The Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) said the terms could block rival AI chatbots from operating on WhatsApp, potentially limiting competition in the AI chatbot market. The regulator said Meta’s actions could restrict market access, reduce innovation, and harm consumers.The investigation began in July, when AGCM opened a probe into Meta over WhatsApp’s market position. In November, the regulator expanded the investigation to include updated contract terms related to WhatsApp’s business platform. According to AGCM, these conditions could fully exclude competitors to Meta’s own AI chatbot services from accessing WhatsApp.As per the report, a spokesperson for Meta called the decision ""fundamentally flawed,"" and said the emergence of AI chatbots ""put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support"".""We will appeal,"" the spokesperson added.European Union antitrust regulators launched a separate investigation last month into similar concerns involving Meta.The Italian watchdog said it is working closely with the European Commission to address the issue effectively.The move is part of a broader push by European regulators to tighten oversight of large technology companies. EU authorities have taken a tougher stance on Big Tech compared to regulators in the United States, a position that has drawn criticism from U.S. technology companies and from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.AGCM said its goal is to ensure fair competition in the fast-growing AI chatbot market while preventing dominant platforms from limiting access for rivals.","Italy's antitrust authority has reportedly ordered Facebook-parent Meta to suspend certain contract terms linked to WhatsApp. The move comes as the antitrust agency investigates the company for a possible abuse of market power. The regulator said the terms could block rival AI chatbots from operating on WhatsApp, potentially limiting competition in the AI chatbot market.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126164435,imgsize-14036,width-400,resizemode-4/meta.jpg"

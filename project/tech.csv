Microsoft creates AI-powered ‘self-defending software’: What is it and how it works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-creates-ai-powered-self-defending-software-what-is-it-and-how-it-works/articleshow/123146780.cms,"How Microsoft’s Project Ire works



Part of a Larger Security Initiative



Apple Confirms: Majority of iPhones Sold in US Are Now Made in India

Microsoft has developed an advanced AI system that can reverse-engineer and identify malicious software without any human help. Named Project Ire, this prototype system automatically dissects software files to figure out what they do and if they're dangerous—a process typically performed by human security experts, the company said.Essentially, Project Ire’s approach is a departure from existing security tools that scan for known threats. According to Microsoft, the AI “automates what is considered the gold standard in malware classification: fully reverse engineering a software file without any clues about its origin or purpose.”This deep, autonomous analysis is crucial as both security defenders and hackers increasingly use AI to their advantage, according to the company.The company said that in a recent test, Project Ire demonstrated its accuracy by creating a threat report that was strong enough to automatically block an advanced piece of malware. According to Microsoft, early tests show the AI is highly accurate. When the system identified a file as malicious, it was correct 98% of the time, with a false positive rate of just 2%.The development of Project Ire is part of a broader company-wide push on security. Following a series of high-profile vulnerabilities, Microsoft has made security its top priority through its Secure Future Initiative.Like Google's “Big Sleep” AI, which focuses on discovering vulnerabilities in code, Project Ire is part of a new wave of AI systems designed to address cybersecurity threats in novel ways. The system, developed by teams across Microsoft Research, Microsoft Defender , and Microsoft Discovery & Quantum, will now be used internally to help speed up threat detection across Microsoft’s own security tools.","Microsoft has developed an advanced AI system that can reverse-engineer and identify malicious software without any human help.

Industry’s divided on AI's economic impact and future regulation

Former Google X chief business officer Mo Gawdat has dismissed claims that artificial intelligence will generate new employment opportunities, calling the notion ""100% crap"" and warning that even top executives face displacement as AI systems become more sophisticated.Speaking on the ""Diary of a CEO"" podcast Monday, Mo Gawdat predicted that artificial general intelligence will eventually outperform humans ""at everything, including being a CEO."" The tech veteran, who spent over 30 years in the industry, used his own AI startup Emma.love as evidence—a project built by just three people that would have previously required 350 developers.Mo Gawdat's stark assessment challenges optimistic predictions from tech leaders who envision AI as a job creator rather than destroyer. The former Google executive specifically targeted roles traditionally considered safe from automation, including podcasters, video editors, and C-suite positions.""CEOs are celebrating that they can now get rid of people and have productivity gains and cost reductions because AI can do that job,"" Gawdat explained during the podcast interview. ""The one thing they don't think of is AI will replace them too.""His warnings align with recent corporate trends, as companies like Duolingo, Workday, and Klarna have already begun significant workforce reductions or hiring freezes in favor of AI-powered alternatives.While Gawdat presents a dystopian outlook, other industry leaders offer more measured perspectives. Billionaires Mark Cuban and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang argue that learning AI skills alongside strengthening soft skills will create competitive advantages for workers.The World Economic Forum's 2025 Future of Jobs report supports this nuanced view, noting that while 41% of employers globally plan workforce downsizing due to AI, 77% intend to upskill current employees to work alongside artificial intelligence systems.Despite his dire predictions, Gawdat doesn't oppose AI development itself. Instead, he criticizes the capitalist framework driving its implementation, arguing that profit-focused deployment ignores ethical considerations. He advocates for potential universal basic income systems and warns against allowing ""stupid leaders"" to control increasingly powerful AI systems.","Mo Gawdat, former Google X chief business officer, says AI will replace even top executives.

3 characteristics that Walmart HR head believes help employees succeed

Apple Confirms: Majority of iPhones Sold in US Are Now Made in India

Walmart ’s chief people officer Donna Morris says job seekers should avoid being constantly negative if they want to grow in their careers. In a recent interview with CNBC Make It, Morris explained that being a ‘ Debbie Downer ’ is a red flag for managers. A ‘Debbie Downer’ is a person who is always negative, pessimistic, or critical, especially in situations where others are trying to be positive or hopeful.During the interview, Donna Morris said: “Nobody wants [to hire] a Debbie Downer”, adding that this kind of person is “constantly negative. You know they’re going to show up [and] they’re going to bring the problem, never the solution. I like people who bring the problem and a suggestion for how they might resolve [it.]”Morris explained that this kind of attitude can lead to being left out of new projects or growth opportunities. She added that constant naysaying is a warning sign managers watch out for.However, Morris clarified that people should not fake positivity. It’s unnatural and unrealistic for someone to be happy all the time, she said. But if someone is always negative, it could be a sign that they are in the wrong job or company.Donna Morris shared that successful employees stand out by doing three key things differently. First, they consistently deliver results on time, or even earlier than expected. “You’re better to deliver early than to deliver late, and you’re better to deliver more than less,” she said.Second, they are proactive and raise their hands to take on new tasks. Bringing problems with possible solutions or asking for help before situations get worse is another positive trait.““Another green flag is they’re open to opportunities, and they put their hand up to take on more. Or they bring a problem with the remedy or request help in a timely manner, as opposed to the house is on fire.”Finally, Morris said that mentoring others and sharing knowledge are strong “green flags” for employees who want to get ahead. “People who you see are actually helping others [are a] total green flag,” she said.","Donna Morris, Walmart’s chief people officer, says job seekers should avoid being constantly negative if they want to grow in their careers.

Tesla Robotaxi service teased to launch in San Francisco

Tesla shareholders recently filed a lawsuit accusing CEO Elon Musk and the EV maker of securities fraud for hiding safety risks of Tesla's self-driving tech, including the Robotaxi. The lawsuit alleges that Tesla misled investors by not disclosing problems with its self-driving vehicles. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has responded to the lawsuit on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). He said lawsuits like this are not driven by real investors but by ""class-action lawyers"" trying to earn a share of the settlement. Musk called these lawyers “scum of the Earth” and criticized the legal system for allowing such cases.“It’s never actually investors. It’s always shitty class-action lawyers grifting for their percentage of the verdict. They are scum of the Earth. The worst human being I’ve ever encountered,” CEO Elon Musk wrote on X.As reported by news agency Reuters, Tesla shareholders have alleged that the company exaggerated the capabilities of its autonomous driving technology, thereby overstating its business outlook and inflating its stock value. However, the company's stock declined by 6.1% across two consecutive trading sessions following the start of the test.The lawsuit aims to recover unspecified damages for investors who held shares between April 19, 2023, and June 22, 2025, Reuters added.The lawsuit comes after Elon Musk teased the launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service in San Francisco last week. The service’s expected expansion will follow a limited pilot in Austin, Texas, where a small fleet of vehicles started operating within a geofenced area.In San Francisco, the initial operational zone is expected to cover the broader Bay Area. Select Tesla owners have received early invitations, and the launch has reportedly also been moved up.Expansion plans for this service even include states like Nevada, Arizona, and Florida, but broader deployment depends on obtaining regulatory approvals. In California, Tesla has yet to complete the permit process required for full driverless services, with state agencies emphasising safety evaluations.","Tesla shareholders have filed a lawsuit accusing the EV maker of securities fraud.

In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company. I’ve got my methods of doing that, and I use machine learning. I sort through all 42,000 employees.”“100% of the time, I increased the company’s spend on OpEx [operating expenses].

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved from a futuristic concept to an everyday necessity, influencing industries ranging from healthcare and finance to entertainment and communication. It automates routine tasks, enhances productivity, and fuels innovations like ChatGPT, AI-driven translation services, and virtual gaming experiences.The growth of AI has also created a new class of billionaires, some of whom have built companies from scratch, while others have pivoted established businesses toward AI-driven opportunities. Backed by massive investments from Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and other global players, these individuals represent the cutting edge of technology and entrepreneurship. From Jensen Huang’s hardware empire to Alexandr Wang’s data infrastructure solutions, and from Sam Altman’s AI innovation to Yao Runhao’s virtual gaming platforms, these billionaires illustrate how AI is reshaping industries and redefining entrepreneurship.Source: ForbesJensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, sits at the top of the AI billionaire list with an astonishing $113 billion (£151 billion) net worth. Nvidia initially focused on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional visualization. However, as AI adoption accelerated, these GPUs became the standard for training and running large language models like ChatGPT and Meta AI.Huang’s strategic vision transformed Nvidia into the backbone of the AI industry. In July 2025, the company reached an unprecedented $4 trillion valuation, reflecting how central its hardware is to AI infrastructure. Owning 3% of Nvidia, Huang’s wealth grew by over 300% in just one year, making him one of the top 20 richest individuals worldwide.At just 26 years old, Alexandr Wang has secured his place as the youngest self-made billionaire in the AI sector. He founded Scale AI at the age of 19, after dropping out of MIT, to focus on providing data labeling and annotation services essential for AI training.Scale AI works with over 300 high-profile clients, including Meta, Google, and General Motors, supplying the data infrastructure required to build machine learning models. The company’s valuation reached $14 billion (£10.5 billion) in 2024, and Wang’s 14% ownership stake boosted his net worth to $2.7 billion (£3.6 billion). His success highlights how even niche AI services can yield massive fortunes.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is one of the most prominent faces in artificial intelligence. While OpenAI itself is valued at around $300 billion (£225 billion), Altman does not personally hold equity in the company. His wealth, estimated at $1.9 billion (£1.4 billion), stems from early investments in companies like Stripe, Reddit, and Helion Energy, combined with the success of his previous startup, Loopt, which he sold for $42 million in 2012.Altman’s leadership at OpenAI popularized generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, setting global trends in how businesses and consumers interact with AI. His influence extends beyond wealth, positioning him as one of the key thought leaders shaping AI’s future.Phil Shawe, co-CEO of TransPerfect, built one of the world’s largest translation and localization companies by leveraging AI-powered language processing. TransPerfect offers services across industries like law, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, helping businesses operate in multiple languages with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.Founded in 1992 from a dorm room at New York University, TransPerfect generated $1.3 billion (£976 million) in revenue in 2024. Shawe owns 99% of the company, securing a personal fortune of $1.8 billion (£1.3 billion). His journey shows how AI technology can transform even traditional industries like language services into billion-dollar enterprises.Dario Amodei, a former vice president of research at OpenAI, left to co-found Anthropic in 2021. His company focuses on building safe, reliable AI systems using reinforcement learning techniques that allow AI models to adapt through human feedback.Anthropic’s approach to ethical AI and safety-first principles resonated with investors and industry leaders, pushing the company’s valuation to $61.5 billion (£46.2 billion) by 2025. Amodei’s net worth has reached $1.2 billion (£901 million), proving that prioritizing responsibility in AI development can be both impactful and profitable.Liang Wenfeng, once largely unknown outside China, made headlines with DeepSeek-R1, a large language model that outperformed ChatGPT on certain benchmarks while being five times cheaper to run. This innovation shook global markets, causing Nvidia’s stock to drop 17% in a single day as investors reacted to the potential shift in AI computing costs.Wenfeng previously founded a successful hedge fund, and he used his financial expertise to build DeepSeek into one of the most cost-efficient AI providers globally. His net worth now stands at $1 billion (£751 million), making him a key figure in China’s growing AI industry.Yao Runhao, CEO of Paper Games, has carved out a unique niche by combining AI with gaming. His company’s hit product, Love and Deepspace, uses artificial intelligence to create virtual dating simulations with interactive, personalized storylines.The game attracts over six million monthly users, showcasing the demand for AI-driven entertainment. Paper Games employs around 2,000 staff and focuses primarily on the female gaming market in China, highlighting how AI is revolutionizing interactive leisure experiences. Runhao’s innovation has earned him a net worth of $1.3 billion (£977 million).","World’s wealthiest AI moguls ranked by net worth.

What scientists said about these remote controlled robot rabbits



“Our partners have allowed us to trial these things that may sound a little crazy. Working in the Everglades for 10 years, you get tired of documenting the problem. You want to address it.”

“Every python that is removed and eliminated is making a difference to protect the Everglades and South Florida’s diverse and native wildlife. Invasive pythons are one of the most destructive and harmful species in America’s Everglades. Their aggressive predation on native wildlife robs panthers, raptors, bobcats, and other native predators of their primary food sources.”

Apple Confirms: Majority of iPhones Sold in US Are Now Made in India

The South Florida Water Management District and the University of Florida have teamed up to use robot rabbits to help solve the state's invasive python problem. The solar-powered robots are designed to mimic marsh rabbits, luring pythons out of hiding so they can be removed by agents in the Everglades. The Burmese python poses a threat to the Everglades ecosystem by preying on native wildlife. Since the snakes are difficult to catch, these robotic decoys were created as a new tool for the Python Elimination Program . Scientists have repurposed 40 toy rabbits, removing their stuffing and replacing it with waterproofed electrical components to withstand the region's rain and humidity.The robot rabbits are equipped to produce a heat signature and emit a smell to attract the pythons. Additionally, they have cameras that monitor for the snakes and alert officials when a python is detected, allowing a snake wrangler to be dispatched to the area to tackle it.In a statement to the Palm Beach Post, Robert McCleery, a University of Florida professor of wildlife ecology and conservation, said:The US state also organises the Florida Python Challenge every year, where participants are invited to capture and humanely euthanise Burmese pythons for a chance to earn prizes of up to $10,000.According to the South Florida Water Management District, Burmese pythons were first seen in the Everglades during the 1970s. Their presence is linked to the pet trade, as some were either intentionally released or escaped into the wild.The district noted:","The robot rabbits are equipped to produce a heat signature and emit a smell to attract the pythons.

Apple Confirms: Majority of iPhones Sold in US Are Now Made in India

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan ’s appointment is, once again, under scanner as US Senator Tom Cotton has sent a letter to Intel's board chair, seeking clarifications about the chipmaker's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, and his alleged ties to Chinese firms. The senator is also seeking clarification on a recent criminal case involving Bu Tan’s former company, Cadence Design . According to a report, Cotton expressed “concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations and its potential impact on US national security .”News agency Reuters reported that in his letter to Intel chairperson Frank Yeary, Cotton specifically inquired whether Intel’s board was aware of subpoenas sent to Cadence Design during Tan's tenure as CEO, and what measures were taken to address those concerns before his hiring.Cotton also questioned whether Intel's board required Tan to divest from Chinese chip firms linked to the Chinese military or Communist Party. He further asked if Tan adequately disclosed other ties to Chinese companies, especially given Intel's involvement in the Secure Enclave program, a Biden administration initiative aimed at securing microelectronics supply for defense.Due to Intel receiving federal funding under this program, Cotton pressed Yeary on Tan's disclosures related to investments, professional roles, or other connections to Chinese entities, the report added.""Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations. Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations,"" Cotton reportedly wrote.In response, the company confirmed it would address the matters raised in the letter directly with the Senator.“Intel and Mr. Tan are deeply committed to the national security of the United States and the integrity of our role in the U.S. defense ecosystem,” an Intel spokesperson stated.In April this year, Bu Tan's appointment came under scrutiny as he is reportedly one of Silicon Valley's longest-running investors in Chinese companies. Reuters reported that he holds stakes in over 600 Chinese companies and controls more than 40 Chinese firms and funds, including at least eight with links to the People's Liberation Army.An analyst even claimed that Intel CEO is 'unqualified' for his role in the company.""The simple fact is that Mr. Tan is unqualified to serve as the head of any company competing against China, let alone one with actual intelligence and national security ramifications like Intel and its tremendous legacy connections to all areas of America's intelligence and the defense ecosystem,"" said Andrew King, a partner at venture capital firm Bastille Ventures.It's important to note that it is not illegal for US citizens to hold stakes in Chinese companies, even those with ties to the Chinese military, unless those companies are explicitly listed on the US Treasury's Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List, which bans such investments.","US Senator Tom Cotton has sent a letter to Intel's board chair, seeking clarifications about the chipmaker's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan.

Edward Coristine’s heroism brings Trump and Musk together amid crime concerns

Former DOGE employee Edward Coristine is once again making headlines – and this time, he has unexpectedly brought Donald Trump and Elon Musk onto the same page. Coristine, a former employee of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), reportedly intervened in a violent carjacking attempt in Washington, D.C., protecting a woman but suffering severe injuries in the process. Eyewitnesses say he fought off the attackers barehanded, displaying extraordinary bravery. Trump and Musk, often seen at odds politically, both rallied online in support of Coristine and called for action on crime in the US capital. This incident not only reignited discussions about public safety but also marked an unusual alignment between two of America’s most influential figures.At just 19 years old, Edward Coristine has already become a controversial public figure. He first gained attention as a DOGE employee, a Musk-backed initiative focused on reducing fraud and waste in US government operations. Known for his unconventional nickname (originally chosen as a joke), Coristine leveraged social media to build a unique personal brand that rejected corporate formality.Earlier this year, Coristine revealed in a Fox News interview that the nickname was intentionally lighthearted, aimed at countering the overly serious tone of platforms like LinkedIn. He quickly became known as a risk-taker with a unique approach to public service.Coristine wasn’t just a meme-worthy nickname; he held real responsibilities. Reports suggest he was one of only two DOGE employees granted exclusive access to critical systems within the Small Business Administration (SBA), including payroll and HR databases for multiple federal agencies like the Justice Department, Homeland Security, and the FBI.His career path included roles at the General Services Administration (GSA) and later the Social Security Administration (SSA), where spokesperson Stephen McGraw confirmed Coristine worked on improving website functionality and delivering more efficient services to Americans. Despite being a freshman engineering student, Coristine left college early to become one of DOGE’s first hires. His X profile (@as400495), followed by Musk himself, highlights his continued association with prominent tech and political figures.The story gained momentum when Donald Trump shared a photo of a bloodied Coristine, alleging he had been “beaten mercilessly by local thugs” after stepping in to help a woman during an attempted carjacking. Trump’s Truth Social post accused D.C. authorities of failing to control violent crime, even threatening to “federalise” the city if action wasn’t taken.Elon Musk amplified the message on X (formerly Twitter), reposting Trump’s statement and adding his own version of events, praising Coristine’s bravery. According to Musk, a DOGE team member (believed to be Coristine) stepped in when a woman was attacked by a group of eight men, ultimately saving her but suffering a concussion from the assault.The viral image of Coristine, snapped by his friend Marko Elez, added fuel to the conversation, sparking widespread debate about safety in Washington, D.C., and the government’s response to street violence.Trump’s strong response to the incident included a vow to use federal powers to combat crime in D.C., stating, “Perhaps it should have been done a long time ago… If this continues, I am going to exert my powers and federalise this city. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”For many, Musk resharing Trump’s message was surprising, considering their previously strained relationship. However, both appeared united in condemning violence and praising Coristine’s heroism. The incident may signal a rare moment of alignment between two powerful but ideologically divergent figures. While Coristine recovers from his injuries, public support continues to grow. His actions have not only reignited debates about D.C. crime rates but also highlighted the blurred lines between technology, politics, and personal heroism. With both Trump and Musk standing behind him, Coristine’s profile as a public figure could rise even further – whether as a government reform advocate or a symbol of civic courage.","Edward Coristine, 19, reportedly intervened in a violent carjacking attempt in Washington, D.C., protecting a woman but suffering severe injuries in the process.

How two Chinese nationals shipped Nvidia chips illegally

Apple Confirms: Majority of iPhones Sold in US Are Now Made in India

Two Chinese nationals have been arrested for allegedly exporting sensitive AI-related microchips to China without authorization. According to the US Department of Justice , Chuan Geng, 28, of Pasadena, and Shiwei Yang, 28, of El Monte, are accused of violating the Export Control Reform Act, a charge that carries up to 20 years in prison. Yang, who is illegally living in the US after overstaying her visa, was arrested last week. While Geng, a lawful permanent resident, surrendered to federal authorities. He was later released on a $250,000 bond, while Yang’s detention hearing is scheduled for August 12.According to the complaint, the chip – made by a manufacturer of high-performance AI chips – is the “most powerful GPU chip on the market,” and is “designed specifically for AI applications,” such as “to develop self-driving cars, medical diagnosis systems, and other AI-powered applications.” While the DOJ press release does not name the AI chip being illegally shipped, a CNBC report says that it is Nvidia’s H100. The publication claims to have accessed a criminal complaint that names H100.According to federal investigators, the accused operated a company named ALX Solutions Inc., based in El Monte, California. From October 2022 to July 2025, Geng and Yang allegedly used this company to export graphic processing units (GPUs)—advanced computer chips essential for AI development—to China without obtaining required licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce.As per the DOJ release, the duo founded ALX Solutions shortly after new export restrictions were imposed on AI-related microchips, indicating an intention to bypass these controls from the outset.Investigators found that ALX Solutions declared shipments as being sent to companies in Singapore and Malaysia, common transit points used to disguise final destinations. Export records showed that a shipment in December 2024, along with at least 20 previous shipments, were routed through these countries to avoid detection.Despite claiming to export to Singapore and Malaysia, ALX Solutions received payments directly from entities in Hong Kong and China, including a $1 million transfer in January 2024. This mismatch raised suspicions of illegal exports disguised as legitimate business transactions.The investigation is being conducted by the FBI and the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security. The case is being prosecuted by the US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California and the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.","Two Chinese nationals have been arrested for allegedly exporting sensitive AI- related microchips to China without authorization.

Gen Z’s shifting career strategy

AI literacy isn’t enough anymore



As artificial intelligence rapidly reshapes the workforce, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates has issued a stark warning to Generation Z: simply learning to use AI tools won’t be enough to secure a stable job. While Gates believes smart systems are “fun and empowering,” he cautions that their growing presence is already causing serious disruptions in the entry-level job market. Despite the hype surrounding AI literacy, recent graduates are still struggling to find work in a competitive and shrinking employment landscape.Gates encourages young people to remain curious and embrace new technologies, but he admits there’s no guarantee it will shield them from dislocation. Entry-level roles are vanishing as companies increasingly automate tasks that once provided a starting point for new workers.The rise of AI has caused a sharp decline in traditional entry-level opportunities. Job postings for such roles have dropped by 35% in the US since January 2023, with industries favoring automation over new hires. Sectors like finance and consulting are already replacing research and basic analytical tasks with AI systems. A 2024 report from the Burning Glass Institute found that automation now threatens 60% of entry-level roles across multiple sectors. Meanwhile, McKinsey forecasts that by 2030, up to 30% of work hours in the US could be automated, disproportionately affecting younger job seekers. Employers now seek junior employees with oversight skills rather than fresh graduates looking to learn on the job.Even small companies are cutting back. Futurety, a consulting firm in Ohio, opted not to hire a summer intern this year, relying instead on ChatGPT to handle social media content creation. As AI tools become more capable, the need for junior staff to handle foundational tasks continues to decline.With automation replacing office work, many Gen Z job seekers are pivoting toward careers that AI cannot easily replicate. A growing number are pursuing skilled trades like plumbing, electrical work, or elevator installation—jobs that offer stability, strong wages, and don’t require a traditional college degree.Others are turning to people-focused professions such as education, healthcare, and social work, where human interaction remains essential. According to a recent survey, 53% of Gen Z respondents are considering roles in skilled labor or social services, reflecting a major shift away from the white-collar path their parents once followed.Gates still recommends young people stay updated on AI, but he’s clear that understanding the tools alone won’t be a safety net. Instead, adaptability, emotional intelligence, and hands-on skills are becoming just as crucial. Many employers now prioritize candidates who can combine tech fluency with creative thinking and human judgment. In a rapidly changing job market, the ability to collaborate, communicate effectively, and problem-solve in real-world situations is gaining value. Companies increasingly seek ""T-shaped"" individuals—those with deep knowledge in one area and broad, adaptable capabilities across others.In a landscape where AI continues to outpace traditional job growth, Gen Z faces the challenge of future-proofing their careers not just through education—but through reinvention.",Bill Gates says AI will reshape — and eliminate — many entry-level jobs.

How Elon Musk reacted to the Cybertruck window cracking incident

iOS 26 Public Beta Is Here: Apple’s Biggest Redesign Since iOS 7

Tesla chief designer Franz von Holzhausen recently discussed an infamous incident from 2019 when the Cybertruck’s window shattered during its launch. Standing next to CEO Elon Musk, von Holzhausen threw a metal ball at the vehicle’s window to showcase its durability and strength. However, the vehicle’s window cracked, creating an awkward situation then. In a recent interview with Tesla Club Austria, Franz von Holzhausen called the incident a “Murphy’s law” moment, where anything that can go wrong. He said he has done test run on the armoured glass window “multiple times right before we went live on the stage”.“I think it was just one of those Murphy's law kind of things where something bad happens. But it turned out to be a great meme,” von Holzhausen said.He added that despite the blunder, the incident became a “great meme” and “turned into a great marketing moment” for Tesla. Interestingly, the EV maker launched a $45 T-shirt featuring a shattered window design shortly after the incident, turning the accident into a merchandise opportunity.Franz von Holzhausen said “The ball didn't go through the window, so you know, you're still safe. It was not an expected moment, but in that moment, you have to roll with it.”The Tesla CEO then laughed off the incident, saying there was ""room for improvement."" He also shared a video of the incident on X with caption “Franz throws steel ball at Cybertruck window right before launch. Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha.”In another explanation to the cracking incident, he wrote: “Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn’t bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time …”","Franz von Holzhausen threw a metal ball at the Cybertruck's window to showcase its durability and strength.

Perplexity under fire: Cloudflare says Perplexity’s AI bots faked their identities to bypass site blocks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/perplexity-under-fire-cloudflare-says-perplexitys-ai-bots-faked-their-identities-to-bypass-site-blocks/articleshow/123136676.cms,"Perplexity accused of evading restrictions through disguised bot behaviour



Perplexity responds, denies wrongdoing and blames confusion

A growing flashpoint in AI and publisher relations

Perplexity , the rising AI-powered search startup, is facing scrutiny after Cloudflare alleged that its AI bots used deceptive tactics to access websites that had explicitly blocked them. According to Cloudflare’s report, Perplexity’s bots masked their identity, altered user agents to impersonate browsers like Google Chrome, and rotated IP addresses to evade detection. These actions allegedly allowed the bots to scrape content from thousands of restricted domains. The accusations reignite concerns about AI companies bypassing consent protocols and exploiting publisher content without permission.Cloudflare, one of the largest internet infrastructure providers globally, claims this behavior was observed across tens of thousands of domains and millions of daily requests. It further argues that such stealth crawling undermines publisher autonomy and violates transparency norms in web scraping . The controversy highlights growing tensions between AI firms seeking to build data-hungry models and platforms or publishers trying to protect their content from unauthorized use.Cloudflare says it received numerous complaints from clients who noticed Perplexity’s AI crawlers accessing their websites despite having put protections in place—such as disallowing the bots in their robots.txt files or blocking them via Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). In a controlled test, Cloudflare built new domains with restrictions against known Perplexity user agents. The company claims that when the AI bots encountered these blocks, they re-identified themselves as normal users by changing user agents to mimic Chrome on macOS, and used rotating IP addresses that were not listed as Perplexity's official infrastructure.Perplexity has pushed back strongly against the accusations, calling Cloudflare’s blog post a “publicity stunt” riddled with misunderstandings. A company spokesperson stated that Cloudflare failed to distinguish between Perplexity’s own crawlers and third-party traffic, especially from services like BrowserBase, which Perplexity says it uses only occasionally. According to the company, the referenced 20–25 million daily requests were largely user-driven and did not amount to unauthorized scraping or bot-driven behaviour.Following the incident, Cloudflare removed Perplexity from its verified bot list and rolled out new measures to block its access by default. The episode underscores larger debates around the ethics of AI scraping, content consent, and intellectual property. This issue mirrors recent high-profile concerns: The New York Times has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft for allegedly using millions of its articles without permission to train AI models. Meanwhile, communities like Reddit and Stack Overflow have begun requiring AI developers to pay for access to their data—marking a shift toward monetizing user-generated content . Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince has warned that AI models pose an “existential threat” to publishers, and the company is actively encouraging website owners to demand compensation for access to their content—signaling a brewing war between digital infrastructure providers and AI firms in the era of large-scale content consumption.","Perplexity accused of evading restrictions through disguised bot behaviour.

Why Nvidia is pushing back

Nvidia has now shared a long message for China along with an appeal to the US government regarding the allegations of hidden security vulnerabilities in its H20 AI chips . Recently, a Bloomberg report revealed that the Chinese government officials summoned Nvidia representatives over alleged security risks related to Nvidia H20 AI chips. The Cyberspace Administration of China issued a statement regarding the same. The statement said that the chips had been exposed to serious security issues. Now a report by Reuters reveal that Nvidia has confirmed that its chips do not have backdoor entry. Now, Nvidia has publicly asserted that its chips contain ""no backdoors, no kill switches, and no spyware."" The chipset major’s chief security Officer David Reber has made this declaration via a blog post.In a blog post shared, Nvidia’s chief security officer David Reber has vehemently denied the accusations of Chinese government alleging security risks in H20. “There is no such thing as a ‘good’ secret backdoor — only dangerous vulnerabilities that need to be eliminated,” wrote Reber in the blog post. He argued that it would ""undermine global digital infrastructure and fracture trust in US technology.Amidst proposals from the White House and both houses of Congress to require U.S. chip firms to include location verification technology in chips to prevent diversion to restricted countries, Nvidia warned against such measures. Reber likened a mandated kill switch to ""buying a car where the dealership keeps a remote control for the parking brake — just in case they decide you shouldn't be driving,"" calling it ""an overreaction that would irreparably harm America's economic and national security interests .""For those unaware, chips from Nvidia power everything ranging from CT scanners and air-traffic systems to supercomputers and autonomous vehicles. The company argues that putting a backdoor or kill switch in the chipset would create single points of failure, undermine the trust in American technology and also lead to exploitation by hackers.In the blog post shared, Nvidia also have an example of Clipper chip initiative of the 1990s. With this initiative the government agencies were given backdoor access to the encrypted communications but was later abandoned due to security risks.“Hardwiring a kill switch into a chip is like buying a car where the dealership keeps a remote control for the parking brake,” the company said. “That’s not sound policy.”","Chinese government officials summoned Nvidia representatives over alleged security risks related to Nvidia H20 AI chips.

Microsoft’s stricter 'Return To Office' policy

Microsoft following Amazon, Dell and other with new Return to Office policy

Microsoft is reportedly considering implementing a more stringent ‘Return to Office’ (RTO) policy. As reported by Business Insider, the Redmond-based tech giant is planning to implement a stricter Return to Office policy which will require the employees at its Redmond headquarters to work from office for at least three days a week starting January 2026. If this is true, then this new change will mark a significant shift in the company’s flexible hybrid working model. The new policy change is still under discussion and the company has not yet finalised the details.Since late 2020, Microsoft had a flexible work policy which allow the employees to work remotely 50% of the times without any prior approval. The flexible work policy of which sets Microsoft apart from rivals like Amazon and Dell allowed its employees to work remotely most of the times. However, now it appears that the company is planning to bring a change to it. As reported by Business Insider, Microsoft is now planning to implement a new policy which will require most of the employees to work from office for at least three days a week.As reported by Business Insider, the proposed three-day mandate, if implemented, would represent a more formalised requirement for office attendance, moving beyond the current emphasis on productivity as the primary driver for in-office presence. The report also adds that the new and stricter ‘Return to office’ policy could exempt some roles or teams with established remote arrangements.Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw confirmed to BI that the company is considering updating its flexible work guidelines but nothing has been finalised yet.Earlier Microsoft assured employees there would be no blanket RTO requirement, a position that helped attract talent disillusioned by rigid office mandates elsewhere. However, with the upcoming change in the work policy brings Microsoft in line with the other Big Tech companies such as Amazon, Dell, Google and others.Microsoft rival Amazon, recently gave 30 days deadline to employees to decide whether to relocate, followed by 60 days to either begin the relocation process or resign without severance. Amazon is ordering thousands of corporate employees to relocate to major city hubs including Seattle, Arlington, and Washington DC, reports Bloomberg. ""We hear from the majority of our teammates that they love the energy from being located together, and whenever someone chooses to or is asked to relocate, we work with them to offer support based on their individual circumstances,"" an Amazon spokesperson said.On the other hand, earlier this year Dell also announced that the company is ending its hybrid and remote work policy for employees living near Dell’s offices. The company asked all its employees living within approximately one hour of a Dell office will be required to work from their desks five days a week. Dell said in the email, obtained by Business Insider, that employees living a significant distance from a Dell office will be permitted to continue working remotely.Along with this, Google also tightened its return-to-office policies across multiple divisions, requiring remote employees within 50 miles of company offices to work on-site at least three days per week or face potential job loss. The company announced the expanded mandate alongside voluntary buyout programs for US-based workers in Search, marketing, research, and core engineering teams.","Microsoft is reportedly considering implementing a more stringent 'Return to Office' (RTO) policy.

What Tesla shareholders said about the company’s Robotaxi service



iOS 26 Public Beta Is Here: Apple’s Biggest Redesign Since iOS 7

Elon Musk and Tesla are facing a lawsuit from the shareholders of the electric vehicle-making company. In the lawsuit, shareholders accused the EV maker and its CEO of securities fraud, alleging that the company concealed significant safety risks associated with its self-driving vehicles, including the Robotaxi . According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the proposed class action lawsuit was filed in the federal court of Austin, Texas. It follows Tesla's first public test of its robotaxis in late June, which reportedly showed the vehicles speeding, braking abruptly, driving over curbs, entering incorrect lanes, and dropping off passengers in the middle of multi-lane roads.As per the Reuters report, Tesla shareholders have alleged that the company exaggerated the capabilities of its autonomous driving technology, thereby overstating its business outlook and inflating its stock value. However, the company's stock declined by 6.1% across two consecutive trading sessions following the start of the test. The lawsuit aims to recover unspecified damages for investors who held shares between April 19, 2023, and June 22, 2025, Reuters added.The lawsuit comes after Musk teased the launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service in San Francisco last week. The service’s expected expansion will follow a limited pilot in Austin, Texas, where a small fleet of vehicles started operating within a geofenced area.In San Francisco, the initial operational zone is expected to cover the broader Bay Area. Select Tesla owners have received early invitations, and the launch has reportedly also been moved up.Expansion plans for this service even include states like Nevada, Arizona, and Florida, but broader deployment depends on obtaining regulatory approvals. In California, Tesla has yet to complete the permit process required for full driverless services, with state agencies emphasising safety evaluations.The service is said to be introduced on an invite-only basis that will allow Tesla to manage safety, collect data, and meet compliance standards. This phased approach reflects the company’s cautious strategy amid regulatory and technical challenges.","Elon Musk and Tesla are facing a lawsuit from the shareholders of the electric vehicle-making company. In the lawsuit, shareholders accused the EV maker and its CEO of securities fraud. They allege that the company concealed significant safety risks associated with its self-driving vehicles, including the Robotaxi. It follows Tesla's first public test of its robotaxis in late June.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123126371,imgsize-56162,width-400,resizemode-4/Tesla-shareholders-sue-company-and-CEO-Elon-Musk-over-Robotaxi-claims.jpg"

Donald Trump says will announce new tariff plan for semiconductors and chips next week because: We want them to ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-says-will-announce-new-tariff-plan-for-semiconductors-and-chips-next-week-because-we-want-them-to-/articleshow/123123280.cms,"Donald Trump

Trump’s recent policy shifts show selective approach

US President Donald Trump announced that new tariffs on semiconductor and chip imports will be unveiled ""within the next week or so,"" as his administration pursues an aggressive trade policy aimed at bringing manufacturing back to the United States.""We're going to be announcing on semiconductors and chips, which is a separate category, because we want them made in the United States,"" Trump said during an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" The president, however, did not provide specific details about tariff rates or implementation timelines.The announcement comes as the Commerce Department has been investigating the semiconductor market since April to lay the groundwork for possible tariffs on an industry expected to generate nearly $700 billion in global sales, according to Bloomberg.The vast majority of the world's most advanced semiconductors currently come from Taiwan, home to major chipmaker TSMC, whose customers include tech giants Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm and AMD.The semiconductor tariff announcement follows Trump's recent decision in April to exclude smartphones, computers, and other electronics from higher tariffs, though other existing duties remain in place. US Customs and Border Protection updated its guidance to exempt various tech products from the 125% additional tariff on Chinese goods and the base 10% global tariff.Despite Trump's claims that ""people love the tariffs,"" his approval rating has declined in multiple poll trackers' latest updates, per CNBC. Historical data, as quoted in the CNBC report, shows that the president's first-term trade war with China actually expanded China's trade surplus with the US between 2018 and 2021, according to industry reports.Trump had sharply criticized the Biden administration's $52 billion CHIPS Act subsidies as ""ridiculous,"" arguing that tariff threats provide superior incentives for domestic manufacturing. ""We will have more plants built in the next short period of time than ever before because the incentive will be there,"" Trump stated at a House GOP conference earlier this year in January, though he provided no specific timelines for these projected developments.","US President Donald Trump announced that new tariffs on semiconductor and chip imports will be unveiled ""within the next week or so"" The announcement comes as the Commerce Department has been investigating the semiconductor market since April.

How Intel may be struggling with its 18A manufacturing process



“Hail Mary”

""risk production""

""Panther Lake""

iOS 26 Public Beta Is Here: Apple’s Biggest Redesign Since iOS 7

Intel’s key manufacturing process, 18A, is reportedly facing significant quality issues as the company tests newer technologies. This issue threatens Intel's timeline for manufacturing deals and its effort to regain a competitive edge in producing high-end chips. A report by the news agency Reuters cited two people who were briefed on the matter to claim that Intel has spent billions on developing the 18A process, including building and upgrading several factories. The US-based chip maker’s goal was to challenge Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), a key supplier that helps Intel produce some of its chips. One of the sources also compared Intel’s effort to a ""Hail Mary” football pass, describing the company’s aggressive timeline to roll out unproven systems to reduce its contract foundry business dependency on closing the technology gap with TSMC.Intel undertook the 18A manufacturing process challenge to narrow its performance gap with TSMC. Still, the company’s fast-paced rollout of untested systems created significant hurdles, two individuals familiar with its test data said to Reuters. One described the initiative as afootball pass.In April, Intel announced it had startedfor Panther Lake chips using the 18A process. At the Taiwan Computex expo in May, it showcased several laptops that it said were powered by these chips.Initial testing of Intel’s 18A process reportedly fell short of customer expectations last year. However, the company has maintained that the technology remains on schedule for high-volume production of itslaptop chips in 2025.These chips feature next-generation transistors and an updated power delivery method. Intel has positioned this development as a key step toward attracting more external clients to its foundry business, which new CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been reassessing, according to Reuters.Two individuals familiar with internal test data since late last year said to Reuters that only a limited portion of Panther Lake chips produced using the 18A process have met quality standards for customer use.Progress in chip manufacturing is often measured by defect density, which depends on the chip’s design. Compared to industry norms, Panther Lake chips showed approximately three times the acceptable number of defects for large-scale production, the two individuals said.Production success rate also referred to as ""yield"" is also an essential factor in determining whether Intel can manufacture the chips cost-effectively. Yield can fluctuate as manufacturing processes are refined, and companies often measure it differently, making it a variable metric, according to two sources and two others familiar with Intel’s operations, Reuters reported.By late last year, around 5% of the Panther Lake chips produced met Intel’s standards, according to the sources. That yield increased to about 10% by this summer, one source noted, adding that Intel might report a higher figure if it includes chips that do not meet all performance benchmarks.","Intel’s key manufacturing process, 18A, is reportedly facing significant quality issues.

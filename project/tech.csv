Lloyds Banking Group Plc has partnered with the University of Cambridge to train 300 senior staff in artificial intelligence, aligning with the bank’s broader technology transformation efforts. According to Bloomberg News, the first cohort of leaders from the British bank began an 80-hour course this month aimed at fostering an “AI-first” mindset. Lloyds is one of the largest banks in the United Kingdom (UK) and Europe with over 66,000 employees across the globe (as per its annual report). Rohit Dhawan , Lloyds’ head of AI and advanced analytics, told Bloomberg, “Participants of the programme will receive training in an 80-hour programme, known as Leading with AI,” which is delivered by Cambridge Spark alongside Cambridge University experts. Dhawan, who joined Lloyds in August 2024, likened the bank’s AI development to “flying an airplane while building it.” He noted that the bank recently completed a three-year migration of its data and AI assets to the cloud, positioning it for widespread AI integration.The Leading with AI program, developed by Lloyds experts in collaboration with Cambridge Spark and Cambridge University, covers AI regulation, ethics, generative AI mechanics, its challenges, and emerging concepts like agentic AI, which operates independently of human input. Raoul-Gabriel Urma, founder of Cambridge Spark, outlined these components to the publication.Additionally, Lloyds has enrolled around 3,000 employees in Google-led courses tailored for AI specialists, data scientists, business intelligence experts, and data engineers. The bank is also an investor in Aveni.AI, a startup creating a large language model tailored for financial services.Globally, banks are competing to leverage AI tools, seen as a key opportunity to streamline processes, cut costs, and potentially automate thousands of jobs. Lloyds has been revamping its technology infrastructure for years, including evaluating thousands of UK tech staff, some of whom were let go or reassigned.The bank is already seeing results from its AI initiatives. Dhawan shared with Bloomberg that approximately 100 employees are working on an AI-enabled agent set for beta testing in the coming months. He added that Lloyds maintains ongoing discussions with the Financial Conduct Authority to ensure safe AI deployment, particularly for future applications like financial advice.Lloyds is expanding its workforce, actively recruiting in the UK and India, where it established a tech hub in Hyderabad in 2023.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk did not advise on Auto tariffs

Tesla's 'warning letter' to the US government on Auto tariffs

Global outrage on auto tariffs imposed by the US

American President Donald Trump has announced a 25% tariff on auto imports, a decision the White House says will boost domestic manufacturing. ""This will keep driving growth,"" Trump told reporters, emphasizing that the tariffs, expected to generate $100 billion annually, will take effect in April. Trump insists that the tariffs will encourage new factories in the US and dismantle what he calls a ""ridiculous"" supply chain spanning the US, Canada, and Mexico. To highlight his commitment, he declared, ""This is permanent.""Trump clarified that Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a key advisor, did not influence the tariff decision, citing a possible ""conflict"" due to Musk's role at Tesla. ""He’s never asked me for a business favor,"" Trump noted. When asked if the tariffs would benefit Tesla, Trump suggested they could be “net neutral or they may be good.” He pointed to Tesla’s vehicle assembly plants in Austin, Texas and Fremont, California and opined that, “anybody that has plants in the United States — it’s going to be good for them.”Musk, who continues to lead Tesla and SpaceX, also heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), aimed at cutting federal spending and streamlining agencies.Despite Tesla’s domestic focus, the company recently cautioned the US Trade Representative in a letter that some components, like headlamps, brakes, and circuit boards, are ""difficult or impossible"" to source locally, urging consideration of the tariffs' broader impact. The company urged the USTR to “consider the downstream impacts of certain proposed actions taken to address unfair trade practices.”Tesla and peers like Ford and General Motors often rely on suppliers in Mexico, Canada, and China. While Tesla faces rising competition in the electric vehicle market, its chief rival, China’s BYD, remains barred from US sales.Globally, the tariffs have sparked outrage. Germany called for a strong EU response, Japan hinted at countermeasures, and experts predicted higher vehicle prices. Italian automaker Ferrari plans a 10% price hike on U.S.-sold models starting next week. The duties, effective April 3 at 12:01 a.m. Washington time (0401 GMT), apply to foreign cars, light trucks, and parts.In the U.S., the American Automotive Policy Council, representing Ford, GM, and Tesla, stressed that tariffs should avoid burdening consumers or undermining competitiveness. JPMorgan warned of ""global supply chain disruptions"" due to the sweeping policy.","US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports, a decision the White House says will boost domestic manufacturing.

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

Air Canada and Thales issue joint statement

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories.” According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales. Air Canada and Thales issued a joint statement acknowledging the error and stating that the issue has been ""resolved."" ""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy."" Thales added in a separate statement that the map had been provided by a third party.The map feature was promptly disabled, and an updated version will be installed across the fleet starting March 14. Air Canada and Thales apologized for the ""unease created by this situation.""This is not the first time such an issue has occurred in aviation. JetBlue apologized for a similar map error in 2024, and British Airways faced a similar situation in 2013. In 2018, SWISS confirmed its policy of turning off maps entirely when landing in Tel Aviv after a similar incident. Thales stated that the maps are supplied by a third party and that they are working with the airline and the provider to resolve the issue quickly.","Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories” The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.

Baidu has unveiled its AI model, Ernie X1, which is designed to articulate its reasoning process. The Ernie X1 model operates on similar principles to DeepSeek R1 , a model that garnered significant attention in Silicon Valley for its ability to deliver comparable performance to leading chatbots at a significantly lower development cost. Baidu emphasises that its reasoning model excels in areas such as daily dialogue, complex calculations, and logical deduction, as per a report.Bloomberg reports that in addition to the Ernie X1 launch, China's leading internet search provider has upgraded its flagship foundation model to Ernie 4.5 . Notably, the company has made all tiers of its AI service, including the X1 model, freely accessible to its chatbot users, accelerating its initial plans by several weeks.Baidu claims that Ernie 4.5 outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT 4.5 in text generation, citing various industry benchmarks. Baidu has also announced its intention to make its Ernie AI models open-source starting June 30. The company has also integrated the R1 model into its core search engine business.This launch appears to be a strategic move to regain momentum in the competitive AI landscape, where Baidu faces increasing pressure from emerging rivals such as DeepSeek, the report added.While Baidu was the first major Chinese tech company to introduce a ChatGPT-like chatbot, it has since faced stiff competition from rivals like TikTok parent company ByteDance and Moonshot AI. Furthermore, open-source models such as Alibaba's Qwen and DeepSeek have received recognition within the global developer community, the report added.The generative AI boom has positively impacted Baidu's financial performance, with a 26% increase in cloud revenue reported in its December-quarter results. This growth, driven by services provided to developers seeking computing power, was somewhat offset by weaker advertising sales amidst China's challenging economic conditions.","Baidu has unveiled its new Ernie X1 AI model, designed to articulate its reasoning process.

Facebook’s extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

Over the past month, BIS teams have conducted similar operations in various locations across India, including Delhi, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Lucknow, and Sriperumbudur, seizing a range of substandard products.The Bureau of Indian Standards mandates compulsory certification for 769 products, as notified by various regulatory bodies and line ministries of the Government. The manufacturing, import, distribution, sale, hire, lease, storage, or exhibition for sale of these products without a valid license or Certificate of Compliance (CoC) from BIS is strictly prohibited.Last week, the BIS raided warehouses of e-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart in Tiruvallur district, seizing large quantities of products being sold without mandatory certification.At Amazon’s warehouse in Puduvoyal, officials confiscated 3,376 items including insulated flasks, food containers, metallic potable water bottles, ceiling fans, and toys without BIS standard marks. The seized products are valued at Rs 36 lakh.In a parallel operation, BIS officials raided Flipkart’s warehouse in Koduvalli and seized baby diapers (286 packs), 36 boxes of casseroles, 26 stainless steel water bottles, and 10 insulated steel bottles without BIS certification.","The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has conducted a series of raids targeting major e-commerce distributors, and seized thousands of substandard products.

Tulsi Gabbard may have just added to Signal app controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tulsi-gabbard-may-have-just-added-to-signal-app-controversy/articleshow/119596123.cms,"The Signal app is shown on a mobile phone in San Francisco, March 18, 2025.

Pentagon had warned US officials of using Signal app

United States' Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard testified Wednesday that Signal, an encrypted messaging app previously deemed problematic, now comes ""pre-installed"" on government devices. During the House Intelligence Committee's annual worldwide threats hearing, Gabbard highlighted guidance from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recommending ""highly targeted individuals"" use end-to-end encrypted communications. ""They named Signal as an app as an example of such an end-to-end encrypted messaging app,"" she told committee members.The testimony comes on the heels of a recent controversy, where The Atlantic's editor was added to a group chat on the Signal app, in which top Trump officials were using the app to plan a strike on Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.Previously, Signal faced significant resistance from government agencies. The Defense Department's Inspector General had condemned Pentagon officials for using the app in 2021, and the National Security Agency had warned employees about its potential vulnerabilities.The context of this shift is critical: a major breach by the Chinese hacking group Salt Typhoon last year compromised phones of top US officials, including President Donald Trump and JD Vance. CISA's December guidance appears to be a direct response to these security challenges.In a further twist, Gabbard acknowledged a potential misstep involving The Atlantic's editor being added to a sensitive Signal chat, though she was limited in discussing details due to an ongoing lawsuit.","Signal, an encrypted messaging app previously deemed problematic, now comes ""pre-installed"" on government devices.

OpenAI and Microsoft’s response

The core issue: AI training vs copyright law

Fair use argument (OpenAI and Microsoft): OpenAI and Microsoft argue that AI training falls under the doctrine of fair use, which allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes such as education, research, and commentary.

Copyright violation argument (Media organizations): Media companies contend that AI firms are directly copying their work and monetizing it, which constitutes outright infringement rather than fair use.

Potential implications of the case

For AI developers

For media organizations

For AI users and consumers

A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit filed by The New York Times and other media organizations against OpenAI and Microsoft over copyright violations can proceed. The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI and Microsoft have used copyrighted news articles to train their artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots without permission. While some claims were dismissed, the court allowed the primary copyright claims to move forward, potentially leading to a jury trial.The ruling marks a significant development in the ongoing legal battle between AI developers and content creators. Media organizations argue that AI companies have unlawfully used their journalistic work to train large language models, threatening their business models. OpenAI and Microsoft, on the other hand, maintain that their AI models are built using publicly available data under the fair use doctrine. The outcome of this case could have major implications for the future of AI training practices and copyright law.The lawsuit, filed by The New York Times in December 2023, accuses OpenAI and Microsoft of copying millions of copyrighted articles without authorization. According to the complaint, OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, and Microsoft’s AI tools can generate text that closely resembles Times articles, sometimes even reproducing passages verbatim.In early 2024, other news organizations, including MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing, joined the case, consolidating their claims in a Manhattan federal court. The plaintiffs argue that AI companies have effectively stolen their intellectual property, depriving them of revenue while profiting from their work.The lawsuit raises fundamental legal questions about how AI systems are trained and whether using copyrighted content without permission constitutes fair use or infringement.On March 27, 2025, U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein ruled that while some claims from the media organizations were dismissed, the core copyright infringement allegations could proceed.Theattorney, Ian Crosby, expressed satisfaction with the ruling, stating, “All of our copyright claims will continue against Microsoft and OpenAI for their widespread theft of millions of Times works, and we look forward to continuing to pursue them.”Frank Pine, executive editor of MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing, echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing that the case centers on AI companies allegedly stealing journalistic content in a way that damages the business of news organizations.Following the court’s decision, OpenAI released a statement saying it was pleased that “many of the claims” had been dismissed. The company reiterated that its AI models are built using publicly available data and argued that its practices align with the principles of fair use.Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI and a co-defendant in the case, declined to comment on the ruling.OpenAI has consistently maintained that AI training involves scanning vast amounts of publicly available text from across the internet. However, media organizations argue that their work is not simply “publicly available” but protected by copyright, meaning it cannot be used without permission or compensation.The lawsuit raises a crucial legal debate:This case could set a precedent for how AI companies handle copyrighted material in the future. If the courts rule in favor of The New York Times, AI developers may be required to obtain licenses or pay fees to news organizations.A ruling against OpenAI and Microsoft could force AI companies to change how they gather training data. They may need to enter into licensing agreements with content creators, similar to how music streaming platforms pay royalties to artists.A victory for The New York Times and other news outlets could strengthen their ability to protect digital content. This might encourage other publishers to pursue similar legal action, leading to a shift in AI training practices.If AI companies must pay for training data, the cost of developing AI models could rise, potentially affecting accessibility and innovation. Consumers might see fewer AI-driven applications or face subscription-based models for premium AI services.","A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit filed by The New York Times and other media organizations against OpenAI and Microsoft over copyright violations can proceed.

What Elon Musk said on Donald Trump’s 25% import tariff announcement on auto parts

US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports and parts. “What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States,” Trump said, as he signed the order in the Oval Office on March 26. The tariffs take effect on April 3 and apply to foreign-made cars, light trucks, and key auto parts. Responding to the development, Tesla CEO and Trump ally Elon Musk said that “this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries”. Musk referred to a post by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley @teslaownersSV which said that “Trump imposes 25% tariff on all cars not made in the United States. Tesla could benefit the most on this.”Musk clarified stating “To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial.”President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on additional goods, including pharmaceuticals, noting that most drugs available in the U.S. are manufactured abroad, primarily in China and Ireland.Regarding reciprocal tariffs, Trump stated that the U.S. wouldn’t match exact levels set by trading partners but stressed that no country would be exempt.“We're going to make it to all countries, and we're going to make it very lenient,” he said. “I think people are going to be very surprised. It'll be, in many cases, less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades.”He added that the U.S. would be “very fair” and “very nice” in its approach, despite what he described as unfair treatment by other nations.","US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports and parts.

The union government has announced plans to launch a new taxi service called "" Sahkar Taxi "". The new service will be an alternative to platforms like Ola, Uber, and Rapido, and will offer bike, cab, and auto rides. Announcing the initiative in the Parliament, Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Amit Shah said “Sahkar Taxi will register two-wheeler taxis, auto-rickshaws, and four-wheeler taxis across the country”. He said that the goal is to help drivers earn directly without sharing profits with big companies.“Profits from this service will not go to any big industrialist but will go solely to the drivers of the vehicles,"" the minister stated. Sahkar will be available across the country and will be rolled out in the coming months.Additionally, a cooperative insurance company will be established to provide insurance services within the country's cooperative system, Shah said.“In a short time, it will become the largest private-sector insurance company,” he added.The Sahkar Taxi initiative aims to provide affordable transport for passengers while ensuring better earnings for drivers. Unlike private ride-hailing services, all earnings will go directly to the drivers, giving them better financial benefits. The government also plans to set up a cooperative insurance company to support this system.A similar model already exists in West Bengal under the ""Yatri Sathi"" service, which has expanded to multiple cities. Kerala also launched "" Kerala Savaari "" in 2022 but is now working on relaunching it with better fares and technology.","The Sahkar Taxi initiative aims to provide affordable transport for passengers while ensuring better earnings for drivers.

"Amazon 'goes' right into China to deal with its 'Chinese headache'; for buyers it means ""crazy low prices"" and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-goes-right-into-china-to-deal-with-its-chinese-headache-for-buyers-it-means-crazy-low-prices-and-more/articleshow/115269040.cms,"Amazon 'goes' to China

""Still early days ...""

Amazon has introduced a new storefront called ""Amazon Haul"" to compete with Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein. Amazon Haul will offer a wide range of products, including apparel, home goods, and electronics, all priced below $20. With Amazon Haul, the US-based online shopping giant is taking on its Chinese rivals Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop. All three platforms have witnessed a rapid rise in popularity in the US over the past few years by offering shoppers clothing, makeup, home goods and other items at extremely low prices.Amazon is reportedly able to offer low prices through its Haul storefront by importing each item directly from manufacturers in China, similar to how Temu’s and Shein’s business models operate. To manage costs, the company says it won’t accept returns on items that are $3 or less.To attract customers, Amazon is offering free shipping on orders over $25 and a flat $3.99 shipping fee for smaller orders. The company is also prioritizing speed, with most orders expected to arrive within two weeks. However, this is a significant departure from Amazon's traditional focus on rapid delivery.“Finding great products at very low prices is important to customers, and we continue to explore ways that we can work with our selling partners so they can offer products at ultra-low prices,” said Dharmesh Mehta , Amazon’s vice president of worldwide selling partner services, in a statement. “It’s early days for this experience, and we’ll continue to listen to customers as we refine and expand it in the weeks and months to come.”This move highlights the increasing competition in the e-commerce market. While Amazon has long been a dominant force, the emergence of budget-friendly platforms like Temu and Shein has forced the company to adapt its strategy to remain competitive.","Amazon has introduced a new storefront called ""Amazon Haul"" to compete with Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein.

Google.org grants Karya $1 million to strengthen skilling in low-income communities globally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-org-grants-karya-1-million-to-strengthen-skilling-in-low-income-communities-globally/articleshow/115268800.cms,"Google’s philanthropic arm, Google.org , announced it has awarded a $1 million grant to Karya , a non-profit organization that connects low-income communities globally to AI-based earning and learning opportunities. The grant will support Karya’s ongoing efforts to help tens of thousands of community members access AI-related economic opportunities and complete complex, employment-linked digital tasks via their smartphones, ranging from annotating data to providing feedback that improves performance of local language AI models.The Google.org grant to Karya is said to be the most recent step in Google’s growing commitment to building India’s AI-ready workforce. Last month, at the 10th edition of Google for India, Google launched AI Skills House, a new initiative to empower 10 million Indians with AI training, and announced a philanthropic grant of $4 million to Central Square Foundation to support awareness amongst 5 million students, educators and parents across India on the meaningful and responsible use of AI.Alex Diaz, Head of AI for Social Good, Google.org: “At Google.org, we’re committed to seeing the transformative power of technology bring opportunity within everyone’s grasp. And with AI the most potent present-day force reshaping the global economy, we are bringing our resources and capabilities to ensure that the opportunities it unlocks are rewarding for everyone, regardless of their background or circumstance. We’ve been deeply encouraged to see Karya share this commitment, and are now proud to support its new chapter in nurturing both aptitude and appetite as it brings AI opportunities to underserved communities, and helps ensure the benefits of this revolutionary technology are truly universal.”Karya will use the grant to design a digital skilling pathway, consisting of both a research-based curriculum and an experience-focused rubric, and translating it into 10 major Indic languages, thereby also aligning with the Government of India’s vision for an AI-ready workforce. Additionally, leveraging Generative AI, Karya will build a multilingual chatbot to provide real-time support for its app and web-based work platforms that provide access to AI-related digital tasks, enabling people across a range of digital competencies to avail of expanded economic opportunities in languages of their choice.To build the multilingual chatbot, Karya will make its digital work platform accessible to partner organizations based in the African continent, conducting experience research before scaling it globally. An early prototype of the chatbot is helping people in Ethiopia to create AI-related tasks in local languages, including Amharic.Karya will make the digital skilling pathway, as well as a report of its experience in developing the multilingual chatbot, freely and widely available to enable developers, technologists, non-profits, worker collectives and government bodies to create even more solutions that democratize access to digital work, and therefore new income streams, for communities across the world.","Karya is a non-profit organization that connects low-income communities globally to AI-based earning and learning opportunities.

Huang, Son Joke About SoftBank's Early Stake in Nvidia

Nvidia CEO shares his big regret

Japan's SoftBank Group Corp will be the first to build a supercomputer with chips using Nvidia 's new Blackwell design . SoftBank’s telecom unit plans to build Japan’s most powerful AI supercomputer to support a wide range of local services. That supercomputer will be based on Nvidia’s DGX B200 product, which combines computer processors with so-called AI accelerator chips.The two companies announced this at the Nvidia’s AI Summit in Japan. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang joined Softbank founder Masayoshi Son on stage at the summit in Tokyo for a fireside chat. Introducing SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son on stage, Huang said that Masa has been a part of every major technology revolution of the past half-century.""Masa is the only entrepreneur. Only entrepreneur, only innovator in the world. That has selected the winner. And partnered with the winner and every single generation.""""Remember, it was Masa that brought Bill Gates to Japan. It was Masa that invented or brought Jerry Yang to Japan. It was Masa that made possible for China's cloud industry to happen (Alibaba). It was Masa that brought Steve Jobs to Japan and the iPhone. And you maybe many of you probably don't know this, but at one point. Maasa was the largest shareholder of Nvidia.""When reminded of SoftBank’s prior Nvidia stake — which would be worth around $178 billion today — Masayoshi Son cringed and put his head on Nvidia CEO's shoulders as if crying. ""It's okay. We can. We can cry. We can cry together. Could you imagine? If today. You are the largest shareholder. Oh, my God,"" said Huang and then the two wrapped Huang in a bear hug.Till 2019, SoftBank was the biggest shareholder of Nvidia, owning 4.9% of shares. The company sold the same for around $3 billion.As to why the Nvidia CEO too said that he wanted to cry? It was because he said that he regrets Softbank founder’s offer to buy Nvidia. Son had offered to give him money to buy the entire Nvidia.Sharing his regret, Huang said, ""Yeah. We tried the free time, which was only five times. I fell us two times. The first time we became a shareholder by ourselves buying from the market.""Nvidia CEO then recalled his earlier interaction with Masayoshi Son when the latter said, “Jensen, the market doesn’t understand the value of Nvidia. Your future is incredible, but the market just doesn’t get it.” Recognising Nvidia’s potential and the transformative future of AI, Son had then offered to lend Huang the funds needed to acquire the company outright.""Your journey of suffering will continue for some time because you are inventing this future. So. Let me give you the money. To buy Nvidia. He wanted to lend me money to buy Nvidia. All of it. Now I regret not taking it. That was a great idea,"" Huang said.Nvidia CEO has been traveling across the globe to host such events, promoting what it calls the new industrial revolution. Events in India and now Japan are aimed at broadening the deployment of AI systems to nation-based efforts and lessening Nvidia’s reliance on a few large US customer",SoftBank Group Corp will be the first to build a supercomputer with chips using Nvidia's new Blackwell design.

Facebook parent Meta to face trial over 10-year-old Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-parent-meta-to-face-trial-over-10-year-old-instagram-and-whatsapp-acquisitions/articleshow/115267206.cms,"What FTC has to say

What Meta spokesperson said

Meta , the parent company of Facebook , to stand trial for its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, a federal judge has ordered. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleges that these purchases were anti-competitive moves aimed at suppressing potential rivals in the social media industry. The FTC 's lawsuit seeks to dismantle the tech giant.Judge James Boasberg rejected Meta's request to dismiss the case filed in 2020 – under the Trump administration. The FTC argues that Meta, then known as Facebook, overpaid for Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 to eliminate potential threats instead of competing fairly.While Judge Boasberg allowed the core claim regarding the acquisitions to proceed, he dismissed a separate allegation that Facebook unfairly restricted third-party app developers' access to its platform. He also ruled that Meta cannot argue that the WhatsApp acquisition strengthened its position against Apple and Google as a defence.The FTC views the case as a bipartisan effort to curb Meta's alleged monopoly power and promote innovation in the social media landscape.“This case represents a bipartisan effort to curtail Meta's monopoly power and restore competition to ensure freedom and innovation in the social media ecosystem,” said FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar.Meta maintains that the acquisitions benefited competition and consumers.""We are confident that the evidence at trial will show that the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp have been good for competition and consumers,"" a Meta spokesperson said.Meta had previously urged the judge to dismiss the entire case, saying it depended on an overly narrow view of social media markets, and did not take into account competition from ByteDance's TikTok, Google's YouTube, X and Microsoft's LinkedIn.As per news agency Reuters, the case against Meta is one of five blockbuster lawsuits where antitrust regulators at the FTC and US Department of Justice are going after Big Tech.","The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleges that these purchases were anti- competitive moves aimed at suppressing potential rivals.

"WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Skype banned by NatWest for staff communication; here's why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-facebook-messenger-and-skype-banned-by-natwest-for-staff-communication-heres-why/articleshow/115260829.cms,"Why did NatWest ban WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Skype?

Regulatory pressure and industry compliance

Broader implications: Beyond the banking sector

Ensuring accountability in the digital age

In a recent move to tighten communication protocols, NatWest Group has blocked the use of messaging platforms like WhatsApp , Facebook Messenger , and Skype on company devices across the UK. According to the BBC, this decision is part of a broader effort to ensure that employees use only approved communication channels for official business matters, enhancing compliance and accountability within the organisation. The restriction is aimed at minimising off-channel communications, which have raised concerns in various industries due to their potential to bypass regular oversight and scrutiny. With this policy, NatWest joins a growing list of companies focused on reinforcing record-keeping and transparency.NatWest’s decision to block these platforms stems from the persistent issue of off-channel communications, which can pose serious risks to regulatory compliance. Messaging services like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger offer features such as disappearing messages and private chats, which can make it challenging to retrieve records in case of internal investigations or regulatory audits. In contrast, messages sent through NatWest’s approved channels are fully accessible, allowing the company to maintain accurate records and meet regulatory requirements.In a statement, NatWest emphasised, “Like many organisations, we only permit the use of approved channels for communicating about business matters, whether internally or externally.” The bank confirmed that this policy change came into effect earlier this month and applies to all company-owned devices.The financial industry has faced mounting pressure to comply with strict record-keeping and communication standards. In the United States, several major banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Citigroup, have incurred substantial fines totaling over $2.8 billion for failing to adhere to regulations concerning message retention and data accessibility. These penalties highlight the growing importance of robust communication practices in the banking sector, where transparency and accountability are vital.In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has also shown concern over the use of messaging apps by bank employees. In August, reports indicated that the FCA was considering launching an investigation into the use of off-channel messaging platforms within the banking sector. This came after Morgan Stanley was fined by Ofgem, the UK’s energy regulator, for violations related to record-keeping when employees communicated over WhatsApp.The challenges of off-channel communication extend beyond banking and finance. Public sector officials in the UK have also faced scrutiny for their use of messaging platforms like WhatsApp to discuss official matters. During the UK COVID-19 inquiry, it was revealed that numerous WhatsApp messages exchanged by officials, including then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson, had been deleted. This revelation sparked debate over the use of private messaging platforms for government communications, as it raised concerns about accountability and transparency in public administration.For instance, former Cabinet member Penny Mordaunt told the inquiry that two years’ worth of messages with Boris Johnson had disappeared. Johnson himself disclosed that he had lost approximately 5,000 messages, underscoring the potential risks of relying on messaging apps with limited record-keeping capacity.NatWest’s move to ban certain messaging platforms highlights an ongoing industry shift towards more stringent controls over digital communications. As regulatory bodies continue to enforce compliance and transparency measures, organizations across sectors are recognizing the importance of accessible, reliable communication records. By restricting the use of unapproved messaging platforms, NatWest aims to prevent potential breaches and safeguard the integrity of its internal communications.This shift reflects a broader trend in digital governance, where companies are increasingly focused on managing the risks associated with off-channel communications. As technology advances and communication tools become more sophisticated, ensuring compliance and accountability remains crucial, especially in industries where regulatory oversight is rigorous.","NatWest Group has blocked the use of messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Skype on company devices across the UK.

When reached for comment, Zomato declined to provide additional details about the pilot program.The initiative comes as competitors in the quick commerce space are also exploring expanded product categories. Rival Swiggy Instamart is developing separate infrastructure for extended delivery timelines for certain categories, though it plans to focus on kitchen appliances rather than large electronics, according to Swiggy CFO Rahul Bothra's recent statements regarding the company's upcoming IPO.""I don't think we would do large white goods electronics; it would be more of the variable category, more of the kitchen appliances,"" Bothra explained.The pilot's success in Delhi NCR could potentially lead to a wider rollout across other major metropolitan areas where Blinkit operates.","Blinkit has launched a pilot program for delivering larger items like luggage, gaming consoles, and home appliances in Delhi NCR.

Government to Amazon and Elon Musk's Starlink: Your satellite application can be processed only after ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-to-amazon-and-elon-musks-starlink-your-satellite-application-can-be-processed-only-after-/articleshow/115124999.cms,"Strict security guidelines and declaration

Why government is extra cautious on security

The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk 's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon before approving their satellite communication services in India. According to a report in Economic Times, both companies are expected to provide detailed compliance information regarding data security, coverage area, and other key parameters.While Bharti-backed OneWeb and Reliance Jio 's partnership with SES have already secured approval, Starlink and Amazon's applications are still pending due to the additional security checks.Officials aware of the details told ET that letters to both the US-based firms were sent recently and the department is awaiting their reply. ""Their applications can be processed only after they submit the compliance. The firms have so far not replied,"" said a person familiar with the details.Another official said that the government will wait for some more time for their reply, but the applications won't be processed till they agree to all the security conditions. ""There are various security-related compliances as well as those related to data, coverage area etc which satcom providers have to give to the government in order to offer services in India. All the boxes need to be ticked,"" said a third official.As per security requirements, the terminals have to stop communicating if there is a change in latitude and longitude position in order to prevent any misuse. In its replies to the government, Starlink had reportedly given a declaration that none of its investors were from countries sharing a land border with India -- primarily China and Pakistan. The government had accepted that declaration.The government's cautious approach is driven by concerns over potential security risks, especially given the strategic importance of satellite communications. The DoT is particularly interested in ensuring that satellite terminals near border areas are securely monitored and controlled to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is currently working on recommendations for pricing and other terms and conditions for allocating satellite spectrum. However, traditional telecom operators like Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea are advocating for a level playing field, arguing that satellite companies should be subject to the same regulations and liabilities as terrestrial operators.",The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon.

Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha Murthy, recently shared some insights from their lives. The couple were the star guests on the popular talk show The Great Indian Kapil Sharma Show where they delighted the audience with candid, humorous stories from their personal lives.One of the show’s highlights was Narayana Murthy’s funny confession about forgetting their 25th wedding anniversary. He recalled, “One morning, Sudha asked me, ‘Is there anything special today?’ I replied, ‘No, nothing,’ and went to the office. As I was getting in the car, she asked again, ‘Think of anything special today?’ I still didn’t realize.”Later that day, while heading to Mumbai, Murthy received a call from their daughter, Akshata Murty, who was studying at Stanford University at the time. This is how the conversation went:“She asked, ‘What are you doing?’ I told her I was catching a flight. She immediately said, ‘Cancel it, get the first flight back to Bangalore, and wish your wife a happy anniversary!’”Narayana Murthy shared that he told her about a speech at 3pm but Akshata insisted, “I don’t care if you have a speech at 3 pm. If you need to hire a private plane, hire it, but come back and wish her!” Their daughter, Akshata Murty, is now married to former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.Sudha Murthy also chimed in, laughing, “It was our 25th wedding anniversary so it doesn’t happen every year. So I thought, let me give him a cue but it did not work… For five-ten minutes I felt bad because I’m also human. But my daughter was very upset, she went ‘In America this never happens!’, but I went ‘India main it happens though’, who can remember these things??”","Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha, recently shared some insights from their lives.

Popular YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia , better known as BeerBiceps, has recently revealed a surprising incident from his early fitness journey. In a candid conversation on his YouTube channel, Allahbadia shared that he was once banned from a gym in Mumbai.In a recent interview with Kamiya Jani, founder of @curly.tales, he revealed that he was banned from a gym in Mumbai. Allahbadia revealed that he began his journey into content creation by sharing workout videos on YouTube. He filmed the initial content for his channel, BeerBiceps, at a gym in Wadala.To avoid the crowds, Allahbadia developed a routine of visiting the gym around 2 PM. He mentioned that with fewer people in the gym, he felt more comfortable and found it easier to record content for his channel.However, Allahbadia's growing popularity didn't sit well with the gym's trainers and he was banned from the gym. “The trainers were angry with me because I was growing. So, they banned me from the gym. I was very sad and upset,” said Allahbadia. He also revealed that the gym was later shut down.He also added that the incident proved to be a turning point in his career and he decided to set up his own home gym, which allowed him to continue his fitness journey without any restrictions.

Attorney General initiates health and privacy investigation

Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency (ANIF), Baltasar Ebang Engonga , is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos allegedly involving him in intimate encounters with multiple individuals. Originally investigated for alleged fraud, Engonga now faces public backlash and intensified scrutiny over his professional conduct and personal life. This controversy has sparked widespread reaction on social media and raised questions regarding ethics, public responsibility, and potential health risks associated with his actions. As the scandal unfolds, government authorities have initiated an official investigation, underscoring the increasing call for accountability among public officials in Equatorial Guinea.The scandal began when investigators, initially looking into Engonga for suspected fraud, reportedly discovered over 400 videos on his computer depicting private interactions with various individuals. These encounters allegedly involved multiple partners, including his brother’s wife, a cousin, and a relative of the President. According to sources, the videos were filmed in locations such as Engonga’s office, hotels, and even restrooms, with all recorded interactions believed to be consensual.Once leaked, the videos rapidly circulated across social media, sparking outrage and debate among citizens. Public response to the videos has varied, with many questioning the ethical standards of a high-ranking public official engaging in such activities, while others raised concerns about the privacy breach that led to the leak. Posts across social platforms criticised the conduct of a figure responsible for financial investigations, with some users highlighting the discrepancy between his public role and personal actions.In response to the viral scandal, Equatorial Guinea’s Attorney General’s Office, led by Anatolio Nzang Nguema, launched an official investigation into the circumstances surrounding the video leak. According to a spokesperson, authorities are assessing whether Engonga’s actions may have posed health risks, which could result in additional charges if confirmed.“If proven, he could face charges for endangering public health,” the spokesperson commented, emphasising that the investigation will extend beyond the videos themselves to assess any potential impact on public health.This probe into health risks marks a significant expansion of the investigation, as the Attorney General’s office examines both the privacy concerns involved in the leak and the broader implications of Engonga’s behaviour on public welfare. The investigation is expected to review the conduct of government officials and enforce measures to maintain accountability.In a public statement, Vice President Teodoro Nguema took to X (formerly Twitter) to address the scandal, emphasising the need for accountability among public officials. Nguema noted that government offices must be strictly reserved for official duties, signalling disapproval of the misuse of government resources and office spaces for personal purposes.Nguema announced that the government would be implementing new, stricter policies to ensure that misconduct within the administration is met with serious disciplinary action. He further stated that officials found guilty of misusing their authority or resources could face termination or other consequences as deemed appropriate. This stance reflects a broader governmental shift towards enforcing ethical standards and reinforces the message that public officials will be held responsible for their actions, especially when it comes to misuse of office privileges.Engonga, a married man and father of six, holds a prominent position at ANIF, leading financial investigations and initiatives against corruption. However, his involvement in the leaked videos has placed his career and reputation under intense public scrutiny. The scandal has opened a wider debate on the expectations placed on public officials, with many citizens questioning whether private conduct should impact public responsibility and ethical standards.As public opinion continues to weigh in, some have called for Engonga’s resignation, while others argue that privacy should protect personal matters unless they directly impact professional duties. The case has ignited a conversation on the balance between privacy and public accountability, particularly when it comes to those in leadership roles within the government.","Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency, Baltasar Ebang Engonga, is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos.

How scammers are using digital wedding invites on WhatsApp to target users



HP Police's warning against these scams



“If you receive an unsolicited wedding invitation or any file from an unknown number, do not click on it. Ensure you verify the sender and the file before downloading anything onto your phone.""

Scammers are reportedly exploiting the rising trend of digital wedding invitations on WhatsApp. Himachal Pradesh Police officials have warned that scammers are using these digital wedding invitations that are shared on WhatsApp to spread malware and compromise personal data. Scammers are reportedly sending malicious APK files disguised as wedding invitations via WhatsApp.Downloading these files can infect phones with malware and grant hackers full access to the device. This allows them to send messages, steal personal information, and even extort money from the victim's phone without their knowledge. As the wedding season peaks and digital invitations become more common, users are urged to exercise caution and avoid downloading suspicious files , even if they appear to be from trusted contacts.According to a report by News18, this new WhatsApp scam scam uses fake wedding invitations to trick users into downloading malware. The scam involves receiving a message from an unknown number with an attached APK file disguised as a wedding invitation.Once downloaded, the malicious file installs an app that grants cybercriminals access to the victim's data, allowing them to monitor activities and even hijack the phone's functions. In some cases, scammers use the compromised device to impersonate the victim and send messages to their contacts requesting money or sensitive information. This can result in significant financial losses and reputational damage.Following a rise in cybercrime related to malicious files spread via WhatsApp, the Himachal Pradesh Cyber Police are urging citizens to be wary of messages from unknown numbers, particularly those containing attachments, the report adds. They have advised users against downloading any files from unfamiliar sources, especially APK files, which are often used to install malware.In a statement to News18, DIG Mohit Chawla, Himachal Pradesh State CID and Cyber Crime Department said:While downloading files from trusted contacts is generally considered safe, the Himachal Pradesh Cyber Police also emphasised the importance of verifying the legitimacy of any file received, especially if it seems unusual or unexpected.","Scammers are sending malicious APK files disguised as wedding invitations.

The statement comes as the home-sharing platform prepares for what Chesky calls ""the biggest moment in the company's history since its founding"" in 2024.The CEO argues that most employees prefer integration over independence, noting that worker retention and engagement peak when staff members collaborate effectively with colleagues. ""I don't think people for the most part want to be disintegrated, they want to be integrated,"" Chesky explained.Defending his hands-on leadership approach, dubbed ""founder mode,"" Chesky revealed he now reviews all work before release, describing himself as ""the chief editor of the company."" This management style, which he shares with tech leaders like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk , emerged from lessons learned during Airbnb's pandemic-era crisis when the company lost 80% of its business.The strategy appears to be working. Since implementing this approach, Airbnb has achieved profitability for the first time in 2022, with $1.9 billion in earnings. The company also made its Fortune 500 debut in 2023, ranking 450th with $8.4 billion in revenue.Chesky emphasises that his involvement in company details differs from micromanagement: ""You can be in the details with people without telling them what to do, working through problems with them.""","Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, says employee autonomy is ""a giant misnomer"" Chesky says he reviews all work before release, describing himself as ""the chief editor of the company"" Airbnb has achieved profitability for the first time in 2022 with $1.9 billion in earnings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115256856,imgsize-591661,width-400,resizemode-4/115256856.jpg"

How this ‘pop-up’ on Windows laptops and PCs may again lead to Google vs Microsoft tussle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-pop-up-on-windows-laptops-and-pcs-may-again-lead-to-google-vs-microsoft-tussle/articleshow/115255106.cms,"Microsoft is once again attempting to automatically import Google Chrome users' data into its Edge browser through a new popup that appears during PC startup, The Verge reports.The latest update causes Edge to launch automatically and display a prompt offering to ""enhance your browsing experience"" with the option to import Chrome data pre-selected by default. Microsoft confirmed this behaviour to The Verge, describing it as ""a notification giving people the choice to import data from other browsers.""The popup features a prominent blue ""confirm and continue"" button, while the option to decline is limited to a small ""X"" button that blends with the background design. If users accept, Edge will continuously import their Chrome tabs, history, and bookmarks, even when Chrome remains the default browser.This aggressive tactic follows similar controversial moves by Microsoft earlier this year when Edge automatically imported Chrome tabs without user consent. After facing criticism, Microsoft quietly addressed that issue in an update, only to introduce this new method months later.The strategy is part of Microsoft's ongoing campaign to increase Edge adoption, The Verge notes. Previous tactics included blocking third-party tools that redirect Edge links to other browsers, making it difficult to change default browsers in Windows 11, and displaying warning messages when users attempt to download Chrome.Despite these efforts, Edge's market growth remains slow. The browser's forceful promotion has drawn criticism from consumer advocacy groups and other browser makers, who have called for increased regulatory oversight of Microsoft's practices.Users can disable the automatic startup behaviour, but doing so requires launching Edge and navigating through multiple settings, even if they've never used the browser before.","Microsoft is once again attempting to automatically import Google Chrome users' data into its Edge browser through a new popup.

How Donald Trump’s ‘dislike’ for Facebook may help save TikTok,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-donald-trumps-dislike-for-facebook-may-help-save-tiktok/articleshow/115253169.cms,"US President-elect Donald Trump (File photo)

TikTok ban in the US

What Trump said in the run-up to the US elections

TikTok , the Chinese-owned video platform facing a US ban, may be handed a lifeline by President-elect Donald Trump, following his campaign trail hints at a possible reprieve. According to a report, Trump’s team has indicated he plans to “deliver” on these campaign promises, though specific plans remain unclear.“The American people reelected President Trump by a resounding margin, giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver,” Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance’s transition team, told The New York Times.This support will mark a major shift from 2020, when Trump sought to ban TikTok and require its sale to a US-based company due to its Chinese parent company, ByteDance.A federal law passed in April mandates that TikTok, which has 170 million users in the country, must be sold to a non-Chinese company by January 19 — just one day before Trump’s inauguration — or face a ban.TikTok has challenged the law in court, arguing that a sale is unfeasible given Chinese government restrictions, and that a ban would violate the First Amendment.In 2020, then President Donald Trump said that he would ban TikTok.“As far as TikTok is concerned we’re banning them from the United States,” Trump said. However, he reversed his stance in March while admitting that the app is a national security threat but Facebook is “enemy of the people”.“I do believe it, and we have to very much admit we are protecting American people’s privacy and data rights,” he said, adding that banning TikTok would lead to the growth of Facebook, which he dubbed as an “enemy of the people.”“But as you know, I was at the point where I could have gotten it done if I wanted to. I should have said, you guys decide, you make that decision, because there are a lot of people who talk that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it. There are a lot of users,” he said.“There’s a lot of good and there’s a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don’t like is that without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people along with a lot of the media,” he told CNBC.Trump will be sworn in at the presidential inauguration that is held on January 20, as specified by the Constitution's 20th Amendment.","US President-elect Donald Trump said in 2020 that he would ban TikTok from the US.

After 4 years of a crazy journey,

and I are closing the doors on

.

At a personal level, what started as an internship at the Planning Commission way back in 2012 has been a 12 year rollercoaster across K-12, Higher education and early parenting.

Our problems are unique - the scale of primary/secondary education and its quality problem, the growing aspirations of our youth - the

upskilling

needed and the supply of high quality jobs all present a really large canvas.

With Stoa, we took a shot at solving upskilling for the rebellious lot which doesn’t fit the criteria of traditional institutions. We succeeded at a lot of things - getting learning from operators right, getting community of ambitious yet helpful folks right but also failed at a few things.

I had the opportunity to learn from many operators who have scaled businesses and it was interesting to be in this unique situation of teaching and learning about business. Thank you to everyone who gave us their weekends as a facilitator at Stoa.

One of the best things about Stoa journey has been working with a bunch of really talented folks and hopefully I will have an opportunity to reunite the Stoa Crew. Truly fantastic people who take pride in their craft - you know who you are :-)

Of course Stoa as a community could not have been what it is without our alums - many of them have started on their own and some are part of core teams at fast growing startups. More importantly, they found the professional network and the space to chart their careers better.

Stoa did become my social identity within the small circle who cares about such things and it is kinda terrifying to reinvent it all over again. But I guess that’s life :-)

Grateful to everyone who cheered for us from the sidelines and in the trenches.

Will write more about my learnings from these 4 crazy years soon.

Why Brockman’s return is important

OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman is back in office, three months after announcing a temporary leave of absence that he said would run “through [the] end of year.” Brockman, who stepped away in August, announced his return through a post on X.Brockman announced in August that he is taking some “time to relax” since he co-founded the company 9 years ago.“I’m taking a sabbatical through end of year. First time to relax since co-founding OpenAI 9 years ago. The mission is far from complete; we still have a safe AGI to build,” wrote Brockman in his post. However, he did not indicate that he may be quitting the company.However, the timing of his sabbatical was suspicious because it came at a time when another OpenAI co-founder John Schulman announced that he is joining rival company Anthropic.This news comes after a tumultuous period for the artificial intelligence powerhouse, which recently secured a staggering $157 billion valuation. During Brockman's sabbatical, OpenAI experienced a wave of executive departures, including CTO Mira Murati, research chief Bob McGrew, and research VP Barret Zoph.This exodus follows the earlier departures of co-founders Ilya Sutskever, former safety leader Jan Leike, and, most recently, vice president of research and safety Lilian Weng. Elon Musk also sued the company over its alleged transition from non-profit to for-profit entity.Brockman, a close ally of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, previously served as the company's CTO. His return may signal a move towards stability following the dramatic events of the past year.Brockman was among a bunch of executives who showed solidarity during company CEO Sam Altman's ouster.","Brockman announced in August that he is taking some “time to relax” since he co- founded the company 9 years ago.

Despite recent speculation about Apple's potential entry into the smart ring market , Tom Hale, CEO of health-tech firm Oura, believes the tech giant is likely to skip the launch of a competitor to its Apple Watch. Hale, whose company has been working on smart ring technology since 2013, believes Apple's focus remains on the Apple Watch as its primary health and fitness platform.“I think they [Apple] are unconvinced about the value of having a ring and a watch together and they’re not interested in undercutting the Apple Watch as a business,” Hale told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal.Samsung has already launched a smart ring debut earlier this year, with one analyst from market research firm CCS Insight predicting that Apple may launch its own smart ring in 2026.“I think they’re probably keeping a close eye on Samsung and a close eye on us, but it’s hard to do this product category right, “ said Hale, who believes that Apple's focus remains firmly on the Apple Watch as its wearable platform.Under CEO Tim Cook, Apple has put a large focus on health applications through the Apple Watch that has become the holy grail of wearables.“Apple is very much a focused company. They’re like: ‘We’ve put our bet on the watch. We’re gonna make the watch our platform,’” Hale said.While smart rings offer several advantages over smartwatches, including their lightweight design, longer battery life, and greater comfort for all-day wear, especially during sleep, smartwatches have their own pros, such as large display for read notifications, ability to make calls, send texts, control music, and even run standalone apps.In fact, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman also said that if Apple launches a ring that offers the same health features as Apple Watch, it may jeopardise the wearable audience.","Tom Hale, CEO of health-tech firm Oura, believes Apple is likely to skip the launch of a competitor to its Apple Watch.

In a bold move, President-elect Donald Trump has announced the formation of a temporary agency, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to tackle bureaucracy and streamline government operations. Led by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy , this new department aims to bring structural reforms to federal agencies, slashing inefficiencies, reducing unnecessary spending, and fostering an entrepreneurial spirit in government. Trump’s initiative marks a significant shift toward limited government and has generated interest due to Musk’s and Ramaswamy’s high-profile involvement. The agency's acronym, “DOGE,” has not gone unnoticed, drawing attention for its reference to the popular Dogecoin meme—a cryptocurrency Musk famously promoted.Announced on Tuesday, the Department of Government Efficiency was introduced as part of Trump’s broader “Save America” movement, with a mission to dismantle complex government structures and cut excessive regulations. According to Trump’s statement, Musk and Ramaswamy will focus on providing “advice and guidance from outside of Government,” collaborating with the White House and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to drive sweeping reforms.“A smaller, more efficient government with fewer bureaucratic hurdles is what America needs,” Trump said, emphasizing that the agency would aim to reduce wasteful government expenditures. He added that their efforts are timed to culminate on July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. This symbolic date, Trump noted, would mark a fitting moment for delivering a “more efficient government” to the American people.Trump’s timeline for the Department of Government Efficiency’s mission aligns with the United States’ 250th anniversary, giving the initiative historical importance. “A smaller Government, with more efficiency and less bureaucracy, will be the perfect gift to America on the 250th Anniversary of The Declaration of Independence,” Trump said. By setting this ambitious deadline, the President-elect signals the urgency with which he seeks to address inefficiencies and build a government that serves Americans with minimal excess.Elon Musk, who has previously expressed frustration with government regulations, shared his enthusiasm for the project. “The Department of Government Efficiency will send shockwaves through the system and target anyone involved in Government waste,” Musk said. Known for his innovative approach to technology and business, Musk’s involvement signals an unconventional approach to restructuring government processes.Ramaswamy, a successful biotech entrepreneur and political commentator, brings his own perspective to the table. He has often voiced support for reducing government overreach, stating that efficiency is key to rebuilding trust in the nation’s institutions. “Our approach will be transformative. We’ll address the core of excessive spending and create a streamlined system that focuses on results,” Ramaswamy remarked.The choice of the acronym “DOGE” has generated a great deal of online attention due to its association with the viral “Doge” meme and Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that Musk once helped bring to public awareness. Some have speculated that the acronym could be an intentional nod to the cryptocurrency community, further solidifying Musk’s brand as an unconventional leader in the public eye. While there is no official confirmation of a deliberate link to Dogecoin, Musk’s previous involvement in promoting the coin has made the acronym particularly memorable.The Trump campaign has likened this initiative to the historic “Manhattan Project,” a top-secret program during World War II that led to the development of the atomic bomb. Comparing the Department of Government Efficiency to a project of this scale underscores Trump’s emphasis on transforming government with the same level of urgency and innovation that defined the Manhattan Project. However, unlike its predecessor, this project aims to revitalize the structure of government rather than develop new weaponry. “It’s potentially the ‘Manhattan Project’ of our time,” stated a Trump campaign representative.The announcement has sparked various responses from government reform advocates, policy analysts, and the general public. While some have welcomed the effort to streamline government functions, others have expressed skepticism, questioning whether Musk and Ramaswamy can implement significant changes within the given timeline. Critics have pointed to the challenge of reshaping government structures from the outside and have raised concerns over accountability, given that Musk and Ramaswamy will operate as external advisors rather than taking formal government positions.Proponents argue that bringing in figures from the private sector could provide the fresh perspective necessary to dismantle entrenched bureaucratic processes. The White House and OMB are reportedly preparing to coordinate closely with Musk and Ramaswamy’s team to ensure that the department's work aligns with Trump’s broader administrative goals.The Department of Government Efficiency faces a challenging road ahead as it aims to reimagine and implement a leaner, more accountable government. With Musk and Ramaswamy’s leadership, the initiative seeks to bring an entrepreneurial mindset to federal operations, sparking innovations that have rarely been associated with government processes. Should this effort succeed, it could establish a new paradigm for the role of private-sector leaders in reforming public institutions.As the 250th anniversary of the United States approaches, the Department of Government Efficiency represents a commitment to celebrating this milestone with a promise of streamlined governance. If Musk and Ramaswamy achieve their ambitious goals, the Department may set a precedent for future reforms in how governments operate, marking a significant departure from traditional bureaucracy.","President-elect Donald Trump has announced the formation of a temporary agency, the Department of Government Efficiency.

Researchers at New Mexico Tech ’s Institute of Mining and Technology, located in Socorro, New Mexico, have embarked on an innovative project to create drones and robots modelled after deceased birds . These ""animatronic"" bird drones, currently still in the testing phase, aim to improve wildlife monitoring by providing a less intrusive, more natural way of studying birds and other animals. The project has gained attention for its unique approach to wildlife observation, and it addresses some of the limitations associated with traditional drone technology.The main goal of these bird-inspired drones is to observe wildlife without disturbing their natural behaviour. Traditional drones often make a lot of noise, which can frighten animals and cause them to flee. For instance, when monitoring large animals like elephants in Africa, the noise from drones can be loud enough to startle the animals, leading to them scattering or becoming stressed. By creating drones that mimic the appearance and movement of birds, the researchers aim to overcome this issue and observe animals in a more natural and discreet way.Mostafa Hassanalian, the lead researcher and mechanical engineering professor at New Mexico Tech, explained that these bird-like drones could be an important tool for studying animal behaviour, such as bird formations, communication, and other ecological dynamics. The ability to blend in with real wildlife means that these drones would be less likely to disrupt the animals they are meant to observe, allowing for more accurate and less biassed data collection.The research team has developed several prototypes of ""zombie birds,"" which are essentially robotic birds made from the preserved bodies of deceased animals. These robots are designed to replicate the appearance and movement of real birds in order to blend in with live wildlife. Here are the three main types of bird-like robots created so far:One of the prototypes is a drone equipped with flapping wings, designed to imitate a real bird’s flight. The researchers used a taxidermied pheasant’s head and wings to create the flapping-wing drone. This bird-like drone is intended to blend in with real pheasants and mimic their natural behaviour in the wild. By using taxidermied birds, the team ensures the drone has a realistic look and movement pattern that can be difficult to distinguish from living birds in the environment.In addition to the flapping-wing drone, the researchers have also developed two versions of robotic mallard ducks: one that can fly and another that can swim.This drone is modelled after the pheasant prototype, with a similar design that includes flapping wings. It is intended for observing birds in flight and studying their patterns and behaviours from the air.Unlike the flying version, this robot is designed to replicate the natural swimming movements of a mallard duck. It features special robotic feet that glide smoothly through water, allowing the robot to move in a way that mimics a real duck. This version is particularly useful for studying aquatic life and observing ducks and other waterfowl in their natural habitat.The team’s latest creation involves a stationary pigeon designed to look like a real bird but with the added capability of carrying a camera in its neck. This pigeon robot can provide real-time video feeds or broadcast footage, making it a valuable tool for remote surveillance or wildlife observation. The camera-equipped pigeon can be placed in natural environments, allowing researchers to monitor animal activity without the need for human presence, which could potentially disturb the ecosystem.One important aspect of this research is that all the birds used in these projects were already deceased before being repurposed. Hassanalian emphasised that they are not using live animals for this purpose, ensuring that no harm is done to wildlife. Instead, they are recycling birds that have already passed away, which makes the research more ethical and sustainable. This approach also highlights the potential of reusing materials that would otherwise go to waste, giving a new life to the preserved bodies of animals.While the current focus of the research is on improving wildlife monitoring, there are potential future applications for this technology, including in the field of surveillance. The ability to create lifelike, nature-inspired robots could make them useful in various areas where traditional drones might be too conspicuous or disruptive. For example, in surveillance applications, these ""zombie birds"" could be deployed to observe public spaces or areas with wildlife in a manner that is less intrusive and more unobtrusive.In the future, these robotic birds could also play a role in studying endangered species or remote ecosystems, where human presence might be limited or harmful to the environment. The technology could further evolve to incorporate more advanced sensors, autonomous navigation, and AI capabilities, enabling even more sophisticated forms of ecological research and surveillance.","Researchers at New Mexico Tech are developing drones and robots modelled after deceased birds. These ""animatronic"" bird drones aim to improve wildlife monitoring by providing a less intrusive, more natural way of studying birds and other animals. The main goal of these bird-inspired drones is to observe wildlife without disturbing their natural behaviour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115236797,imgsize-77996,width-400,resizemode-4/115236797.jpg"

Biggest technology IPO after Paytm

When can Swiggy employees sell their shares

Flipkart's $1.4-1.5 billion payout to employees

Swiggy’s IPO, scheduled to debut on November 13, is expected to create substantial wealth for its employees. The food and grocery delivery giant’s IPO is anticipated to be one of the largest wealth-generating events in India’s startup landscape,The IPO will unlock Rs 9,000 crore in employee stock options (ESOPs), marking a significant milestone in wealth creation. With this move, Swiggy is positioned as a major player in India’s startup ecosystem, following in the footsteps of companies like Flipkart.The company's ESOP payout will be among the top in India's startup scene, rivaling Walmart-owned Flipkart's massive $1.4-1.5 billion payout.Swiggy’s Rs 11,300-crore IPO would be the biggest technology company's public offering since the Paytm IPO in 2019. The issue was subscribed 3.6 times. Retail investors subscribed to their portion 1.14 times, while the portion reserved for employees saw 1.65x bidding. The stock is set to debut on November 13. Swiggy’s public issue was subscribed 3.59 times primarily driven by interest from institutional investors. The company had set a price band of Rs 371-390 apiece for the IPO.According to an Economic Times report, Swiggy founders and employees in the top management were allocated Esops worth nearly Rs 2,600 crore in its latest stock ownership plan. These include founder and group CEO Sriharsha Majety; cofounders Nandan Reddy and Phani Kishan Addepalli; chief financial officer Rahul Bothra; chief technology officer Madhusudhan Rao; food marketplace CEO Rohit Kapoor; and newly appointed CEO of Swiggy Instamart, Amitesh Jha.An exemption on the mandatory one-year lock-in period, secured by Swiggy from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in July this year means that employees are allowed to sell shares a month after the IPO.According to Swiggy’s prospectus, the company has rolled out three Esop plans so far—one each in 2015, 2021 and 2024. This aggregates to a pool of almost 230 million shares. Of these, 9 million options have been exercised into shares, while the remaining are yet to be exercised.Ecommerce major Flipkart has conducted Esop buybacks aggregating to $1.5 billion across various tranches over the years. In 2023, Flipkart made a one-time payout of $700 million to current and former employees as part of its separation from PhonePe, when the payments firm moved domicile from Singapore to India. Billed as one of the largest liquidity events for employees by a local internet firm, it topped the $500 million bonanza for employees when Walmart acquired Flipkart in 2018.","Swiggy’s Rs 11,300-crore IPO would be the biggest technology company's public offering since the Paytm IPO in 2019.

LG announces world's largest stretchable display: All details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/lg-announces-worlds-largest-stretchable-display-all-details/articleshow/115225209.cms,"What are stretchable displays



How this prototype is better than the previous one



LG’s largest-ever foldable display prototype is now official. The company announced the existence of the world's first stretchable display which is capable of expanding up to 50%. This is the highest rate of elongation in the foldable display industry. The Korean company demonstrated the panel during a meeting at LG Science Park in Seoul with more than 100 South Korean industry, academia, and research participants involved in a stretchable display national project.Stretchable displays are seen as the ultimate free-form foldable screen technology because they can be freely transformed into any shape. This includes stretching, folding and twisting. LG’s prototype features a 12-inch screen that stretches up to 18 inches, while simultaneously delivering a resolution of 100ppi (pixels per inch) and full red, green, and blue (RGB) colour.Earlier, in 2022, LG unveiled its first stretchable display prototype. However, the new panel's maximum elongation rate has more than doubled from 20% to 50%.The company said that it has improved the properties of a special silicon material substrate used in contact lenses and developed a new wiring design structure for the latest prototype. LG Display also claimed that this panel will offer more stretchability and flexibility, exceeding the original national project's target of 20% elongation.By using a micro-LED light source of up to 40μm (micrometres), the new prototype's strengthened durability means it can be repeatedly stretched over 10,000 times, maintaining clear image quality even in extreme environments such as exposure to low or high temperatures and external shocks, the company notes.The company also showcased numerous concepts where stretchable displays can be adopted, including an automotive panel that stretches out into a convex shape and can be operated by hand as well as a wearable display attached to firefighters' uniforms that provides real-time information.",LG Display has unveiled its largest-ever foldable display prototype.

YouTube’s latest update for Android may be buggy: What affected users claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/youtubes-latest-update-for-android-may-be-buggy-what-affected-users-claim/articleshow/115224332.cms,"What some users are saying about the bug

YouTube down for some users in India

YouTube app for Android recently got an update. Some users claim that the update has introduced frustrating bugs affecting playback and miniplayer functionality. The update, which rolled out on November 7, brought granular playback speed controls but also seems to have inadvertently introduced these glitches.As per a section of users, one bug is hampering the functionality of the miniplayer that disappears when positioned on the right side of the screen. They claim that the miniplayer exits the screen when dragged to the right edge, requiring them to tap the video thumbnail again to make it reappear, according to a report by Android Police.The second bug is said to be preventing video playback from resuming when the device is in portrait mode. Users have observed that after switching to full-screen landscape mode, pausing the video, and returning to portrait mode, playback cannot be resumed without returning to full-screen mode.While the exact cause of these bugs remains unclear, they appear to be linked to the latest update. For those affected by these bugs, rolling back to an older version of the YouTube app seems to provide a temporary solution.Meanwhile, YouTube users in India reportedly faced issues with the Google-owned video platform on the YouTube app as well as website. They claimed to be facing issues with the YouTube Play button. But the issue seems to have been resolved.According to DownDetector, approximately 56% of users experienced issues with video streaming, while 23% and 21% faced problems with server connection and the app, respectively. The issue with YouTube appears to be limited as most members of the Times of India Tech team did not report any problems with the YouTube app on Android and iOS or the website throughout the day.","YouTube app for Android recently got an update.

EU to Apple: “No company… should unjustly discriminate customers based on…”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/eu-to-apple-no-company-should-unjustly-discriminate-customers-based-on/articleshow/115223992.cms,"What the Commission has found

What next for Apple

The European Union (EU) has taken another action against Apple, ordering the tech giant to cease geo-blocking practices on its various media services, including the App Store, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.“Today, following a coordinated investigation at European level, the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network of national consumer authorities and the European Commission notified Apple of several potentially prohibited geo-blocking practices that the CPC Network has identified on certain Apple Media Services. The network requested Apple to align their practices with the EU's anti-geo-blocking rules,” said the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, in a statement.Geo-blocking refers to the practice of restricting access to content based on a user's location. The Commission identified several instances of potentially illegal geo-blocking on Apple's platforms and threatened enforcement action by national regulators if the company fails to comply.“We are stepping up the fight against geo-blocking. No company, big or small, should unjustly discriminate customers based on their nationality, place of residence or place of establishment,” said European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager .The CPC Network found a number of limitations on Apple Media Services, key elements of which are as follows:Online access: Apple Media Services have a different interface for different countries in the EU/EEA. In the app version of these services, consumers are only allowed to access the interface made for the country where they have registered their Apple account and face significant challenges when attempting to change this, which is not allowed under EU's anti-geo-blocking rules.Payment methods: When making paid purchases on Apple Media Services, consumers are only allowed to use means of payment (such as a credit/debit card) issued in the country where they registered their Apple account.Downloading: Since the App Store does not allow consumers to access the version of another EU/EEA country, consumers are not allowed to download the apps offered in other countries. Consumers should be able to download apps offered in other EU/EEA countries when they travel to or temporarily stay in that country.Apple now has one month to reply to the CPC Network's findings and propose commitments that will address the identified geo-blocking practices. Depending on Apple's reply, the CPC Network may enter into a dialogue with the company.","The EU has ordered Apple to cease geo-blocking practices on its various media services, including the App Store, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.

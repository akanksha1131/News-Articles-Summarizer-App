Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky expressed interest in integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the travel platform but noted that the technology isn’t yet up to par. Speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” recently, Chesky said the current software development kit “wasn’t quite robust enough for the things we want to do. ” Said to be a close friend of OpenAI founder Sam Altman , Chesky added that Airbnb would “probably” incorporate ChatGPT in the future.Airbnb already leverages 13 AI models, including those from OpenAI and Google, to power its service bot. However, Chesky’s remarks underscored a growing trend: open-source AI models, which developers can customize, are gaining ground against proprietary systems like OpenAI’s. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and DeepSeek are driving this shift, releasing advanced, cost-effective open-source AI systems. At Alibaba’s recent Apsara conference, the company reported hosting over 300 open-source AI models, supporting more than 170,000 derivative models, making it the world’s largest open-source AI ecosystem.Alibaba’s Qwen 3 series, launched in May, supports over 100 languages, earning praise for its natural multilingual capabilities. In a report by South China Morning Post, Nicolas de Cameret, founder of BotBot Robotics, called Qwen’s models the best for such applications.Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai argued that AI success hinges on rapid adoption, not just building the most powerful models. He contrasted China’s focus on affordable, open-source AI with the U.S.’s heavy investments in trillion-parameter models, suggesting China’s approach fosters faster global uptake.To date, Alibaba has released more than 300 open-source AI models that underpin over 170,000 derivative models, making it the world’s largest open-source AI ecosystem, according to data reportedly released during the company’s annual Apsara conference late last month.",Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky expressed interest in integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the travel platform.

US senator sends letter to FCC to ban China's two biggest drone makers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-senator-sends-letter-to-fcc-to-ban-chinas-two-biggest-drone-makers/articleshow/124770136.cms,"Representative Image

What new FCC rules may mean for DJI and Autel Robotics





Florida Senator Rick Scott is reportedly intensifying pressure on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to crack down on Chinese drone giant DJI and other companies as the agency prepares to vote on a proposal granting it authority to revoke certifications for devices deemed national security risks. In a letter sent this week to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, Scott called for “swift and decisive” action against DJI and Autel Robotics, two Chinese drone manufacturers he accuses of exploiting regulatory loopholes.According to a report in DroneDJ, the FCC’s forthcoming vote, expected within days, would allow the agency to block new authorizations for companies on its “Covered List,” which includes firms like Huawei and Hikvision, and retroactively revoke approvals for previously certified devices. Scott praised the move as a critical step to strengthen U.S. supply chain security, alleging that DJI has evaded oversight by creating shell companies, such as Lyno Dynamics, whose FCC filings reportedly feature DJI’s logos.“This initiative closes regulatory gaps and protects our national security,” Scott wrote, urging the FCC to rescind existing certifications for DJI and Autel devices and block new licenses for products containing their components or software.He also called for stricter corporate disclosure rules to prevent companies from masking ownership.The proposed FCC rule could have far-reaching implications for DJI, which dominates over 70% of the global consumer drone market. If certifications are revoked, DJI would be unable to import, market, or sell new drones in the U.S., and retailers could not restock products or parts. While existing drones would remain operational, the company’s U.S. business could grind to a halt, potentially turning its devices into rare commodities.The push comes as the Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act mandates a national security review of DJI by December 23, 2025. A failure to clear the review could automatically place DJI on the FCC’s Covered List, further restricting its operations. The Pentagon has already labeled DJI a “Chinese military company,” and several federal agencies have restricted its use.DJI has consistently denied posing a security threat or sharing data with the Chinese government, emphasizing privacy features that allow users to keep flight data offline. However, bipartisan support for tougher measures, led by figures like Scott and FCC Chairman Carr, signals growing skepticism in Washington. Carr described the FCC’s proposal as a “long-standing, bipartisan effort” to block “foreign adversary-controlled devices” from the U.S. market.Despite the political storm, DJI drones remain popular with U.S. consumers. The DJI Mini 4K, a budget-friendly model, is currently discounted 20% for Amazon Prime members, underscoring strong demand even as the company faces an uncertain future in the U.S. As tensions over U.S.-China tech restrictions escalate, the FCC’s decision could reshape the American drone market and determine whether DJI’s products continue to soar—or are grounded for good.","Florida Senator Rick Scott is intensifying pressure on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to crack down on Chinese drone giant DJI.

Microsoft AI CEO makes it clear: It is ChatGPT Atlas rival





AI Browser race is heating up. Just two days after OpenAI 's announcement of ChatGPT Atlas, Microsoft has launched a suite of new features for its AI assistant. This includes an ambitious project that builds artificial intelligence directly into one of its most central products -- Microsoft CoPilot. The new CoPilot Mode in Microsoft Edge goes beyond just being a browser extension and is said to be Microsoft’s take on AI browser category — an intelligent and flexible AI assistant that follows you as you browse the web.Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI, even described the new product in those terms in the announcement. “Copilot Mode in Edge is evolving into an AI browser that is your dynamic, intelligent companion,” Suleyman wrote in the announcement post. “With your permission, Copilot can see and reason over your open tabs, summarize and compare information, and even take actions like booking a hotel or filling out forms. ”Microsoft's announcement comes just two days after OpenAI introduced its Atlas browser, sparking comparisons due to their striking visual and functional similarities. While Copilot Mode features a darker background, text instead of a logo, and Windows-style interface elements, it closely resembles Atlas in design.Both integrate a chatbot into the “new tab” screen, though Copilot opts for a full-tab “ride-along” function rather than a split-screen approach.Industry observers note that browser design constraints may explain the similarities, as clean interfaces leave limited room for variation. The real distinction lies in the underlying AI models powering each browser, which will likely define the user experience.Microsoft’s release, planned for weeks and likely in development for months, coincides with a heated AI race between the two companies, or should we say 'Frenemies'. The near-simultaneous launches underscore the competitive tension between Microsoft and OpenAI, despite neither inventing the AI browser concept. As both companies vie for dominance, this week’s dual announcements signal a new chapter in AI-driven web browsing.",Microsoft launches CoPilot Mode in its Edge browser.

Spotify confirms Android app freezing issue; here’s how you can avoid it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotify-confirms-android-app-freezing-issue-heres-how-you-can-avoid-it/articleshow/124767103.cms,"“We've received reports from Android users (mainly Samsung and Google Pixel) experiencing issues where the Spotify app becomes unresponsive, freezes, or crashes when connected to certain WiFi networks.

The issue doesn't occur while using mobile data.""

How this Spotify issue is affecting Android users







Spotify has acknowledged that its Android app is freezing and crashing for certain users when connected to Wi-Fi and confirmed that a fix is in development. In a response to the community, the music streaming company said:The problem primarily affects Samsung and Google Pixel devices; however, the app functions normally when users switch to mobile data. According to a report by 9to5Google, reports across Spotify's community forums suggest that the app becomes unresponsive shortly after connecting to Wi-Fi.Many users reported a pattern in which the app opens briefly, freezes, and then crashes. Some Reddit users note that playback resumes when Wi-Fi is turned off or when switching to a different network, suggesting the problem may be linked to specific routers or configurations.Reports indicate the issue has been affecting users for nearly two weeks before Spotify acknowledged it. While the company stated that its engineering teams are investigating the problem, it has not provided a timeline for a fix.The bug appears limited to certain Android devices and specific Wi-Fi setups. Some users have speculated that the problem could be linked to Chromecast-ready devices on the same network. This might explain why the crashes occur when connected to Wi-Fi, but not when using mobile data or offline mode.Users have reported that standard troubleshooting methods, such as clearing the cache or reinstalling the app, have not resolved the problem. Until a patch is released, users can try switching to mobile data or temporarily disabling Wi-Fi while streaming. Another temporary fix option is to roll back to an earlier app version from a couple of weeks ago.","Spotify's Android app is freezing and crashing for certain users when connected to Wi-Fi.

""prompt injection,""

What cybersecurity experts said about new ChatGPT Atlas browser



“There will always be some residual risks around prompt injections because that’s just the nature of systems that interpret natural language and execute actions. In the security world, it’s a bit of a cat-and-mouse game, so we can expect to see other vulnerabilities emerge.”

“The main risk is that it collapses the boundary between the data and the instructions: it could turn an AI agent in a browser from a helpful tool to a potential attack vector against the user. So it can go and extract all of your emails and steal your personal data from work, or it can log into your Facebook account and steal your messages, or extract all of your passwords, so you’ve given the agent unfiltered access to all of your accounts,”

What OpenAI said about ChatGPT Atlas browser’s security



“Our long-term goal is that you should be able to trust ChatGPT agent to use your browser, the same way you’d trust your most competent, trustworthy, and security-aware colleague or friend.

For this launch, we’ve performed extensive red-teaming, implemented novel model training techniques to reward the model for ignoring malicious instructions, implemented overlapping guardrails and safety measures, and added new systems to detect and block such attacks.

However, prompt injection remains a frontier, unsolved security problem, and our adversaries will spend significant time and resources to find ways to make ChatGPT agents fall for these attacks,”

“logged out mode”

“Watch Mode”

“browser memories”





Cybersecurity experts have warned that OpenAI 's new ChatGPT Atlas browser could be vulnerable to attacks. Hackers can use this security flaw to turn AI assistants against users, potentially enabling theft of sensitive data or unauthorised access to bank accounts, experts claimed. The primary concern isa type of attack in which malicious instructions are fed to an AI system to make it behave in unintended ways, such as revealing sensitive information or performing harmful actions. Experts also said that all current AI browsers pose these security risks. OpenAI launched Atlas this week as an AI browser designed to help users execute tasks across the internet and search for answers.In a statement to Fortune, George Chalhoub, assistant professor at UCL Interaction Centre said:AI browsers face a security risk because they may not correctly distinguish user-generated prompts from content on untrusted websites. This allows attackers to create webpages containing hidden instructions that can trick the browser into performing actions such as opening the user’s email and exporting data.Some attackers may hide these commands using techniques like white text on a white background or embedding code within the site, making them difficult for users to notice but readable by the AI browser.Chalhoub explained.In a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Dane Stuckey, OpenAI’s Chief Information Security Officer, said that the company was “very thoughtfully researching and mitigating” the risks associated with prompt injections.Stuckey wrote.Stuckey said OpenAI had introduced multiple measures to reduce risks and safeguard users, including rapid-response systems to block attacks, ongoing investment in research and security, and features such asandto enhance user control and safety.The ChatGPT Atlas browser is designed to make web browsing more interactive and assistive. It lets users search for information, plan trips, and book services directly through ChatGPT. The browser includesto remember user preferences and an experimental “agent mode” that allows ChatGPT to browse and interact with websites on the user’s behalf.","ChatGPT Atlas browser is designed to make web browsing more interactive and assistive.

Building a new identity beyond the meme





Sam Sung's Apple business card went viral in 2012, sparking panic that nearly cost him his peace of mind. Over a decade later, he's Sam Struan—but wishes he'd handled the moment differently. Sam Struan, now 36, was working at an Apple retail store in Vancouver when someone posted a photo of his business card on Reddit. The name ""Sam Sung"" at an Apple Store became an instant internet sensation, and Struan thought his career was over.""I was so scared, and I just wanted to keep my head down and stay employed,"" Struan told Business Insider in a recent interview. When Apple called asking if he knew about the viral post, his first thought was termination—not the job security he actually had.Apple's response was swift but protective. The company pulled Struan off the sales floor after a reporter approached him at work. Colleagues were instructed not to identify him when customers came asking for ""Sam Sung,"" and his business cards were confiscated.For months, Struan played along with the ruse, pretending to be someone else when customers inquired. His Scottish accent helped mask his identity over the phone.The joke eventually faded, but the damage to his sense of security lingered.In 2013, Struan left Apple to pursue recruitment work. The following year, he auctioned his old business card and uniform pieces for charity, raising over $2,500 for Children's Wish. But the viral fame—or infamy—continued to shadow his professional life.Business Insider reports that Struan ultimately changed his surname to escape being defined as ""an internet joke."" He chose Struan, named after a village on Scotland's Isle of Skye. The decision also addressed practical concerns: all desirable social media handles were taken by Samsung , and research shows non-anglicised names can affect job opportunities.Today, Struan works as a consultant and résumé writer in Glasgow. While he doesn't regret the name change, he has one wish: ""I wish I could tell my younger self to see it as a funny thing...and enjoyed it for what it was.""","Sam Sung's Apple business card went viral in 2012.

GM compares CarPlay removal to Apple 's disk drive decision

Automaker prioritises data Control over customer preference





General Motors is expanding its controversial decision to eliminate Apple CarPlay and Android Auto from all future vehicles, including gas-powered cars, not just electric models. GM CEO Mary Barra confirmed the company-wide strategy during an interview on The Verge's Decoder podcast.The automaker initially dropped CarPlay support from its 2024 electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Cadillac Lyriq, sparking customer backlash. Now, Barra says the phase-out will follow each vehicle's refresh cycle across GM's 40-model portfolio. When asked if new gas cars would lack smartphone projection, Barra responded: ""As we get to a major rollout, I think that's the right expectation. Yes.""GM Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson defended the move by invoking Apple's late co-founder. ""It's a very Jobsian approach to things,"" Anderson told The Verge's podcast. He compared removing CarPlay to Steve Jobs eliminating disk drives despite user complaints, arguing flash storage proved superior.Anderson claimed GM's proprietary infotainment system offers a ""much more immersive environment"" with better integration for features like charging infrastructure and Super Cruise.He likened using CarPlay to phone mirroring on a laptop—unnecessary when native solutions exist.The strategy centers on GM's new centralised computing platform launching in 2028, which will unify software across Chevrolet, GMC, Buick, and Cadillac brands. The Android-based system will include Google's Gemini assistant for voice commands.Industry observers note the move allows GM to control customer data, software updates, and potential subscription services—revenue streams worth billions annually by 2030. Barra emphasised GM maintains ""good relationships"" with Apple and will add Apple Wallet support for car keys, though Apple Music integration remains unconfirmed.The decision risks alienating customers in a market where CarPlay is available in roughly 80% of new US vehicles, according to S&P Global data.",GM CEO Mary Barra confirmed the company-wide strategy during an interview on The Verge's Decoder podcast.

Real-world lessons over instant gratification







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has an important and surprising piece of advice for young people who are dreaming of entrepreneurial success. Bezos said ‘Go work at McDonald’s.’ As reported by Fortune, in a recent interview, Bezos stressed on the importance of early work experience especially in the fast-paced, customer-facing environment. “I always advise young people: Go work at McDonald’s,” Bezos said. “You learn responsibility. You learn how to show up. You learn how to deal with people. You learn how to hustle.”For those unaware, Bezos started Amazon out of his garage in 1994. He believes that entry-level jobs such as those at McDonald’s tech foundational skills which are important for long term success. He emphasised that such small roles are necessary as they instill skill like discipline, resilience and the ability to handle pressure. These are the traits that many Gen Z entrepreneurs may overlook in their rush to build startups.The comments by Bezos come at a time when debate is growing over the value of traditional work experience versus the allure of instant digital success. With platforms like TikTok and YouTube offering rapid fame and monetization, Bezos’ advice serves as a reminder that grit and consistency still matter.Jeff Bezos also stressed that the working environments like McDonald’s exposes Gratification.

Google expands AI infrastructure and data centres

Strengthening Belgium’s digital future

AI’s potential for economic growth





US tech giant Google has announced plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network, creating hundreds of new jobs and supporting local economic growth. The investment will focus on the company’s existing Saint-Ghislain site and the new Farciennes campus, with construction already underway. Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade. Most jobs are expected to be supported or improved by AI, with only a small portion at risk of automation. By expanding AI infrastructure, Google aims to equip Belgian companies and the workforce with advanced digital tools while fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. The investment positions Belgium as a hub for next-generation AI innovation in Europe. It also signals Google’s commitment to combining technological advancement with environmental responsibility, shaping the future of digital and green growth.","Google plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network.

In an emotional response on X, Vembu dedicated the moment to engineers who chose to work from India despite opportunities abroad.""Thank you Sir, for your faith in us. I dedicate this moment to our hard-working engineers who have toiled hard in Zoho for over 20 years. They all stayed in India and worked all these years because they believed. Their faith is vindicated. Jai Hind, Jai Bharat,"" Vembu wrote.Shah's announcement came as a significant endorsement for the Chennai-based tech company. Sharing his new email address—amitshah.bjp@zohomail.in—on social media, the Home Minister requested all future correspondence be directed to his Zoho account, marking a symbolic shift away from global platforms like Gmail and Outlook.The move aligns with the government's broader push for digital sovereignty.

Prioritisation is the key: Srinivas





The 80% solution for product growth









Aravind Srinivas, co-founder and Desi CEO of the AI startup Perplexity, has identified the most critical quality for leading a company. In a recent interview, Srinivas said that the ability to learn and “make peace with some problems” and “pick the number one thing” to tackle issues is key to survival and growth in the fast-paced AI sector.Srinivas recently shared vital lessons from his time running Perplexity, including his strategies for product development and engaging with investors at the Dean's Speaker Series at UC Berkeley Haas.Srinivas emphasised that accepting unresolved issues as part of the entrepreneurial journey is essential. The biggest skill a CEO or founder needs, he stressed, is clear prioritisation.“Anytime you ask someone, 'What are you doing, what is the one problem you're looking at, or, 'What are your priorities for this week?', they will have a bucket list of like five to 10 things to say,” Srinivas said.“And then, I asked them, 'OK, what is the number one thing?' And they can't say it... And I think that is the number one skill you need as a CEO or a founder is anytime you need to pick the number one thing,"" Srinivas added.This mindset of embracing imperfection permeates Perplexity's approach to product development, which aims to launch solutions that are about 80% finished. This strategy allows the firm to adapt quickly to the rapidly evolving AI landscape.Srinivas explained that a product cannot be launched at 60% completion, as user retention would plummet. Instead, a sweet spot must be found:“You have to build products that 80% work. It cannot be 60% because no one's going to use it... You have to build 80% perfect products where there is a long tail of 20% that kind of doesn't work, but that 80% is enough for users to get excited about it,” he explained.He concluded that this flexible strategy is the path to winning the market, allowing the company to continuously iterate: ""Six months from now, that 80/20 goes to 90/10, and 12 months from now, it goes to 95/5. And that's how you win the market one or two years from now.""","Aravind Srinivas, co-founder and Desi CEO of the AI startup Perplexity, has identified the most critical quality for leading a company.

How things changed under Microsoft CFO Amy Hood







Microsoft is reportedly demanding much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. According to a report by Bloomberg, the tech giant has set a tough new goal: Xbox must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations. This target, implemented in fall 2023, is significantly higher than what most game companies achieve and has forced Xbox to make difficult decisions about its future, the report noted.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. Xbox itself has historically operated between 10% and 20% profit margins over the past six years. Court documents from 2023 showed Microsoft's gaming business had just a 12% profit margin for the first nine months of fiscal year 2022.Previously, game developers at Xbox weren't given specific profit targets to hit. Instead, they were told to focus on creating the best possible games without worrying too much about the financial side. This approach allowed creative teams more freedom to take risks and experiment, the report noted.That changed when Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target. Her finance team has taken a much larger role in gaming decisions over the past two years, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the business.Microsoft's stricter profit demands come at a challenging time for the gaming industry overall. Development costs have skyrocketed as games become more complex and visually impressive, while players have become more selective about which games they buy and play.","Microsoft is reportedly demanding much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry.

WhatsApp Makes Group Calls Smarter

MAX app part of Russia's 'Sovereign Internet'

Russia restricting WhatsApp and Telegram





Russia wants everyone in the country to download the Superapp: MAX. The state-backed messaging app -- MAX -- is said to be designed to serve as a comprehensive ""Superapp."" Launched as part of a broader initiative to foster domestic technology, MAX aims to consolidate everyday digital needs into a single platform, much like global counterparts such as WeChat and WhatsApp. Russian government is said to be aggressively promoting the app across billboards, schools, and preloaded on new cellphones.More than 45 million people have created MAX accounts, equivalent to nearly a third of the Russian population, the app’s parent company said recently. On average, the company said, 18 million people have been using the MAX app daily.Launched in March, MAX can only be installed using Russian or Belarusian phone numbers, with virtual SIM cards blocked and registration from other countries not possible. This effectively means that Russians abroad cannot communicate with family and friends unless they have a Russian or Belarusian number.In August, the Russian government said in a statement that MAX, which will be integrated with government services, would be on a list of mandatory pre-installed apps on all ""gadgets,"" including mobile phones and tablets, sold in Russia from September 1.The rollout of the new “super app” is reported to be the latest step by President Vladimir Putin to tighten control over internet in Russia.Putin, analysts say, is pushing to move Russians to what Moscow calls a “sovereign internet,” an online world cut off from Western technology. A Russian-language TV app called LIME HD TV, which allows people to watch state TV channels for free, will be also pre-installed on all smart TVs sold in Russia from January 1, 2026.The push to promote homegrown apps comes after Russia said that it has started restricting some calls on WhatsApp and Telegram, accusing the foreign-owned platforms of failing to share information with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases.WhatsApp, which in July had a reach of 97.3 million in Russia, responded by accusing Moscow of trying to block Russians from accessing secure communications, while Telegram, which had a reach of 90.8 million users, said it actively combats the harmful use of its platform. The third most popular messenger app in July, according to Mediascope data, was VK Messenger at 17.9 million people. The app is from the same state-controlled tech company VK which has developed MAX.Russian Government: MAX has less access to user data than WhatsApp and TelegramState media says accusations from Kremlin critics that MAX is a spying app are false and that it has fewer permissions to access user data than rivals WhatsApp and Telegram.","MAX aims to consolidate everyday digital needs into a single platform.

Nokia posts growth in latest quarter results







Nokia CEO Justin Hotard has drawn parallels between the current AI investment frenzy and the internet boom of the 1990s. Despite mounting concerns over a potential bubble, Hotard believes the foundational shift driven by AI is here to stay. His comments came as the Finnish tech giant reported €435 million ($505 million) in adjusted operating profit for the quarter.“I fundamentally think we're at the front end of an AI supercycle, much like the 1990s with the internet,” Hotard told news agency Reuters in an interview.“Even if there's a bubble, a trough, we'll look to the longer-term trends. And right now, all those trends are very favourable,” he added.Hotard's comments arrive amid a growing debate over the sustainability of AI investment. A recent Bank of America survey showed that over half of fund managers believe AI stocks are currently in a bubble, and figures like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have also cautioned that investor excitement could lead to major losses.However, Hotard, who previously led Intel's data centers and AI group before joining Nokia in April, points to surging demand for the infrastructure. Companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google , among others are racing to build out the data centres necessary to support AI processing power.“Clearly the incremental, growth investment is driven by data centres. It's a huge step up in volume,” he said.Nokia is witnessing growth “across the board,” from massive tech firms to smaller players expanding in Europe. The Finnish telecom equipment maker recently beat market expectations with its quarterly earnings, a performance boosted by strong optical and cloud demand, including sales to AI-driven data centers following its acquisition of US optical networking firm Infinera last year.","Nokia CEO Justin Hotard says AI investment is here to stay.

A trio of Europe’s aerospace giants are merging their space businesses to create a regional unit capable of competing with Elon Musk-owned SpaceX ’s Starlink satellite cluster. Airbus, Leonardo and Thales have announced that they have signed a memorandum of understanding to combine their space operations, promising ""significant synergies"" and cost savings in the ""mid-triple-digit millions"" of euros in operating income within five years of the merger's completion.According to a report by The Financial Times, this move comes as European space companies struggle to respond to market shifts driven by SpaceX's rapid expansion of its Starlink communications satellite constellation in low Earth orbit (LEO).By consolidating their space divisions, the three European aerospace leaders aim to create a more efficient organisation better equipped to navigate the transformed market landscape.The combined entity will encompass satellite manufacturing, space systems, components and services, employing approximately 25,000 people worldwide. The new company will reportedly generate annual revenue of around 6.5 billion euros.When it comes to ownership, it will be distributed among the parent companies, with Airbus holding 35%, while Leonardo and Thales each control 32.5% stakes. The governance structure for the joint venture will be announced at a later date.The merger still requires regulatory clearance from competition authorities. The companies expect the new entity to become operational by 2027, assuming approvals proceed smoothly. Negotiations with labor unions will now commence to merge the operations.Guillaume Faury, chief executive of Airbus, Roberto Cingolani, chief executive of Leonardo, and Patrice Caine, chief executive of Thales, issued a joint statement calling the creation of the new European space champion ""a pivotal milestone for Europe's space industry.""“By pooling our talent, resources, expertise and R&D capabilities, we aim to generate growth, accelerate innovation and deliver greater value to our customers and stakeholders,” the executives said.","Airbus, Leonardo and Thales have announced that they have signed a memorandum of understanding to combine their space operations.

As per the report, the Iraq government further said that the content on Roblox was ""incompatible with social values and traditions"".The Iraqi communications ministry, according to the report, said the nationwide ban was based on a comprehensive study and field monitoring which found that ""the game involves several security, social, and behavioural risks"".Roblox denies the allegations. In its defence, said that safety was its top priority and it wanted to work with the government to restore access.The Reuters report quotes a Roblox spokesperson who said:“We strongly contest recent claims made by the Iraqi authorities, which we believe to be based on an outdated understanding of our platform”Earlier this year, Roblox temporarily suspended certain communication features such as in-game chat for users in Arabic speaking countries, including Iraq, the spokesperson added.With the ban, Iraq has joined other countries that have already banned the video game platform. Several Middle East countries have tightened regulation of online gaming and interactive platforms over child safety and moral concerns in the past. These includeTurkey blocked access to Roblox in August 2024. It also cited child abuse risks as the reason behind the ban.Roblox is also facing a lawsuit in Louisiana, accusing the platform of exposing children to explicit content and failing to protect them from predators. Further, a 12-year-old girl in Canada has also sued Roblox, alleging it is designed with features and gameplay elements that are ""addictive, manipulative and financially exploitative.""",Iraq has banned video game platform Roblox due to child safety concerns.

Dutch chipmaker Nexperia's Chinese unit resumes supply: One condition that may have ‘solved’ matter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dutch-chipmaker-nexperias-chinese-unit-resumes-supply-one-condition-that-may-have-solved-matter/articleshow/124761063.cms,"Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Payments in Yuan and growing independence







The Chinese subsidiary of Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has reportedly resumed supplying semiconductors to local distributors, ending a halt in shipments which was triggered by a recent ownership dispute and a Chinese export ban. However, the normalcy in operations comes with a major condition that signals a move toward greater autonomy for the Chinese unit, the report added.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the temporary halt on shipments – imposed after Beijing blocked Nexperia from exporting chips on October 4 – has now partially lifted for domestic trade. The company reportedly said that all domestic sales must now be settled exclusively in Chinese yuan. Previously, transactions were conducted using foreign currencies, such as the US dollar.Citing sources briefed on the matter, the news agency said that the requirement for yuan settlement—confined only to domestic sales—is intended to help the Chinese subsidiary stabilise local supply and operate more independently from its Dutch parent. The unit has reportedly instructed its distributors to also conduct subsequent transactions with their customers only in yuan.This development follows the Dutch government seizing control of Nexperia on September 30 and removing its Chinese CEO, Zhang Xuezheng. The move was made over concerns that Nexperia's technology could be misappropriated by its Chinese parent company, Wingtech Technology.The rift is showing few signs of a quick resolution, the report said, adding that Nexperia, now under Dutch government control, is seeking alternative packaging partners outside China. Furthermore, Nexperia has issued a warning to customers in China that it cannot guarantee the quality of products sourced from its Chinese subsidiary.A Nexperia spokesperson said the company had informed customers of potential risks but stopped short of advising them not to purchase the chips.In a strongly worded response on its WeChat account, the Chinese unit confirmed it was operating independently and that its “manufacturing and business activities are proceeding in an orderly manner.”","Chinese subsidiary of Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has reportedly resumed supplying semiconductors to local distributors.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made a new prediction about the Optimus humanoid robot. During the EV maker’s latest earnings call, Musk said the robot, which could become its largest product, will be able to perform surgical procedures. He also noted that, combined with autonomous driving technology, the company can enable widespread access to medical care and reduce poverty using the Optimus robot. Musk also confirmed Tesla’s plans to demonstrate a new version of the robot, called V3, in the first quarter of 2026. Optimus is Tesla's bipedal humanoid robot currently in development. The product has not yet been commercially deployed. However, Musk has also previously stated that the robots could function as factory workers or childcare assistants.Instead of focusing on financial performance, Musk spoke about Tesla’s long-term vision centred on autonomous vehicles at the earnings call.Musk noted.Musk has continued to express confidence in Tesla’s ability to turn its cars into self-driving vehicles capable of generating income for their owners. However, while companies like Alphabet’s Waymo and Baidu’s Apollo Go have expanded their commercial robotaxi operations, Tesla remains limited to a few pilot programs.In July, Musk had said Tesla’s autonomous ride-hailing would be available toHoweverthe company has yet to sell cars that can operate safely without human supervision.Musk also said Tesla would have its robotaxi service operating without human drivers in Austin by the end of the year and that it would be running in eight to 10 cities by the close of 2025, at least with drivers on board.As for its current fleet of cars, finance chief Vaibhav Taneja said on the call that the customer base for FSD Supervised, Tesla’s partially automated driving system,with 12% of users paying for the system. Taneja didn’t offer an average sale price that subscribers are paying after Tesla ran several promotions to drive uptake.Tesla said in its investor deck that FSD revenue was lower than in the year-ago period, when the figure was $326 million.

What Tom Mueller wrote about the company's Moon ambitions





Tom Mueller, SpaceX ’s first employee and famous propulsion engineer, is setting his sights on the Moon with his company, Impulse Space. The founder and CEO recently unveiled plans to develop a lunar lander capable of delivering up to three tons of cargo to the lunar surface, carving out a new niche in lunar exploration distinct from his former employer, Elon Musk-owned SpaceX, Mars-focused ambitions. Mueller, credited with designing SpaceX’s Draco, Merlin, and SuperDraco engines, left the company in 2021 to launch Impulse Space.The company already operates a dishwasher-sized space tug called Mira, which reached space for the first time on SpaceX's Transporter 9 rideshare mission in November 2023.In a recent blog post, Mueller outlined Impulse’s vision to fill a gap in NASA ’s lunar programs. While NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) focuses on small payloads and the Human Landing System (HLS) targets crewed missions, Impulse’s lander would offer a midsized option, handling payloads from 0.5 to 13 tons. This capability could serve scientific missions, commercial ventures, or resource exploration. Mueller projects that Impulse Space could begin lunar missions as early as 2028, using its Helios kick stage and lander technology. The announcement marks a bold step for the company, positioning it as a key player in the growing lunar economy. “SpaceX sees the Moon as a distraction from Mars,” Mueller noted in his post.“We see it as an opportunity to make reliable lunar access a reality.”""To echo President John F. Kennedy, going to the moon is hard. But we know that we have some of the brightest minds in aerospace engineering here at Impulse, who push the boundaries of innovation forward every day,"" Mueller wrote in a blog post on Tuesday that laid out Impulse's lunar vision.

Huang says HR work will go digital



Salesforce and Anthropic CEOs also talked about Agentic AI







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has predicted a shift in the workforce of the corporate world. According to the tech executive, in future, artificial intelligence (AI) agents will work alongside human employees as well as go through formal hiring and onboarding processes to absorb a company's culture. He has estimated the potential market for new, ""agentic"" AI workforce may be worth trillions of dollars.In a recent interview with Citadel Securities, Huang said that he envisions a future workforce populated by digital nurses, accountants, lawyers and marketers.“I wouldn’t be surprised if you license some and you hire some, depending on the quality and depending on the deep expertise. So future workforces in enterprise will be a combination of humans and digital humans,” Huang stated.Huang detailed the integration of these new digital hires, suggesting they will need to be properly introduced to the company's culture, philosophies, and practices—just like human employees.“I tell my CIO, our company’s IT department, they’re going to be the HR department of agentic AI in the future,” he said.“And those digital employees are going to work with our biological ones, and that’s going to be the shape of our company in the future,” the CEO added.These AI workers could come from various platforms, with Huang name-checking providers like OpenAI, Harvey, OpenEvidence, Cursor, Replit, and Lovable. Other AI agents may be homegrown; Nvidia, for example, already employs significantly more cybersecurity AI agents than human staff to safeguard proprietary knowledge and data.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff stated at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland that he and many of his peers would be the last cohort of executives to lead all-human workforces.“From this point forward… we will be managing not only human workers but also digital workers,” Benioff affirmed. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, meanwhile, predicted that by as early as 2026 or 2027, AI systems will be “better than almost all humans at almost all things.”","Huang says HR work will go digital in the future.

However, TBD Labs—the elite division housing Meta's high-profile AI recruits hired over the summer—remained untouched, underscoring CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's bet on expensive new talent over legacy teams.Despite the layoffs, Wang emphasised that Meta remains committed to aggressive AI spending. ""This by no means signals any decrease in investment. In fact, we will continue to hire industry-leading AI-native talent,"" he stated in the memo seen by Axios.The company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars recruiting engineers and researchers from OpenAI , Google DeepMind, and Apple following its $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI and Wang's June hiring.Meta Superintelligence Labs now employs just under 3,000 people after the cuts.Sources told CNBC that Meta's AI unit had become bloated, with teams like FAIR and product-oriented groups competing for computing resources.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has confirmed that the company’s upcoming artificial intelligence chip, called AI5, will be produced by Samsung in Texas and TSMC in Arizona. Speaking during Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call on October 22, Musk said the company aims to produce more chips than it currently needs.“Our goal is to have an oversupply of AI5 chips,” the tech billioniare said, adding that any extra chips not used in Tesla cars or robots will be deployed in the company’s data centers.Tesla had earlier used Nvidia’s Drive chips in its vehicles but switched to its own processors in 2019. During the earnings call, Musk clarified that Tesla will still rely on Nvidia’s GPUs for AI model training, saying, “We’re not replacing Nvidia, but we use both in combination.” He revealed that Tesla now has computing power equal to 81,000 Nvidia H100 chips.The AI5 chip, first announced in 2024, is the latest version of Tesla’s Autopilot hardware, designed to handle data for self-driving functions. In July, Samsung revealed a $16.5 billion chip contract with an unnamed client—later confirmed to be Tesla. Musk also mentioned that the next-generation AI6 chip will be produced by Samsung.The decision to split AI5 production between Samsung and TSMC reflects Tesla’s effort to strengthen its U.S.-based chip supply chain. The chip will be smaller than most existing AI designs, using what Musk described as a “half-reticle” size, unlike the larger chips made by Nvidia and AMD.Elon Musk said Tesla’s in-house chip design allows the team to simplify and optimize performance. “Tesla only has to satisfy one customer—ourselves. That makes the design job radically easier,” he said.He added that Tesla engineers removed older components such as GPUs and signal processors from the AI5, which could give it “the best performance per dollar for AI—maybe by a factor of 10.”The move places Tesla alongside tech giants like Google , Amazon , and Microsoft, all of whom are developing their own AI chips to reduce dependence on Nvidia. Apart from Tesla, only Apple currently designs its own silicon for both devices and data centers.Meanwhile, Musk’s AI startup xAI, which works closely with Tesla, continues to be a major Nvidia customer. The company is building a new supercomputing center in Memphis, Tennessee, powered by Nvidia’s latest Grace Blackwell chips.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has confirmed that the company’s upcoming artificial intelligence chip, called AI5, will be produced by Samsung in Texas and TSMC in Arizona. Musk said the company aims to produce more chips than it currently needs. Any extra chips not used in Tesla cars or robots will be deployed in the company's data centers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124753885,imgsize-25940,width-400,resizemode-4/elon-musk.jpg"

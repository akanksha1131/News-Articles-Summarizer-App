What happens to existing users?



Chats & Contacts: Users can log into Microsoft Teams with their Skype credentials, ensuring a seamless transition with all previous messages and contacts intact.

Paid Services: New purchases of Skype Credit and subscriptions have been halted, but existing users can continue using their plans until their billing cycle ends.

Skype Numbers: These will remain active until expiry and can be ported to other carriers. Calls to Skype Numbers will still be received via Teams

How to get started with Teams for free

Download Teams on your device from the official Microsoft Teams website. Log in with your Skype credentials. Start using Teams with all your Skype chats and contacts ready to go.

Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that it will shut down its Skype video conferencing service today (May 5). “In order to streamline our free consumer communications offerings so we can more easily adapt to customer needs, we will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub,” said Microsoft in a blog post. The company is encouraging both free and paid Skype users to migrate to the Teams platform, which offers similar communication and collaboration features. Notably, this change does not affect Skype for Business users . Microsoft has also allowed the Skype users to sign into Teams on any supported device using their Skype credentials.Microsoft launched Skype on 2003 for easier online communication. However, with the platform lost its relevance with rise of new platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet and more. Microsoft’s decision to retire Skype is part of a broader strategy to streamline its communication services and focus on Teams, which offers enhanced collaboration tools for both personal and professional use.Microsoft has already stopped allowing new purchases of Skype Subscriptions, Skype Numbers, and Skype Credit, signaling the gradual phasing out of the platform.Moving to Teams is simple and doesn’t prevent you from also continuing to use Skype during the transition period.Here’s how to get started:","Microsoft announced it will shut down its Skype video conferencing service today (May 5) The company is encouraging both free and paid Skype users to migrate to the Teams platform, which offers similar communication and collaboration features.

What is Biden era’s ‘AI Diffusion Rule’ that has Nvidia and Amazon-backed Anthropic 'fighting' each other,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-is-biden-eras-ai-diffusion-rule-that-has-nvidia-and-amazon-backed-anthropic-fighting-each-other/articleshow/120879364.cms,"What is ‘AI Diffusion Rule’ and three-tiered country classification

Tech industry concerns and changes urged to Trump administration

The Biden administration, earlier this year, implemented a regulatory framework, widely known as the “AI Diffusion Rule,” with the primary objective of protecting advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology developed within the US, specifically high-performance AI chips and AI models. This measure has been introduced as part of a broader effort to manage the potential risks associated with the proliferation of powerful AI capabilities. However, this has recently encountered pushback from industry giant Nvidia, a leading manufacturer of the very AI chips the rule aims to control. Nvidia has voiced concerns that the current stipulations of the “AI Diffusion Rule” could stifle innovation. The company has gone so far as to publicly criticise Anthropic , an AI research and development company, for its stance in favour of maintaining the existing regulations. Here’s a look at the regulation.The rule, officially termed the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion and set to come into force starting May 15, is designed to prevent powerful AI technologies from falling into the hands of foreign adversaries or being used for malicious purposes.The “AI Diffusion Rule” mandates that companies developing advanced AI models, particularly those with potential national security implications, implement stringent security protocols. These protocols include robust access controls, detailed record-keeping and measures to detect and prevent unauthorised dissemination of the technology.The rule categorises countries into three tiers based on their relationship with the US and associated security concerns.Trusted allies, including nations like the UK, Canada, Australia, Japan and several European countries, enjoy near-unrestricted access to US AI technologies.Countries not explicitly adversarial but not fully trusted may receive limited access under specific licensing agreements.Adversarial nations, such as China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, face stringent restrictions, effectively barring them from acquiring advanced AI chips and models.The rules come amid growing concerns about the potential misuse of AI, including its application in developing sophisticated cyber weapons and disinformation campaigns. The Biden administration emphasised that while promoting innovation, it is critical to ensure that these technologies are not exploited to undermine US national security.Major tech companies, including Nvidia and Oracle, have expressed apprehension that the rule could hinder US competitiveness in the global AI market. They argue that overly restrictive measures might push international partners toward alternative suppliers, potentially diminishing US influence in AI advancements.“I'm not sure what the new diffusion rule is going to be, but whatever it turns out to be, it really has to recognise that the world has changed fundamentally since the previous diffusion rule was released,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week.Meanwhile, Anthropic, the AI startup backed by billions from Amazon , and Google, argued for tighter controls and enforcement, claiming that China is smuggling chips hidden in “prosthetic baby bumps” and “packed alongside live lobsters.”Nvidia blasted the AI company saying, “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’”“China, with half of the world’s AI researchers, has highly capable AI experts at every layer of the AI stack. America cannot manipulate regulators to capture victory in AI,” the spokesperson added.","The ‘AI Diffusion Rule’ mandates that companies developing advanced AI models, particularly those with potential national security implications, implement stringent security protocols.

How FarmVille and viral apps powered Facebook's early success

Zuckerberg explains how Apple’s App Store restrictions impacted Facebook’s mobile growth

""The original Facebook platform was really built for the web, before mobile became big.""

Apple’s App Store policies and their impact on Facebook

""When people started using mobile more, Apple told us, ‘You can’t have apps inside your app.’ That hurt something that had grown to be an important part of our business.""

Apple’s privacy and tracking policies

The bitter relationship between Meta and Apple

Apple’s legal challenges and the future of mobile platforms

The digital landscape has been shaped by a series of key players over the years, with Facebook, now Meta, standing at the forefront of the social media revolution. But for all its growth and transformation, the platform has faced significant challenges along the way. One of the more notable struggles came when Facebook 's thriving app and game ecosystem, including the wildly popular FarmVille , saw a dramatic decline.In a recent interview with tech writer Ben Thompson from Stratechery, Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed a critical factor in this decline: Apple ’s strict App Store policies. Zuckerberg explained how Apple’s decisions over the years impacted Facebook’s ability to maintain its business model, particularly its app-based games, and how this shift altered the company’s trajectory in the mobile era.In the late 2000s, Facebook was at the peak of its desktop-based platform, where games and apps played a significant role in the platform's growth. The social network quickly became a hub for developers looking to create interactive content that would engage its growing user base. Games like FarmVille, Mafia Wars, and Texas HoldEm Poker captured the attention of millions, providing Facebook with a fresh revenue stream. By 2012, these apps contributed to about 20% of the company’s revenue, marking a high point for Facebook’s game platform.This success was primarily driven by Facebook’s ability to integrate its game platform into the broader Facebook experience, allowing users to discover and share apps with their friends. The platform was tailored for the web, and developers used Facebook’s social features to create viral games. As the desktop experience dominated, it seemed that Facebook’s app ecosystem would only continue to thrive.However, the rise of smartphones and mobile apps introduced a massive shift in the way people engaged with the internet. The advent of the iPhone and other smartphones ushered in a new era of app-based experiences that would change the way users interacted with social media and online games. As mobile platforms began to dominate, Zuckerberg and his team recognized that Facebook’s future would depend on successfully adapting to the mobile revolution.Unfortunately, Facebook’s smooth transition from desktop to mobile wasn't as seamless as they hoped. Zuckerberg recalled,The company’s model, which relied heavily on web-based interactions, needed to be overhauled to thrive in an app-centric mobile environment.It was at this point that Zuckerberg pointed to Apple’s App Store policies as a significant hurdle for Facebook's continued success in the mobile space. Facebook had initially planned to leverage its own app platform inside the iPhone to continue growing its mobile app and game ecosystem. However, Apple’s stringent rules soon made this impossible.In the early days of mobile app development, Apple implemented rules that severely restricted how companies like Facebook could operate within the App Store. One of the key policies that Zuckerberg highlighted was Apple’s decision to block Facebook from running its own app platform inside the iPhone. Zuckerberg explained,This policy change effectively cut Facebook off from the ability to operate a platform that could support games and apps in the same way it had on desktop. As a result, Facebook's ability to host third-party applications, which had been a core part of its business model, was significantly diminished. While Apple argued that these policies were necessary for maintaining the security and quality of apps on its platform, the restriction ultimately stifled the growth of Facebook’s app-based ecosystem.The ramifications were immediate and profound: Facebook’s once-booming app and game business started to decline, and developers who had once relied on Facebook’s platform for distribution were forced to adapt to the new constraints. Zuckerberg noted that by limiting Facebook’s access to key tools and changing the company’s relationship with developers, Apple set off a chain of events that led to the decline of its game and app platform.In addition to the restrictions on Facebook’s app platform, Zuckerberg also pointed to Apple’s privacy policies as a factor that further undermined Facebook’s mobile business. Specifically, Apple’s introduction of App Tracking Transparency (ATT) in 2020 made it more difficult for companies like Facebook to track user behavior across different apps and websites. This update, which required apps to ask users for permission before collecting data for targeted advertising, was seen as a direct challenge to Facebook’s ad-driven revenue model.For Facebook, which had built its business around precise ad targeting, this policy change was a blow to its ability to effectively monetize its platform. Zuckerberg expressed frustration with Apple’s stance, noting that its policies had placed significant limitations on how Facebook could operate in the mobile space.Zuckerberg’s comments on Apple reveal a deeper sense of frustration and bitterness between the two tech giants. He described Apple’s decisions as creating ""deep bitterness"" and emphasized the company’s refusal to consider the value Facebook’s platform could bring to the iPhone ecosystem. Zuckerberg argued that Apple’s approach was too restrictive and that it limited the potential for collaboration between the two companies.He expressed his belief that mobile platforms should be more open, similar to traditional desktop systems such as Windows or macOS, where developers have more freedom to build their own ecosystems and offer a wider range of services. Zuckerberg lamented that Apple’s ""walled garden"" approach prevented Facebook from fully realizing its potential in the mobile era.Zuckerberg’s comments come at a time when Apple is facing increasing legal scrutiny over its App Store policies. Recently, a U.S. judge ruled that Apple had violated an earlier order by continuing to block developers from linking users to external payment options. This ruling is part of a broader legal battle in which Apple is being accused of maintaining an illegal monopoly over the app market. Apple is also facing an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice, which claims that the company’s practices harm competition in the smartphone industry.For Zuckerberg and Meta, these developments offer a glimmer of hope that Apple’s ""walled garden"" may eventually start to open up, allowing for greater freedom for developers and a more open mobile platform. As regulators push back against Apple’s control over the App Store, Zuckerberg and other tech leaders may see this as an opportunity for a more balanced and competitive mobile ecosystem.","Zuckerberg explains how Apple's App Store restrictions impacted Facebook’s mobile growth.

Mark Zuckerberg warns against rushing to judge AI friendships too soon

Mark Zuckerberg: Don’t judge AI in social roles too soon

“One of the main things we see people using

Meta AI

for is talking through difficult conversations they need to have with people in their lives,”

“Like ‘I’m having this issue with my girlfriend. Help me have this conversation.’ Or ‘How do I talk to my boss about a problem at work?’”

Mark Zuckerberg reveals why Americans feel lonely and how AI may help

“The average person has demand for meaningfully more. I think it's something like 15 friends or something,”

“But at some point you're like, ‘All right, I’m just too busy, I can't deal with more people.’”

Mark Zuckerberg: AI won’t replace real-world connections

“There’s a lot of concern people raise like, ‘Is this going to replace real-world, physical, in-person connections?’ And my default is that the answer to that is probably not,”

The role of personalization in AI companionship

Key ethical and social considerations

Emotional dependency : Could reliance on AI for emotional support reduce motivation to build real human relationships?

: How are emotionally sensitive conversations with AI stored, analyzed, or used by tech companies? Consent and authenticity: Can relationships with entities that don’t possess consciousness or true emotion be considered authentic?

The future of social AI at Meta

In an era where technology increasingly mediates our communication, the nature of human relationships is evolving at an unprecedented pace. At the forefront of this transformation is Mark Zuckerberg , the founder and CEO of Meta Platforms, whose innovations have fundamentally reshaped the way billions of people interact globally. From Facebook’s original mission to connect college students to today’s expansive virtual and AI-driven platforms, Zuckerberg has played a pivotal role in defining digital relationships.In a recent podcast interview hosted by Indian-American technology commentator Dwarkesh Patel , 23, Zuckerberg addressed a critical and timely question: Can artificial intelligence replace human relationships? Their in-depth conversation explored not only the psychological implications of AI companionship but also the growing trend of individuals turning to AI for emotional support, guidance, and even friendship. As AI continues to develop sophisticated conversational capabilities, this question carries far-reaching consequences for how we perceive intimacy, trust, and social fulfillment in the digital age.Artificial intelligence has rapidly become integrated into everyday digital platforms. Whether it's through chatbots, personal assistants, or generative AI tools, many users now interact with AI for more than just technical support. From role-playing therapy bots to AI friends offering emotional comfort, the scope of these interactions is broadening.Platforms such as Replika, Character.ai, and Meta’s own AI features are examples of how conversational AI is moving into domains previously reserved for human connection. This shift has prompted intense debate among technologists, psychologists, and ethicists: can machines simulate companionship, and should they?It was against this backdrop that Dwarkesh Patel asked Zuckerberg how AI developers can ensure users form healthy relationships with their artificial companions.Mark Zuckerberg emphasized the importance of understanding user behavior before making definitive judgments about AI’s role in social relationships. He noted that AI’s utility in helping people navigate emotional or difficult conversations is already evident.Zuckerberg said.This example suggests that rather than replacing human relationships, AI is currently being used as a tool to support and enhance them. Zuckerberg argued that being overly prescriptive about what AI should or should not do at this early stage might hinder valuable developments.A compelling point raised by Zuckerberg relates to the unmet social needs of many individuals. He cited a statistic from his experience working in social media that the average American has fewer than three people they would consider close friends.Zuckerberg stated.This discrepancy between social capacity and social desire highlights the growing loneliness epidemic—a trend corroborated by numerous health studies, including those by the U.S. Surgeon General. In such a context, Zuckerberg believes AI could play a meaningful role by providing companionship where human connection is lacking.Despite recognizing the potential of AI to assist with social needs, Zuckerberg clarified that he does not believe AI will fully replace real-world relationships. He emphasized that while AI may serve as a helpful supplement, particularly for those struggling with loneliness or social anxiety, it is unlikely to displace physical, in-person interaction.Zuckerberg stated.Instead, he suggested that AI will more likely fill gaps in social interaction and provide new tools for communication, rather than become a full-scale substitute for human connection.One of the factors driving the effectiveness of AI in social tasks, according to Zuckerberg, is personalization. As AI systems continue to learn and adapt based on user interactions, their ability to provide emotionally resonant and context-aware responses improves.He noted that as personalization “kicks in,” the relationship between AI and user becomes more compelling. This echoes a broader industry trend where AI agents are designed to retain memory, adjust tone, and even reflect empathy in long-term interactions.This raises important design considerations for developers—particularly around ethical boundaries, data privacy, and mental health implications.While Zuckerberg expressed optimism about AI’s role in supporting relationships, the growing popularity of AI companions also introduces several ethical concerns:These are ongoing discussions in academic and technological circles, and while Zuckerberg touched on some of them indirectly, the industry as a whole will likely need clearer frameworks as AI relationships become more prevalent.Meta’s investments in AI extend across multiple platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and the metaverse. The company has rolled out various AI-powered features designed to enhance user interaction, such as content suggestions, virtual assistants, and automated moderation tools.Looking forward, Zuckerberg’s comments suggest that Meta may deepen its exploration of AI-driven social features, with an emphasis on user support, mental health, and emotional intelligence.",Mark Zuckerberg: Don’t judge AI in social roles too soon.

What is Amazon vs 'Beverly Hills Polo Club' case

Amazon Technologies Inc has approached the division bench of the Delhi High Court to contest a single judge’s order directing the US e-commerce giant to pay Rs 340 crore in damages to Lifestyle Equities C.V. and Lifestyle Licensing B.V. for infringing their registered trademark ' Beverly Hills Polo Club ,' according to a report by the Economic Times.The division bench, led by Justice Hari Shankar, reportedly scheduled the next hearing for Wednesday (May 7). Amazon argued that the Lifestyle companies, which claimed “extensive goodwill and recognition” for their trademark, failed to provide evidence of infringement before the single judge. The company emphasized that the case warrants a detailed review by the division bench, as per the Economic Times.In February, Justice Prathiba M. Singh had issued a permanent injunction barring Amazon Technologies from selling or advertising products bearing a logo identical or deceptively similar to Lifestyle’s trademark. The report quoted Justice Singh’s observation that Amazon, a dominant player in e-commerce, leverages its platform to promote its products, often at prices 10% of Lifestyle’s, engaging in a “deliberate strategy of obfuscation” to evade liability.Justice Singh further noted, as reported by ET, that Amazon Technologies, along with Cloudtail India and Amazon Seller Service—all part of the Amazon Group—operated as a “cohesive commercial entity” but failed to clarify their interrelationships. “The clear attempt is to not disclose the exact relationship between the said three defendants to this court,” she said, describing Amazon’s conduct as lacking bona fides and indicative of an intent to withhold crucial information.Lifestyle Equities, which launched its Beverly Hills Polo Club products in India in 2007, reportedly argued for exemplary and punitive damages due to Amazon’s “wilful” infringement. The trademark, inspired by the luxurious Beverly Hills area in Los Angeles, includes the word-mark and a logo featuring a charging polo pony, rider, and mallet.Amazon also faces accusations of diluting Lifestyle’s brand through deep discounting of competing products with similar marks, leveraging its platform’s dominance.

Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for Grand Theft Auto VI, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

"After Walmart, Target may be making this ‘Big change’ to self-checkout machines to tackle theft",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-walmart-target-makes-this-big-change-to-self-checkout-machines-to-tackle-theft/articleshow/120871808.cms,"“The target I live near completely got rid of self-checkout,”

Why Target is removing self-checkout machines at its stores



Target is reportedly phasing out self-checkout kiosks in its stores. The change comes after thieves increasingly exploited the technology to steal merchandise, a report claims. In March, the retailer announced limits on self-checkout by capping transactions at 10 items and began removing or reducing kiosks in response to customer complaints about unreliable machines and growing shrinkage. To accommodate the change, Target will open more staffed checkout lanes, ensuring smoother transactions for shoppers, the report added. This comes after rival Walmart updated its self-checkouts with bright yellow PIN pad rims to tackle card skimming. Named the “chastity belt”, the PIN pads are aimed at making it more difficult for criminals to install illegal skimming devices on the machines.Reddit user @jxbermudez72 also spotted the change, posting a photo of the space where the self-checkout kiosks once stood in their local store.the user noted.According to a report by The New York Post, Target said that this shift reflects changing consumer habits. The company said that self-checkout surged during the pandemic as customers sought minimal contact, but usage has declined as in-store traffic stabilised. The move also comes as Target, along with other major retailers, grapples with a sharp uptick in organised retail crime, which has forced some stores to close temporarily, the report added.During a 100-visit spree, a California shoplifter used Target’s self-checkout to steal more than $60,000 in merchandise, the report claims. In New York, organised theft rings have been reportedly blamed for $4.4 billion in annual losses, which fueled a booming underground resale market.As per the Council on Criminal Justice, shoplifting in NYC jumped 64% between June 2019 and June 2023. Stolen goods were then funnelled through eBay, Facebook Marketplace and illicit pawnshop warehouses.","Target is reportedly phasing out self-checkout kiosks in its stores.

The proposal targets high-profile firms such as Alibaba , Baidu , JD.com and Weibo, among other Chinese companies listed in the US.The proposed delisting also targets companies like: Pony AI (an autonomous‐driving technology firm), Hesai (a laser‐sensors manufacturer that denies Pentagon allegations of military ties), Tencent Music (already blacklisted by the Pentagon), and Daqo New Energy Corp (a polysilicon producer previously blacklisted for alleged forced labour in Xinjiang).In the letter (seen by the Financial Times), Moolenaar and Scott warn that these companies’ purported ties to the Chinese military threaten US investors and compromise national security. They also insisted that the SEC should use its authority to protect American markets.the letter said.The letter argued that regardless of their outward commercial appearance, these Chinese groups weredue to China’s military-civil fusion program, which compels companies to share technology with the People’s Liberation Army at Beijing’s direction.The lawmakers warned that the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) control over these firms wasand that Chinese law imposed anFurthermore, they noted that many of the companies named in their letter werebutMoolenaar and Scott pointed out that the SEC already possesses the necessary tools and authority under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act tothe letter added.Lawmakers argued these companies wereAs per the US–China Economic and Security Review Commission, 286 Chinese firms remain listed on US exchanges as of March.","Two Republican lawmakers have formally requested the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to delist 25 Chinese companies from the US stock exchanges.

The BIG BIG Panda grant fraud

Elon Musk speaking to Fox News' Jessie Waters about fraud and abuse in the government: ""Yeah, I mean, generally, like these programs, these grants are going to be like along the lines of 'Save the baby pandas.' And it's like, well, of course, who wouldn't want to save the baby pandas?""

""And, you know, in some cases they've got a show panda, which they will trot out for special occasions. In a lot of cases they don't even have a show panda.""

Jessie: ""No panda?""

Elon: ""There's not even one panda! Because we asked for pictures, and we don't even get one panda.""

""And it's like, well, you've got to... well, that's a lot of... you know, what's the... what's... what does a billion dollars get you? It doesn't even get you one panda.""

Jessie: ""You really want to see a baby panda?""

President Donald Trump this week celebrated his 100th day in office. On the occasion, he spoke about a range of things including Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trump said that DOGE has cut at least $160 billion in waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government. As per the executive order establishing DOGE on his Inauguration Day signed by Trump, Musk can work for the federal government no more than 130 days a year. According to the Office of Government Ethics, ""special government employees"" like Elon Musk can work for the federal government no more than 130 days a year, which fall on May 30.Elon Musk has already started to transition from his role with DOGE and is reportedly no longer working regularly from the White House. At Tesla's recent earnings call, Musk told investors that he would be ""allocating far more of his time to Tesla"" in the coming months.As Elon Musk starts moving away from DOGE full time, Fox News Channel's ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" had the opportunity to meet members of Musk's DOGE. Elon Musk and ""DOGE boys"" told Watters of some of the most shocking savings secured by the department, their reason to join DOGE and more.Elon Musk while discussing waste talked about alleged rampant abuse by an unspecified number of organisations devoted to protecting the animals.

Poll Do you believe that sexual health startups will significantly reduce the stigma around sexual wellness in India? No Yes

Disrupting traditional healthcare

India’s sexual health and wellness sector is rapidly expanding, with startups attracting significant venture capital funding to cater to growing consumer demand. According to a report by Economic Times, the sexual health and wellness startups address the needs of both male and female consumers and offer wide range of products and services, from treatments for infertility, erectile dysfunction (ED), and premature ejaculation to hormone tracking, contraceptives, and personal massagers. As per the report, the these startups are witnessing growth due to the increased awareness among Gen Z and millennial demographics, which is helping to reduce the stigma surrounding sexual health.Several startups have secured funding in recent weeks, signaling investor confidence in the sector. Among them:Additionally, Bengaluru-based Inito, which produces fertility monitors for women, is reportedly in talks to raise USD 15-20 million.Startups emphasise that the growth of telehealth, improved logistics, and wider access to diagnostics have facilitated the provision of private and personalized care.Akash Kumar, co-founder of Raaz App, which raised USD 1 million in January, told Economic Times, “In our case, the user doesn’t want to walk into a clinic—these are closely-knit communities where privacy is key. Technology allows us to offer full-stack virtual care: doctor consultations, diagnostics, medicines, counselling, and lifestyle support.”Also, Direct-to-consumer (D2C) platforms and quick-commerce models are enabling startups to bypass traditional e-commerce friction, where compliance restrictions often limit sexual wellness products’ visibility. Boldcare’s co-founder Rajat Jadhav pointed out: “More flexibility in D2C and quick commerce helps us reach users without hurdles. This allows startups to scale faster.”Investors believe that the fragmented nature of the sexual health category, where most specialists operate independently, presents an opportunity for disruption through digital-first platforms.""This sector could grow into a billion-dollar market in the next 5–6 years,"" said Ankur Khaitan, principal at Fireside Ventures. ""We estimate nearly 150 million Indian men suffer from sexual dysfunction or fertility issues. The actual number could be even higher.""","India’s sexual health and wellness sector is rapidly expanding, with startups attracting significant venture capital funding to cater to growing consumer demand.

Apple, Google and Snapchat slam utter disregard of sensitive information

New Shocking Details Emerge

Facebook and Instagram parent Meta, led by Mark Zuckerberg, has stumbled into a Huge blunder, igniting fury among legal teams from tech giants Apple, Google, and Snapchat . As first reported by Futurism, the latest chapter of Meta’s ongoing antitrust trial has exposed a series of egregious errors, with the company’s mishandling of sensitive court documents at the center of the storm. During the trial, Meta’s legal team presented slides containing confidential details about competitors, supposedly redacted for protection. However, the redactions were so poorly executed that anyone with access to the files could easily uncover the information. While the exposed data wasn’t catastrophic -- one slide, per The Verge, merely noted that iPhone users favor Apple’s messaging app over Meta’s—the breach has raised serious concerns about Meta’s competence and respect for legal proceedings.Snapchat’s legal counsel lambasted Meta’s “cavalier approach and casual disregard,” questioning whether the company would have been so careless if its own secrets were at stake. Apple’s attorneys went further, hinting they may hesitate to share internal documents with Meta in the future, citing a breakdown in trust. Google’s team echoed these sentiments, warning that Meta’s negligence could set a dangerous precedent for handling proprietary data in high-stakes litigation.This isn’t Meta’s first brush with controversy. The company previously faced backlash for “Operation Ghostbusters,” a covert effort to siphon user data from Snapchat to gain a competitive edge. In 2019, Meta also suffered a massive data breach that exposed personal details of 533 million Facebook users due to a security flaw exploited by hackers. These incidents paint a troubling picture of a company struggling to safeguard sensitive information—whether its own or others’.The current debacle unfolds amid a landmark antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which accuses Meta of stifling competition by acquiring rivals like Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Oculus instead of innovating to compete. A key focus of the trial is Meta’s failed 2013 attempt to buy Snapchat, which Snap’s leadership rejected, much to Zuckerberg’s frustration. The FTC argues this move reflects Meta’s broader strategy of neutralizing threats through acquisition rather than fair competition.In a defiant PR statement, Meta dismissed the FTC’s case as “weak” and out of touch, insisting that its competitive landscape extends far beyond Snapchat. “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows,” Meta declared, pointing to rivals like TikTok, YouTube, and X as proof of a vibrant, competitive market.Adding fuel to the fire, recent court filings have revealed that Meta allegedly pressured smaller startups into “cooperation agreements” to avoid being crushed by its market dominance. Sources close to the case claim Meta offered these companies access to its vast user data in exchange for exclusivity deals, effectively locking them out of partnerships with competitors. While these claims are still under investigation, they bolster the FTC’s narrative of Meta as a monopolistic bully.As Meta scrambles to contain the damage, its latest misstep has done more than embarrass the company -- it’s deepened skepticism about its ability to operate responsibly in an industry where trust and precision are paramount. With the antitrust trial ongoing and new allegations emerging, Zuckerberg’s empire faces an uphill battle to restore its credibility.","Facebook and Instagram parent Meta has stumbled into a Huge blunder, igniting fury among legal teams from tech giants Apple, Google, and Snapchat.

Swiggy has suspended its pickup-and-drop service , ‘Swiggy Genie,’ in most cities across India. The service, which previously operated in nearly 70 cities, is currently not visible on the Swiggy app in major regions including Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Delhi NCR, a report claims. In some locations where the service is still reportedly appearing in the app, it shows a message stating it is “temporarily unavailable.” We at the TOI Tech desk confirmed the service was not accessible in Noida either. While the company has not made an official statement, it remains unclear whether the suspension applies to all cities where Swiggy Genie was operational. However, to customers inquiring about the same on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter), the company confirmed that the service has been suspended temporarily.Responding to a post on X about the removal of Swiggy Genie from the app, Swiggy said:“Genie is currently shut due to operational constraints.”Replying to X user who shared a screenshot of the app showing the Genie service being unavailable, the company wrote: “Ah, the Genie’s currently taking a little break from granting wishes, Suhas! But worry not, we do hear your wishes loud and clear. While there’s no concrete timeline for Genie’s return just yet, our team is working hard behind the scenes to bring it back as soon as possible. We’ll be sure to keep you posted the moment it’s back in action!”“The Genie’s lamp is just cooling off for a bit. While we are unable to provide any concrete info on the same, please sit tight, we’ll keep you posted,” Swiggy said when a third customer inquired about Genie.“Hey there! Yes, Swiggy Genie is currently paused in Pune, which is why the button has been removed from the app. We get how useful the service was, and we’re genuinely sorry for the inconvenience. There’s no official timeline for its return just yet, but rest assured—we’ll let you know the moment the magic is back. 🧞‍♂️✨Thanks for hanging in there!” the company wrote, replying to a fourth user.Swiggy Genie, the hyperlocal delivery service launched in April 2020, had expanded to nearly 70 cities but has now been suspended again. This isn't the first time Swiggy has temporarily halted the service. The company paused the service in 2022 in cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad due to rising demand for its food delivery and Instamart services.The latest suspension comes after Swiggy announced the expansion of its 10-minute delivery service, Bolt, to over 500 cities.","Swiggy has suspended its pickup-and-drop service, ‘ swiggy Genie,’ in most cities across India.

"Kunal Bahl on Indian startups: India Should prioritise sustainable ""Indicorns"" over billion-dollar unicorns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/kunal-bahl-on-indian-startups-india-should-prioritise-sustainable-indicorns-over-billion-dollar-unicorns/articleshow/120866952.cms,"Kunal Bahl urge startups to focus on profitable businesses



Kunal Bahl , co-founder of Snapdeal and Titan Capital, recently advocated for greater recognition of startups that are built of profitability, rather than solely focusing on billion-dollar valuations. Speaking at the TiE Delhi-NCR Summit, Bahl emphasised that companies like Infosys, Wipro and TCS are great examples of businesses that achieved success via patient capital and long-term profitability. He also urged the Indian startup ecosystem to shift its focus from billion-dollar unicorns to sustainable, profitable businesses—which he calls “Indicorns.”Bahl voiced his concern that after 2017, the focus of media and investors shifted to ""flashy valuations and big bets."" He coined the term ""Indicorns"" to describe Indian startups that prioritise sustainable growth, often with little or no external funding, contrasting them with Unicorns, which are defined by reaching a $1 billion valuation, and Indicorns , which are characterised by strong revenues and profitability.""Valuation doesn't always represent progress,"" Bahl stated. ""You can have a billion-dollar tag and no profits. Meanwhile, others are quietly building real value. They deserve recognition too.""According to Titan Capital's data, Delhi-NCR has the highest number of Indicorns (51), followed by Bengaluru (42) and Mumbai (35). Founders of these companies have largely prioritised operational efficiency and margin discipline over securing substantial external funding.Bahl also shared his own experience of building a software company that went public without raising any external capital, highlighting that profitable growth remains a viable strategy in today's startup ecosystem.He clarified that the ""Indicorn"" concept is not intended to replace Unicorns but to broaden the definition of success. ""There's no single way to build a company,"" Bahl explained. ""Some raise capital and scale fast. Others grow profitably. Both are valid—but the latter is often ignored.""Bahl's comments come at a time when late-stage startups are facing valuation markdowns, and IPO prospects remain uncertain, underscoring a growing emphasis on financial sustainability.""I've met thousands of founders—none say they don't want to be profitable,"" Bahl added. ""Most raise money because they have to, not because they want to. Let's not overlook the ones building quietly and profitably.""","Kunal Bahl, co-founder of Snapdeal and Titan Capital, recently advocated for greater recognition of startups that are built of profitability. He coined the term ""Indicorns"" to describe Indian startups that prioritise sustainable growth. Delhi-NCR has the highest number of Indicorns, followed by Bengaluru and Mumbai.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120866948,imgsize-62190,width-400,resizemode-4/kunal-bahl-2.jpg"
'May the 4th be with you': How Google celebrated Star Wars day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/may-the-4th-be-with-you-how-google-celebrated-star-wars-day/articleshow/120866816.cms,"How Star Wars Day celebrations began

Google has a ‘Star Wars’ surprise for fans

It started “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....” and is now celebrated by Google . Observed globally on May 4th each year, Star Wars Day is a yearly celebration of George Lucas's iconic Star Wars saga. For fans across the world, this day has become a special occasion, deeply linked with the popular phrase “May the Fourth be with you.”This date-specific pun, cleverly derived from the series’ renowned line, ""May the Force be with you,"" has grown into a worldwide phenomenon. On this day, enthusiasts, cultural organisations, and even businesses participate in various festivities to honor the enduring legacy of Star Wars.The playful twist “May the 4th be with you” gained traction among fans in the years following the 1977 debut of the first Star Wars film. Interestingly, the phrase even found its way into a British political advertisement in 1979, celebrating Margaret Thatcher's victory as Prime Minister on May 4th of that year.While May 4th has become the widely recognized Star Wars Day, some dedicated fans consider May 25th, the original release date of the first film, as the true official celebration. The Los Angeles City Council even declared May 25th as Star Wars Day in 2007. However, in 2019, the California Legislature officially designated May 4th as Star Wars Day.Google has also jumped on Star Wars Day celebrations. When you go to Google and type “Star Wars”, confetti in the shape of R2-D2, Yoda, C-3PO, Darth Vader, and more characters fall from the top of the screens.Three buttons slide up from the bottom, giving users the option to quit, unleash more confetti, or share the experience with friends and family.This year, the day is being celebrated both big and small. Disney+ is marking the occasion with the launch of a new series, Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld, while the second season of another fan-favorite, Andor, is also getting underway.","Star Wars Day is celebrated globally on May 4th each year.

Google deal critical to browser's financial viability



Long-term market reform vs immediate survival



Mozilla 's Chief Financial Officer has warned that Firefox 's survival is at risk if the Justice Department's proposed remedies against Google's search monopoly are fully implemented. Eric Muhlheim testified that losing Google's default search engine payments would threaten the browser maker's existence. ""We would be really struggling to stay alive,"" Muhlheim said during testimony as Google presents its defense in the antitrust case . The US court has already ruled that Google maintains an illegal monopoly in Search, partly through exclusionary default search engine agreements.Muhlheim revealed that Firefox generates about 90 percent of Mozilla's revenue, with approximately 85 percent of that coming directly from its Google search deal. Without this income, Mozilla would face ""significant cuts across the company"" and a potential ""downward spiral"" as product engineering investments decrease.The DOJ wants to prohibit Google from paying to be the default search engine in third-party browsers like Firefox. Additional proposals include forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser and requiring it to share search results with competitors.While these remedies aim to increase competition, Muhlheim testified that an immediate end to Google payments would be devastating for Mozilla. The company has explored alternatives, including discussions with Microsoft about Bing, but found that other search engines don't monetize traffic as effectively as Google.A December 2024 board presentation highlighted that losing Google payments posed a ""significant threat to viability for Mozilla with limited ability to mitigate."" When Mozilla previously made Yahoo the default search engine between 2014 and 2017, users disliked the experience so much that many abandoned Firefox entirely.Under cross-examination, Muhlheim acknowledged it would be preferable not to rely on one customer for most of Mozilla's revenue. He also agreed with Judge Amit Mehta that Mozilla would benefit if at least one other company matched Google's quality and monetization capabilities.""If we were suddenly in that world,"" Muhlheim said, ""that would be a world that would be better for Mozilla.""The CFO noted that Firefox's underlying Gecko browser engine is ""the only browser engine that is held not by Big Tech but by a nonprofit,"" contrasting with Google's Chromium and Apple's WebKit. Mozilla developed Gecko to prevent a single company from controlling internet protocols.While the DOJ's proposals could eventually create more quality search engines competing for Firefox's default position, Muhlheim warned this would likely take too long for Mozilla to survive the transition period intact.","Mozilla's Chief Financial Officer testified that losing Google's default search engine payments would threaten the browser maker's existence.

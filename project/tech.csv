OpenAI issues statement

Suchir Balaji , a 26-year-old Indian-origin former OpenAI employee, was discovered dead in his Buchanan Street apartment on Thanksgiving Day last week. The San Francisco Medical Examiner’s Office ruled the death as suicide, with no signs of foul play. Days after, his mother Poornima Ramarao has opened up about her son’s death. In an interview with Business Insider, his mother revealed that Balaji had grown increasingly disillusioned with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly OpenAI’s shift toward commercialization with ChatGPT .Poornima Ramarao said, “He felt AI is a harm to humanity,” describing how her son, Suchir Balaji, transitioned from boundless optimism about AI’s potential to profound skepticism. Reflecting on his tragic death, she added, “It doesn’t look like a normal situation.”Suchir Balaji worked at OpenAI for nearly four years before resigning in August this year. One of his early contributions, a project called WebGPT , is credited with laying the groundwork for ChatGPT.Balaji had openly voiced concerns about potential copyright violations by OpenAI and other AI firms, particularly the use of copyrighted material to train generative AI models like ChatGPT. These concerns drew attention amid a growing wave of lawsuits from writers, programmers, and journalists accusing AI companies of unauthorized use of their work.Expressing its condolences following the passing of the former researcher, OpenAI has released a statement on Thursday, December 26. The company confirmed its support for Balaji's family during this challenging time. The statement, shared on OpenAI's newsroom, marks exactly one month since Balaji's death on November 26.“We were devastated to learn of this tragic news and have been in touch with Suchir's family to offer our full support,” the statement read. “Our priority is to continue to do everything we can to assist them.”","Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old Indian-origin former OpenAI employee, was discovered dead in his Buchanan Street apartment on Thanksgiving Day last week.

Here’s what the union minister wrote on X

Zero tolerance for consumer exploitation!!

This Prima Facie looks like Unfair Trade Practice where the cab-aggregators are alleged to be using Differential Pricing based on the factors mentioned in the article below. If so, this is blatant dis-regard to Consumer’s right to know. I have directed @jagograhakjago through CCPA to conduct a detailed inquiry into this and submit a report at the earliest. Have asked the department to look into other sectors as well like, food delivery apps, online ticket booking apps etc.

Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Pralhad Joshi said that the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) will investigate ride-hailing apps like Ola Uber and Rapido for allegedly charging different fares for identical rides on Android and Apple devices. Joshi expressed concern over what he described as a ""prima facie unfair trade practice"" and a ""blatant disregard"" for consumers' right to transparency. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Joshi said that he has directed the consumer protection watchdog to carry out a thorough inquiry and submit a report as soon as possible.“Zero tolerance for consumer exploitation !” Joshi emphasized, responding to media reports that revealed price discrepancies between mobile platforms – Android and iOS mainly, for the same journey.

Google Drive now allows users to stream videos immediately after they are uploaded. This update marks the latest in a series of enhancements to the platform's video playback capabilities. This new feature eliminates the wait time previously required for processing before viewing. This improvement follows a major overhaul of Drive's video player in October, which introduced a refreshed user interface and new playback controls.These video-focused upgrades are part of a broader effort by Google to enhance Drive's functionality. Last week, the company introduced an improved document scanner to the cloud storage platform. In 2024, Google added multiple new features to its cloud storage service, making it more than just a basic storage solution. Google Drive now boasts a range of functionalities, including automated backup tools and advanced sharing options.The importance of Google Drive's new instant video playback feature lies in how it addresses the platform's video processing. While Drive preserves the original uploaded video file for download, it also creates a stream-optimised version for its built-in player, similar to YouTube's transcoding process.However, this transcoding can take considerable time. Now, users can start watching their videos immediately after uploading, even though sharing through the Drive player still requires processing to complete. This is a notable improvement for users who frequently work with video files, as it allows for quicker identification and access to content within uploaded clips.","Google Drive now allows users to stream videos immediately after they are uploaded.

, as per Chandok,

is to partner India “in becoming an AI first nation and scripting a future where technology becomes the catalyst for societal progress.”

One of the companies at the forefront of making AI mainstream is Microsoft.Puneet Chandok , President, Microsoft India and South Asia, believes that initially there was skepticism but now it has “evolved into full-scale adoption, with businesses harnessing AI to revolutionize their operations”According to Chandok, Microsoft’s Copilot technology has substantially simplified daily tasks and enhanced productivity.Chandok believes that there is a strong eagerness to explore AI’s potential among organisations. Some of the key sectors in India which are embracing AI — along with Microsoft’s AI tech stack — are BFSI, manufacturing and digital natives. “The financial services sector is leading AI adoption, quickly identifying use cases and developing MVPs. The ITES sector is also making significant strides by scaling and quantifying improvements in productivity and cost efficiency,” Chandok said.The idea, for Microsoft, as per Chandok is to democratise AI and ensure it reaches every part of India—from boardrooms to classrooms, commerce to communities and finance to farmers. “We are dedicated to making AI accessible to all, ensuring that its transformative power benefits everyone, everywhere,” he said. Not only that but Microsoft is looking to bridge urban and rural divides, foster skilling initiatives, and drive responsible innovation, added Chandok.""As we step into 2025, there is no doubt that India stands at the cusp of an AI-powered transformation,"" said the Microsoft India president.","2024 will perhaps go down as the year when — from enterprise to education, from regular users to organizations — AI went beyond being a buzzword and became mainstream.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle



Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

What is digital arrest scam



How to identify a digital arrest scam

Unexpected Contact from ‘Officials’: Be cautious if someone claims to be from government agencies like the police, CBI, income tax officers, or customs agents, contacts you. Be cautious especially if they claim urgent legal action is being initiated or warranted. They might allege that you or one of your family members is involved in a serious crime like money laundering, tax evasion, or drug trafficking.

Fear-based language and urgency: Scammers may request video calls, disguising themselves in police uniforms, using government logos, or creating official-sounding background noise to appear legitimate. They often threaten arrest or immediate legal action, demanding a quick response and using legal terms to sound convincing. In some cases, they create a police station-like set up to further convince victims of their credibility.

Request for sensitive information or payment: Scammers may ask for personal information or demand large sums of money, promising that this will clear up your involvement in the alleged crime. They may also coerce you to transfer money to their account until the investigation is complete. Terms like “clearing your name”, “assisting with the investigation”, or “refundable security deposit/escrow account” might be used by them to persuade you into transferring money to specified bank accounts or UPI IDs.

Tips to stay safe

Pause and Verify: If you receive unexpected calls or messages about legal issues, take a moment to verify. Stay calm, as scammers rely on fear and urgency. Real government and law enforcement agencies will never ask for money or investigate cases through phone or video calls. Always confirm the caller’s identity and consult trusted sources before taking any action.

Use Support Channels: Report suspicious numbers to the national cybercrime helpline by dialing 1930 or the Department of Telecommunication (https://sancharsaathi.gov.in/sfc/).

The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country. As digital payments, including UPI, gain widespread adoption, incidents of online scams have risen significantly. Indians, as mentioned by PM Modi in one of the episodes of Mann ki Baat have lost Rs 120.3 crore through digital arrest scam s. In its advisory, the NPCI highlights the critical need for awareness and vigilance to protect against such fraudulent activities as India advances towards a digital-first economy.In a press release, NPCI says “Digital payments are now accessible nationwide, driving India towards a digital-first economy. They offer both security and convenience. However, it's crucial to use digital payments safely and avoid online scams. Early identification of potential scams helps protect you and your loved ones, fostering a safer, less-cash economy, for everyone.”The 'Digital Arrest' scam is a type of online fraud where cybercriminals trick individuals into believing they are under investigation or at risk of arrest by law enforcement or financial authorities. Scammers often impersonate government officials, police officers, or financial regulators and use fear tactics to manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information or transferring money. Some of the common tactics used in the scam include fake calls or messages, threat of arrest and demand for payment.As per NPCI, you can identify a digital arrest scam by keeping an eye for the following","The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

North Korea’s cyber warfare: A growing threat

In a significant cybersecurity breach, a North Korean hacking group has stolen over $300 million worth of cryptocurrency from DMM Bitcoin, a Japan-based exchange, according to reports from Japanese police and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The theft, which occurred in late May 2024, highlights the growing threat of cybercrime linked to North Korea 's extensive and well-established hacking operations. The incident underscores the increasing use of cryptocurrency theft as a method of generating illicit revenue, with global implications for both the cryptocurrency industry and international cybersecurity efforts. The cyberattack, attributed to the ""TraderTraitor"" group, is believed to be a part of the infamous Lazarus Group, which has a history of cyberattacks tied to North Korea's government. The FBI and Japanese authorities are working in tandem to investigate the breach and prevent future attacks.The DMM Bitcoin breach was carried out through a highly sophisticated social engineering scheme that allowed North Korean cyber actors to infiltrate the exchange's systems. According to the FBI's report, the attackers targeted an employee of a different cryptocurrency wallet software company through LinkedIn. Posing as a recruiter, the hacker initiated contact with the employee and sent them what appeared to be a pre-employment test. However, the test was a cleverly disguised phishing attempt that contained malicious code. When the employee unknowingly executed the file, it granted the hacker access to their system.This seemingly minor breach gave the attacker the opportunity to impersonate the employee and manipulate legitimate transactions within DMM Bitcoin’s infrastructure. By May 2024, the hacker was able to exploit this access to authorize the transfer of 4,502.9 Bitcoin, a sum worth $308 million at the time of the theft. The cryptocurrency was subsequently moved to an external wallet controlled by the perpetrators. This method of attack, leveraging human error and exploiting trust in digital communications, is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities in the cybersecurity landscape, particularly when employees are targeted as the entry point.The TraderTraitor group, responsible for the heist, is believed to be part of Lazarus Group, a notorious hacking collective linked to North Korea's government. Lazarus gained global attention in 2014 after it was accused of orchestrating a cyberattack on Sony Pictures in retaliation for the release of The Interview, a satirical film that mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Since then, Lazarus has been implicated in a series of high-profile cyberattacks, including the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, which affected organizations worldwide.The FBI's detailed analysis and investigation into the DMM Bitcoin incident confirm the link between TraderTraitor and Lazarus, further cementing the group’s role in North Korea’s broader cyber warfare strategy. Lazarus has been accused of using cybercrime as a means to generate revenue for the North Korean regime, bypassing international sanctions and supporting the country's economy in the face of increasing global isolation.North Korea’s cyber warfare program, which traces its origins to the mid-1990s, has evolved into a formidable force. According to a 2020 U.S. military report, the country now operates a highly specialized unit known as Bureau 121. This unit is reportedly made up of 6,000 cyber operatives working from various countries to carry out a range of cyber operations, including espionage, sabotage, and financial theft.Cryptocurrency has increasingly become a central element of North Korea’s financial strategy. With international sanctions severely limiting the country’s access to the global financial system, North Korean cybercriminals have turned to digital currencies as a way to generate illicit revenue. Cryptocurrencies, with their decentralized and pseudonymous nature, present an attractive target for cybercriminals, offering a way to bypass traditional banking systems and launder stolen funds more effectively.The theft from DMM Bitcoin is just one example of how North Korea has leveraged cryptocurrency for its own financial gains. In addition to direct thefts like the one at DMM, the regime has been linked to a variety of other cyber activities aimed at accumulating digital currencies. These activities include hacking cryptocurrency exchanges, stealing wallets, and exploiting vulnerabilities in blockchain technologies. The proceeds from these operations are believed to fund the country’s weapons programs, military expenditures, and the regime’s continued defiance of international sanctions.The DMM Bitcoin breach has broader implications for the global cryptocurrency industry, which is still grappling with how to secure its infrastructure against sophisticated attacks. Cryptocurrency exchanges, digital wallets, and blockchain technology companies are increasingly becoming targets of cyberattacks, and incidents like the one involving DMM Bitcoin highlight the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures.In response to the theft, the FBI, Japan’s National Police Agency, and other international law enforcement agencies have launched joint efforts to track down those responsible and prevent similar incidents in the future. As part of this effort, authorities are focusing on uncovering the tactics used by North Korean hackers and improving the resilience of the cryptocurrency sector against cyber threats.The DMM Bitcoin theft also brings attention to the role of international cooperation in combating cybercrime. As cryptocurrency transactions often transcend national borders, it is essential for governments and law enforcement agencies to collaborate closely in addressing the global nature of these crimes.North Korea's cyber activities are not limited to cryptocurrency thefts. The regime has consistently used cyber tools for a wide range of operations, including espionage, disruption of critical infrastructure, and attacks on foreign businesses and governments. Bureau 121, which is believed to be behind many of these attacks, represents one of the largest and most advanced state-sponsored cyber programs in the world.The capabilities of North Korean hackers continue to evolve, and the country's cyber operations are expected to remain a significant threat to global cybersecurity for the foreseeable future. As the use of cyber warfare becomes more prevalent in international conflicts, nations and organizations worldwide will need to adapt their defenses to address this growing risk.","A North Korean hacking group has stolen over $300 million worth of cryptocurrency from DMM Bitcoin, a Japan-based exchange.

Difficulties that Foxconn may face



Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn is diversifying its manufacturing operations globally to lessen its reliance on China. The company which is also the biggest global supplier of Apple’s iPhones expects potential tariffs from the US on Chinese imports amid rising trade tensions . The company has spent millions of dollars over the past two years expanding its operations worldwide. This includes a recent $33 million purchase of a 10-acre tract north of Houston for expansion, as well as investments in new factories in India and Mexico and further commitments in Thailand, reports the New York Times (NYT).These moves come as US President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to impose tariffs on goods imported from China, among other countries, upon taking office next month. Foxconn, a major producer of consumer electronics, is reportedly preparing for such a scenario for several years.Foxconn's chairman, Young Liu, recently explained that the company's strategic expansion worldwide is designed to mitigate the impact of expected tariffs. During a forum in Taipei, Liu told reporters, ""The impact on us is likely smaller compared to our competitors,"" after the company closed its Texas deal. The company’s newly acquired Texas land, located adjacent to one of its existing warehouses, is slated for development related to the company's AI operations .Apart from this, Foxconn's global expansion includes hundreds of millions of dollars invested in land and equipment for new factories. These include facilities in India's Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for iPhone production and in Mexico's Jalisco for AI server manufacturing. Additionally, a Foxconn subsidiary received approval from Thailand's government for a $300 million investment in its computer chip component business, earlier this month.Foxconn's global expansion reflects a broader trend among multinational companies, especially in Asia, to diversify supply chains and shift manufacturing away from China. This restructuring was spurred by the trade war initiated during the previous administration and is further driven by the prospect of new tariffs.While companies hope this diversification will lessen the impact of potential upcoming tariffs, replicating the manufacturing ecosystem that benefited from years of government-backed infrastructure investment in China will be challenging, the NYT report claims.Despite previous investments in smaller factories abroad, none have matched the scale or revenue generation of Foxconn's Chinese operations. However, last year, Foxconn's chairman vowed to change that.3","Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn is diversifying its manufacturing operations globally to lessen its reliance on China.

The company plans to introduce over a dozen inverter AC models in its 2025 lineup within the next few weeks, expanding its offerings to 15-16 SKUs, according to industry sources.These new room air conditioners (RACs) will incorporate Samsung's Bespoke AI solutions , targeting consumers seeking high-end ACs with advanced features. This move marks Samsung's return to a market where it once held a significant position, boasting over 15% market share in 2014-15 before shifting focus to other product categories like mobile phones and smart TVs.The Indian appliance market is currently experiencing a trend of premiumization, with consumers increasingly willing to pay more for energy-efficient and connected devices. Samsung aims to capitalize on this trend, projecting double-digit volume growth in its RAC segment in 2025. While Samsung sold approximately half a million units in 2024, holding a low single-digit market share, the company anticipates achieving a double-digit share with its new Bespoke AI-powered lineup in the highly competitive Indian RAC market.The Indian RAC market, estimated at around 11 million units, is dominated by established players like Voltas, LG, Daikin, BlueStar, Hitachi-Johnson, Panasonic, and Lloyd. The industry saw exceptional sales growth of 30-40% in May and June due to a severe heatwave. Factors such as rising temperatures, urbanization, and increasing incomes are driving demand for ACs in India. The market is also evolving with the availability of more energy-efficient models and increased domestic manufacturing of components.While an email to Samsung India for comment went unanswered at the time of reporting, the company's re-entry into the RAC market signals a renewed focus on this growing segment.","Samsung India is set to relaunch its residential AC business with a focus on premium, smart features.

Amazon sets this 'China condition' for sellers on its website in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-sets-this-china-condition-for-sellers-on-its-website-in-the-us/articleshow/116691161.cms,"'Punishment' for sellers not following

Sellers Caught in the Middle

Amazon denies

Chinese sellers are reportedly caught in the middle as Amazon battles to maintain its dominance in the U.S. ecommerce market. According to the South China Post, Amazon has instructed some Chinese cross-border merchants to stop listing goods at lower prices on the rival platform, Temu . The report states that Amazon's local office recently notified managers of top-selling Chinese brands, advising them not to list identical items at reduced prices on Temu.Adding fuel to the fire, Anker, a popular brand on Amazon, recently removed its listings from Temu's US marketplace. This move fueled speculation that Amazon pressured Anker to prioritize its platform. However, Temu maintains its commitment to ""fair and open competition"" and said that it believes offering products across platforms benefits consumers with more choices and better deals.Temu is owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings . The ecommerce website has gained popularity rapidly since its launch in the year 2022. Its aggressive pricing strategy is said to be attracting US consumers and threatening Amazon's market share. Temu was the world’s third-most-visited online marketplace after Amazon and Alibaba Group Holding’s AliExpress, according to November data from Similarweb.Sellers who violate this rule risk losing their placement in Amazon's coveted Featured Offer program, which gives products prime real estate on product pages. A Featured Offer, also known as the Buy Box, is prominently displayed at the top of an Amazon product page, alongside the “Add to Cart” and “Buy Now” buttons, making it easier for customers to purchase the featured item rather than the same product sold by other merchants.Recently, Amazon launched Haul, an app section that sells goods priced under $20 aimed to take on competition from the likes of Temu and Shein.Previously, Amazon excluded Temu from its price comparison system, potentially due to concerns about counterfeit products on the platform. However, with Temu's growing success, Amazon seems to be changing tactics.This situation puts Chinese sellers in a difficult position. They need to balance lower prices on Temu's platform, favored by the algorithm, with maintaining good standing on Amazon, crucial for reaching a wider audience. Some sellers are resorting to changing product pictures on Temu to avoid detection by Amazon.An Amazon representative denied the report and said that “sellers decide their selling strategy and set their own product prices in the Amazon store, and Amazon does not ask them to set certain prices.”","Chinese sellers are reportedly caught in the middle as Amazon battles to maintain its dominance in the U.S. ecommerce market.

Russia is increasingly turning to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for international payments as it seeks to navigate Western sanctions and reduce its reliance on the US dollar, a report has said. The changes come after sanctions were imposed on Russia after its war with Ukraine hampered trade with China and Turkey.Citing Russia’s finance minister Anton Siluanov, news agency Reuters reported that the companies in the country have begun using digital currencies in foreign trade following recent legislative changes that legalised their use.Russia legalised the use of cryptocurrencies in foreign trade and has taken steps to regulate cryptocurrency mining. Russia is a major player in Bitcoin mining, and Siluanov highlighted that Bitcoin mined within Russia is already being used for international payments.“As part of the experimental regime, it is possible to use bitcoins, which we had mined here in Russia (in foreign trade transactions ),” Siluanov told Russia 24 television channel.“Such transactions are already occurring. We believe they should be expanded and developed further. I am confident this will happen next year,” he said, adding that international payments in digital currencies represent the future.Earlier this year, Siluanov urged the public to stay away from crypto investment.“Some people see cryptocurrency as a source of quick money. I don’t recommend it as a means of investment,” the minister statedEarlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin criticised the US for using the dollar as a political weapon, arguing that this has undermined its role as the global reserve currency and driven countries to seek alternative assets like Bitcoin.","Russia legalised the use of cryptocurrencies in foreign trade and has taken steps to regulate cryptocurrency mining.

Japan Airlines (JAL) has restored its systems and resumed ticket sales after a cyberattack disrupted domestic and international flights earlier on Thursday (December 26).The attack, which began at 7.24 am local time, affected both internal and external systems, prompting JAL to temporarily shut down a malfunctioning router and suspend ticket sales for flights departing on Thursday.JAL assured that no customer information was compromised and that the company suffered no damage from computer viruses. ANA Holdings, Japan's other major airline, reported no impact on its systems from the cyberattack.As per news agency Reuters, the disruption led to delays of more than 24 domestic flights, with delays exceeding 30 minutes each.While Japanese authorities investigated the incident, local media suggested that the disruption could be due to a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, where networks are overwhelmed by concentrated data traffic from multiple sources.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi directed the transport ministry to expedite system restoration efforts and ensure proper accommodation for affected passengers.Earlier in the day, television footage showed crowds of stranded travelers at Tokyo's Haneda airport. The disruption coincided with the start of Japan's New Year holiday season, which is the country's peak travel period.This incident comes on the heels of a technical glitch that grounded all American Airlines flights for an hour on Christmas Eve, disrupting travel for thousands of passengers.","Japan Airlines (JAL) has restored its systems and resumed ticket sales after a cyberattack disrupted domestic and international flights earlier on Thursday.

Improvements in the increase in mobile internet speed



The usage of the internet continues to grow rapidly across the globe, with mobile internet playing a central role in this digital revolution. However, there remains a clear disparity in internet speeds between countries, with nations in the Middle East and Asia leading the way. While countries like the UAE and Qatar set benchmarks for fast internet speeds, large nations such as the U.S. and India still face challenges in achieving high-speed mobile internet, primarily due to infrastructure limitations and regional differences. Despite these challenges, the overall trend points towards improved internet speeds and connectivity, which will likely continue to fuel global digital transformation.As of October 2024, 5.52 billion people are using the internet, up by 151 million people in a year, and this trend keeps growing. The contribution of the internet to current life cannot be underestimated since it changes communication, business, and access to information. Mobile internet has grown fast, connecting over half of the world population with smartphones. With the speeds of mobile internet improving continually, there is always the case of disparity in terms of quality connection, where some countries lead the speed and others trail with slower speeds. This continues to form global economies and societies.According to the Speedtest Global Index, countries in the Middle East and Asia generally have the fastest mobile internet speeds. For example, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) leads the global rankings, with mobile internet speeds increasing nearly 100 times in the nation's capital, Dubai. The UAE has made considerable investments in digital infrastructure since 2012, helping it become a global leader in internet speeds.The UAE comes on top, with the fastest mobile internet in the world. Continuously investing in the country's digital infrastructure, especially in places such as Dubai, allows this country to achieve good speed. It is propelled into the ranks by their leading-edge 5G networks and more up-to-date technologies.Qatar is located in the Middle East and ranks second. It has invested heavily in the telecom network, ensuring good high-speed internet, especially with the implementation of 5G services, providing robust mobile connectivity.Kuwait comes third, and the impressive speed has to do much with its being one of the first in the advanced mobile technology era and its further expansion into 4G and 5G, ensuring the internet is accessible speedily and stably for users.Bulgaria ranks among the top-performing European nations. This is because there are affordable high-speed broadband and mobile services, sustained by a competitive telecom market.Denmark ranks fifth with high-speed internet driven by substantial investments in infrastructure and one of the best 5G networks in Europe, enhancing mobile data speeds for users.South Korea was one of the top in mobile technology, having long dominated internet rankings. With widespread usage of 5G networks across the country, the use of mobile internet speeds increases, placing it among the top globally, in telecom infrastructure.It comes in right below South Korea, which is based on good mobile network services and wide adoption of 5G. This is one of the most connected countries in Europe that offers fast and reliable mobile data.The country has fast mobile internet speeds with high-quality 4G and 5G networks supporting a highly tech-savvy population that requires fast internet both for personal and professional reasons.One of the largest economies in the world, China has rapidly expanded its 5G networks. It still faces challenges in rural areas but does not have any issue with speed in urban areas and remains a key player in the global mobile internet space.Luxembourg completes the top 10 list by providing fast mobile internet. The country has a small size but it enjoys well-developed mobile infrastructure and rapid adoption of advanced technology, thus permitting high-speed mobile connections.India is the world's second largest online market after China, with more than 900 million internet users, while the internet penetration in the country is low at above 50% global average. India ranks 25th globally for mobile internet speeds as of November 2024, the Speedtest Global Index states. The country's median download speed stands at 100.78 Mbps, the upload at 9.08 Mbps, and latency at 30 ms. Even though Indian internet speeds have increased, they are still yet to close the gap on many of the high-income countries-both in infrastructure-related challenges as well as India's overall digital divide.This means the internet, in particular via mobile phones, has been able to connect many people in the world. Mobile Internet usage is a far bigger growth rate factor in enhancing global internet penetration. It is even interesting that nowadays mobile internet has been one of the major access enablers because more and more users rely on smart phones and mobile devices for web access.Indeed, the fast growth in the rate at which people use the mobile internet has led to rapid rises in average speeds for mobile internet connections due to almost half of world inhabitants using mobile internet online with over 58 percent of world's population or more so approximately 4.7 billion people, with well above 2.1 billion additional mobile internet users between 2015 and 2023, by the GSMA.Other than the growing number of internet users, mobile internet speeds have also grown. According to DataReportal, average global download speeds for mobile users have increased by nearly 30% from the previous year, now at 55.8 Mbps. Improvement in mobile internet speed would indicate both mobile internet infrastructure development and high-speed mobile data networks' increasing availability.However, even with this, there is still a ""digital divide"". Some countries are lagging behind in internet speed and unreliability; while other regions in some countries cannot even install digital infrastructure. Other countries, however, have come along in leaps and bounds, boasting speeds of mobile internet that far exceed the average globally.","The UAE comes on top, with the fastest mobile internet in the world.

"Vodafone Idea gets Rs 24,800 Crore relief with bank guarantee waiver, says it will ensure 4G/5G network growth",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/vodafone-idea-gets-rs-24800-crore-relief-with-bank-guarantee-waiver-says-it-will-ensure-4g/5g-network-growth/articleshow/116782746.cms,"

What Vodafone Idea said on the waiver

Vi, also known as Vodafone Idea , received a waiver of bank guarantee requirements for spectrum auctions conducted in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2021 from the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) last week. The telecom operator has welcomed the government’s decision to waive the requirement of bank guarantees for past spectrum auctions, stating that it will enable the telecom sector to better utilize banking resources for expanding 4G and 5G networks across India.On December 27, the DoT informed the three private telecom operators — Reliance Jio Bharti Airtel , and Vi — about the waiver of BGs amounting to Rs 33,000 crore. Of this, the lion’s share of relief, totaling Rs 24,800 crore, applies to Vodafone Idea.In an exchange filing, Vi said “This step of BG waiver is a clear indication of the government’s continued support to the telecom industry. It will ensure that the exposure of the banking system is utilized by telecom operators towards further proliferation of 4G and 5G networks in India.”“Prior to this reform, BGs aggregating to Rs 24,800 crore were required to be provided by Vi against each spectrum installment. With this decision, no BGs will be required for auctions held in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2021,” the company stated.However, Vi noted a one-time partial shortfall for the 2015 auction, where the net present value (NPV) of payments made is less than the pro-rated spectrum usage value. “We are in discussion with the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to determine the final amount of this partial shortfall for the 2015 auction,” the company added.For Vodafone Idea, which is yet to roll out 5G services, the BG waiver comes as a significant relief. It reduces financial burdens and opens avenues for lenders to extend much-needed credit. This funding will help the struggling telecom operator enhance its 4G coverage and accelerate its 5G rollout to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel.","Vi, also known as Vodafone Idea, received a waiver of bank guarantee requirements for spectrum auctions conducted in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2021.

Change in UPI Rule: RBI allows UPI access for prepaid payment instruments via third-party apps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/change-in-upi-rule-rbi-allows-upi-access-for-prepaid-payment-instruments-via-third-party-apps/articleshow/116750577.cms,"What is the UPI rule change

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has significantly expanded the functionality of Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) by allowing users to make and receive UPI payments through any third-party UPI-enabled app. This change, announced by RBI, marks a major step towards interoperability in the digital payments ecosystem.Prepaid Payment Instrument or PPIs is a financial tool that allows users to store funds on a card or digital wallet for future transactions. PPIs store monetary value and can be used for purchasing goods and services, conducting financial services, and facilitating remittances. This new regulation effectively integrates PPIs more deeply into the UPI ecosystem, further solidifying UPI's position as the dominant digital payment platform in India.Previously, UPI transactions involving PPIs, such as digital wallets, gift cards, and metro cards, were confined to the mobile app provided by the specific PPI issuer. This restriction limited user convenience and the broader adoption of PPIs for UPI transactions. Now, holders of full-KYC (Know Your Customer) compliant PPIs can link their instruments to popular UPI apps like Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, and BHIM, similar to how they link bank accounts.According to the RBI's circular, ""A PPI issuer shall enable holders of only its full-KYC PPIs to make UPI payments by linking its customer PPIs to its UPI handle. UPI transactions from PPI on the issuer’s application shall be authenticated using the customer’s existing PPI credentials. Such a transaction will, thus, be pre-approved before it reaches the UPI system. A PPI issuer, in its capacity as a PSP, shall not on-board customers of any bank or any other PPI issuer."" This means that only PPIs with complete customer verification (KYC) will be eligible for this feature. The authentication of these UPI transactions originating from PPIs will occur using the user's existing PPI credentials before the transaction reaches the UPI network, adding an extra layer of security. This pre-authorization process ensures that the PPI issuer validates the transaction before it is processed by the UPI system.The RBI also emphasized that PPI issuers, in their role as payment system providers, are prohibited from onboarding customers of other banks or PPI issuers. This stipulation aims to maintain a clear separation and prevent potential conflicts of interest.This move aligns with the RBI's broader objective of promoting digital payments and enhancing financial inclusion. By enabling greater interoperability between PPIs and the UPI network, the RBI aims to make digital transactions more seamless and accessible for a wider range of users. This decision also brings PPIs on par with bank accounts in terms of UPI accessibility, as bank account holders can already use any UPI app for transactions.UPI, developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), has revolutionized digital payments in India , facilitating instant real-time inter-bank transactions through mobile phones.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has significantly expanded the functionality of Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) by allowing users to make and receive UPI payments through any third-party UPI-enabled app. This change, announced by RBI, marks a major step towards interoperability in the digital payments ecosystem.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116750575,imgsize-25458,width-400,resizemode-4/116750575.jpg"

NPCI issues an advisory about 'online scams' that Indians are losing crores to,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/npci-warns-phonepe-gpay-and-other-upi-users-about-scam-that-indians-are-losing-crores-to/articleshow/116352174.cms,"What NPCI advisory says

What is digital arrest scam



How to identify a digital arrest scam

Unexpected Contact from ‘Officials’: Be cautious if someone claims to be from government agencies like the police, CBI, income tax officers, or customs agents, contacts you. Be cautious especially if they claim urgent legal action is being initiated or warranted. They might allege that you or one of your family members is involved in a serious crime like money laundering, tax evasion, or drug trafficking.

Fear-based language and urgency: Scammers may request video calls, disguising themselves in police uniforms, using government logos, or creating official-sounding background noise to appear legitimate. They often threaten arrest or immediate legal action, demanding a quick response and using legal terms to sound convincing. In some cases, they create a police station-like set up to further convince victims of their credibility.

Request for sensitive information or payment: Scammers may ask for personal information or demand large sums of money, promising that this will clear up your involvement in the alleged crime. They may also coerce you to transfer money to their account until the investigation is complete. Terms like “clearing your name”, “assisting with the investigation”, or “refundable security deposit/escrow account” might be used by them to persuade you into transferring money to specified bank accounts or UPI IDs.

Tips to stay safe

Pause and Verify: If you receive unexpected calls or messages about legal issues, take a moment to verify. Stay calm, as scammers rely on fear and urgency. Real government and law enforcement agencies will never ask for money or investigate cases through phone or video calls. Always confirm the caller’s identity and consult trusted sources before taking any action.

Use Support Channels: Report suspicious numbers to the national cybercrime helpline by dialing 1930 or the Department of Telecommunication (https://sancharsaathi.gov.in/sfc/).

The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country. As digital payments, including UPI, gain widespread adoption, incidents of online scams have risen significantly. Indians, as mentioned by PM Modi in one of the episodes of Mann ki Baat have lost Rs 120.3 crore through digital arrest scam s. In its advisory, the NPCI highlights the critical need for awareness and vigilance to protect against such fraudulent activities as India advances towards a digital-first economy.In a press release, NPCI says “Digital payments are now accessible nationwide, driving India towards a digital-first economy. They offer both security and convenience. However, it's crucial to use digital payments safely and avoid online scams. Early identification of potential scams helps protect you and your loved ones, fostering a safer, less-cash economy, for everyone.”The 'Digital Arrest' scam is a type of online fraud where cybercriminals trick individuals into believing they are under investigation or at risk of arrest by law enforcement or financial authorities. Scammers often impersonate government officials, police officers, or financial regulators and use fear tactics to manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information or transferring money. Some of the common tactics used in the scam include fake calls or messages, threat of arrest and demand for payment.As per NPCI, you can identify a digital arrest scam by keeping an eye for the following","The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan (LY), the country’s highest legislative body, is under constant cyberattack, with an average of 900,000 attacks originating from China every month. This alarming statistic, revealed by Cheng Hui-pin, the head of the legislature’s information technology (IT) department, underscores the challenges Taiwan faces in safeguarding its digital infrastructure. The Legislative Yuan plays a critical role in representing the people and exercising legislative power, making it a significant target for cyber threats. These attacks not only threaten national security but also highlight vulnerabilities in the LY’s network and operational systems, which were scrutinized during a recent budget review by the Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee.The Legislative Yuan’s network connects to devices containing highly sensitive information, making it an attractive target for cyberattacks. According to Cheng Hui-pin, these attacks are primarily of Chinese origin and pose severe risks to Taiwan’s national security. Cheng assured lawmakers that cybersecurity is a top priority for the IT department, which routinely reviews the LY’s defenses in compliance with the Cyber Security Management Act.Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Chung Chia-pin raised concerns during a budget review meeting, questioning the security of the legislature’s network and the quality of its infrastructure. He emphasized the potential consequences of a compromised system, highlighting the need for robust cybersecurity measures.In addition to cybersecurity vulnerabilities, several operational issues were discussed during the budget review. Legislator Chung pointed out that the legislature’s wifi network is frequently slow and experiences outages, hampering the productivity of lawmakers and staff. He also criticized the poor state of audio equipment in committee rooms, stating that excessively loud microphones could cause hearing damage and disrupt proceedings in adjoining rooms.Chung urged the IT department to address these issues promptly, recommending that a comprehensive report be submitted within three months. He warned that failure to comply could lead to the suspension of the department’s budget.After negotiations between members of the DPP and the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT), lawmakers passed a resolution requiring the IT department to address the identified issues without freezing its budget. The department has been tasked with testing all devices connected to the LY’s network to ensure they meet security standards. Additionally, lawmakers recommended inspecting and improving the audio equipment and installing soundproofing in legislative chambers to reduce noise disruptions.Cheng Hui-pin assured the committee that the IT department would compile and submit a detailed report addressing both cybersecurity and operational issues. The department also plans to implement regular testing of devices and strengthen cyber defenses to mitigate future risks.Taiwan’s position as a democratic nation makes it a frequent target of cyberattacks from China, which seeks to undermine its governance and infrastructure. The high frequency of attacks on the Legislative Yuan underscores the importance of implementing advanced cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive information.The Legislative Yuan’s response to these challenges reflects a broader commitment to enhancing the resilience of Taiwan’s governmental institutions. By addressing both cybersecurity and infrastructure concerns, Taiwan aims to safeguard its legislative processes and maintain the integrity of its democratic system.","Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan (LY) is under constant cyberattack, with an average of 900,000 attacks originating from China every month.

In a surprising development, President-elect Donald Trump shared on social media that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates had requested a meeting with him. The post, which appeared to be directed at Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , highlights the increasing number of influential figures engaging with Trump as he prepared to take office. This revelation sheds light on the dynamics of high-profile meetings taking place at Mar-a-Lago , Trump’s Florida estate, which has become a hub for discussions with tech industry leaders. These interactions come amid significant developments in policy, criticism of key figures, and speculation about the influence of such meetings on the incoming administration.In a Truth Social post on Friday, Trump disclosed that Bill Gates had expressed interest in meeting him. Addressing Elon Musk in the post, Trump wrote,The post also made an apparent reference to Musk’s son, X Æ A-Xii, often affectionately called ""X.""Sources close to the situation revealed that Gates had reached out regarding a possible meet-up with Trump. However, no official confirmation about the meeting has been provided. This marks yet another instance of tech industry leaders seeking face time with Trump as he readies his administration for a January inauguration.The timing of Trump’s post coincides with mounting criticism directed at Elon Musk, who was recently named co-leader of Trump’s government efficiency program. Musk faced backlash for his support of the H-1B visa program, which facilitates the entry of highly skilled foreign workers into the U.S. While the program has been championed by many in the tech industry, it has also drawn criticism for potentially displacing domestic workers, a concern that aligns with Trump’s “America First” rhetoric.Despite the controversy, Musk has maintained his role in fostering discussions between the tech sector and the incoming administration. His involvement highlights the delicate balancing act faced by tech leaders navigating policy priorities and public sentiment under the new administration.Mar-a-Lago has emerged as a focal point for meetings between Trump and prominent figures from the tech industry. In the weeks following his election victory, Trump has hosted several tech CEOs at his Florida estate, many of whom represent Fortune 500 companies. These leaders have reportedly donated significant sums to Trump’s inauguration fund, further emphasizing the high stakes involved in fostering relationships with the incoming administration.Sources familiar with these gatherings told CNN that the meetings often follow a strategic agenda. Many CEOs have tailored their discussions to align with Trump’s priorities, such as revitalizing U.S. manufacturing and job creation. Amid these discussions, they have also used the opportunity to voice concerns about potential challenges posed by the administration’s policies. These efforts are widely viewed as an attempt to establish favorable relations with Trump before his presidency officially begins.The post by Trump not only revealed Gates’ intention to meet but also underscored Musk’s proximity to the President-elect’s circle. Gates and Musk represent two of the most influential figures in the tech industry, and their interactions with Trump have drawn significant attention. While Gates’ agenda for a potential meeting remains unclear, his involvement adds another layer to the narrative of tech leaders actively engaging with the incoming administration.Similarly, Musk’s dual role as an entrepreneur and an adviser to the administration places him in a unique position. His actions and statements have been closely scrutinized as he navigates the complexities of supporting Trump’s initiatives while addressing the concerns of the broader tech community.The ongoing meetings between Trump and tech leaders have sparked widespread speculation about their implications. For Trump, these engagements allow him to project an image of inclusivity and collaboration with industry leaders. For the tech executives, the meetings serve as an opportunity to influence policy decisions and establish rapport with the administration.Critics, however, have raised concerns about the transparency and motives behind these interactions. Questions about whether these meetings prioritize public interest or corporate gain remain unanswered. Furthermore, the involvement of major corporations in funding Trump’s inauguration has prompted scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest and the influence of money in shaping policy.","President-elect Donald Trump shared on social media that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates had requested a meeting with him.

Allegations against influencers

Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has banned several prominent financial influencers, including Ravindra Balu Bharti and Nasiruddin Ansari , for their alleged role in disseminating inaccurate investment tips. The regulatory crackdown follows a growing trend of social media personalities leveraging their popularity to promote dubious stock recommendations, often at the expense of unsuspecting retail investors.Separately, the regulator took down more than 15,000 ‘content sites’ by unregulated financial influencers as part of its efforts to protect investors. The regulatory body’s crackdown aims to protect retail investors from falling prey to unverified and harmful financial tips.Among those penalized were well-known influencers like Ravindra Balu Bharti, Nasiruddin Ansari and others. Ansari runs a profile on X (formerly Twitter) by the name of 'Baap of Chart' where he offers buy/sell recommendations in the stock market. Sebi has asked Ansari and associates to open an escrow account and deposit Rs 17 crore, which will be used only for refunding investors/ complainants who had availed the investment advisory services.Further, the regulator has imposed a penalty of Rs 20 lakh on Ansari, Rs 2 lakh each on Padamati, Tabraiz Abdullah, Wani, GSVPL, Mansha Abdullah, and Vamshi. SEBI has also barred Shubhangi Ravindra Bharti, Rahul Ananta Gosavi and Dhanashri Chandrakant Giri from accessing the securities markets. These individuals had built large followings by positioning themselves as financial experts but were found to have breached SEBI’s regulations.SEBI’s investigations revealed that these influencers promoted specific stocks without adequate disclaimers and failed to disclose conflicts of interest. Many were accused of accepting payments from companies in exchange for endorsements. Such practices not only misled investors but also artificially manipulated stock prices, violating market integrity.The rise of finfluencers or financial influencers has been fueled by social media platforms, where many claim to offer quick and lucrative investment strategies. While some provide genuine insights, others exploit their followers’ trust for personal gain. SEBI’s actions underscore the importance of regulatory oversight to ensure transparency and accountability in the financial advice ecosystem.","SEBI has banned several prominent financial influencers, including Ravindra Balu Bharti and Nasiruddin Ansari.

OpenAI issues statement

Suchir Balaji , a 26-year-old Indian-origin former OpenAI employee, was discovered dead in his Buchanan Street apartment on Thanksgiving Day last week. The San Francisco Medical Examiner’s Office ruled the death as suicide, with no signs of foul play. Days after, his mother Poornima Ramarao has opened up about her son’s death. In an interview with Business Insider, his mother revealed that Balaji had grown increasingly disillusioned with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly OpenAI’s shift toward commercialization with ChatGPT .Poornima Ramarao said, “He felt AI is a harm to humanity,” describing how her son, Suchir Balaji, transitioned from boundless optimism about AI’s potential to profound skepticism. Reflecting on his tragic death, she added, “It doesn’t look like a normal situation.”Suchir Balaji worked at OpenAI for nearly four years before resigning in August this year. One of his early contributions, a project called WebGPT , is credited with laying the groundwork for ChatGPT.Balaji had openly voiced concerns about potential copyright violations by OpenAI and other AI firms, particularly the use of copyrighted material to train generative AI models like ChatGPT. These concerns drew attention amid a growing wave of lawsuits from writers, programmers, and journalists accusing AI companies of unauthorized use of their work.Expressing its condolences following the passing of the former researcher, OpenAI has released a statement on Thursday, December 26. The company confirmed its support for Balaji's family during this challenging time. The statement, shared on OpenAI's newsroom, marks exactly one month since Balaji's death on November 26.“We were devastated to learn of this tragic news and have been in touch with Suchir's family to offer our full support,” the statement read. “Our priority is to continue to do everything we can to assist them.”","Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old Indian-origin former OpenAI employee, was discovered dead in his Buchanan Street apartment on Thanksgiving Day last week.

Here’s what the union minister wrote on X

Zero tolerance for consumer exploitation!!

This Prima Facie looks like Unfair Trade Practice where the cab-aggregators are alleged to be using Differential Pricing based on the factors mentioned in the article below. If so, this is blatant dis-regard to Consumer’s right to know. I have directed @jagograhakjago through CCPA to conduct a detailed inquiry into this and submit a report at the earliest. Have asked the department to look into other sectors as well like, food delivery apps, online ticket booking apps etc.

Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Pralhad Joshi said that the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) will investigate ride-hailing apps like Ola Uber and Rapido for allegedly charging different fares for identical rides on Android and Apple devices. Joshi expressed concern over what he described as a ""prima facie unfair trade practice"" and a ""blatant disregard"" for consumers' right to transparency. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Joshi said that he has directed the consumer protection watchdog to carry out a thorough inquiry and submit a report as soon as possible.“Zero tolerance for consumer exploitation !” Joshi emphasized, responding to media reports that revealed price discrepancies between mobile platforms – Android and iOS mainly, for the same journey. The investigation will also expand to other sectors, including food delivery and ticket booking apps, he said.",The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) will investigate ride-hailing apps like Ola Uber and Rapido for allegedly charging different fares for identical rides on Android and Apple devices.

This new feature eliminates the wait time previously required for processing before viewing. This improvement follows a major overhaul of Drive's video player in October, which introduced a refreshed user interface and new playback controls.These video-focused upgrades are part of a broader effort by Google to enhance Drive's functionality. Last week, the company introduced an improved document scanner to the cloud storage platform. In 2024, Google added multiple new features to its cloud storage service, making it more than just a basic storage solution. Google Drive now boasts a range of functionalities, including automated backup tools and advanced sharing options.The importance of Google Drive's new instant video playback feature lies in how it addresses the platform's video processing. While Drive preserves the original uploaded video file for download, it also creates a stream-optimised version for its built-in player, similar to YouTube's transcoding process.However, this transcoding can take considerable time. Now, users can start watching their videos immediately after uploading, even though sharing through the Drive player still requires processing to complete. This is a notable improvement for users who frequently work with video files, as it allows for quicker identification and access to content within uploaded clips.","Google Drive now allows users to stream videos immediately after they are uploaded.

North Korea’s cyber warfare: A growing threat

In a significant cybersecurity breach, a North Korean hacking group has stolen over $300 million worth of cryptocurrency from DMM Bitcoin, a Japan-based exchange, according to reports from Japanese police and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The theft, which occurred in late May 2024, highlights the growing threat of cybercrime linked to North Korea 's extensive and well-established hacking operations. The incident underscores the increasing use of cryptocurrency theft as a method of generating illicit revenue, with global implications for both the cryptocurrency industry and international cybersecurity efforts. The cyberattack, attributed to the ""TraderTraitor"" group, is believed to be a part of the infamous Lazarus Group, which has a history of cyberattacks tied to North Korea's government. The FBI and Japanese authorities are working in tandem to investigate the breach and prevent future attacks.The DMM Bitcoin breach was carried out through a highly sophisticated social engineering scheme that allowed North Korean cyber actors to infiltrate the exchange's systems. According to the FBI's report, the attackers targeted an employee of a different cryptocurrency wallet software company through LinkedIn. Posing as a recruiter, the hacker initiated contact with the employee and sent them what appeared to be a pre-employment test. However, the test was a cleverly disguised phishing attempt that contained malicious code. When the employee unknowingly executed the file, it granted the hacker access to their system.This seemingly minor breach gave the attacker the opportunity to impersonate the employee and manipulate legitimate transactions within DMM Bitcoin’s infrastructure. By May 2024, the hacker was able to exploit this access to authorize the transfer of 4,502.9 Bitcoin, a sum worth $308 million at the time of the theft. The cryptocurrency was subsequently moved to an external wallet controlled by the perpetrators. This method of attack, leveraging human error and exploiting trust in digital communications, is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities in the cybersecurity landscape, particularly when employees are targeted as the entry point.The TraderTraitor group, responsible for the heist, is believed to be part of Lazarus Group, a notorious hacking collective linked to North Korea's government. Lazarus gained global attention in 2014 after it was accused of orchestrating a cyberattack on Sony Pictures in retaliation for the release of The Interview, a satirical film that mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Since then, Lazarus has been implicated in a series of high-profile cyberattacks, including the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, which affected organizations worldwide.The FBI's detailed analysis and investigation into the DMM Bitcoin incident confirm the link between TraderTraitor and Lazarus, further cementing the group’s role in North Korea’s broader cyber warfare strategy. Lazarus has been accused of using cybercrime as a means to generate revenue for the North Korean regime, bypassing international sanctions and supporting the country's economy in the face of increasing global isolation.North Korea’s cyber warfare program, which traces its origins to the mid-1990s, has evolved into a formidable force. According to a 2020 U.S. military report, the country now operates a highly specialized unit known as Bureau 121. This unit is reportedly made up of 6,000 cyber operatives working from various countries to carry out a range of cyber operations, including espionage, sabotage, and financial theft.Cryptocurrency has increasingly become a central element of North Korea’s financial strategy. With international sanctions severely limiting the country’s access to the global financial system, North Korean cybercriminals have turned to digital currencies as a way to generate illicit revenue. Cryptocurrencies, with their decentralized and pseudonymous nature, present an attractive target for cybercriminals, offering a way to bypass traditional banking systems and launder stolen funds more effectively.The theft from DMM Bitcoin is just one example of how North Korea has leveraged cryptocurrency for its own financial gains. In addition to direct thefts like the one at DMM, the regime has been linked to a variety of other cyber activities aimed at accumulating digital currencies. These activities include hacking cryptocurrency exchanges, stealing wallets, and exploiting vulnerabilities in blockchain technologies. The proceeds from these operations are believed to fund the country’s weapons programs, military expenditures, and the regime’s continued defiance of international sanctions.The DMM Bitcoin breach has broader implications for the global cryptocurrency industry, which is still grappling with how to secure its infrastructure against sophisticated attacks. Cryptocurrency exchanges, digital wallets, and blockchain technology companies are increasingly becoming targets of cyberattacks, and incidents like the one involving DMM Bitcoin highlight the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures.In response to the theft, the FBI, Japan’s National Police Agency, and other international law enforcement agencies have launched joint efforts to track down those responsible and prevent similar incidents in the future. As part of this effort, authorities are focusing on uncovering the tactics used by North Korean hackers and improving the resilience of the cryptocurrency sector against cyber threats.The DMM Bitcoin theft also brings attention to the role of international cooperation in combating cybercrime. As cryptocurrency transactions often transcend national borders, it is essential for governments and law enforcement agencies to collaborate closely in addressing the global nature of these crimes.North Korea's cyber activities are not limited to cryptocurrency thefts. The regime has consistently used cyber tools for a wide range of operations, including espionage, disruption of critical infrastructure, and attacks on foreign businesses and governments. Bureau 121, which is believed to be behind many of these attacks, represents one of the largest and most advanced state-sponsored cyber programs in the world.The capabilities of North Korean hackers continue to evolve, and the country's cyber operations are expected to remain a significant threat to global cybersecurity for the foreseeable future. As the use of cyber warfare becomes more prevalent in international conflicts, nations and organizations worldwide will need to adapt their defenses to address this growing risk.","A North Korean hacking group has stolen over $300 million worth of cryptocurrency from DMM Bitcoin, a Japan-based exchange.

Difficulties that Foxconn may face



Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn is diversifying its manufacturing operations globally to lessen its reliance on China. The company which is also the biggest global supplier of Apple’s iPhones expects potential tariffs from the US on Chinese imports amid rising trade tensions . The company has spent millions of dollars over the past two years expanding its operations worldwide. This includes a recent $33 million purchase of a 10-acre tract north of Houston for expansion, as well as investments in new factories in India and Mexico and further commitments in Thailand, reports the New York Times (NYT).These moves come as US President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to impose tariffs on goods imported from China, among other countries, upon taking office next month. Foxconn, a major producer of consumer electronics, is reportedly preparing for such a scenario for several years.Foxconn's chairman, Young Liu, recently explained that the company's strategic expansion worldwide is designed to mitigate the impact of expected tariffs. During a forum in Taipei, Liu told reporters, ""The impact on us is likely smaller compared to our competitors,"" after the company closed its Texas deal. The company’s newly acquired Texas land, located adjacent to one of its existing warehouses, is slated for development related to the company's AI operations .Apart from this, Foxconn's global expansion includes hundreds of millions of dollars invested in land and equipment for new factories. These include facilities in India's Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for iPhone production and in Mexico's Jalisco for AI server manufacturing. Additionally, a Foxconn subsidiary received approval from Thailand's government for a $300 million investment in its computer chip component business, earlier this month.Foxconn's global expansion reflects a broader trend among multinational companies, especially in Asia, to diversify supply chains and shift manufacturing away from China. This restructuring was spurred by the trade war initiated during the previous administration and is further driven by the prospect of new tariffs.While companies hope this diversification will lessen the impact of potential upcoming tariffs, replicating the manufacturing ecosystem that benefited from years of government-backed infrastructure investment in China will be challenging, the NYT report claims.Despite previous investments in smaller factories abroad, none have matched the scale or revenue generation of Foxconn's Chinese operations. However, last year, Foxconn's chairman vowed to change that.3","Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn is diversifying its manufacturing operations globally to lessen its reliance on China.

Samsung plans big for India's AC market; to launch over a dozen models with 'connected features' and more,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-plans-big-for-indias-ac-market-to-launch-over-a-dozen-models-with-connected-features-and-more/articleshow/116691907.cms,"Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to come with Galaxy AI features

After a record-breaking summer for air conditioner sales in India, Samsung India is set to relaunch its residential AC business with a focus on premium, smart features. The company plans to introduce over a dozen inverter AC models in its 2025 lineup within the next few weeks, expanding its offerings to 15-16 SKUs, according to industry sources.These new room air conditioners (RACs) will incorporate Samsung's Bespoke AI solutions , targeting consumers seeking high-end ACs with advanced features. This move marks Samsung's return to a market where it once held a significant position, boasting over 15% market share in 2014-15 before shifting focus to other product categories like mobile phones and smart TVs.The Indian appliance market is currently experiencing a trend of premiumization, with consumers increasingly willing to pay more for energy-efficient and connected devices. Samsung aims to capitalize on this trend, projecting double-digit volume growth in its RAC segment in 2025. While Samsung sold approximately half a million units in 2024, holding a low single-digit market share, the company anticipates achieving a double-digit share with its new Bespoke AI-powered lineup in the highly competitive Indian RAC market.The Indian RAC market, estimated at around 11 million units, is dominated by established players like Voltas, LG, Daikin, BlueStar, Hitachi-Johnson, Panasonic, and Lloyd. The industry saw exceptional sales growth of 30-40% in May and June due to a severe heatwave. Factors such as rising temperatures, urbanization, and increasing incomes are driving demand for ACs in India. The market is also evolving with the availability of more energy-efficient models and increased domestic manufacturing of components.While an email to Samsung India for comment went unanswered at the time of reporting, the company's re-entry into the RAC market signals a renewed focus on this growing segment.","Samsung India is set to relaunch its residential AC business with a focus on premium, smart features.

US Attorney for DC Ed Martin sends warning letter to Wikimedia Foundation: Wikipedia breaking US law about ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-attorney-for-dc-ed-martin-sends-warning-letter-to-wikimedia-foundation-wikipedia-breaking-us-law-about-/articleshow/120675449.cms,"Representative Image

The warning letter has an Israel angle to it

Attorney's letter to Wikipedia also targets Google and other Big Tech

Ed Martin , the interim Attorney for the District of Columbia, has formally challenged the nonprofit status of the Wikimedia Foundation, the organization that operates Wikipedia . In a letter obtained by The Free Press, Martin raises concerns that the online encyclopedia is engaging in activities that may violate its obligations as a tax-exempt organization under U.S. law. The letter signals a potential threat to the Wikimedia Foundation 's Section 501(c)(3) status, suggesting Martin may seek to have its tax-exempt charitable designation revoked.According to Section 501(c)(3) of Title 26 of U.S. law, tax-exempt entities must operate exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, public safety testing, literary, or educational purposes. Martin alleges that Wikipedia is failing this criterion by ""allowing foreign actors to manipulate information and spread propaganda,"" including through the ""rewriting"" of historical events and other actions that he claims implicate US national security and interests.""Masking propaganda that influences public opinion under the guise of providing informational material is antithetical to Wikimedia’s ‘educational’ mission,"" Martin wrote, stating that his office has received information indicating Wikipedia's ""policies benefit foreign powers."" While the Wikimedia Foundation is headquartered in San Francisco, it is also registered as a corporation and conducts fundraising activities in D.C.The letter does not identify the specific foreign actors allegedly involved or provide concrete examples of the purported propaganda. However, a source familiar with Martin's concerns indicated a focus on ""edits on Wikipedia as they relate to the Israel-Hamas conflict that are clearly targeted against Israel to benefit other countries.""This concern aligns with a recent report from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in March, which claimed that ""at least 30 Wikipedia editors acted in concert to circumvent Wikipedia’s policies to introduce antisemitic narratives, anti-Israel bias, and misleading information.""Previous reporting by Pirate Wires also alleged that anti-Israel editors on Wikipedia have ""hijacked the Israel-Palestine narrative"" by removing key facts and promoting pro-Hamas viewpoints.In his letter, Martin also highlights the practice of search engines like Google ""prioritizing Wikipedia"" in search results. He argues that Wikipedia articles are often ""biased, unreliable, or sourced by entities who wish to do harm to the United States."" These allegations follow a February editorial in the New York Post criticizing Wikipedia for allegedly ""blacklisting"" conservative news sources. Wikipedia's ""reliable sources"" guideline does indeed rate various websites for accuracy, with several conservative publications, including Ben Shapiro’s Daily Wire, Fox News, and National Review, receiving lower ratings.Martin has posed several questions to the Wikimedia Foundation, demanding information on its measures to ""safeguard"" the public from propaganda and its efforts to exclude ""foreign influence operatives from making targeted edits"" on topics that could ""reshape or rewrite history."" He has set a deadline of May 15th for the Foundation to respond to his inquiries.","Attorney's letter to Wikipedia also targets Google and other Big Tech.

Full statement of the University of Waterloo on cheating in coding competition

The University of Waterloo has made the unprecedented decision to cancel the results of its annual Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) due to widespread suspected cheating involving artificial intelligence (AI). As first reported by The Logic, the university cited a ""significant number of students"" who breached the competition's regulations. In a statement, the university expressed its disappointment, noting that the rule violations would negatively impact deserving students. Officials added that they are actively ""considering possible ways to address this problem for future contests."" The University of Waterloo is among the biggest Universties in Cananda.The University of Waterloo's Centre for Computing and Math acted after uncovering multiple cases of students submitting code that wasn’t their own. The CCC is a crucial event for many aspiring students, as strong performance can significantly enhance their applications to Waterloo's highly regarded computing and engineering programs. Furthermore, the competition serves as a pathway for students to qualify for teams representing Canada in international informatics competitions.The CCC attracts talented students globally, drawn by the opportunity to strengthen their prospects of admission to Waterloo's competitive STEM fields. The university boasts a distinguished alumni network in these areas, including prominent figures such as RBC Chief Executive Dave McKay, BlackBerry founder Mike Lazaridis, and Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya. The cancellation underscores the growing challenges educational institutions face in maintaining academic integrity in the age of increasingly sophisticated AI tools.Normally, official results from the CCC would be released shortly after the contest. For this year’s contest, however, we will not be releasing official results. The reason for this is the significant number of students who violated the CCC Rules. In particular, it is clear that many students submitted code that they did not write themselves, relying instead on forbidden external help. As such, the reliability of “ranking” students would neither be equitable, fair, or accurate.The consequences of not releasing official results will come as a disappointment to the majority of students who wrote the contest with integrity and honesty. It is disappointing that the students who violated the CCC Rules will impact those students who are deserving of recognition.We are considering possible ways to address this problem for future contests.","University of Waterloo cancels results of its annual Canadian Computing Competition due to widespread suspected cheating involving artificial intelligence.

Mark Zuckerberg's Education Ventures

The Primary School , a no-cost private institution in the Bay Area co-founded by Priscilla Chan , wife of Facebook parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , will reportedly cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students. First reported by Bloomberg, the impending closure was disclosed in a statement posted on the school's website recently. In a move aimed at preserving its legacy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the billionaire couple's philanthropic arm, has committed $50 million to invest in the communities the school serves -— specifically East Palo Alto, Belle Haven, and the East Bay region near San Francisco -- over the subsequent few years.""This was a very difficult decision, and we are committed to ensuring a thoughtful and supportive transition for students and families over the next year,"" the online statement conveyed. Carson Cook, a spokesperson for The Primary School, stated there would be no further comment beyond the official announcement.Pediatrician Priscilla Chan, 40, co-established The Primary School in 2016, implementing an ""integrated health and education model"" designed to support families and children from birth through high school, according to the organization's tax filings. The school's inaugural middle school cohort commenced in 2023.The most recent tax documentation indicates that over 95% of The Primary School's students in East Palo Alto identify as under-represented minorities. The filing also revealed the nonprofit held assets exceeding $30 million as of the end of June 2023.The Primary School is among several educational endeavors recently initiated by prominent billionaires. Elon Musk , Jeff Bezos, and Larry Ellison have all established schools in recent years. Musk's nonprofit, the Musk Foundation, has contributed $237 million to his technology-focused primary and secondary school in Austin, named Ad Astra, with future aspirations for a university. Ad Astra collaborates with the same entity that assisted Ellison in establishing his Hala Kahiki Montessori school in Lanai, Hawaii, an island largely owned by the Oracle co-founder. Amazon.com founder Bezos has created a network of Montessori-inspired preschools catering to children in underserved communities.The closure of The Primary School coincides with significant strategic shifts within Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms Inc. as the 40-year-old founder appears to be aligning his business interests more closely with the Trump administration. Recent appointments to Meta's board include longtime Trump allies Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, and Dina Powell McCormick, who served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser during his first term.Furthermore, Zuckerberg has appointed a Republican strategist as chief of global affairs, eliminated Meta’s US fact-checking program, rolled back the company’s hate-speech policies, and discontinued key diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at both Meta and CZI. This contrasts with The Primary School's documented commitment to diversity, which included conducting a diversity audit in June 2020 following the Black Lives Matter protests and forming a DEI task force in the fall of that year.","The Primary School will cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students.

After his visit to the historical site, Vance shared photos from his X handle, and received a reply from Elon Musk “Today I visited the Taj Mahal with Usha and the kids,” Vance said in the post on X with three photos.“It's a beautiful historic site, and I'm grateful for the warm welcome we received there!” he added.Elon Musk replied to his post, saying, “One of the most beautiful wonders of the world.”JD Vance also recorded his impressions in the visitor's diary, describing the Taj Mahal as “amazing” and a “testament to true love, human ingenuity, and a tribute to the great country of India.”The Vance family landed at Agra airport on Wednesday (April 23) after traveling from Jaipur. They were received by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who presented them with floral greetings.The CM subsequently expressed his welcome on X, stating, “A warm welcome to Hon'ble US Vice President Mr. JD. Vance and his family to Uttar Pradesh, the sacred heartland of India, renowned for its timeless devotion, vibrant culture, and spiritual legacy.”The Vance family, including sons Ewan and Vivek and daughter Mirabel, drove from the airport to the Taj Mahal.Security measures were stringent for the visit.

Implications for global research

Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law, which restricts the sharing of “important data” with overseas partners without approval. The suspension impacts joint research in fields like health and environmental studies , raising questions about the future of international scientific cooperation .Implemented in 2021, China’s Data Security Law broadly defines “important data” as information that could threaten national or economic interests or affect the rights of individuals or organisations. European agencies, including the German Research Foundation , Swedish Research Council, and Swiss National Science Foundation, have expressed concerns over the law’s vague provisions, which make it difficult to assess compliance and avoid legal liabilities.The law requires security clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China to export data classified as “important,” effectively making cross-border data sharing extremely challenging. This has led to the suspension of new co-funded projects with China’s National Natural Science Foundation.The halt in collaborations could delay progress in critical areas like pandemic response and air quality studies, where data sharing is essential. Experts warn that the restrictions may hinder the ability to address global health challenges effectively.Jan Palmowski, Secretary-General of the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities, emphasised the need for responsible and safe data sharing to tackle future pandemics and other health crises.","Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law.

Poll Do you believe artificial intelligence can significantly improve rare disease diagnosis? No, not really Yes, definitely

What is DxGPT and how it works



Microsoft software developer Julian Isla spent a distressful year seeking answers for his infant son Sergio's unexplained seizures before finally discovering he had Dravet syndrome , a rare and severe neurological disorder. Frustrated by repeated misdiagnoses and inadequate medical resources, Isla envisioned using artificial intelligence to revolutionise rare disease diagnosis . Motivated by his family's ordeal, he co-founded Foundation 29 in 2017 to harness AI for faster, more accurate medical insights. Further inspired by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella ’s personal story of raising a child with cerebral palsy, Isla became a leading advocate for using technology to transform healthcare for families in need.The nonprofit’s initial achievement was creating a clinical-grade diagnostic tool powered by basic AI algorithms. By 2023, they elevated their innovation with DxGPT , a next-generation diagnostic assistant powered by advanced language models and hosted on Microsoft’s Azure platform .DxGPT uses the GPT-4o and o1 models, trained on a combination of public medical resources and proprietary datasets from healthcare partners, to quickly analyse symptoms and suggest possible diagnoses within minutes. Designed with privacy in mind, the tool does not collect or store personal data and requires no user identifiers.Patients or caregivers can simply input a description of symptoms and receive an initial diagnostic summary, which doctors can later validate with tests and clinical expertise.Now freely accessible online, DxGPT offers a vital starting point for families facing complex health challenges, delivering faster, more accurate support when it’s needed most.","Microsoft software developer Julian Isla spent a distressful year seeking answers for his infant son Sergio's unexplained seizures.

When you're flying abroad, it's easy to get overwhelmed by details like rechecking flight schedules or ensuring proper travel documents. But one of the most crucial steps that the majority of tourists overlook is to charge their cell phones at airports—a seemingly harmless procedure that ends up exposing them to real security risks. Although charging your phone might seem an easy way of charging your phone in long queues, experts recommend that charging in public outlets at airports has serious consequences on your security and privacy.In the modern era of technology, smartphones are part of almost every activity associated with traveling, such as carrying boarding passes, flight information, and staying connected with family members. Airports offer conveniently placed charging stations where passengers can recharge their phones prior to travel. Such charging stations are filled with security threats that are alien to the general public. Jae Ro, a security expert at SIGNAL + POWER, explains that accessing these stations risks exposing passengers to high security threats.Even a charge on your phone could be seen as something innocuous to do, because public charging points are accessible by hackers. Ro reports that malware can be injected by cyberhackers using infected charging points, and this malware will not be seen in your phone. This malware steals data that is personal in nature such as passwords, banking details, and personal information. The clandestine threat posed by these charging points is the greatest concern to travelers, who access their phones for vital information.One of the most frightening threats of airport charging points is a method known as juice jacking. It happens when cyber attackers infect USB ports with malware, enabling them to steal your information straight from your phone or even lock it. This vulnerability, according to Ro, is because data and power travel via the same cable when charging a phone. If your charging port has been compromised, the attackers are able to utilize this connection to access your information without your knowledge. Now that you've infected your device, it's not only a risk when you're at the airport. Ro indicates that the infected device would also be hazardous when you are leaving the airport since the malware is persistent and it is accessible from where you are no matter how far. Thus, your confidential details remain at risk of misuse for a considerable length of time and cause data exposure or identity theft.Even if the charging station appears to be safe, there is always a possibility of unauthorized data exposure. Charging stations not only supply power, but they also transfer data between your device and the station. Although smartphones typically prompt users to select between ""Charge only"" or ""Transfer files"" modes, this security feature is simple to disable in public charging stations.Ro informs us that since we have no authority over such charging stations, your phone becomes open to interception of data. In case the hackers access your phone via an unsecured charging station, your bank details or travel tickets may be stolen by them. Your information can either be sold in the dark web or used to commit identity theft. Given how much information about ourselves we carry on our phones these days, from bank account numbers to passport information, the stakes are high.The risks associated with public charging points have not escaped the notice of the authorities. In 2024, the FBI issued a public alert warning travellers against the use of complimentary charging terminals at airports, hotels, shopping centers, or at any other public point. The agency's alert states that the security threats presented by such charging terminals are real, and travellers need to try alternative ways of charging their mobile devices to remain secure.The most secure way of charging your phone without malware or data being stolen is using a portable charger. This renders the use of public charging stations, which could be compromised, unnecessary.Prior to charging your phone at a public charging point, turn off any data transmitting functionality on your device. This will ensure no data is transmitted unintentionally and that your information cannot be intercepted.When you plug in your phone to a public charging point, make sure that it's on ""charge only"" mode. This prevents any data stealing or malicious software from being installed on your phone while you're charging it.","Airports offer conveniently placed charging stations where passengers can recharge their phones prior to travel.

"Scientists have discovered a new colour, 'Olo,' visible only through laser technology; here’s what it means",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/scientists-have-discovered-a-new-colour-olo-visible-only-through-laser-technology-heres-what-it-means/articleshow/120660072.cms,"How scientists used Oz technology to reveal a new colour



What does the new colour Olo actually look like



Poll What do you think about the concept of an invisible color like Olo? Confusing and unnecessary Fascinating and innovative

Is Olo really a new colour



Potential future uses of Olo technology in vision correction



Understanding colour perception through the lens of Olo



In a stunning breakthrough, scientists have discovered a new colour named Olo. There's just one catch: it's entirely invisible to the human eye. Defined as a deeply saturated teal, this enigmatic new colour has been perceived by just a few people with the help of specialized laser technology . The groundbreaking research, led by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Washington School of Medicine, was released in Science Advances on April 18, 2025.The process of finding Olo is something straight out of a science fiction book. Scientists created a method called Oz — named after The Wizard of Oz — to ""fool"" the human eye into seeing a colour that would otherwise be invisible to the eye. With minute laser light micro-pulses of precise energy, the researchers specifically addressed individual photoreceptors in the retina without activating adjacent ones. Describing the problem, Ren Ng, UC Berkeley professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences, stated, ""There's no wavelength in the world that can stimulate only the M cone."" Addressing this issue, the researchers created a means of stimulating only a single kind of cone cell selectively.Austin Roorda, one of the professors working on the project, likened the Oz technique to a microscope for the retina. It enabled them to shoot laser beams directly at individual cone cells with great precision, producing a colour — Olo — which no human had ever seen naturally before.Since Olo cannot be achieved through any regular screen or medium, you would perhaps ask yourself: what does it look like? From the very few individuals — only five, including some of the scientists involved — who have viewed it through the Oz system, Olo looks more like an over-charged teal. Austin Roorda said it was ""a profoundly saturated teal,"" adding that even the richest natural colourings seem pale in comparison with Olo.In spite of this explanation, no photo, digital image, or colour chip can recreate Olo. It is exclusively contained in the immediate stimulation of the human retina, rendering it one of the most unusual visual experiences in the world — at least until now.The question, of course, arises: is Olo a new colour, or just a new experience of colour? Technically, Olo is not a new wavelength of light produced by nature. Rather, it is a latent colour, always there in theory, but not visible because of the constraints of human vision. Francis Windram, an Imperial College London research associate, added that, sociolinguistically speaking, naming and acknowledging a hitherto unseen colour such as Olo could actually make it seem like an actual ""new"" colour to mankind. Thus, although Olo has been quietly present in the universe all along, it was technological innovation that finally brought it to light.Apart from its wow factor, the finding of Olo and the creation of the Oz laser technology have broader implications for medicine — especially in curing colour blindness. Scientists think that in the future, technology based on the Oz technique may assist individuals with certain types of colour blindness like deuteranomaly, which causes green colour vision impairment. Francis Windram described how if lasers could precisely stimulate particular cone cells, it might in theory restore better colour vision.But the technical hurdles are high. Striking the right cones reliably in a moving, living eye is very hard. As Windram noted, although the concept is intriguing, it could be a long time before such a device is practical for routine vision correction.The discovery of Olo also sheds light on the broader mystery of how colour perception varies across species. Humans possess three types of cone cells, allowing us to perceive a range of colours based on red, green, and blue light. By comparison, animals such as mantis shrimp have as many as 12 different kinds of colour receptors. These allow them to see a blinding range of colours, even ultraviolet. At the same time, dogs have only two cones and primarily perceive colour in shades of yellow and blue.As Windram pointed out, colour vision relies on three factors: the physical nature of light, the neurological processing of the brain, and the social aspects — how we classify and label colours. Infamous phenomena such as the viral controversy over the dress in 2015 demonstrate just how subjective our experience of colour can be.","Scientists have discovered a new colour named Olo.

A tough moment and the road ahead

Autonauts,

This is a hard message to write.

Over the past few weeks, we have had to make the difficult decision to part ways with around 200 of our teammates across various functions. Every person impacted gave this company their time, energy, and belief. That matters deeply, and we are genuinely grateful.

This is not about how hard someone worked. This is about the bets we placed and where we got it wrong.

More than performance, this is about structure.

We’ve always believed in moving fast. We’ve always pushed to build big. But the hard truth is: speed without enough clarity is expensive. And when the math doesn’t add up, it is on us to reset.

Over the last few months, we realised that some projects did not deliver what we expected. Some roles were added too early. A few hypotheses simply didn’t hold when tested. And in some cases, we couldn’t offer the kind of growth or learning that people truly deserve.

It is easy to blame the market or external factors. But the responsibility is ours. When the plan doesn’t work, you don’t blame the players, you take responsibility, and change the plan.

Yes, we made mistakes.

I wish we hadn’t, but when you're building something hard, failures are part of the journey. The most challenging part is when those failures affect our teammates. That’s not easy to accept.

But I truly believe this: CARS24 and our Autonauts get stronger with every experience. Tough times don’t last. Tough people do.

So we are course-correcting now. Fewer things, done better. That’s the shift. It may sound obvious, but when you’re in motion constantly, it’s easy to lose balance.

The exercise is now behind us.

From here, we focus entirely on rebuilding stronger, with clarity and care.

You are not alone. We are here to help you land on your feet, and to walk with you through this transition.

To those impacted: We’re here for you, offering severance support, resume and LinkedIn assistance, mentorship, emotional wellness resources, and access to open roles within our network. Your managers and people team have already reached out to you. We are here for you, not just in words, but in action. Our first priority is to ensure the smoothest possible transition for you and your families. If you are facing financial hardship, whether due to medical issues, family emergencies, or any other reason, please know you are not alone. That’s why we have created a Compassion Fund: a way to stand by those who need extra support right now. We will look at every case with care, dignity, and urgency, and do our very best to provide help where it is needed most. This is our commitment to be there for our Autonauts in the moments that matter most. Even if you don’t need financial help, please know: we are still here for you in every way we can be. You are, and will always be, part of the Autonaut family.

To those still here: I know this shakes confidence. Please don’t hold back. Speak your mind. Share what’s heavy. Let’s walk through this together. I’ll do my best to answer every question.

Wherever people go from here, I hope one thing stays true: That we each get to do work that pushes us, grows us, and matters.

Today, more than ever, our values are not abstract words, they are practices.

Let’s keep building that kind of company together.

– Vikram

This comes after the competition watchdog found a prima facie case of abuse of dominant position by the tech giant. As part of the settlement (that Google applied under Section 48A of the Competition Act), the company has agreed to a 'New India Agreement'. This will allow Google to offer separate licences for the Play Store and Play Services on Android smart TVs in India. The latest agreement will even remove the need for TV manufacturers to bundle these licences or set default placement rules. The latest settlement follows previous penalties imposed on the company by the CCI in cases related to its Play Store policies and dominance in the Android mobile ecosystem.

‘I don't think it could be recreated': Chrome chief dismisses browser’s ‘existence’ without Google at US antitrust trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/i-dont-think-it-could-be-recreated-chrome-chief-dismisses-browsers-existence-without-google-at-us-antitrust-trial/articleshow/120645831.cms,"Representative Image

“Chrome today represents 17 years of collaboration between the Chrome people and the rest of Google. Trying to disentangle that is unprecedented. I don’t think it could be recreated,”

Google Chrome chief's concern with browser's ownership



Google Chrome ’s general manager, Parisa Tabriz , has said that the browser cannot ‘exist’ without the tech giant. During an antitrust trial in Washington, US, the company’s executive said that Google is the only company capable of supporting Chrome’s current feature set, due to its deep “interdependencies” with its parent company Alphabet’s infrastructure. Speaking before Judge Amit Mehta at the US Justice Department’s case, Tabriz explained that critical browser functions—like its safe browsing mode and password-breach alerts—draw on shared Google systems, which are beyond Chrome’s codebase. She argued that separating Chrome from the rest of the company would be an unprecedented technical challenge.Tabriz said to the court, as reported by Bloomberg.Tabriz said this as Judge Mehta presides over a three-week hearing to determine what changes Google must make to its business practices, after last year’s finding that the company illegally monopolised the search market.The US Justice Department wants Google to divest its Chrome browser and provide a portion of its collected data for use in competing search results. It also asked Judge Mehta to prohibit Google from paying to secure default search-engine status—a restriction that would extend to its AI offerings, including Gemini, which the government argues benefited from Google’s unlawful search monopoly.Google’s Chrome browser, which holds roughly 66% of the global market as of March, is built atop the open-source Chromium Project and accepts contributions from companies like Meta, Microsoft and the Linux Foundation.During the Justice Department’s antitrust remedies hearing, Harvard professor James Mickens testified that spinning off Chrome to a new owner “is feasible from a technical perspective” and could be done “without breaking too much” of its functionality; he added that Google would still have incentives to maintain Chromium for Android and other uses, the report noted.However, Tabriz countered that by saying that Google has supplied over 90% of Chromium’s code since 2015 and invests hundreds of millions annually in its development.She noted, “Google invests hundreds of millions of dollars into Chromium,” estimating that 1,000 engineers in her division have worked on the project. Tabriz added that other companies “are not contributing now in any meaningful way.”","Google Chrome's general manager, Parisa Tabriz, has said that the browser cannot ‘exist’ without the tech giant.

"Elon Musk calls Google-owned Waymo ‘expensive’, former robotaxi company CEO fires back: ‘They've failed utterly and…’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-calls-google-owned-waymo-expensive-former-robotaxi-company-ceo-fires-back-theyve-failed-utterly-and/articleshow/120643110.cms,"What Musk said during earnings call

Google-owned Waymo’s former CEO has responded to the remarks made by Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the self-driving car project during the company’s recent earnings call about Waymo's expensive sensor suite and its approach to autonomous driving. In a sharp rebuttal, John Krafcik – who led Waymo from 2015 to 2021 – said that Tesla has yet to demonstrate any real-world competitive presence in the robotaxi market. Musk projected a rapid expansion to “millions” of fully autonomous Teslas by the second half of next year.“Tesla has never competed with Waymo — they've never sold a robotaxi ride to a public rider, but they've sold a lot of cars,” Krafcik said in an email to Business Insider.“And although Tesla hopes to compete with Waymo someday, they've failed utterly and completely at this for each of the 10 years they've been talking about it,” he added.Musk informed the investors that the initial “pilot” rollout in Austin this June will consist of 10 to 20 robotaxis, which will be Tesla Model Y cars. He also claimed that Tesla will have a market-share domination of “99% or something ridiculous.”Musk touted Tesla’s camera-based, “generalised” AI approach as superior to Waymo's lidar-heavy, pre-mapped strategy, claiming it would lead to lower costs and higher production volumes.“The issue with Waymo's cars is it costs way more money,” Musk said.While Tesla is said to adapt to various driving environments without the need of pre-mapping a particular region, Waymo maps out a city with its cars before deploying a robotaxi service.Krafcik dismissed Musk’s cost arguments, emphasising the importance of safety. He argued that the long-term cost of sensors is “trivial” compared to the “massive quantifiable safety benefits” they provide.Krafcik also cast doubt on Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, which is central to its robotaxi vision. Despite Tesla's claims and recent previews of its robotaxi app, he pointed to the lack of a fully autonomous, publicly available service.“Well, after 10 years of undelivered promises, it seems pretty rational for those watching to be data- and evidence-driven,” Krafcik said.“There's still a lot of promises, still no Tesla liability for FSD driving performance, and still no universal robotaxi service,” he added, while noting that Tesla's FSD has improved but stressed that this does not equate to a proven, safe and truly autonomous robotaxi service.","John Krafcik, who led Waymo from 2015 to 2021, said Tesla has yet to demonstrate any real-world competitive presence in the robotaxi market.

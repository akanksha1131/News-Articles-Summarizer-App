Hands-on AI experience essential for future success

Google DeepMind CEO and Nobel laureate Demis Hassabis says he would still prioritize STEM subjects if he were a student today, despite artificial intelligence's rapid transformation of the job market. Speaking at SXSW London on Monday, Hassabis emphasized that understanding mathematical and scientific fundamentals remains crucial even as AI reshapes entire industries.""It's still important to understand fundamentals"" in mathematics, physics, and computer science to comprehend ""how these systems are put together,"" Hassabis said. However, he stressed that modern students must also embrace AI tools to remain competitive in tomorrow's workforce.Hassabis predicts AI will create ""new very valuable jobs"" over the next five to 10 years, particularly benefiting ""technically savvy people who are at the forefront of using these technologies."" He compared AI's impact to the Industrial Revolution, expressing optimism about human adaptability despite widespread job displacement concerns.Beyond traditional education, Hassabis recommended that students gain practical experience with cutting-edge AI systems. ""I'd also be experimenting with all the latest AI systems and tools and seeing what's the best way of utilizing them and making use of them in useful and novel ways,"" he explained.The DeepMind leader believes today's children will become ""AI native"" similar to how previous generations grew up with the internet. This technological fluency will be essential as companies increasingly use AI for tasks like coding, with major tech firms including Meta, Microsoft, and Google already implementing these tools.At Google's recent I/O developer conference, Hassabis and Google cofounder Sergey Brin predicted artificial general intelligence—when AI matches or exceeds human capabilities—could arrive around 2030. This timeline underscores the urgency for students to prepare for an AI-dominated future.While some companies are reducing hiring for AI-replaceable roles, Hassabis maintains that the technology will ultimately ""supercharge"" workers who understand how to leverage these powerful new tools effectively.","Google DeepMind CEO and Nobel laureate Demis Hassabis says he would still prioritize STEM subjects if he were a student today.

Morgan Stanley is reportedly arranging a $5 billion debt package for Elon Musk’s AI company xAI Corp . According to a report in Bloomberg, quoting sources familiar with the matter, this marks another fundraising effort by the world's richest man Elon Musk across his business ventures. Launched on Monday (June 2), the debt package reportedly comprises a term loan B, a fixed-rate term loan, and senior secured notes, the source said, speaking anonymously as the information is not public. The funds will support general corporate purposes, with commitments due by June 17.The debt is reportedly tied to XAI Holdings, which encompasses Musk’s AI startup and his social-media platform X, formerly Twitter. xAI has been heavily investing in its Memphis data center, Colossus, which could benefit from the debt proceeds. The facility currently operates 200,000 GPUs for AI training, with plans to add 1 million more nearby, Musk revealed in a CNBC interview.This follows a report that xAI is raising $300 million through a stock sale.Bloomberg earlier reported that XAI Holdings was seeking $20 billion in funding, reflecting strong investor interest in AI and Musk’s influence as a business and political figure. Musk, a prominent supporter of President Donald Trump, recently stepped down from an administration role after driving significant government changes and placing allies in key positions following Trump’s reelection.Additionally, Musk’s Neuralink Corp. announced a $650 million Series-E funding round, backed by investors like ARK Invest, DFJ Growth, and Founders Fund.

Industry response and public backlash

A turning point for online adult content regulation

In an unprecedented move reflecting rising global concern over online child safety, the European Union has officially launched a formal investigation into several major adult content websites, including Pornhub , XNXX , XVideos , and Stripchat . These platforms, some of the most visited websites in the world, are now under scrutiny for allegedly failing to comply with key provisions of the EU’s landmark Digital Services Act (DSA). At the heart of the investigation is a single but vital issue: safeguarding children from exposure to explicit adult material online.As internet access becomes more ubiquitous and younger demographics increasingly consume content on digital platforms, regulatory bodies across the globe are tightening rules around content moderation, age verification, and online harm mitigation. The EU’s inquiry signals a pivotal shift in how mature content is regulated in cyberspace, especially with respect to child protection standards. The European Commission has accused these adult platforms of neglecting their legal obligations, particularly around effective age verification and risk assessments, setting the stage for a landmark regulatory showdown that could reshape the adult industry’s digital infrastructure.The European Commission announced on June 1, 2025, that it had initiated formal proceedings against four high-profile adult content platforms. The accused—Pornhub, XNXX, XVideos, and Stripchat—are suspected of violating the Digital Services Act (DSA), the EU’s sweeping legislation aimed at creating a safer and more transparent digital ecosystem.Key allegations include:As reported by The Economic Times, according to Henna Virkkunen, the EU’s chief of digital policy, ""The online space should be a safe environment for children to learn and connect. Our priority is to protect minors and allow them to navigate safely online.""Enacted in 2022 and fully enforceable as of 2024, the Digital Services Act (DSA) is one of the most comprehensive digital laws in the world. It applies to all digital services operating in the EU but places additional responsibilities on companies classified as Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs)—defined as those with more than 45 million monthly active users in the EU.Core DSA requirements include:While these platforms operate globally, their corporate registrations are primarily in EU member states or nearby countries, allowing the EU regulatory framework to apply with direct jurisdiction:Their physical and legal presence within EU territories grants the European Commission direct leverage in enforcing compliance with the Digital Services Act.Should the investigation conclude that these platforms are in breach of the DSA, the consequences could be severe. The most significant penalty available to the European Commission is a fine of up to 6% of the company’s global annual revenue. Given the massive user bases and significant revenue streams of these sites, such fines could amount to hundreds of millions of euros.Beyond financial penalties, the EU could also impose:Interestingly, one of the four platforms—Stripchat—is now on track to lose its classification as a VLOP. According to the Commission, its average monthly EU user count dropped below the 45 million threshold, and the platform will be officially delisted from the DSA’s VLOP registry in four months. However, this does not exempt it from basic DSA obligations or from ongoing investigations related to its past performance while still classified as a VLOP.As of now, the adult platforms in question have not issued comprehensive public responses. However, legal experts anticipate a strong pushback grounded in arguments related to technical feasibility, user privacy, and the limits of platform liability.Meanwhile, child safety advocacy groups have welcomed the probe. “The industry has operated in a legal grey zone for too long,” said a spokesperson from the European Alliance for Child Protection Online. “This is a necessary and long-overdue step to hold platforms accountable.”Public opinion remains mixed. While many support stronger child protection online, some privacy advocates warn that overly aggressive age verification systems could compromise user anonymity and personal freedoms.This investigation could serve as a precedent-setting case for how the world’s largest adult content websites are held accountable in democratic societies. As global governments increasingly prioritize digital safety, particularly for children, the EU’s firm stance may push other jurisdictions—such as the United States, Canada, and Australia—to introduce or tighten similar frameworks.Notably, the UK’s Online Safety Act has also introduced similar rules requiring pornographic websites to enforce age verification. Australia is conducting public consultations on age verification technology, while some U.S. states like Utah and Louisiana have passed laws mandating proof of age to access adult material.","Pornhub, XVideos, XNXX, and Stripchat are accused of violating the EU's Digital Services Act.

Meta , the tech giant behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has requested a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) high-profile antitrust case, just as the trial approaches a critical phase. According to the, the case, which began in early April, represents one of the most significant regulatory challenges faced by Meta in its history, potentially resulting in the breakup of the company’s social media empire.Meta's move to dismiss the case comes after the FTC rested its side of the argument, asserting that the company holds an illegal monopoly over the social networking market, particularly those platforms focused on friends-and-family connections. Meta, however, argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces from newer platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X (formerly known as Twitter).In a court filing late Thursday, Meta reiterated its stance that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standards required to prove its antitrust allegations. The company’s legal team argues that the FTC has fundamentally mischaracterized the social media market, claiming that the agency's definition is overly narrow and excludes significant competitors.“After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps).”Meta claims that it faces substantial competition from a wide range of digital platforms, including short-video giant TikTok, video-sharing platform YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X. These platforms, Meta argues, all compete for user engagement, advertising revenue, and market share, undercutting the FTC’s claim that Meta has maintained an unlawful monopoly.The FTC’s antitrust lawsuit, which was first filed in December 2020, centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market.In its filing, the FTC pointed to internal Meta communications as evidence of this strategy. This includes a 2012 email from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that buying Instagram would “neutralize a competitor.” The FTC further argues that these acquisitions reduced consumer choice and stifled innovation, limiting competition in the rapidly evolving social media industry.The FTC's case aims to convince U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, effectively dismantling the company's integrated social media ecosystem.Meta's defense in the trial has focused on presenting itself as a company that supports innovation and benefits consumers. In its Thursday filing, the company argued that its acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth, which in turn delivered significant benefits to users.“Meta’s acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth – with correspondingly massive benefits for US consumers,” the company stated in its court filing.However, the trial has also brought to light internal documents that may complicate Meta’s defense. For instance, a 2018 email from an unnamed Instagram executive warned that ""fake engagement could be in the range of 40%,"" potentially undermining Meta's claims about the platform’s integrity and user trust.Mark Zuckerberg himself was the first witness called by the FTC as the trial opened, highlighting the personal stakes for the Meta CEO. During his testimony, Zuckerberg sought to portray Meta as a company facing fierce competition, rather than a monopoly crushing potential rivals.Earlier in the trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified that he felt Zuckerberg viewed Instagram’s rapid growth as a potential threat to Facebook’s dominance after the acquisition, further fueling the FTC’s argument that Meta's mergers were designed to stifle competition.The 10-week non-jury trial, which is expected to conclude in June, will be followed by final briefs from both the FTC and Meta. If Judge Boasberg sides with the FTC, a second trial will be held to determine appropriate remedies, potentially including the forced divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp.Meta will continue presenting its defense when the trial resumes on Monday. The company’s attempt to dismiss the case outright remains a long shot, as the judge may choose to let the case proceed to its scheduled conclusion before issuing a ruling.","The FTC's antitrust lawsuit centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market. Meta argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121252048,imgsize-33102,width-400,resizemode-4/Mark-Zuckerbergs-Meta-seeks-mid-trial-dismissal-of-FTC-antitrust-battle.jpg"

"Jeff Bezos’ $165 billion divorce lesson: New bride Lauren gets prenup, not Amazon shares",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jeff-bezos-165-billion-divorce-lesson-new-bride-lauren-gets-prenup-not-amazon-shares/articleshow/121513202.cms,"Jeff Bezos’ $165 billion divorce lesson: New bride Lauren gets prenup, not Amazon shares

Bezos’ divorce bombshell: How a missing prenup created a $35 billion settlement

Bezos’ new romance, new rules: The $220 billion prenup strategy

Inside the billion-dollar prenup: Legal experts weigh in

When Jeff Bezos married MacKenzie Scott in 1993, few could have predicted the trajectory of their lives. At the time, Amazon was a fledgling online bookstore operating from a garage, and the tech boom that would make Bezos one of the richest people in history was still years away. Their 25-year marriage not only survived Amazon's meteoric rise but also played a crucial role in shaping one of the most iconic business empires of the 21st century. Yet, despite the immense wealth they amassed, the couple entered their union without a prenuptial agreement—a decision that would reverberate globally after their 2019 divorce.MacKenzie walked away with a 4% stake in Amazon, instantly catapulting her into the ranks of the world's richest women. As of 2025, Forbes estimates her net worth to be around $165.3 billion. That highly publicized split not only altered the tech landscape but also sparked renewed conversations about asset protection in high-net-worth marriages.Now, with Jeff Bezos preparing to marry his fiancée Lauren Sánchez, a former TV anchor and entrepreneur, he appears to be approaching marriage with a new playbook. Legal insiders and wealth advisors reveal that this time, Bezos has opted for a comprehensive, multi-jurisdictional prenuptial agreement — a far cry from the informal beginning of his first marriage.Jeff and MacKenzie Scott met in the early 1990s when they were both working at hedge fund D.E. Shaw. The couple moved to Seattle, where Bezos launched Amazon in 1994 with MacKenzie as one of the earliest employees. Their professional and personal lives were deeply intertwined, and as the company flourished, so did their financial fortune. MacKenzie played a key role in Amazon’s early operations, even helping with the company’s initial business plan. Their shared vision laid the foundation for what would become one of the most valuable companies in the world.However, when they announced their divorce in 2019, one crucial detail became the focus: the absence of a prenuptial agreement. As a result, under Washington state’s community property laws, MacKenzie was entitled to half of all marital assets — including a significant portion of Bezos’ Amazon shares.Ultimately, she walked away with 25% of their shared Amazon holdings, equivalent to about 4% of the company’s total shares at the time. That stake alone was valued at approximately $35 billion when the settlement was finalized, though her net worth has since grown due to stock value increases and philanthropic activities.Bezos' new relationship with Lauren Sánchez, which began publicly in 2019 shortly after his divorce, has been markedly different. Sánchez, a media personality, helicopter pilot, and founder of Black Ops Aviation, has her own career and public profile. However, the wealth disparity between the two is massive. Bezos, with a net worth of around $220 billion, remains one of the top three richest individuals globally.This stark financial imbalance has prompted Bezos to take a vastly different approach in his second marriage — one focused on legal precision, asset protection, and long-term planning.According to Certified Family Law Specialist Alphonse Provinziano, Bezos' prenuptial agreement with Sánchez is likely airtight. Speaking to HELLO!, Provinziano noted that such agreements in ultra-high-net-worth marriages typically involve extensive documentation of separate property and future earnings exclusions. These agreements are meticulously crafted with the input of top legal and financial experts. They aim to preemptively resolve disputes that could arise from complex asset portfolios. They often include legal language vetted across multiple jurisdictions. Such precautions are especially crucial when international assets or income streams are involved.“There would be a clear enumeration of all business assets and ownership interests, stating these would be considered Jeff Bezos' separate property,” he explained. This ensures that the division of assets post-divorce remains uncontested. It also minimizes the chances of lengthy litigation or financial surprises.In other words, Sánchez would not be entitled to any share of Amazon, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, or any related entities regardless of how long the marriage lasts — unless otherwise stipulated.These prenups often include clauses preventing spouses from claiming business appreciation, intellectual property growth, or share in future ventures unless there’s joint investment or involvement. They may even have confidentiality clauses and non-disparagement agreements to avoid post-divorce public disputes. Such terms are common in celebrity or high-profile marriages to maintain reputational integrity. They reflect a broader trend of legal foresight among billionaires seeking long-term asset protection. These agreements essentially serve as legal firewalls in case of relationship breakdown. They are part of a growing norm among the ultra-rich to future-proof personal and business legacies.","Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott divorced in 2019 after 25 years of marriage.

Laura Loomer has slammed the Republican Party for driving away Elon Musk , whom she termed as “their biggest donor”. In a post on social media X, Loomer criticized Republican Party, popularly known as Grand Old Party ( GOP ) for failing to codify spending cuts proposed under Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). She further suggested that their inaction may have cost them critical support ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.“Leave it to the GOP to push their biggest donor away,” Loomer wrote. “All they had to do was codify the DOGE cuts and they could have had unlimited funding for the midterms. They somehow managed to F that up,” she added.In her post, Loomer was referring to Musk’s recent announcement to step down from DOGE and his advisory role in the Trump administration. The Tesla CEO has been leading the DOGE task force to cut federal waste and streamlining government spending. He later expressed public disappointment over the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which failed to reflect the aggressive cuts he had championed.“Now @elonmusk is pissed and walking away.

With the midterms approaching and party divisions deepening, Loomer’s post reflects a growing frustration among right-wing influencers over what they see as a squandered opportunity to secure both policy wins and campaign funding.The post comes amid rising tensions between Musk and some of Trump’s top advisers, including those who publicly defended the controversial spending bill.","Laura Loomer has slammed the Republican Party for driving away Elon Musk, whom she termed as ‘their biggest donor’ In a post on social media X, she criticized Republican Party, popularly known as Grand Old Party ( GOP ) for failing to codify spending cuts proposed under Department of Government Efficiency.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121515936,imgsize-29520,width-400,resizemode-4/Now-Elon-Musk-is-pissed-and-says-angry-Laura-Loomer-on-Republicans-for-tiff-with-Tesla-CEO.jpg"
Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn makes a prediction on how AI will change schools in future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/duolingo-ceo-luis-von-ahn-makes-a-prediction-on-how-ai-will-change-schools-in-future/articleshow/121290768.cms,"Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn feels that AI will take over teaching



Schools won’t disappear, but their role will change: Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn



Duolingo CEO Luis von Ann recently predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally transform education, shifting the role of schools from traditional learning institutions to childcare and supervised spaces. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the No Priors podcast, von Ahn stressed on the fact that AI’s scalability makes it more efficient than human teachers and it can be easily used for personalised education. ""Education is going to change. It's just a lot more scalable to teach with AI than with teachers,” von Ahn said.Von Ahn suggests that AI will increasingly handle the core instruction in schools. He believes that AI can deliver personalised education more effectively than traditional classroom models with teachers. AI system can be designed to precisely track individual student progress, identify areas where they struggle and then tailor the learning experience accordingly.While Von Ahn does not believe schools will vanish, he foresees a future where AI tutors handle most of the teaching, while schools primarily serve as safe environments for children. He explained that AI can track individual student performance in real time, adjusting lesson plans to match each child’s learning pace—something human teachers struggle to do in large classrooms.“That doesn't mean the teachers are going to go away. You still need people to take care of the students. I also don't think schools are going to go away because you still need childcare,” von Ahn said on the podcast.This doesn't mean teachers will become obsolete, according to von Ahn. Instead, their responsibilities may evolve. Teachers could transition from primarily delivering instruction to supervising students, providing guidance, and fostering social and emotional development.Von Ahn also points out that the integration of AI in education is already happening. Duolingo, for example, is restructuring its operations to embrace an ""AI-first"" approach. This includes using AI for tasks previously done by contractors and incorporating AI into employee performance reviews.","Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn predicts that AI will transform education.

"Aimed to help Apple, Google, Microsoft and other American technology companies, US government 'vows' to refuse visas to foreign officials who ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/aimed-to-help-apple-google-microsoft-and-other-american-technology-companies-us-government-vows-to-refuse-visas-to-foreign-officials-who-/articleshow/121578696.cms,"What the new Visa policy of the US says

How new visa policy of the US is aimed at technology companies

How the new visa law of the US is good and bad news for American tech companies

The United States has announced a new policy to deny visas to foreign officials who suppress the social media posts of American citizens, escalating tensions over free speech and digital censorship. This move by President Donald Trump ’s administration directly impacts US technology companies like Twitter, Meta, and Rumble, which have faced increasing pressure from foreign governments to moderate content on their platforms. The policy underscores a broader clash between the US tech giants and international regulators over content moderation, data sovereignty, and the global reach of American platforms.Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has stirred controversy by revoking visas for activists critical of Israel and intensifying social media screenings for foreign students, framed the policy as a response to “flagrant censorship actions” by foreign officials against U.S. tech firms. Rubio’s statement emphasized that it is “unacceptable” for foreign officials to demand that American platforms adopt global content moderation policies or censor content in ways that extend beyond their jurisdiction into the United States. While Rubio did not name specific targets, he recently hinted at sanctions against Brazil’s Justice Moraes, who has clashed with X over disinformation policies. Moraes’ actions, including the temporary X ban and the Rumble suspension, have been cited as examples of overreach that threaten U.S. tech companies’ operations.The policy also responds to broader tensions with U.S. allies like Germany and the UK, which have implemented stringent laws against online hate speech and misinformation. Germany, for instance, enforces the NetzDG law, requiring platforms to remove illegal content within 24 hours or face hefty fines. The Trump administration, including Vice President JD Vance, has criticized these measures as stifling free expression, particularly for conservative voices. Vance, in a February 2025 speech in Munich, accused Germany of “shunning” far-right groups despite their growing popularity, a stance echoed by State Department official Samuel Samson. In a May 27, 2025, essay, Samson argued that European social media regulations reflect a “strategy of censorship” that undermines democracy, drawing parallels to perceived domestic censorship of Trump and his supporters.US technology companies operate in a complex global landscape where their platforms -- used by billions worldwide -- are subject to varying national laws on speech, disinformation, and hate content. Countries like Brazil, Germany, and the United Kingdom have imposed stricter regulations on online content, often clashing with the U.S.’s more permissive approach to free expression under the First Amendment. These regulations have led to high-profile disputes, such as Brazil’s temporary nationwide ban on Twitter in 2024, ordered by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, until the platform complied with demands to remove accounts accused of spreading disinformation. Similarly, Rumble, a video-sharing platform popular with conservative audiences, faced a suspension in Brazil for refusing to block a U.S.-based user’s account. These actions have raised concerns among U.S. tech firms about their ability to operate globally without compromising their commitment to free speech or facing legal repercussions.The US tech industry, valued at over $10 trillion and employing millions, relies heavily on global markets for revenue and user growth. Companies like Twitter, led by Elon Musk, and Meta, which operates Facebook and Instagram , have repeatedly faced accusations of enabling disinformation or hate speech abroad, prompting foreign governments to demand content removals or account suspensions. Such demands often conflict with US laws, like Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields platforms from liability for user-generated content. The new US visa policy aims to protect these companies by pressuring foreign officials to refrain from actions that could be seen as infringing on American sovereignty or the free speech rights of U.S. citizens.For U.S. tech firms, the visa policy is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it signals robust support from the Trump administration, potentially deterring foreign officials from targeting American platforms with aggressive regulations. This is particularly significant for companies like Twitter, which has faced legal battles in Brazil, and Rumble, which markets itself as a free-speech alternative to mainstream platforms. The policy could bolster their negotiating power in foreign markets, where they face pressure to comply with local laws or risk bans and fines.On the other hand, the policy risks escalating diplomatic tensions, which could lead to retaliatory measures against U.S. tech companies. Brazil, for example, is a major market for platforms like Meta and X, with over 100 million social media users. A tit-for-tat escalation could result in further restrictions or bans, impacting revenue and user engagement. Additionally, the policy’s focus on protecting “American sovereignty” may complicate operations for U.S. firms that rely on global interoperability and must navigate diverse regulatory frameworks.","The United States has announced a new policy to deny visas to foreign officials who suppress the social media posts of American citizens.

How Elon Musk’s denial of scrapping this project may have been concerning for some Tesla executives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-elon-musks-denial-of-scrapping-this-project-may-have-been-concerning-for-some-tesla-executives/articleshow/121574821.cms,"How Elon Musk’s denial may have confused some Tesla executives



Several senior Tesla executives were reportedly surprised when CEO Elon Musk publicly denied that the company had scrapped the plan to build a cheaper EV last year. In April 2024, the tech billionaire dismissed a report by the news agency Reuters that alleged that the car maker had cancelled its plans for an all-new $25,000 electric vehicle, a project many investors believed would significantly drive sales growth, sources familiar with the matter claimed. According to the latest Reuters report, the executives knew that Musk had decided to shelve the low-cost car, often referred to as the ""Model 2,"" weeks before last year’s report. They were aware that Tesla's strategic focus had shifted towards developing self-driving robotaxis, the new report claims.As per the original Reuters report, which cited three sources and company documents to highlight that Tesla had already informed employees that the affordable EV project was terminated. However, Musk's public denial came minutes after the Reuters story was published last year. He took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to claim ""Reuters is lying,"" a statement which reportedly stopped a 6% slide in Tesla's stock.The company CEO's contradictory public stance reportedly confused some senior managers. These executives directly questioned Musk, asking if his public denial signalled a reversal of his decision to cancel the Model 2, the report added. However, these tech billionaire dismissed their concerns and reaffirmed that the affordable EV project remained dead, according to the sources.This internal confusion sheds new light on the company's struggles and internal communications surrounding its commitment to delivering a mass-market, low-cost electric vehicle, long considered a cornerstone of Tesla's promise for widespread EV adoption and future growth, the report notes.

Originally intended to be a brand-new model on a fresh platform with innovative manufacturing, the company will now release more affordable, simplified versions of the existing Model 3 and Model Y.These vehicles, expected in the first half of 2025, have faced delays, and pricing details haven’t been revealed.

iPhone 16e: 5 Reasons to buy the most affordable iPhone 16 series model!

Movies are shot on these ultra-expensive cinema cameras, but lately makers have been using phones also, often an iPhone and people even call that ambitious. But, Danny Boyle built a custom rig to hold 20 of them. The unconventional setup for his $75 million zombie sequel 28 Years Later for action shots that the director describes as ""basically a poor man's bullet time.""The sequel to his 2002’s 28 Days Later, employed three different iPhone rigs throughout production. One held eight phones, another ten, and the largest accommodated a full 20 iPhone 15 Pro Max(es). These multi-camera setups could be mounted on cranes or carried by crew members to capture sweeping 180-degree views of the action.""There is an incredible shot in the second half where we use the 20-rig camera, and you'll know it when you see it,"" Boyle revealed to IGN. ""It's quite graphic but it's a wonderful shot that uses that technique in a startling way that kicks you into a new world.""The iPhone choice wasn't arbitrary, it's a deliberate callback to the original 28 Days Later, which made waves in 2002 by using consumer-grade Canon digital camcorders instead of traditional film cameras. Last year, Boyle said he wanted to capture the same raw, immediate feel that defined the franchise's aesthetic.""I suppose you could ignore it, but we decided to carry it as an influence,"" Boyle explained, noting that smartphones are today's equivalent of the camcorders that would have documented a real zombie apocalypse in 2002.Boyle say that this multi-camera setup offered, what he calls “unexpected” benefits beyond creating a visual spectacle.""It gives you 180 degrees of vision of an action, and in the editing you can select any choice from it,"" he explained. ""Either a conventional one-camera perspective or make your way instantly around reality, time-slicing the subject, jumping forward or backward for emphasis."" The setup also kept his cast alert and unpredictable, preventing them from anticipating camera angles during intense scenes.Despite using smartphones as the primary filming device, 28 Years Later won’t look like typical phone footage. Professional cinema lenses were mounted in front of the iPhone cameras, and the production received technical support from Apple during filming. The phones shot in Apple's ProRes codec with log color profiles, preserving maximum image data for post-production color grading and editing.28 Years Later drops in theaters June 20, bringing back Boyle alongside original writer Alex Garland and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle. The cast includes Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Ralph Fiennes as survivors trying to make it in a world still reeling from the Rage Virus nearly three decades later. They're already deep into filming the follow-up, 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, with The Marvels director Nia DaCosta taking the helm for a 2026 release, part of what's shaping up to be a whole new trilogy for the zombie franchise (those 28 weeks don't matter much, guess so).","Danny Boyle built a custom rig for his $75 million zombie sequel 28 Years Later for action shots that the director describes as ""basically a poor man's bullet time"" The sequel to his 2002’s 28 Days Later, employed three different iPhone rigs throughout production.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121574376,imgsize-1931618,width-400,resizemode-4/The-rig-that-straps-together-20-iPhones-Image-Sony.jpg"
Why Microsoft is warning Authenticator app users to save their passwords on Edge browser immediately,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-microsoft-is-warning-authenticator-app-users-to-save-their-passwords-on-edge-browser-immediately/articleshow/121573485.cms,"What Microsoft said about transferring passwords from Authenticator to Edge

“Your saved passwords (but not your generated password history) and addresses are securely synced to your Microsoft account, and you can continue to access them and enjoy seamless autofill functionality with Microsoft Edge, a secure and user-friendly AI-powered web browser that offers features such as Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, Password Monitor, and InPrivate search.”





“Starting June 2025, you will no longer be able to save new passwords in Authenticator. During July 2025, you will not be able to use autofill with Authenticator. From August 2025, your saved passwords will no longer be accessible in Authenticator.”

How to use Microsoft Edge’s password autofill feature



Microsoft is asking users of the Authenticator app to back up all their saved passwords immediately. This comes after the company announced plans to phase out the app’s password management capabilities starting next month. Microsoft Authenticator, which is widely used for providing two-factor authentication for online accounts, offers users the convenience of storing and autofilling passwords for various apps and websites, a feature that will now be removed. The company is now shifting its password management feature to its Edge browser.In a blog post, Microsoft explains how this change will affect users. The company writes:The company has confirmed:The tech giant has also noted that any saved payment information, including credit card details stored in the Authenticator app, will be deleted by the deadline. This payment data will not automatically transfer to the Microsoft Edge browser and will require users to manually re-enter their card details in Edge if they wish to continue using Microsoft's ecosystem for payment information storage.To keep using generated passwords, users should save them from the Generator history (accessible via the appropriate icon or option from the Password tab) into their saved passwords. Microsoft Authenticator will continue to support passkeys.However, it's important to note that if passkeys are set up for a Microsoft account, users must ensure that Authenticator remains enabled as the Passkey Provider. Disabling Authenticator will also disable the associated passkeys.To use autofill with Microsoft Edge, users need to set Edge as their default autofill provider on their mobile devices. For iPhone users, this involves downloading the Microsoft Edge browser and navigating to the device’s settings. Under General, they must select “Autofill & Passwords” and then choose Edge from the list of available password managers. Once Edge is selected and the user has signed in, their passwords and addresses will be securely synced with their Microsoft account. These details can be managed through the Edge app under Settings > Passwords. It’s important to note that if passkeys have been set up for a Microsoft Account, the Microsoft Authenticator app must remain enabled as the designated Passkey Provider, as disabling it will result in the loss of access to those passkeys.Android users follow a similar process. After downloading the Edge browser, they need to go to their device’s settings and search for the Autofill option. Under Preferred Service, they should choose Edge. After signing in to the Edge browser, autofill will become active, and their passwords and addresses will be securely synced with their Microsoft account. These can also be accessed through Edge’s Settings under the Passwords section.Additional precautions apply to Android users who have set up passkeys for work or school accounts using the Authenticator app. In such cases, they need to ensure that the Authenticator toggle is enabled under Device Settings > Autofill > Additional Services. Turning off Authenticator will also disable the use of passkeys. Furthermore, for security reasons, payment information is not synced to Edge or any other app and is saved only on the device where it was entered. Microsoft has announced that any payment information stored in the Authenticator app will be deleted after July 2025, requiring users to manually re-enter this data if needed.To access saved passwords in Microsoft Edge on a mobile device, users can simply open the app, tap the menu icon, go to Settings, and select Passwords.","Microsoft is moving its password management feature from the Authenticator app to its Edge browser.

How this billion-dollar London startup backed by Microsoft made 700 engineers sitting in India pose as AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-billion-dollar-london-startup-backed-by-microsoft-made-700-engineers-sitting-in-india-pose-as-ai/articleshow/121572659.cms,"Years of deception behind AI claims

Regulatory scrutiny and bankruptcy filing

London-based Builder.ai , once valued at $1.5 billion and backed by Microsoft and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, has filed for bankruptcy after reports that its ""AI-powered"" app development platform was actually operated by Indian engineers, said to be around 700 of them, pretending to be artificial intelligence.The startup, which raised over $445 million from investors including Microsoft and the Qatar Investment Authority, promised to make software development ""as easy as ordering pizza"" through its AI assistant ""Natasha."" However, as per the reports, the company's technology was largely smoke and mirrors, human developers in India manually wrote code based on customer requests while the company marketed their work as AI-generated output.Builder.ai's dramatic collapse came in May 2025 when lender Viola Credit seized $37 million from the company's accounts after discovering the startup had inflated its 2024 revenue projections by 300%. Founder Sachin Dev Duggal had promised $220 million in sales to creditors, but an independent audit revealed actual revenue of just $50 million.The deception wasn't new. As early as 2019, The Wall Street Journal exposed Builder.ai's questionable AI claims, revealing that the platform relied heavily on human contractors rather than artificial intelligence. Multiple former employees described the company as ""all engineer, no AI,"" with most development work performed manually by staff in India.Former employee Robert Holdheim sued the company for $5 million in 2019, alleging he was dismissed after complaining that Builder.ai's technology ""did not work as promoted and was essentially nothing more than 'smoke and mirrors'."" Court filings claimed the company told investors apps were ""80% built"" by AI technology they had ""barely even begun to develop.""The scheme unraveled when new CEO Manpreet Ratia , brought in to replace Duggal in February, discovered the extent of the financial misrepresentations. US prosecutors in New York have since demanded the company's financial statements and customer lists as part of a federal investigation.Builder.ai's collapse represents the largest AI startup failure since ChatGPT's launch triggered a global investment frenzy. The company now owes $85 million to Amazon and $30 million to Microsoft in cloud computing fees, while approximately 1,000 employees have lost their jobs.The failure highlights growing concerns about ""AI washing,"" companies rebranding conventional technology services as artificial intelligence to attract investment in the current AI boom.","Builder.ai was once valued at $1.5 billion and backed by Microsoft and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp , has announced that it is implementing a global temporary “pause” that will ban the teenagers’ access to its cast of AI characters. The move comes as the social media giant is looking to change its generative AI strategy to prioritise parental oversight and safety controls after pressure from child safety advocates.“In October, we shared that we’re building new tools to give parents more visibility into how their teens use AI, and more control over the AI characters they can interact with. Since then, we’ve started building a new version of AI characters, to give people an even better experience. While we focus on developing this new version, we’re temporarily pausing teens’ access to existing AI characters globally,” Meta said.In an update, the company said that the suspension will take effect in the coming weeks across Meta's entire suite of apps, and will target not only users who have registered with “teen birthdays” but also those accounts that are suspected of belong to minors. Meta's uses its proprietary age-prediction technology to spot ‘fake’ accounts run by minors.“Starting in the coming weeks, teens will no longer be able to access AI characters across our apps until the updated experience is ready.This will apply to anyone who has given us a teen birthday, as well as people who claim to be adults but who we suspect are teens based on our age prediction technology,” the company added.The pause is said to be designed to bridge the gap between Meta's current AI offerings and a new, ""parent-approved"" version of the technology.“This means that, when we deliver on our promise to give parents more oversight of their teens’ AI experiences, those parental controls will apply to the latest version of AI characters,” according to Meta.“In the meantime, teens will still be able to access helpful information and educational opportunities through Meta’s AI assistant, with default, age-appropriate protections in place — and we’re continuing our work to give parents insights into those conversations,” the company concluded.",The suspension will take effect in the coming weeks across Meta's entire suite of apps.

Nvidia board member Persis Drell after over a decade: What SEC filing said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-board-member-persis-drell-after-over-a-decade-what-sec-filing-said/articleshow/127391668.cms,"



Nvidia director Persis Drell has resigned from the company’s board of directors, says a CNBC report. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Nvidia revealed that Drell, 70, stepped down to pursue a “new professional opportunity”. The exit was not because of a disagreement with the company or any matter related to its operations or policies.Drell is an engineering professor at Stanford and worked with Nvidia for over a decade. She served on the compensation committee and is the first Nvidia board member to depart since astronaut Ellen Ochoa resigned in June last year.Nvidia’s board now has 10 directors, including CEO Jensen Huang.As per the latest holdings report, Drell owns nearly 143,000 Nvidia shares, worth about $26 million. She was paid about $344,000 for her work with Nvidia in 2025, including almost $259,000 in stock awards.In a related news, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attended the World Economic Forum 2026 in Davos, Switzerland. Speaking at the forum, Huang declared that the massive infrastructure required to power the AI data centres will transform traditional 'blue-collar' jobs into six-figure careers. He argued that the $7 trillion global push to build data centers and “AI factories” represents the largest infrastructure buildout in human history, essentially pointing out that the AI will not be confined to software engineers but also people who are physically building these massive centres.“First of all, this is the largest infrastructure buildout in human history. That's going to create a lot of jobs. And it's wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft. We're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steel workers and network technicians and people who install and fit out the equipment and all of these jobs we're going to in the United States. We're seeing quite a significant boom in this area. The salaries have gone up nearly double. And so we're talking about six figure salaries for people who are building uh chip factories or computer factories or AI factories,” he said in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.","Drell is an engineering professor at Stanford and worked with Nvidia for over a decade.

Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis 'points out' what may be the big irony in ChatGPT's plan to show ads: When Sam Altman says ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ai-ceo-demis-hassabis-points-out-what-may-be-the-big-irony-in-chatgpts-plan-to-show-ads-when-sam-altman-says-/articleshow/127401105.cms,"Demis Hassabis calls ChatGPT ads ‘premature’

Demis Hassabis calls out Sam Altman for claiming we have already whooshed by AGI





Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis has questioned Sam Altman ’s claims of artificial general intelligence (AGI) being around the corner. Speaking at World Economic Forum 2026 in Davos, Hassabis pointed at the ‘big irony’ in his actions and words. “I think actions speak louder than words,” Hassabis said adding “With Sam and others claiming AGI is around the corner, why would you bother with ads then?”. Demis Hassabis’ comments are directed at OpenAI ’s latest announcement to show ads in ChatGPT. Earlier this month, Sam Altman-led AI company announced that it will begin testing ads in ChatGPT in the coming weeks.Demis said “That is a reasonable question to ask,” adding Google has “no plans at the moment to show ads in the Gemini app”. “We are going to watch very carefully the outcome of (ChatGPT ads),” he stated.During the interaction, Hassabis called the ad test a premature revenue push. “It's interesting they've gone for that so early,” he said adding “Maybe they feel they need to make more revenue” – something that investors have expressed concerns about recently.In November 2025, tech analyst and professor Scott Galloway issued a warning against possible financial implosion at OpenAI which he then described as a “trainwreck from a financial management perspective.”Earlier this month, veteran investor George Noble argued that the company is ""falling apart in real time"" despite its eye-watering $500 billion valuation.When asked if he agrees with Altman’s statement of the world being “whoosed by AGI” and moving towards super intelligence, Demis Hassabis replied:“He does wish that, but absolutely not. I don't think AGI should be turned into a marketing term or for commercial gain.”“I think there has always been a scientific definition of that. My definition (of AGI) is a system that can exhibit all the cognitive capabilities humans can….. the kind of highest levels of human creativity that we always celebrate, the scientists and the artists that we admire…. (and) not just solving a math equation or a conjecture, but coming up with a breakthrough conjecture. That's much harder.”Hassabis said that an AGI system must be able to do all of these things to really fulfill the original goal of the AI field. “And I think we're 5 to 10 years away from that,” he stated.","Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis has questioned Sam Altman’s claims of artificial general intelligence (AGI) being around the corner. “I think actions speak louder than words,” Hassabis said adding “With Sam and others claiming AGI is around the corners, why would you bother with ads then?”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127401083,imgsize-29044,width-400,resizemode-4/google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis.jpg"

Reality check: productivity gains remain uncertain





Engineers are becoming artists and artists are turning into engineers, all thanks to AI—at least according to Logan Kilpatrick, who leads product for Google AI Studio and the Gemini API. In a post on X that’s racked up over 627,000 views, Kilpatrick captured what he sees as a fundamental shift in how creative and technical work now overlap. “Engineers are artists now thanks to AI,” he wrote, “and artists are becoming engineers, all in a positive sense.”The comment reflects a growing sentiment in Silicon Valley that AI coding tools are erasing traditional boundaries between disciplines. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently said AI now writes over 30% of new code at Google, while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei claimed Claude generates 90% of his company’s code. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has gone even further, saying he wants his engineers to stop writing code entirely and focus instead on “discovering undiscovered problems.” At Nvidia’s recent all-hands meeting, Huang reportedly pushed back against managers who told teams to reduce AI usage, asking bluntly: “Are you insane?”Kilpatrick’s observation aligns with Pichai’s recent comments that “vibe coding”—using AI to build software with minimal technical knowledge—is making development “exciting again” and more accessible to non-technical workers. From HR professionals to accountants, people across industries are now using tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Cursor to prototype apps and automate workflows without formal coding training.But the optimism isn’t universal. Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor—the $29 billion AI coding assistant Nvidia has adopted company-wide—warned developers against blindly trusting AI-generated code. “If you close your eyes and have AIs build things with shaky foundations, things start to kind of crumble,” he told Fortune.Research backs up the skepticism: a METR study found AI assistants actually decreased experienced developers’ productivity by 19%, despite participants expecting significant gains.Even Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI director who coined the term “vibe coding,” admitted his recent project was “basically entirely hand-written” because AI agents “just didn’t work well enough.” His warning to fellow programmers: “I’ve never felt this much behind. The profession is being dramatically refactored.“",Google AI Studio product manager Logan Kilpatrick says artists are becoming engineers.

Sridhar Vembu: Engineering discipline matters

“I suggest the term ""AI-assisted Code Engineering"" with ACE as the acronym instead of ""vibe-coding"". We must have solid engineering discipline and ACE is the maturation of the tools and techniques”.

“It does not eliminate all software engineers but enables experienced engineers who ACE well to be much more productive,” he said, adding “It is also going to reshape our industry but that is a separate topic.”



What is vibe coding







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has suggested a new way to describe vibe-coding, a word that became one of the biggest “headache” of engineers in 2025. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Vembu argued that the termdoes not reflect the discipline required in real engineering work. He said that he prefers a new termto describe the growing use of AI tools in writing and maintaining software. In the post, Vembu said the focus should remain on solid engineering practices, even as AI becomes more deeply embedded in coding workflows.Sharing the post, Sridhar Vembu wrote:Vembu says that the term ACE does not remove the need for software engineers. Instead, it allows experienced engineers to “be much more productive”.Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming. It refers to building apps and websites by chatting with AI instead of writing code line by painstaking line.Vembu’s comments come at a time when AI-powered coding tools are being widely adopted by developers and companies to speed up software development. His remarks also highlight concerns among industry leaders that such language may underplay the importance of structure, accountability, and long-term reliability in software systems.Collins Dictionary named “vibe-coding” as its word of the year for 2025.","Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming.

What Tim Cook means by “loving museums”



Apple CEO Tim Cook (Image source: Bloomberg)

“I don’t want to live in one”: A warning against stagnation



A lesson in leadership and decision-making



Why the quote resonates beyond technology



A reflection of Tim Cook’s leadership style



Why the quote still matters



""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

,





Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple , doesn't give long speeches or use dramatic slogans. When he does say something, it's usually short, to the point, and well thought out. One of these lines is his quote:. The sentence is easy to understand, like a conversation. But it has a deeper meaning about how to move forward, how to be a leader, and how businesses and people should plan for the future.The quote is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Museums are places where history is kept. They keep ideas, inventions, and events that changed the world. They help us remember where we came from. Tim Cook has never said that we should forget or ignore history. Instead, he says that it is dangerous to get too comfortable with it.In today's world, where things change quickly, especially in technology, staying still can cost you a lot. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.Museums are very important to society. They keep culture, new ideas, and human accomplishments safe. Future generations would lose touch with the ideas and work that shaped the past if there were no museums. Tim Cook saying ""love"" shows that he cares. He thinks it's important to learn from the past. He likes what has already been made.Apple has a long and well-known history. People often study and admire the company's past innovations, which include the Macintosh, the iPod, and the iPhone. A lot of these items are now on display in museums and exhibitions all over the world. Cook knows more about this legacy than most people.But liking someone doesn't mean you care about them. His quote makes it clear that history is important to learn about, but it shouldn't be a place where you want to stay, especially in an industry driven by constant innovation, progress, and forward-looking thinking.The second part of the quote is where the real meaning is. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. It means comfort, safety, and familiarity. That comfort can slowly turn into stagnation in business and leadership.Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. The markets change. Technology changes. People's needs change. What worked ten years ago might not work anymore. Businesses that only care about keeping their legacy alive often have a hard time staying relevant.Apple has kept changing under Cook's leadership. The business has grown into services, put more emphasis on user privacy, put money into protecting the environment, and moved into new areas like custom silicon chips. These choices show that the company is willing to try new things, even if the old ones worked.The quote is true for all leaders, not just Apple. People often praise leaders for their past successes, using previous wins as proof of future capability and judgement. People trust you more when you have done well in the past. But depending too much on past success can keep you from coming up with new ideas or recognising when the environment has fundamentally shifted.Cook's words make it sound like good leadership needs to be balanced. You can learn from history, but don't let it tell you what to do all the time. Don't let your past experiences tell you what to do. This method lets businesses change instead of fighting it, allowing innovation to emerge naturally rather than defensively.This idea also works for people. Careers, skills, and fields of work change over time. It can be harder to grow if you hold on too tightly to what used to work. The quote quietly encourages people to be open and curious, even when change is hard, uncertain, or uncomfortable at first.This quote stands out because it is so simple. It doesn't use business jargon or technical language. People can all understand it. Most people know how nice it is to stick to their routines and how hard it is to try something new.In a more general sense, the quote talks about how societies deal with progress. Tradition and new ideas often clash with each other. It's important to respect culture and history, but it's also important to be open to new things. Cook's statement does not deny the past. It just won't let itself be limited by it.This balance is especially important now that technology is changing quickly and making people wonder about jobs, education, and social structures. The quote tells people that progress doesn't mean forgetting the past; it means building on it in a smart way.People often say that Tim Cook is calm, level-headed, and practical. His way of leading is different from Steve Jobs's, who was known for making bold and dramatic statements. Cook does things in a quieter way. His words are more likely to make you think than to make you angry, reflecting patience, consistency, ethical decision-making, and a long-term focus rather than short-term applause.This quote fits that pattern. It doesn't need attention. It makes you think. It gives a point of view without making people agree. That restraint is one reason it feels real.The quote doesn't give a big picture; it gives a way of thinking. It talks about how Cook sees progress, responsibility, and long-term success.is still true because it describes a problem that everyone faces. How can we remember the past without letting it control us? How do we go on without losing what matters?It's clear but not obvious what Tim Cook means. Value history. Take something away from it. Then decide to go on.In one short sentence, the CEO of Apple reminds us that we can choose to make progress. It takes work, curiosity, and a willingness to go beyond what you already know. Museums keep the past alive. But the future is being built somewhere else.","Tim Cook's quote has a deeper meaning about how to move forward.

Blinkit CEO Albinder Singh Dhindsa will take over as CEO.

Deepinder Goyal has tendered his resignation as Director, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company, effective close of business on February 1, 2026.

Albinder Singh Dhindsa has been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company with effect from February 1, 2026. Further, the Board of Directors (“Board”) recommended the appointment of Deepinder Goyal as the Director and Vice Chairman of the Board, effective upon shareholders' approval.

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.""

Read Deepinder Goyal's full letter that he sent to shareholders

“Dear Shareholders,

Today, I am going to step away from the Group CEO role, and subject to shareholders' approval, will remain on the board of directors as Vice Chairman.

Albinder Dhindsa

(Albi) will be Eternal's new Group CEO.

Why this change

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.

This transition allows Eternal to remain sharply focused, while giving me the space to explore ideas that do not fit Eternal's risk profile.

What doesn't change

I have spent eighteen years, almost half my life, building this company. I will continue doing that.

Albi, Akshant, and I will continue to work closely together, as we always have. Our partnership, shared context, and trust remain unchanged. All our business CEOs will continue operating with the autonomy they have always had.

My involvement in long-term strategy, culture, leadership development, and ethics and governance, continues. This is where I have increasingly focused lately anyway.

What changes

The centre of gravity for operating decisions moves to Albi.

As Group CEO, he will own day-to-day execution, operating priorities, and business decisions.

Blinkit's journey from acquisition to breakeven happened under his leadership.

He built the team, the culture, the supply chain, the operating rhythm. He has the DNA of a battle-hardened founder and his ability to execute far exceeds mine. He is more than capable of leading Eternal as Group CEO.

Blinkit remains our largest growth opportunity and will remain as Albi's top priority. Our decentralized structure, where each business has a CEO with full ownership, continues unchanged - and will help Albi execute this well.

On alignment and ESOPs

My financial future remains meaningfully tied to Eternal, and my incentives remain aligned with long-term shareholder value creation.

As part of this transition, all of my unvested ESOPs will revert to the ESOP pool. This ensures that Eternal continues to have meaningful wealth-creation opportunities for its next generation of leaders, while strengthening long-term retention without incremental shareholder dilution.

Looking ahead

Eighteen years ago, the idea that a menu scanning company could be worth tens of billions of dollars, provide livelihoods to hundreds of thousands of people, and serve millions of families daily would have seemed absurd. We helped prove it was possible. And there's a lot in store for Eternal to do over the next few decades.

I believe Eternal is not going to lose focus or momentum through this change. Rather, it is reinforcing its institutional strength.

And personally, I gain the flexibility to explore ideas that sit outside Eternal's scope, without compromising the company's priorities.

I want Eternal to become India's most valuable company. I want us to serve a billion customers. I want us to create the most positive impact on society. I want us to be the source of livelihoods for millions of Indians. None of that changes.

This is a change in title, not in commitment towards outcomes. Eternal remains my life's work.

Thank you for your continued trust and support.

Deepinder Goyal”

When White House called Amazon's tariff plan an 'hostile act'





In April 2025, a pissed Donald Trump made a call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after learning that the company is planning to display the added cost of tariffs on certain items. Trump made the call to Bezos to complain about reports that Amazon was considering to highlight the cost of US tariffs next to prices for certain products on the company’s website. Trump later told reporters about the call to Amazon founder and said it was a “good call.” “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump told reporters. “He solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.”Punchbowl News first reported that Amazon will soon “display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs — right next to the product’s total listed price.” The move came after Trump slapped 145% tariffs on imports from China and a 10% minimum tax on all other countries.Now months later, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC in an interview Jassy at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Amazon.com is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures stemming from the US President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""We did a lot of pre-buying in the early part of 2025 to enable us to try and keep prices as low as possible for customers,"" Jassy said.He added, ""And a lot of our third-party sellers did a lot of forward-staging in our fulfillment network for the same reasons. And that supply is run out in the fall, so you start to see some of the tariffs creep in to some of the prices, some of the items.""""Some third-party sellers are raising prices in response while others are absorbing the costs in hopes of driving more demand,"" Jassy went on to add. ""Our priority is to try to figure out how to keep prices low as possible,"" Jassy said. ""At a certain point, because retail is a mid-single-digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it.""The warning marks a shift from the Amazon leader's commentary on tariffs last year. While he cautioned in April that third-party sellers could need to pass along tariff costs, he said on several occasions that Amazon had not seen selling prices appreciably rise from tariffs. ""Amazon's consumers overall have fared well. But we'll have to see what happens in 2026,"" CEO Jassy had said.The company has also maintained so far that over the past year it was seeing very little impact on consumer behavior and product prices from tariffs. It has doubled down on expanding product categories and speeding up delivery timelines to shield demand.In April 2025, at a briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the move a “hostile and political act,” adding that she had spoken about the matter with President Trump earlier. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Levitt’s comments, saying it’s a hostile act if a company goes out of its way to “make it seem” like tariffs have caused prices to change.“It’s nonsense,” he said Tuesday in a CNBC interview. “A 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price,” he added, referring to the nearly universal baseline tariff on all countries. “The only price will change would be a product that we don’t make here, like a mango.” The 10% tariff, however, is hardly the only one in effect.",Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the company is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Satya Nadella said it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp says: AI will destroy these jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/palantir-ceo-alex-karp-says-ai-will-destroy-these-jobs/articleshow/126973650.cms,"Vocational skill in demand



Debate at Davos



Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid







Palantir CEO Alex Karp has now issued a stark warning about the future of work in the age of artificial intelligence. Karp predicted that humanities-based jobs will now be among the first casualties. As reported by Business Insider, speaking during a panel at the World Economic Forum, Karp revealed that his own academic background which is a philosophy degree from Haverford College, a law degree from Stanford, and a Ph.D. in social theory from Germany, cautioned that such qualifications may no longer be viable. “AI will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp said. “You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market.”Karp believes that workers with technical and vocational training will be in then highest demand. He quoted battery manufacturing as an exampple, nothing that technicians in such industries are “very valuable, if not irreplaceable.” “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” Karp told BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who moderated the discussion.Not all leaders at Davos agreed with Karp’s assessment. Finance executives told Business Insider that liberal arts degrees may actually become more valuable, as AI takes over routine financial analysis. Critical and creative thinking, they argued, is increasingly prized in young recruits.Meanwhile, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei highlighted another trend: entry-level hiring is already declining due to AI. Amodei said software and coding roles at Anthropic were down across junior and mid-level positions.Recently, Karp said that value of skilled workers is rising. Speaking on TBPN, a tech talk show broadcast live from Palantir’s customer conference, AIP Con 8, Karp said, “Workers become more valuable. The person at the top is actually crazy valuable. People with technical expertise are crazy valuable."" His words underscore a trend that’s become increasingly apparent in Silicon Valley: in a world awash with automation and AI, human expertise, especially deep technical skill, has become a rare commodity.Karp calls these individuals “artist-shaped people,” a nod to the company’s unique culture, sometimes referred to internally as “an artist colony.” He added, “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid.”. The statement doesn’t just reflect Palantir’s philosophy; it mirrors the market reality, where top AI researchers and engineers have recently netted unprecedented paydays, sometimes reaching hundreds of millions, while thousands of others were laid off from companies like Microsoft and Meta.","Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid. “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid,” he said.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”.

The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index. Most of her wealth comes from her share of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, significant assets transferred during her 2021 divorce from Bill Gates (including billions in stocks and real estate), and her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, focused on women's equality.","Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

Security Risks: Without updates, Chrome on Monterey will become increasingly vulnerable to exploits.

Feature Loss: New Chrome features introduced after July 2026 will not be available on Monterey.

Compatibility Issues: Websites and web apps optimized for newer versions of Chrome may not function properly.





Google has announced that its Chrome browser will officially end support for macOS 12 Monterey starting July 2026.

Hi team,

As the situation in our community continues to evolve, I want to share a few updates for our team and acknowledge the stress many of you may be carrying as disruption in our hometown affects daily life. We remain deeply focused on caring for our team and providing the support we can.

The safety and well-being of our entire team and guests matters immensely. In fact, it guides every decision we make. Over the past week, we've added new FAQs to our resource to address the most common questions we're hearing. Based on feedback, our security teams are also increasing communication with Minneapolis-based team members about expected disruption near our locations, along with guidance to help you stay safe. Field teams continue to receive updated procedures as conditions around stores and sites change.

While we can't control everything happening around us, we are focused on what we can control. Senior leaders are actively engaging with government officials, community partners, faith leaders and other stakeholders. As part of these conversations, and as we shared in our FAQs, we are clear about our priorities and practices, including that Target does not have cooperative agreements with any immigration enforcement agency. We're listening and working to de-escalate where possible—while staying clear on what we need to safely operate our business and care for our team.

Please continue to lean on your leaders, HR partners, Spring Health resources and one another for support. Thank you for the care you show each other and for being there for one another during this time.

Last year, Target was hit by a 40-day consumer boycott over its decision to scale back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and now, the company is now facing an “ICE problem”. As armed US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents carry out detentions across the its Minneapolis hometown of Target, viral videos have surfaced appearing to show enforcement actions taking place within Target stores and parking lots.According to a report by Business Insider, this crackdown in the proximity of Target stores has sparked protests, leaving the retailer’s workforce in a state of high alert. Target, while remaining publicly silent, has sent an internal memo to staff, acknowledging the “stress many of you may be carrying”.Target’s human resources chief Melissa Kremer sent an internal memo to staff on Thursday (January 22), clarifying the company’s stance on the federal activity.

Elon Musk marked his debut at WEF 2026 with a critique of US solar tariffs and aggressive targets for Tesla, including humanoid robot sales next year, as well as flagging European approval for self-driving tech within weeks. After years of describing the World Economic Forum's annual meeting as elitist, unaccountable and disconnected from ordinary people, the world's richest man was interviewed by Larry Fink. The BlackRock CEO expressed his admiration for Musk at the start of the wide-ranging discussion, which covered the future of robots and AI, the economic benefits of reusable rockets and Musk's childhood fascination with science fiction.As per WEF 2026 release, the event was attended by close to 3,000 leaders from across regions, sectors and generations from 130 countries, including a record 400 top political leaders, a majority of G7 leaders, close to 830 of the world's top CEOs and chairs, and almost 80 leading unicorns and technology pioneers.

Speaking at the Italian Tech Week in November last year, Bezos stressed on the importance of early work experience especially in the fast-paced, customer-facing environment. He advised the young entrepreneurs to work at established companies before starting their own companies.“It is possible to drop out of college and be a great entrepreneur… but these people are the exception,” Bezos said. “Go work at a best practices company somewhere, where you can learn a lot of basic fundamental things.There’s still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it.”For those unaware, Bezos started Amazon out of his garage in 1994. He believes that entry-level jobs such as those at McDonald’s tech foundational skills which are important for long term success. He emphasised that such small roles are necessary as they instill skill like discipline, resilience and the ability to handle pressure.

What Vimeo's former VP Dave Brown wrote on LinkedIn

In a LinkedIn post, Vimeo’s former VP of Global Brand and Creative Dave Brown shared how he was caught off guard by sudden layoffs. Here's Brown's post:





Video platform Vimeo is reportedly laying off a large number of employees globally. The job cuts at US-based Vimeo come shortly after the company’s acquisition by the European tech conglomerate Bending Spoons, which purchased it in an all-cash deal for $1.38 billion in November 2025. Since its founding in 2004, Vimeo has fought to position itself as a premium video hosting platform and an alternative to YouTube. In recent years, the company has expanded into software offerings beyond hosting, such as webinars and other events. Vimeo was previously owned by media holding company IAC, which spun it off as a public company in May 2021.This is Vimeo's second round of layoffs since September, when the company cut 10% of its full-time workforce in an ""effort to ensure focus and efficiency,"" the company wrote in an SEC filing at the time.Milan-based Bending Spoons owns a collection of software companies, including Evernote, Meetup and WeTransfer.According to a report in The Verge, the cutbacks will impact a ""large portion"" of the company’s total workforce, citing a LinkedIn post from Vimeo’s former VP of Global Brand and Creative Dave Brown, who stated that he, “along with a large portion of the company,” had been “impacted by layoffs.”Yesterday, following Vimeo’s recent acquisition by a private equity firm, I learned that I, along with a large portion of the company, was impacted by layoffs.It’s not the ending any of us would have chosen. Still, the work and relationships we built were real, and something I’m deeply proud of. I’m grateful for the incredibly talented people I had the privilege to work alongside and the global community of storytellers who use Vimeo every day.Now I’m turning my attention to what’s next.If you’re looking for a creative leader who believes good taste matters, people come first, and the best work happens when leaders roll up their sleeves and build alongside the team, I’d love to hear from you.","Vimeo is reportedly laying off a large number of employees globally.

What is PwC’s 3A2I framework and how can it help in India’s development

AI Edge framework

,

“AI is revolutionising all spheres of life, and we are embedding it in governance to democratise its impact.

We have done well in creating a strong digital infrastructure, and we are now in a position to leverage data to drive deeper digitisation. We have developed an AI‑based app for farmers, available in Marathi, which is being actively used to understand crop cycles and the appropriate understanding around pesticide usage.

At the same time, we are building an innovative city that will help push the state’s larger AI agenda. EODB is another key focus area. In Maharashtra, we have recently cancelled 17 laws as part of our decriminalisation drive. Platforms like MAITRI for industrial investments are becoming more reliable through the use of AI. By bringing down multiple permission regimes and leveraging AI, we are confident of reducing red tape even further.”





PwC India launched its flagship report,at the World Economic Forum in Davos. According to PwC's economic modelling, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to contribute USD 550 billion to five priority sectors, including agriculture, education, energy, healthcare and manufacturing, by 2035 at a nominal level. The report positions India as a potential global benchmark for how emerging economies can deploy AI in a transformative and equitable manner.The report discussed PwC's proprietary 3A2I framework, a national, system-level playbook designed to enable AI to function as a connected “central nervous system” for India's development. The model builds access to data, infrastructure and skills; fosters acceptance through trust, transparency and ethical safeguards; and enables assimilation by embedding AI into real workflows. Once these foundations are established, the framework will drive large-scale implementation and long-term institutionalisation of AI through governance, policy, and continuous learning.​​PwC's analysis shows that AI can be a driver of sectoral growth, from boosting crop productivity and reducing agri-waste to improving school governance, cutting power theft, accelerating disease detection, and enhancing manufacturing quality.Real-world pilots already demonstrate this potential as AI-enabled crop advisories delivered double-digit efficiency gains, smart metering flagged high-accuracy theft cases, and AI-driven TB detection improved notification rates dramatically. Scaling such applications, even to modest levels, could save hundreds of millions annually, the report added.In the report, PwC also introduced thedefining the five tangible outcomes India should expect from AI deployed at scale: operational excellence, sustainability, good governance, resilience, and financial discipline. These outcomes shift the global AI conversation from efficiency alone to a broader focus on transparency, environmental stewardship, system reliability and inclusive value creation across public and private ecosystems.As India advances toward its Viksit Bharat vision, the report underscores that the country stands at a decisive moment, one where responsible, systemic and inclusive AI can reshape national growth trajectories. With deep collaboration among government, industry, academia, and civil society, India can build an AI ecosystem that learns continuously, scales responsibly, and ensures that every community benefits from this technological shift, driving sustainable and equitable national progress.The report was unveiled by the Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, who said,","PwC India launched its flagship report,at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

The scientist who never wanted to lead

When a 28-year-old became his boss





Yann LeCun, Meta's former chief AI scientist and one of the ""godfathers"" of modern AI, has opened up about what he despised most during his 12-year tenure at the tech giant: being a manager. ""I can do management, but I don't like doing it,"" LeCun told MIT Technology Review in an interview published Thursday. ""I kind of hated being a director. I am not good at this career management thing. I'm much more visionary and a scientist.""The 65-year-old Turing Award winner, who founded Meta's influential Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab, announced his departure from the company in November to launch his own AI startup, AMI Labs. The Paris-based venture will focus on building ""world models""—a type of AI that learns from videos and spatial data rather than just text, which LeCun believes is the true path to artificial general intelligence.At his new venture, LeCun will serve as executive chairman while former Meta colleague Alex LeBrun handles CEO duties. It's a deliberate choice that lets him dodge the administrative work he despised. ""This is not my mission in life,"" he explained to MIT Technology Review.""It's really to make science and technology progress as far as we can.""He'll also keep teaching at NYU, where maintaining his academic position was one of three conditions he set when Mark Zuckerberg first wooed him to Facebook in 2013 over dinner and ""chicken with some pretty good white wine.""But LeCun's exit wasn't just about escaping paperwork. Meta's direction increasingly clashed with his scientific convictions, particularly after the company poured $14.3 billion into Scale AI and installed its 28-year-old CEO Alexandr Wang to oversee AI development—making Wang briefly LeCun's manager.""You don't tell a researcher what to do,"" LeCun told the Financial Times. ""You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do.""The real friction, though, centered on technology. LeCun has consistently argued that large language models are ""a dead end when it comes to superintelligence,"" a stance that became awkward as Meta doubled down on LLMs. ""I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta who would like me to not tell the world that,"" he admitted, ""but I'm not gonna change my mind because some dude thinks I'm wrong.""His honesty cuts through the usual corporate doublespeak that dominates AI discussions, offering a rare peek at what happens when scientific integrity meets billion-dollar bets.","Yann LeCun, Meta's former chief AI scientist, has opened up about what he despised most during his 12-year tenure at the tech giant.

"Anthropic's test to hire engineers had this Claude 'problem', here's how the company solved it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anthropics-test-to-hire-engineers-had-this-claude-problem-heres-how-the-company-solved-it/articleshow/127296937.cms,"AI startup Anthropic faced a unique hiring challenge as its own Claude models began outperforming human candidates on engineering tests. Initially designed to assess performance engineers, the take-home test, simulating accelerator optimization, was repeatedly redesigned. Newer Claude versions, particularly Opus 4 and 4.

What is Anthropic’s take-home test for engineers and how Claude cracked it





Anthropic has been forced to redesign its engineering hiring test multiple times. The AI startup had to make this change because newer versions of its Claude model could solve challenges that previously distinguished top human candidates from average ones. The performance engineering team introduced a take-home test to optimise code for a simulated accelerator in 2024. The company currently employs dozens of the more than 1,000 applicants who took the test. But when given the same time limit, Claude Opus 4 outperformed the majority of human applicants, and under test conditions, Claude Opus 4.5 even matched the performance of the best candidates.In a blog post, Tristan Hume, a lead on Anthropic's performance optimisation team who designed the test, announced that he has now created three versions of the test to ensure the evaluation remains useful. He noted that humans can still outperform the models when given unlimited time. Still, under the time constraints of the take-home test, the company could no longer distinguish between output from top candidates and its most capable model.Anthropic is also releasing the original take-home as an open challenge, as the best human performance with unlimited time still exceeds what Claude can achieve.In November 2023, Anthropic needed to hire performance engineers quickly to support training Claude Opus 3.The company had secured new computing clusters and was spending more on hardware, but lacked enough engineers. When the company posted on Twitter asking for candidates, the response overwhelmed their standard interview process.To evaluate candidates more efficiently, the team designed a take-home test. Unlike typical boring tests, this one aimed to be engaging and accurately measure technical skills. The test gave candidates 2-4 hours to work in their own environment, allowed AI assistance, and focused on problems representative of real work without requiring specific domain knowledge.The test simulated a fake accelerator similar to TPUs. Candidates optimised code for this machine using tools that showed every instruction, identical to real Anthropic tooling. The task involved parallel tree traversal, deliberately avoiding deep learning topics since most candidates hadn't worked on that yet. Candidates started with basic code and progressively added optimisations.The initial test worked well. About 1,000 candidates completed it over 18 months, helping hire most of the current performance engineering team. Many candidates enjoyed it so much that they worked past the time limit. The test proved especially valuable for identifying talented candidates with limited experience on paper.However, by May 2025, Claude 3.7 Sonnet had advanced to the point that more than 50% of candidates would be better off delegating completely to Claude Code. When tested on a pre-release version of Claude Opus 4, the AI provided solutions better than almost all humans within the time limit.The team redesigned the test, using Claude Opus 4 to identify where it was struggling, and made that the new starting point. They shortened the time limit to 2 hours and added new challenges. This worked for several months until Claude Opus 4.5 matched the best human performance.After considering options such as banning AI or requiring candidates to outperform Claude by a significant margin, the team created an entirely new test based on unusual programming puzzles with heavily constrained instruction sets. This unconventional approach works because it simulates novel tasks rather than resembling typical tasks for which Claude has extensive training data."," AI startup Anthropic faced a unique hiring challenge as its own Claude models began outperforming human candidates on engineering tests.

This move signals growing confidence in AI coding tools, with even non-technical staff encouraged to experiment. Nvidia's CEO also recently urged engineers to embrace AI coding assistants, highlighting a significant industry shift.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang joins the Claude chorus

What this means for Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI





Microsoft is asking thousands of its software engineers to work with both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot—and report back on which one works better. The move signals the company's growing confidence in Anthropic's AI coding tools, even as it continues to sell GitHub Copilot as its flagship product to enterprise customers.According to a report from The Verge, Microsoft's CoreAI team and its massive Experiences + Devices division—responsible for Windows, Office, Teams, Edge, and Surface—were instructed last week to install Claude Code. The company is even encouraging non-technical employees like designers and project managers to experiment with the tool for rapid prototyping. Microsoft has also greenlit Claude Code access across all repositories for its Business and Industry Copilot teams.The timing couldn't be more striking. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently told engineers at his $3 trillion company to stop writing code manually and focus on solving ""undiscovered problems"" instead. Speaking on the No Priors AI podcast recently, Huang revealed that every Nvidia engineer now uses AI coding assistants like Cursor throughout their workday. At the World Economic Forum, he went further, calling Claude ""incredible"" and urging every software company to adopt it.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella disclosed in April 2025 that up to 30% of Microsoft's codebase is now AI-generated, a figure that continues to climb. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has made similar claims, stating that over 30% of new code at Google comes from AI. The shift is reshaping how tech giants approach software development—and raising questions about the future of junior developer roles.Microsoft remains deeply committed to its partnership with OpenAI, which powers much of its Copilot infrastructure. Frank Shaw, Microsoft's communications chief, emphasized that ""OpenAI continues to be our primary partner and model provider on frontier models."" But the company signed a separate deal with Anthropic in November, giving Microsoft Foundry customers access to Claude Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.1, and Haiku 4.5. That agreement also includes Anthropic's commitment to purchase $30 billion in Azure compute capacity.The internal pilot program reflects a pragmatic reality: developers increasingly rely on multiple AI tools depending on the task. While Microsoft sells GitHub Copilot externally, its willingness to deploy Claude Code internally suggests it may eventually offer Anthropic's tools to cloud customers as well. For now, the company is betting that letting its engineers compare both platforms will reveal which approach delivers the best results.","Microsoft is testing Anthropic's Claude Code alongside its own GitHub Copilot. This move signals growing confidence in AI coding tools, with even non-technical staff encouraged to experiment. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella disclosed in April 2025 that up to 30% of Microsoft's codebase is now AI-generated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127296141,imgsize-110876,width-400,resizemode-4/127296141.jpg"

She advocates for leader-led training, citing a client whose 300 leaders had to directly use AI tools before progress was made. This hands-on approach, starting with top executives, is crucial for unlocking AI's potential and ensuring widespread adoption across all sectors.

“If leaders don't understand AI, they can't lead the company through the changes. In three years, you should be able to say, 'My company has different services and has different insights.' That requires a depth of learning from leaders first, and then you have to bring everybody along the way. So leader-led learning is absolutely critical.”

“It's also critical for regulators and regulated industries: if regulators block AI, they won't be able to scale or succeed. So governments, non-profits and companies all need leader-led learning and then a strategy to bring all of our people along,”

What Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said about leader-led AI learning for the workforce

“concrete example”

“put it for my workforce or for my citizens.”

“Well, one of my clients told me that, until they had their 300 leaders touch keyboards and see what AI could do, they couldn't get moving. That's a very tangible example. That's the first thing we did way back after November 2022; most of the training was actually for our top 50 leaders who actually got their hands dirty, understanding it, and that's what we mean by leader-led learning. And once you have that, it unlocks the possibilities of what it really means that it's going to change everything.

”





Accenture CEO Julie Sweet has shared an example showing how other companies and their leaders can learn from Accenture’s approach to training employees to use AI tools effectively. In a recent interview, she said that company leaders should be able to tell within three years whether their company offers different services and insights enabled by AI, emphasising that this requires leaders first deeply understand AI. She even stressed that if leaders don't understand AI, they can't lead their companies through the necessary changes. She also explained how leader-led learning is critical, followed by bringing all employees along in the process.Speaking in a Bloomberg Television interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Sweet said,Sweet also emphasised that regulators in regulated industries must understand AI, warning that if regulators block AI, companies won't be able to scale or succeed.She said governments, non-profits and companies all need leader-led learning and a strategy to train their people on AI.she added.Bloomberg’s Francine asked for afrom Julie Sweet to make the audience understand how to put her thoughts through toReplying to her, Sweet said,","Accenture CEO Julie Sweet stresses that leaders must grasp AI to guide their companies through transformation.

Hyundai’s plans to introduce robots by 2028







Hyundai Motor may have a union problem in South Korea. The automaker’s labour union has warned the company against deploying humanoid ‌robots without its approval, saying the robots would bring “employment shocks”. The warning comes weeks after the company shared plans to deploy humanoid robots starting in 2028, sending the company shares rallying to record highs. However, the move was ‘not welcome’ for workersCiting an internal letter by the ‌union, news agency Reuters reported that the union accused Hyundai of seeking to boost profits by deploying robots to reduce workforce.“Remember that without labour–management agreement, not a single robot using new technology will be allowed to enter the workplace,” the union said in the letter.Reportedly, the union also criticised Hyundai’s efforts to shift production to the US, arguing that the automaker’s new factory in Georgia was already making a dent in the ‍domestic production and threatening job security at two of its factories in Korea.Hyundai Motor and its affiliate Kia together are the world's third-biggest automaker by sales. Last year, the company said that its Georgia factory ‍will reach annual production capacity of 5,00,000 vehicles by 2028 as it navigates US tariffs.At CES this year, the company unveiled the production version of the Atlas humanoid robot, which has been developed by its unit Boston Dynamics. According to the company, it aims to build a factory capable of manufacturing ‍30,000 robot units annually by 2028 and plans to deploy humanoid ‌robots ‌at its US plant in Georgia starting in 2028.The company did not disclose the cost of the robots, but said in a statement it aims to roll out adoption across all of its manufacturing sites as part of a push into “physical AI”. These robots will initially carry out parts sequencing tasks from 2028 and the applications will expand gradually as safety and quality benefits are validated.At that time, Hyundai Motor's vice chair Jaehoon Chang said that the company understands concerns about job losses, but people will be needed to maintain and train the robots, and additional personnel will be required.","Hyundai Motor and its affiliate Kia together are the world's third-biggest automaker by sales.

$101 Billion in 1 Day: How Larry Ellison Became the World’s Richest Man Explained

Hollywood impact and regulatory scrutiny





Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters has rejected Paramount Skydance’s $108 billion hostile bud for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), calling it unrealistic without the financial backing of Oracle founder Larry Ellison. In an interview with Financial Times, Peters said Paramount’s proposal ‘doesn’t pass the sniff test’ and relies too heavily on debt and external support. He contrasted it with Netflix’s revised $82.7 billion all-cash offer, which he argued is far more stable. “That additional leverage required for Paramount’s bid is pretty crazy,” Peters said.As per the report, Paramount has taken its offer directly to WBD shareholders after the board rejected it. However, the early filings show Paramount has secured only about 7% of WBD shares which are far short of the majority needed to gain control. Analysts also point out that Netflix’s cash-backed proposal is gaining stronger traction among investors wary of debt-heavy deals.A potential Netflix-Warner Bros. merger would reshape Hollywood, combining franchises like Game of Thrones and Harry Potter with Netflix originals such as Stranger Things and Squid Game.The consolidation has sparked concern among filmmakers, unions, and theater owners about Netflix’s growing influence over theatrical releases.Peters sought to ease those fears, pledging that Netflix would honor Warner Bros.’ traditional 45-day theatrical window. Regulators in both the U.S. and Europe are expected to scrutinize the deal closely, given its sweeping implications for competition and consumer choice.Peters emphasized that Netflix’s competition extends beyond traditional studios, pointing to YouTube (Alphabet Inc.), Amazon.com Inc., and Apple Inc. as rivals in the streaming and entertainment space. He also noted that Netflix accounts for less than 10% of TV viewing hours in most markets, underscoring the fragmented nature of global media consumption.","Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters has rejected Paramount Skydance’s $108 billion hostile bud for Warner Bros.

The reshuffling at the top

Why Google beat everyone else

The man calling the shots

What’s happening now and what happens next





When Craig Federighi picked up his iPhone one afternoon in early 2025, he wasn't expecting to have his world turned upside down. Apple 's software chief was just doing what he always does before a major release—testing the product himself, making sure it works the way the commercials promise it will.This time, it didn't.The commercials had been running for months. In one, actress Bella Ramsey asks Siri about someone she'd met at a café weeks earlier, and the assistant instantly recalls the name. In another, users navigate their phones entirely by voice, jumping between apps with the ease of thought. These weren't just ads—they were Apple's promise that it had finally cracked AI.Federighi tried the features. They failed. He tried again. Still nothing. According to Bloomberg, he was genuinely shocked at how broken everything was. The new Siri that was supposed to launch in weeks didn't work properly about a third of the time. Sometimes it was worse.Apple pulled the ads. It pushed back the launch. And this week, more than a year later, the company announced it would be handing the whole problem to Google.The partnership means Apple will power its revamped Siri with Google's Gemini models, in a deal worth roughly $1 billion a year.For a company that prides itself on controlling every piece of the user experience, it's a remarkable admission: we can't build this ourselves.But how did the company that invented the modern voice assistant—the one that made ""Hey Siri"" part of everyday language—end up here?Apple had been working on the Siri overhaul for years. The plan was straightforward enough: take the old assistant that sets timers and plays music, then bolt on the kind of sophisticated AI that powers ChatGPT. The result would be an assistant that actually understands context, can take actions across apps, and feels less like a voice-activated search box and more like a genuine helper.The problem was that merging old code with new AI proved far harder than anyone expected. ""We initially wanted to do a hybrid architecture,"" Federighi later explained at Apple's developer conference in June 2025, ""but we realised that approach wasn't going to get us to Apple quality.""That's corporate-speak for: it was a disaster.Behind the scenes, engineers were drowning in bugs. The Information reported that team members described it as ""whack-a-mole""—fix one issue, and three more would pop up. The hybrid system created integration nightmares. Features that looked promising when tested individually would fall apart when everything ran together.In an internal meeting in March 2025, Robby Walker—the senior director then running the Siri team—tried to rally his staff. ""We swam hundreds of miles,"" he told them, according to Bloomberg. ""But we still didn't swim to Hawaii.He admitted they'd been ""jumped on, not for the amazing swimming that we did, but the fact that we didn't get to the destination."" Walker also acknowledged he wasn't even sure when the features would actually ship. There were other priorities now. Maybe they'd make it into iOS 19 in the fall. Maybe not.Some team members weren't buying the pep talk. ""There are hundreds of bugs right now,"" one engineer told Bloomberg. ""There's no leadership.""While Apple struggled with its own AI, its people started leaving.It began in July 2025, when Ruoming Pang—the distinguished engineer who'd built Apple's foundation models team from scratch—announced he was going to Meta. The compensation package was jaw-dropping: more than $200 million over several years, according to Bloomberg.Within weeks, his top lieutenants followed. Tom Gunter and Mark Lee went to Meta. Then Bowen Zhang. Then Yun Zhu. Meta was offering annual packages between $10 million and $40 million for senior AI researchers, money that Apple's traditional pay structure simply couldn't match. OpenAI grabbed a few others. Anthropic took some too. By August, the Financial Times counted about a dozen departures from Apple's AI team since the start of the year—devastating losses for a foundation models group that numbered only around 50 to 60 people to begin with.""Ruoming Pang leaving is huge,"" Aaron Sines of recruiting firm Razoroo told the FT. ""It sends a signal of a crisis of confidence around what is to come.""The exodus revealed something uncomfortable about Apple's position. For years, working at Apple meant something—prestige, purpose, the chance to shape products used by a billion people. But AI researchers had discovered they had other options, options that came with compensation packages that made Apple's offers look quaint.Apple tried to stem the bleeding. Bloomberg reported the company offered raises to engineers still on the foundation models team. But those increases were ""a far cry from Meta's offers."" When you're competing with nine-figure packages, standard salary bumps don't move the needle.There's another reason Apple couldn't keep pace with its rivals, and it's one the company rarely talks about: its own values keep getting in the way.While Meta trains AI on user data harvested from billions of Facebook and Instagram accounts, and while OpenAI builds models by scraping the internet, Apple has spent years constructing a privacy-first architecture that makes those approaches impossible.Here's the uncomfortable truth: AI threatens Apple's way of doing business in more ways than one. The technology doesn't just open the door to possibly replacing the iPhone. It fundamentally conflicts with Tim Cook's ethos around user privacy.Consider the gap. Meta's AI can access everything users post, like, and share. Google trains on search history, emails, and YouTube habits. OpenAI's ChatGPT has intimate confessions from millions of users who've poured their thoughts into the chatbot, apparently forgetting that someone—or something—is listening.Apple built Private Cloud Compute instead, a system where even cloud-processed AI queries are encrypted and never stored. The company allows users to opt out of data collection. Its web crawler lets websites block Apple's AI from learning from their content. Many sites have done exactly that, the Information reported, creating yet another handicap.""There are a thousand noes for everything in this area,"" one person familiar with Apple's AI work told Bloomberg. ""You have to fight through the privacy police to get anything done.""The principled stance has a cost. Apple's internal chatbot was at least 25% less accurate than ChatGPT at answering most queries, according to company data described to Bloomberg. Less data means worse AI. It's that simple.By spring 2025, Tim Cook had seen enough. According to Bloomberg, the CEO concluded that John Giannandrea—the former Google executive hired in 2018 specifically to fix Apple's AI problems—couldn't execute on product development.The solution was dramatic. Strip Siri from Giannandrea's control entirely. Hand it to Mike Rockwell, the hardware veteran who'd created the Vision Pro headset. Put Rockwell under Craig Federighi, who would now own Apple's entire AI product roadmap.Giannandrea kept his title—senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy—but his actual responsibilities shrank. He'd oversee research and infrastructure, important work but no longer the stuff that shows up in keynote presentations.Bloomberg reported that some executives have discussed shrinking his role even further or easing him toward retirement. He's 60 now, and while he's told colleagues he wants to stay until Apple's AI is ""in proper shape,"" people close to the situation say he's also professed relief that Siri is ""now someone else's problem.""The reshuffling exposed tensions that had been simmering for years. The Information reported that Federighi, known for being cost-conscious and skeptical of risky investments, had long resisted the kind of massive AI spending that rivals embraced. Around 2019, he'd reportedly shot down a proposal to use AI for rearranging iPhone home screens, arguing it would confuse users.Even after ChatGPT's launch in late 2022 convinced him AI mattered, Federighi's instincts clashed with what the technology demanded. ""In the world of AI, you really don't know what the product is until you've done the investment,"" one longtime Apple executive told Bloomberg. ""That's not how Apple is wired.""Faced with failing models and fleeing talent, Apple started shopping around. The company met with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google to discuss partnerships. It even built two parallel versions of the new Siri internally—one powered by Apple's own models, codenamed ""Linwood,"" and another running on third-party tech, codenamed ""Glenwood.""Anthropic was initially the frontrunner, Bloomberg reported. But the AI startup's financial demands were steep—it wanted a multibillion-dollar annual fee that would increase sharply each year. That sent Apple looking elsewhere.Google closed the deal for a few reasons. First, its Gemini 3 model topped AI leaderboards when it launched in November 2025, proving the search giant had caught up to OpenAI. Second, Google had something AI startups lack: a proven track record running large-scale services for corporate clients. Third, and perhaps most importantly, Apple and Google already had a template for this kind of arrangement.Google pays Apple around $20 billion a year to be Safari's default search engine, a deal that survived antitrust scrutiny and remains wildly profitable for both companies. The AI partnership follows similar logic: Google provides the technology, Apple controls the user experience, both benefit from the iPhone's massive installed base.The Financial Times estimated the AI contract could be worth $5 billion for Google over time, structured as cloud computing services rather than direct licensing.With Giannandrea sidelined and Rockwell reporting to him, Federighi now controls Apple's entire AI roadmap. And the Google deal? That was his call. Federighi himself, by late 2025 had consolidated near-total control over Apple's AI direction.According to The Information, Federighi spent years as an AI skeptic, rejecting proposals from his lieutenants who tried to convince him the technology mattered. He preferred software that behaved predictably, where engineers could specify exactly how features would work during design reviews. AI's algorithmic unpredictability made him uncomfortable.When engineers pitched him on a feature that would use AI to dynamically reorganise the iPhone home screen based on usage patterns, Federighi shut it down. His reasoning: it would disorient users who expect their apps to stay in the same place. Apple does offer Siri Suggestions widgets that surface apps proactively, but nothing as ambitious as what was proposed.The Information also reported that Federighi ""tends to scrutinise every detail of his team's expenses, down to their budgets for bananas and other office snacks."" He's resisted paying AI researchers the kind of salaries that have become standard at Meta and OpenAI, concerned about creating compensation disparities with Apple's executive team.But ChatGPT changed Federighi's calculus. After experimenting with OpenAI's chatbot in late 2022, he told colleagues he'd come to appreciate what the technology could do. He tasked his teams with finding ways to integrate similar capabilities into Apple products.Once converted, Federighi moved decisively. When Apple's homegrown models proved inadequate, he led the charge to evaluate external alternatives. He oversaw the ""bake-off"" between different AI providers. And when the Google deal came together, it was Federighi's decision to structure it so Apple could swap AI providers if needed—a hedge against lock-in that reflects his careful, pragmatic approach.The Google partnership solves Apple's immediate crisis, but it doesn't answer the bigger question: what happens when AI becomes the primary way people interact with technology?Apple is reportedly building a new Siri experience, codenamed ""Campos,"" that will work as a full chatbot embedded across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. It's scheduled to launch later this year. But here's the interesting part: Bloomberg reports that Apple is designing the system so the underlying AI models can be swapped out over time.Gemini today. Maybe Anthropic's Claude tomorrow. Or OpenAI's next GPT. Or even Apple's own models if they ever improve enough.This plug-and-play architecture reveals Apple's bet: that AI models will become commodities, powerful but ultimately interchangeable. If that's true, the real advantage shifts to design, privacy controls, hardware integration—things Apple actually excels at.It's the same playbook Apple has used for technologies it doesn't own. The company doesn't run its own search engine or cellular networks or maps (well, not successfully). Instead, it packages third-party services into products people want to use.Whether that works for AI remains to be seen. The risk is that by outsourcing the foundation, Apple cedes the ability to create breakthrough features that require deep integration between models and hardware. The next revolutionary product might demand capabilities only a company that controls the full AI stack can deliver.There's also the branding problem. Apple Intelligence was supposed to be ""AI for the rest of us""—simple, reliable, distinctly Apple. Revealing it's actually running on Google's brain doesn't quite fit that narrative.But Apple doesn't have many options left. The company that revolutionised voice assistants in 2011 let Siri stagnate for over a decade. When the AI revolution arrived, Apple was caught unprepared. Delays piled up. Talent fled. Internal models underperformed.Now it's trying something different: admitting it can't do everything alone, and hoping that's enough.","Apple will power its revamped Siri with Google's Gemini models, in a deal worth roughly $1 billion a year.

How TikTok will change under US leadership



President Donald Trump says he ‘saved TikTok’







TikTok has officially transitioned to US-led ownership, putting an end to years-long geopolitical standoff. The short-video giant has announced that it has finalised a complex divestment deal, essentially cutting its primary ties with its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to avoid a permanent nationwide in America. The deal has created a new entity called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, and it has facilitated by President Donald Trump.This means that by licensing the app’s algorithm and housing all operations within US borders, the Chinese company has satisfied national security requirements that have plagued it since 2020. Moreover, the newly-formed joint venture will be governed by a seven-member, majority-American board. Adam Presser, a former WarnerMedia executive, has been tapped as the CEO of the US operations.The ownership of TikTok is now split among a consortium of high-profile global and American investors. These include Oracle, Silver Lake, MGX, ByteDance and a group of Strategic Investors.TikTok is not just changing hands but the core working of the app will be different. Under Oracle, the algorithm is being “retrained” exclusively on US user data, ensuring that the data used to predict user preferences never leaves American soil and is not accessible by foreign entities.This will means that the, localised new version of the algorithm is expected to feel different to the 200 million Americans on the platform, potentially leading to a “slower” or less accurate recommendation feed compared to the global version.Trump celebrated the deal on social media, stating he was “happy to have helped in saving TikTok”.“I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok! It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice. Along with other factors, it was responsible for my doing so well with the Youth Vote in the 2024 Presidential Election,” Trump posted on Truth Social. He had previously postponed enforcement of ban legislation to allow for negotiations.“I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok. Thank you to Vice President JD Vance, and all of the others within my Administration, who helped bring this Deal to a very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion. I would also like to thank President Xi, of China, for working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal. He could have gone the other way, but didn’t, and is appreciated for his decision.

Despite calling himself an AI optimist, he believes both ""smart"" and ""dumb money"" are flooding the sector, though he expects the free market to eventually determine real winners.

From dot-com bust to AI boom: Taylor draws parallels

Sierra's $10 billion valuation amid bubble warnings





Bret Taylor, the chairman of OpenAI 's board, has stated that artificial intelligence is ""probably"" a bubble and expects a market correction in the coming years. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Taylor told CNBC that both ""smart money"" and ""dumb money"" are currently funding AI competitors at every layer of the tech stack.""When everyone knows that AI is going to have a huge impact on the economy across a huge range of industries and workflows, money is plentiful,"" Taylor explained. He added that while he expects consolidation and correction over the next few years, innovation requires ""that kind of messy competition.""Taylor, who also co-founded AI customer service startup Sierra, described himself as an AI optimist despite his bubble concerns. He believes the free market will ultimately determine which AI players have the best products and where the real value lies.This isn't the first time Taylor has expressed these views. In a September 2025 interview with The Verge, he drew comparisons between today's AI landscape and the late 1990s dot-com bubble. While many companies failed when that bubble burst, Taylor argued that ""all the people in 1999 were kind of right"" because the internet eventually created massive economic value through companies like Amazon and Google ""I think it is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,"" Taylor told The Verge. ""I think we're also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money. I think both are absolutely true at the same time.""Taylor's bubble warnings come as his own company rides the AI wave. Sierra, which builds AI agents for customer service, raised $350 million in September 2025 at a $10 billion valuation—a figure Taylor himself acknowledged ""almost seems quaint"" given the growing number of $100 billion-plus AI companies.Before launching Sierra, Taylor served as co-CEO of Salesforce, board chairman of Twitter during Elon Musk's takeover, CTO at Facebook (now Meta), and co-created Google Maps. His extensive tech industry experience gives weight to his predictions about AI's trajectory and potential pitfalls.","Bret Taylor, the chairman of OpenAI's board, has stated that artificial intelligence is ""probably"" a bubble.

Facing new competition

Jamie Dimon calls for phased deployment of AI





JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that even after two decades the mistakes that haunt him most are not the failed deals or bad calls, but they are the moments he moved too slowly. As reported by Fortune, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davis, Dimon described that bureaucratic inertia and delayed personnel decisions as the most costly errors of his career, especially in an era where artificial intelligence is accelerating the pace of chance. “Inertia has become an unforgivable sin,” Dimon said, underscoring how hesitation can cripple even the largest institutions.That urgency is the reason behind JPMorgan’s aggressive embrace of artificial intelligence, which Dimon called the most consequential technological shift of his lifetime. Far from a side project, AI is embedded across the bank’s operations — from fraud detection and credit decisions to marketing and customer service. The bank has deployed more than 500 AI use cases and built an internal large language model used weekly by 50,000 employees.Dimon also warned that legacy bans can no longer rely on scale or repetition alone. The competitive landscape now incorporates fintech disruptors like Stripe, PayPal, Chime and SoFi, which can chip away at traditional banking services with speed and precision. “Firms that move too slowly risk losing business to faster, more focused competitors,” he said.Along with this, Dimon also recognised that AI will eliminate some jobs, reshape others and also create new ones. The real danger, he believes is not the technology itself but the speed at which it advances compared to society’s ability to adapt. “You’ll have civil unrest,” Dimon warned, if displacement arrives in sudden, concentrated waves.To mitigate that risk, Dimon proposed a phased approach to AI deployment, with governments and companies working together to slow mass layoffs and support retraining. He suggested that local negotiations — not sweeping federal mandates — would be the most effective way to manage the transition. Pressed on whether JPMorgan would accept government-imposed limits on layoffs, Dimon was unequivocal: “We would agree if we have to do that to save society,” he said.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that bureaucratic inertia and delayed personnel decisions are the most costly errors of his career.

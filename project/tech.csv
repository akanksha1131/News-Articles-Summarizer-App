What Scott Bessent said about the government’s plan to acquire a stake in Nvidia



“I don't think Nvidia needs financial support. That seems not on the table right now, but could there be other industries where we're reshaping, something like shipbuilding, that, sure, there could be things like that. These are critical industries that we have to, we have to be self-sufficient in the United States.”

“I don't know if we need to take stakes in defence companies. We'll see whether the defence companies are fulfilling their mission in terms of providing adequate and timely deliveries for the U.S. military as opposed to maybe an overemphasis on the shareholders,""

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has confirmed that the Trump administration is not planning to acquire a stake in Nvidia . While the government intends to invest in industrial companies, the decision to avoid a stake in the US-based chip giant aims to reduce uncertainty for investors, Bessant noted. The White House's plan to take positions in private companies, a move previously seen with another chipmaker, Intel , has raised concerns among investors about potential share dilution. The policy has also caused discomfort among some of US President Donald Trump 's supporters, who oppose the idea of government investment in the private sector.In a Fox Business interview, Bessent said,Apart from this, Bessent also dismissed a suggestion made by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick about the possibility of major defence contractors being the government’s next investment targets.Bessent noted.Last week, the Trump administration announced that it had taken a nearly 10% stake in chipmaker Intel. In June, it had also intervened in Nippon Steel’s acquisition of US Steel, securing what Trump described as a “golden share” that grants Washington influence over the company’s operations.Trump has often expressed interest in creating a sovereign wealth fund, with senior aides describing the Intel investment as a “down payment” toward that goal. However, it remains unclear how actively the administration will implement this strategy, mainly since no such fund currently exists, and it has not even received congressional approval.",US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has confirmed that the Trump administration is not planning to acquire a stake in Nvidia.

America's largest charitable organisation, The Gates Foundation , has reportedly stopped providing grants to a non-profit network associated with the Democratic Party. This move could prove to be a significant blow to a powerful player in liberal politics, according to a report. An internal foundation announcement reviewed by The New York Times (NYT) suggests that Mark Suzman , the CEO of the charitable organisation started by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda Gates , decided to stop all grants to non-profit funds managed by the consulting firm Arabella Advisors in June. This decision has also caused unease within the world of progressive philanthropy, the report noted.In the internal document, the Gates Foundation wrote:However, the Gates Foundation's internal announcement from June did not mention politics; instead, it cited a desire to work directly with grant recipients and reduce the use of intermediaries. Arabella Advisors is also known for managing ""dark money"" funds that support Democrats and the progressive movement.As per the report, some nonprofits that work with Arabella are now attempting to distance themselves from the company to maintain their relationship with the Gates Foundation, which has given or pledged nearly $450 million to Arabella-administered funds over the past 16 years.The Gates Foundation, which has gradually been shifting away from intermediaries, plans to increase direct giving as it works to spend down its $77 billion endowment by 2045.Arabella, employing over 400 staff, manages funds that provide back-office support to nonprofits, some of which are engaged in political activities, such as voter registration and Democratic super PAC donations. Critics argue it wields outsized influence, though Arabella insists it simply offers operational support to philanthropic clients.The Gates Foundation was an early backer of Arabella’s New Venture Fund. Still, by 2023, its contributions made up only 2% of the fund’s revenue, as the fund had significantly diversified its donor base.","The Gates Foundation has reportedly stopped providing grants to a non-profit network associated with the Democratic Party.

A call for guardrails and awareness



As part of a new revelation about AI, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’. For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at a recent interview, Suleyman explained AI psychosis as a “real and emerging risk” which can easily affect vulnerable individuals who become deeply immersed in conversations with AI agents. The condition will mainly affect the individuals whose interactions blur the line between human and machine.As per the Microsoft AI CEO, AI psychosis is a state of mind in which individuals start to anthropomorphize AI, attributing emotions, intentions, or consciousness to systems that are fundamentally non-human. ""It disconnects people from reality, fraying fragile social bonds and structures, distorting pressing moral priorities,"" he said.The condition can lead to delusional thinking here individuals feel that AI is sentiment or has some personal relationships with them. Along with this, it can also cause emotional dependency to users who are either isolated or mentally fragile. Lastly, AI psychosis can also lead to distorted perception of reality as users rely a lot of AI for validation, companionship and also decision-making.Suleyman also stressed on that fact that while AI can be helpful and engaging but it is definitely not a substitute for human or clinical support.As per Business Insider, Suleyman also has asked the tech industry to take this risk quite seriously and also help in implementing some ethical guardrails, which include:* Clear disclaimers about AI’s limitations* Monitoring for signs of unhealthy usage patterns* Collaboration with mental health professionals to study and mitigate risksAlong with this, Suleyman also urged the regulators and educators to raise public awareness as AI is slowly becoming more embedded in the daily life in the form of personal assistant and therapeutic chatbots.""AI companions are a completely new category, and we urgently need to start talking about the guardrails we put in place to protect people and ensure this amazing technology can do its job of delivering immense value to the world,"" Suleyman added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’ For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems.

German banks have blocked PayPal payments totalling more than 10 billion euros ($11.7 billion) due to fraud concerns. The news agency Reuters cited the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung to report this development. The payments were halted earlier this week after lenders flagged millions of suspicious direct debits from PayPal that appeared last week. A banking source told Reuters that the value of the blocked payments was somewhere between hundreds of millions and billions of euros. According to the report, PayPal's security system, which typically filters out fraudulent direct debits, was either ""completely or largely disrupted"" late last week, resulting in unvetted payments being sent to banks, the report explained.the PayPal spokesperson said to Reuters.The spokesperson also said that the temporary service disruption impacted “certain transactions from our banking partners and possibly their customers,” but confirmed that the issue has since been resolved.Germany's Savings Banks and Giro Association, which represents over 300 local savings banks and financial service providers, recently told Reuters that cases of unauthorised direct debits via PayPal have had a “significant impact on payment transactions” across Europe, with Germany being particularly affected.The association noted that PayPal transactions for Sparkasse customers had already returned to normal and confirmed that supervisory authorities had been notified.Germany’s financial regulator BaFin acknowledged it had been informed but did not share further details.

DOGE looking for additional savings

DOGE employees illegally accessed government data, claim critics

Elon Musk is out of DOGE, but this seems to no way mean that the DOGE-linked layoffs or cuts too have gone. According to a report by Bloomberg, the Pentagon is preparing for its in-house DOGE team to examine almost half a million contracts and grants in a bid to trim waste.The Pentagon is reportedly gearing up to review more than 400,000 contracts and grants in a massive effort to find and cut wasteful spending. The report quotes recent budget documents. This initiative is being led by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a unit that has continued its work despite the departure of its founder, Elon Musk.The goal is to find ""additional savings"" in contracts for fiscal year 2026 and beyond. As these savings are identified, the Pentagon plans to ask Congress to shift the money to other programs. A Pentagon spokesperson told Bloomberg that the in-house DOGE team, which consists of about a dozen people, is ""absolutely for certain"" to continue its work.While the Pentagon hasn't disclosed how many contracts DOGE has already reviewed, its budget book cites 390 contracts that have been ""terminated or adjusted."" Separately, a database maintained by DOGE.gov shows about 600 canceled or adjusted defense contracts, claiming more than $20 billion in savings. This is significantly more than an outside analysis by Todd Harrison of the American Enterprise Institute, who tallied about $11 billion in savings.Critics, however, have raised concerns about DOGE's ""slash-and-burn"" methods and a lack of transparency. Lawsuits also allege that DOGE employees illegally accessed government data at other agencies. Harrison pointed out that because a large portion of the Pentagon's budget goes to labor, ""the main way they are likely to save money is by cutting people.""Harrison also questions the feasibility of reviewing such a large number of contracts. ""The only way they will be able to get through reviewing 400,000 contracts over the next year is to use some sort of automated generic algorithm,"" he said, noting that a proper, in-depth review of each contract would take far too long for the current DOGE staff.","The Pentagon is reportedly gearing up to review more than 400,000 contracts and grants in a massive effort to find and cut wasteful spending.

AI is going to be the ‘next big thing’: Rao



Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 Review: Changing The Game

Samsung has outlined its strategic vision for the future of its on-device artificial intelligence (AI). According to a top executive from Samsung R&D Institute India – Bangalore (SRI-B), with Galaxy AI , the company is now keenly focused on moving from the smartphone era to the ‘AI Phone’ era where AI is used to enhance overall experience. To achieve its goal, Samsung is dedicated to democratising Galaxy AI, making its advanced capabilities accessible across a broader spectrum of Galaxy devices. This includes everything from flagship smartphones to notebooks and other gadgets.“Galaxy AI started with the Galaxy S24 series of smartphones, and now it has become a platform for us to make a good impression on the consumers,” Mohan Rao Goli , corporate vice president and managing director of Samsung R&D Institute India – Bangalore (SRI-B), told The Times of India-Gadgets Now.He highlighted that the company offered several features under the Galaxy AI platform, and based on the “very good feedback from the consumers”, the company is now building on those features to further enhance the user experience.Rao says that Samsung is working on two ways to enhance the Galaxy AI experience for the consumers: Personalisation and moving from smartphones to AI phones.“Galaxy AI focuses on personalisation of one’s device as per his/ her needs. It can provide timely assistance to everyone’s personal needs and (by extension) enhance productivity,” Goli said, when asked about Samsung’s vision when it comes to AI. “So that's where we are focusing: Providing a personalised experience to the users using the Galaxy AI.”When asked how the company optimises the same Galaxy AI features across the Galaxy devices – Like from a Rs 8,000 phone to a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 that costs Rs 1.75 lakh -- Rao emphasised that while the level of functionality will naturally depend on the specific hardware compute capabilities available on each device, the overarching goal is to significantly expand the AI platform's reach.He noted that while flagship devices will run all Galaxy AI-related features, certain meaningful AI functionalities will also be extended to platforms like the A-series smartphones.“We make a decision. What features go onto the Galaxy A platform, to what kind of consumers and it all depends on the market needs. We also try to optimise certain features by taking out certain minimum features to provide to the consumers. This happens before making the product itself,” Goli told TOI-Gadgets Now.Rao elaborated on the impact of AI, saying that the technology is going to be the ‘next big thing’. He explained that AI is fundamentally changing user interaction with technology, moving beyond traditional interfaces.“I think AI is going to be a very important trend. I know AI is the buzzword everybody is using, but in my opinion, the face of these particular technologies with AI introductions, complementing the AI models, is changing,” Goli said.“If you have to stick to computer vision and technologies only, maybe a smartphone camera wouldn't have been where it is today. By adding and complementing the AI features and models with smartphone camera algorithms, we created wonderful images, wonderful videos, and are creating the editing experience for the masses,” Goli explained.The transition from a “smartphone to AI phone” is not an overnight phenomenon, Goli stressed, drawing parallels to the evolution of smartphones themselves.“The smartphone era did not happen overnight. The AI phone also will happen, and it will take some time. For that, the groundwork is that we have to prepare the platform. So the Galaxy AI is the platform for that transition to happen,” he concluded.","Samsung has outlined its strategic vision for the future of its on-device artificial intelligence (AI) According to a top executive from Samsung R&D Institute India – Bangalore (SRI-B), the company is now keenly focused on moving from the smartphone era to the ‘AI Phone’ era where AI is used to enhance overall experience.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123542478,imgsize-35468,width-400,resizemode-4/Mohan-Rao-Goli.jpg"

Why Apple may be planning to buy Perplexity

As Apple gears up to launch its iPhone 17 series on September 9, a report by The Information has emerged which says that the Cupertino-based company internally discussed acquiring Mistral AI and Perplexity. Mistral AI is a Paris-based artificial intelligence company founded in 2023 and backed by Nvidia. Perplexity AI , on the other hand, is a US based company led by Aravind Srinivas.The report comes a month later Apple CEO Tim Cook signaled a shift from its historic conservative merger and acquisition (M&A) stand stating that the company was open to larger AI-related acquisitions in order to accelerate its AI roadmap. The iPhone maker has spent more than a hundred million dollars on an acquisition, with Beats at $3 billion and Intel's wireless modem business at $1 billion.Apple’s services head Eddy Cue is said to be the strongest supporter of buying AI companies to strengthen the company’s products. In the past, Cue also backed ideas for Apple to acquire Netflix and Tesla, though CEO Tim Cook rejected them. Other executives, including software chief Craig Federighi, are reportedly less interested in buying AI startups, believing Apple can develop its own AI technology instead.Nevertheless, the Information report corroborates with a previous Bloomberg report that said that Apple is exploring a potential acquisition of AI startup Perplexity AI to bolster its artificial intelligence capabilities. Citing people familiar with the matter, the report then said that the discussions were led by Adrian Perica, Apple’s head of mergers and acquisitions, alongside services chief Eddy Cue and key AI decision-makers. However, the source added that the talks were in an early stage and may not result in a formal offer.Acquiring Perplexity or Mistral AI, as stated in The Information report, could provide Apple with AI talent, a recognized brand, and a consumer product to strengthen its position. Alternatively, Apple has considered partnering with Perplexity, potentially integrating its technology into Safari and Siri. The companies have met multiple times, with Apple’s AI team evaluating Perplexity’s technology, signaling interest in a closer relationship.","The Information reports that Apple has discussed acquiring Mistral AI and Perplexity AI.

Mark Zuckerberg’s gifts fails to calm neighbours



Not first property dispute

Nothing Headphones (1) Review: Style Meets Sound

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly gifted noise-cancelling headphones to his neighbours in Palo Alto. According to a New York Times report, the move came after years of complaints over nonstop construction and disruptions linked to his growing residential compound in the Crescent Park area. As per the report, Zuckerberg has spent more than $110 million over the past 14 years buying at least 11 homes on Edgewood Drive and Hamilton Avenue. Neighbours say the once-quiet area, home to lawyers, executives and Stanford professors, has turned into a zone of construction equipment, noise and lavish parties.While some of the properties remain empty in a region that is already facing acute housing shortage, others have been turned into guest houses, gardens, a pool with a hydrofloor, a pickleball court and even a short-lived private school for Mark Zuckerberg’s children.Beneath the compound, the Meta CEO has also built around 7,000 square feet of underground space, which some locals compare to a “billionaire’s bat cave.”Reportedly, the noise cancelling headphones was among several gifts that Mark Zuckerberg gave to his neighbours in order to appease them. He had also gifted bottles of sparkling wine and boxes of Krispy Kreme doughnuts. But, none of them have been effective. Zuckerberg’s neighbours say the gestures have done little to offset frustrations over blocked streets, debris, constant noise and heavy security patrols.neighbours say the gestures have done little to offset frustrations over blocked streets, debris, constant noise and heavy security patrols.This is not Mark Zuckerberg’s first clash with neighbours.

Veeps,

I'm writing to share some difficult news. Today we have made workforce reductions across the company as part of our ongoing efforts to manage costs and ensure resources are allocated to our most critical priorities. All impacted Veeps have been notified.

These are not decisions we've taken lightly, and I want to address both those who will be impacted and those who will continue with us on Verily's journey.

A significant part of these changes is the decision to wind down our Devices program. Over the years, Verily has built a legacy in developing world-class, innovative medical devices. The dedicated professionals in our Devices organizations — many who have devoted a decade or more to this important work — have poured their hearts, expertise, and commitment into advancing

healthcare technology

. To everyone who contributed to this program, whether as a core team member or in a supporting role across the company, your efforts have been extraordinary. You've led groundbreaking achievements, from the launch of the Dexcom G7 CGM, to the Stargazer VNRC launch with other 7,800 patients screened, to Study Devices launched with numerous study partners, and these contributions have advanced patient care and medical research.

As Verily has continued on its journey of narrowing product focus around our precision health platform, and data and AI strategy, we cannot support the investment of the resources necessary for the long-term growth and scaling of our Devices programs, and have therefore made the difficult decision to fully wind down the program. We will continue to honor our commitments by supporting customers using the Numetric Watch in active clinical trials.

To all of our departing Veeps: Your contributions to programs across our business have been invaluable to Verily's mission and have made a lasting mark on the healthcare technology landscape. The innovation, dedication, and collaborative spirit you've brought to your work have advanced our company and touched many lives. We are grateful for everything you've given to Verily and to the patients and partners we serve together.

To our continuing team members: I know this news is difficult to process, especially as we say goodbye to colleagues and friends. Your continued dedication during this transition period is both appreciated and essential as we focus our efforts on our core mission. The work ahead of us in precision health, data, and AI remains as important and exciting as ever, and we need your expertise and commitment to continue making a meaningful different in healthcare. We will be providing additional details about what today's changes mean for Verily and for you and your teams in the coming days, both within your respective functions and in our next town hall.

During this challenging time, I ask for your patience and understanding as we prioritize supporting our departing colleagues in the days ahead. To everyone — whether you're leaving us or continuing with Verily — thank you for your professionalism, your contributions, and your commitment to our shared mission of using technology to improve human health.

The path forward requires difficult decisions, but I remain confident in Verily's future and grateful for the exceptional team that will continue building it.

China’s biggest online shopping website Temu has resumed direct shipments of goods from Chinese factories to the US. According to a Financial Times report, the e-commerce platform has also increased its advertising spending in the US after a trade deal between Washington and Beijing. Temu had suspended the service in May this year. The report says that multiple Temu suppliers, partners and investors have restored so-called fully managed shipments — where it handles most of the logistics and customs formalities on behalf of suppliers — in July.In April, Trump administration had announced the cancellation of the de minimis exemption, which allowed goods worth under $800 from China to enter the US duty-free. The order meant duties of more than 100% on such shipments.The change then hit Temu hard, as its rapid growth was partly driven by shipping billions of dollars of small packages tax-free. After Trump’s order, Temu had said that it would fulfill US orders from American suppliers.Talks between Washington and Beijing in May led to a temporary reduction in tariffs. The US agreed to cut extra duties on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days, and lowered the rate for small packages from China to 54%. The truce was extended for another 90 days this month.However, from August 29, the US will end de minimis exemptions for all countries, meaning all low-cost parcels will face tariffs. Last year, US Customs and Border Protection cleared 1.3 billion de minimis packages worth $64.6 billion.The report quotes Sheng Lu, a fashion industry professor at the University of Delaware who said “Because of across-the-board tariff increases . . . even regular brands and retailers have to increase their price substantially. This will reduce the price pressure facing Temu and Shein.”",China’s biggest online shopping website Temu has resumed direct shipments of goods from Chinese factories to the US.

When combined with AT&T’s fibre internet network, the spectrum is intended to help meet increasing demand for data and enable upcoming use cases, including applications in AI, autonomous vehicles, and advanced robotics.AT&T also expects to expand the availability of its fixed wireless home internet service, AT&T Internet Air, particularly in areas where the company plans to deploy fibre in the coming days. The spectrum licenses will allow the company to transition customers from legacy copper-based services to newer technologies such as AT&T Internet Air and AT&T Phone – Advanced.In addition, the acquisition is expected to support long-term growth and efficiencies. AT&T anticipates that the added spectrum will reduce the need for new cell site construction to increase network capacity, lowering capital costs over time.",AT&T has reached an agreement to acquire wireless spectrum licenses from EchoStar in a nearly $23 billion deal. This deal will also improve a long-term wholesale network services agreement between the two companies. The licenses that will cover over 400 markets across the US are expected to strengthen AT&T’s spectrum holdings in low-band and mid-band frequencies.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123529129,imgsize-1210706,width-400,resizemode-4/ATT-announces-23-billion-deal-to-acquire-EchoStars-spectrum-licenses-heres-what-it-means-for-users.jpg"
"Startups selling at discounts of 30-40%, says Family Office to Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy; warns on startup valuations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/startups-selling-at-discounts-of-30-40-says-family-office-to-infosys-co-founder-narayana-murthy-warns-on-startup-valuations/articleshow/123526890.cms,"Valuation bubble deflates



Catamaran’s strategic pivot



In an assessment of the Indian startup ecosystem , Catamaran Ventures LLP, the family office of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy , has raised concerns over the inflated startup valuations and also revealed that many startups are still being sold at 30 to 40% discount. Catamaran president, Deepak Padaki told Bloomberg that many startups lack clear paths to profitability and are being offloaded by funds which leads to end of their investment cycles. “Funds that invested in these companies want to sell their investments because they are reaching the end of their fund terms,” Deepak Padaki said, adding that Catamaran is steering clear of turnaround-heavy deals.India’s startup scene, once buoyed by pandemic-era funding surges that peaked at $38.5 billion in 2021, has seen a sharp correction. While deal activity has rebounded slightly in 2024 to $13.7 billion, investors are now scrutinizing growth metrics and profitability more rigorously.High-profile examples like Oyo Hotels , once valued at $10 billion, illustrate the volatility. The company has faced stiff competition and delayed its IPO multiple times, despite a partial recovery.The warning reveals the new reality of India startup ecosystem. As per the family office, many VC firms are focusing on making a secure exit and are also willing to offload their stakes at a considerable loss. This change indicate that the investors have shifted their focus from aggressive growth at any cost to only profitability.Catamaran which manages $1.3 billion for Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy and also holds stakes in companies like SpaceX and National Stock Exchange of India is now shifting its focus towards manufacturing and supply chain-driven enterprises. The company is also helping some small and medium businesses in scaling their operations in various sectors such as aerospace, EVs, electronics and medical devices.Deepak Padaki stressed on the fact that India has a small window to capitalise on its cost effective nature. “As a family office with the potential to deploy more patient capital, manufacturing fits aptly with what we want to do,” he said.","Catamaran Ventures LLP, the family office of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy has raised concerns over the inflated startup valuations.

200 Chinese planes were unable to fly because US did not give …: Donald Trump ‘reminder’ to China while warning of more tariff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/200-chinese-planes-were-unable-to-fly-because-us-did-not-give-donald-trump-reminder-to-china-while-warning-of-more-tariff/articleshow/123525416.cms,"Donald Trump threatens slapping 200% tariff on China

Chinese analyst calls Donald Trump's remarks as bluff

President Donald Trump once again warned that the United States would impose steeper tariffs on China if it restricted exports of rare-earth magnets to the country. The move is being seen as threat that could jeopardize a fragile trade truce between the world's two largest economies. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, Donald Trump said, “They have to give us magnets, if they don’t give us magnets, then we have to charge them 200% tariffs or something.”The President also revealed a key point of leverage the US holds over Beijing: Airplane parts. ""200 of their planes were unable to fly because we were not giving them Boeing parts purposely because they weren’t giving us magnets,"" Trump claimed. This comes as Boeing is reportedly working toward a deal to sell as many as 500 aircraft to China, underscoring the role of aerospace in the trade negotiations.The recent surge in China's rare-earth magnet exports to the U.S. preceded the president's warning. According to the latest government data, shipments to the U.S. in June surged by 660% from the previous month and continued to rise in July.China holds a dominant position in the global supply chain for these critical materials, controlling about 90% of the world's rare-earth magnet production and a similar share of the refining process. This gives Beijing significant leverage in trade talks, as U.S. industries—including automotive, electronics, and renewable energy—rely heavily on these magnets.Henry Wang, president of the Center for China & Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank, characterized Trump's remarks as a bluff. In a conversation with CNBC, Wang said, ""He always talks big on tariffs or potential punishment, but we shouldn’t get caught up in the rhetoric."" He added that the true measure of progress will be both sides' efforts to implement existing agreements.The current temporary trade truce, which included an agreement to ease controls on Chinese rare-earth exports and roll back some American tech restrictions, is set to expire in mid-November. The deal lowered tariffs on each other’s goods to around 55% for the U.S. and 32% for China.November deadline for ChinaWith the November deadline looming, the fate of the trade truce will likely depend on continued engagement between the two nations. Senior Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang is reportedly heading to Washington this week for meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and other senior officials.",Chinese analyst calls Donald Trump's remarks as bluff.

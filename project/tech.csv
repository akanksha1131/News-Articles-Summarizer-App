Why AI may devalue skills, not just eliminate jobs



How skills become obsolete:

Automation of routine tasks : Industries like typing, factory work, and taxi driving saw initial waves of automation. With AI, even roles requiring moderate skill—like legal document review or marketing analysis—are now at risk.

: Industries like typing, factory work, and taxi driving saw initial waves of automation. With AI, even roles requiring moderate skill—like legal document review or marketing analysis—are now at risk. Commoditised skills: Resources like touch typing were once prized. Once AI can perform those actions without fatigue or error, such skills lose their edge.

The ‘Mad Max’ comparison: What it means



Concentrated gains : Wealth and influence accrue to companies and individuals who own AI systems.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping our world in profound ways—from improving medical diagnostics to powering chatbots and self-driving cars. But not all of its impacts are positive. In a Business Insider interview on the “Possible” podcast, MIT economist David Autor sounded a serious caution: AI could turn our labour market into something resembling a Mad Max wasteland. While this doesn’t mean total job loss, it does mean something equally alarming—the devaluation of once-valuable skills, pushing many into poorly paid work with limited advancement, as reported by Business Insider.This warning comes amid broader studies, such as a Salesforce projection that up to 23% of the workforce could be redeployed due to AI in the next two years (Business Insider, citing Salesforce). The underlying concern is clear: AI may not take jobs outright, but it could severely undermine what makes work valuable.Autor’s analogy to Mad Max warns of a world where technology runs rampant and wealth concentrates at the top. Instead of liberation, AI could exacerbate income inequality and leave most people scrambling for low-end service roles. This article explores Autor’s caution, what’s driving this concern, which sectors are most vulnerable, and why intentional design and workforce planning are critical to avoid an AI-driven dystopia.Autor argues that the threat AI poses is more subtle than mass unemployment. Instead of taking jobs, it may strip roles of their expert value, turning once-specialised skills into commodities.“The threat… is not running out of work, but making the valuable skills that people have highly abundant so they’re no longer valuable,” Autor explained.Autor’s bleak vision is inspired by the Mad Max universe—a world marked by scarcity, brutal competition, and centralised power. He sees an economic parallel: AI empowers a few, while the majority struggle.A Salesforce study cited by Business Insider estimates that 23% of the global workforce may be redeployed in the next two years due to increased AI adoption. This includes changes in roles, responsibilities, or sectors.While not everyone will lose their job, many may find themselves working in different, less lucrative positions—a dangerous shift that Autor warns could erode societal well-being if not managed.Autor emphasises these roles as critical to ensuring AI serves humans, not the other way around.Autor recognises the potential for AI to enhance human capabilities—but only if implemented thoughtfully. He urges:“The future is not a forecasting exercise—it’s a design exercise,” Autor said, as reported in Business Insider.He insists the AI future must be built deliberately, not left to chance.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping our world in profound ways.

OpenAI Chief Research Officer warning to employees

Who replaces Ruoming Pang at Apple

It seems Facebook-and Instagram parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is still not done shopping talent for his new AI superintelligence unit. According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple’s head of AI models, Ruoming Pang , is leaving the iPhone maker to work at Meta. This marks the latest high-ranking AI executive that Mark Zuckerberg has poached to be part of his new AI superintelligence unit. With this, the Apple exec joins an array of talent Zuckerberg has poached in recent months, including leaders from Google DeepMind, OpenAI , and Safe Superintelligence.Pang is said to be a key part of Apple’s in-house team that trained the AI foundation models that are said to underpin Apple Intelligence and other on-device AI features. Pang is reported to offer expertise in designing small, on-device AI models to Meta. Sources told Bloomberg that Ruoming Pang’s departure might be the first of many in Apple’s troubled AI unit.Meta Platforms is reported to be racing to secure top AI talent for its newly created Superintelligence Labs to better compete with rivals including OpenAI, Google and Anthropic. The Facebook and Instagram parent's aggressive hiring for its unified AI initiative has intensified the talent war in Silicon Valley.ChatGPT-maker OpenAI recently announced a rare company-wide shutdown to give employees time to recharge after months of grueling 80-hour workweeks. According to a report by Wired, the temporary closure comes as the ChatGPT maker fights to retain top talent amid Meta's aggressive $100 million recruitment offers.Chief Research Officer Mark Chen is said to have warned employees in an internal Slack memo that Meta would likely exploit the shutdown period to pressure OpenAI researchers into making quick decisions. ""Meta knows we're taking this week to recharge and will take advantage of it to try and pressure you to make decisions fast and in isolation,"" Mark Chen wrote, in the memo as seen by Wired. Meta's superintelligence lab has hired Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, Xiaohua Zhai, and Trapit Bansal; a foundational contributor to OpenAI's o1 model.With Pang’s departure, the AFM team will now reportedly be headed by Zhifeng Chen. In a change from a structure under Pang where most of the engineers reported to him directly, the report said that there will be a new organizational layout that includes multiple managers reporting to Chen, who will then have engineers reporting to them. Apple’s overall AI strategy is now run primarily by Craig Federighi, Apple’s head of software engineering, and Mike Rockwell, who helped create the Apple Vision Pro headset and now leads engineering for Siri.","Ruoming Pang, Apple’s head of AI models, is leaving the iPhone maker to work at Meta.

What Microsoft Pakistan country head said on the exit

Microsoft recently shut down its operations in Pakistan after 25 years. The news of Microsoft closing down its operations in Pakistan was first revealed in a LinkedIn post by Jawwad Rehman, the founding head of Microsoft Pakistan. However, the move is said to be in the offing for sometime as only a liaison office with around five employees remained in Pakistan. Microsoft has now confirmed the complete closure of the company's operations in the country. The Redmond-based company told TechCrunch that it is changing its operational model in Pakistan. The report further added that Microsoft did not have any engineering resources in Pakistan. This is unlike Microsoft's operations in India and other growing markets.The closure comes amid broader company restructuring of Microsoft's operations globally.“Our customer agreements and service will not be affected by this change,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in an emailed statement. It added that the company will now serve its customers through resellers and “other closely located Microsoft offices.” the spokesperson added, “We follow this model successfully in a number of other countries around the world. Our customers remain our top priority and can expect the same high level of service going forward.”The decision will reportedly impact the five Microsoft employees in Pakistan. These employees reportedly sold Azure and Office products in the countryIn a post titled 'End of an Era… Microsoft Pakistan', the company's first-ever country head in Pakistan Rehman wrote, ""Today, I learned that Microsoft is officially closing its operations in Pakistan. The last few remaining employees were formally informed and just like that, an era ends... Exactly 25 years ago, in June 2000, I had the honor of launching and leading Microsoft Pakistan.""He added, ""Today’s news forces reflection. This is more than a corporate exit. It’s a sobering signal of the environment our country has created.. one where even global giants like Microsoft find it unsustainable to stay. It also reflects on what was done (or not done) with the strong foundation we left behind by the subsequent team and regional management of Microsoft.""He further said that it is time for Pakistan to reflect on what has changed. ""We must ask: What changed? What was lost? What happened to the values, leadership, and vision that once made it all possible?"" he wrote.""Allah grants honor and opportunity to whom He wills.. and takes it away from those who lose sight of it.

Human adaptation: Reskilling for the AI era



Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the global labour market at a speed and scale not seen since the Industrial Revolution. From customer service to logistics, law, finance, and the creative arts, AI technologies are automating tasks, altering workflows, and redefining roles. This transformation is not theoretical—it’s already underway.According to a 2023 analysis by Goldman Sachs , generative AI could boost global GDP by up to 7% by 2030, driven by substantial productivity gains. But this economic upside also brings disruption. AI is expected to displace or reshape millions of jobs, particularly those involving repetitive tasks, data handling, and structured decision-making.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has described this moment as a turning point. In his public statement titled The Gentle Singularity, Altman said: “We are past the event horizon; the takeoff has started.” His comment reflects the reality that AI tools—like large language models and multimodal systems—are now performing at or above human-level efficiency in many specialized areas. As these systems integrate deeper into professional settings, new opportunities are emerging, but so are substantial employment risks.The reason AI poses a threat to millions of jobs is grounded in its ability to replicate tasks that are rules-based, repetitive, or procedural in nature. Unlike previous technologies that required human oversight, generative AI systems can now operate autonomously in fields that once relied on entry-level labour.According to Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of AI safety company Anthropic, up to 50% of current entry-level office roles could be eliminated in the next five years due to automation. These vulnerable roles include:These tasks are especially susceptible because they follow predictable, repeatable patterns—the ideal input for generative AI tools.The disruption isn't limited to white-collar work. In logistics, AI-directed robots are replacing manual warehouse labour. In the media sector, automated subtitling and real-time translation systems are taking over jobs previously performed by trained human linguists.The shift is being accelerated by AI’s scalability. A single model can generate output across multiple industries and languages, dramatically lowering labour costs for companies while increasing their efficiency.While some jobs are being eliminated, AI is also creating new ones. These emerging roles focus on developing, managing, and working alongside AI systems:AI is not replacing all jobs—it’s also augmenting existing professions. In writing and communications, copywriters now use AI to generate first drafts, allowing them to focus on deeper narrative development and strategic content planning.In customer service, a joint MIT-Stanford field study found that AI assistants increased productivity by 14% per hour among support agents. For less experienced workers, the improvement was even greater—34% higher resolution rates, according to the study. This suggests AI can help level up junior staff and reduce onboarding time.The effect of AI reaches beyond office settings:Even industries once thought resistant to automation—like the arts—are adapting. AI tools are now used in scriptwriting, music production, game design, and digital illustration.Experts across the tech and education sectors stress the importance of reskilling. Individuals who proactively learn to use AI tools are more likely to thrive as the job landscape shifts.Jobs requiring soft skills, judgment, and emotional intelligence—like education, healthcare, leadership, and counselling—remain less vulnerable. Educational institutions and governments are beginning to offer certifications in prompt engineering, AI ethics, and data literacy to prepare workers for the new reality.According to a report by McKinsey & Company, nearly 100 million workers globally may need to switch occupations by 2030 due to automation and AI integration. To mitigate this, countries are launching public-private partnerships focused on retraining and upskilling.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the global labour market at a speed and scale not seen since the Industrial Revolution.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence (AI), the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Huang said both AI and robotics represent what he believes a “multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity”. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said during the conference. Nvidia’s robotics division has seen fast growth in the past. Currently making up just 1% of Nvidia’s total revenue, the revenue brought in $567 million last quarter – a steep 72% rise from the previous year.“We’re working towards a day where there will be billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories that can be powered by Nvidia technology,” Huang said.Huang also emphasized a shift in how the company sees itself. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” he said, adding that Nvidia is now focused on being an “AI infrastructure” and “computing platform” provider.During the annual shareholder meeting, Huang said that Nvidia’s chips will be key not just for AI training, but also for software and hardware use in autonomous vehicles and robots. He named self-driving cars as the first major commercial use of Nvidia’s robotics technology. Nvidia’s Drive platform, a suite of chips and software for autonomous cars, is currently being used by Mercedes-Benz.The chipmaker recently introduced Cosmos, a line of AI models designed for humanoid robots.In a related news, Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company with a market cap of around $3.75 trillion.

The post reminded visa applicants to disclose all social media usernames or handles they’ve used over the past five years while filling out the DS-160 visa application form. “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form” the post read. “Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit.”The requirement is part of broader vetting procedures introduced by the US State Department in recent years. As part of the updated rules, applicants must list IDs used on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and others—even if the accounts are no longer active from the last five years.The move comes days after the US government issued a new guideline for those applying for student and exchange visitor visas. Applicable to all applicants of F, M, and J non-immigrant visas, the new rule requires these applicants to set their social media accounts to public. “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under U.S. law,"" the US embassy in India wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post.F, M and J visas are the common types of non-immigrant visas issued by the agency to foreign nationals who wish to study or participate in exchange visitor programs in the U.S. F visa is typically used by academic students, the M visa by vocational students, and the J visa by exchange visitors, including researchers, scholars, and interns.In a related news, USCIS has announced that it will switch to a new phone number for sending text (SMS) messages. “Effective July 1, 2025, USCIS will no longer send text (SMS) messages from the phone number 468-311 (GOV-311). Our new number will be 872466 (USAIMM),” USCIS said in an official press release.","US Embassy in India issues new rule for F, M, and J non-immigrant visa applicants. visa applicants must disclose all social media usernames or handles they’ve used over the past five years while filling out the DS-160 visa application form.

Read OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s complete post here

I’m not big on identities, but I am extremely proud to be American. This is true every day, but especially today—I firmly believe this is the greatest country ever on Earth. The American miracle stands alone in world history.

I believe in techno-capitalism. We should encourage people to make tons of money and then also find ways to widely distribute wealth and share the compounding magic of capitalism. One doesn’t work without the other; you cannot raise the floor and not also raise the ceiling for very long.

The world should get richer every year through science and technology, but everyone has to be in the “up elevator”. I think the government usually does a worse job than markets, and so we need to encourage our culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. I also believe that education is critically important to keeping the American edge.

I believed this when I was 20, when I was 30, and now I am 40 and still believe it. The Democratic party seemed reasonably aligned with it when I was 20, losing the plot when I was 30, and completely to have moved somewhere else at this point. So now I am politically homeless. But that’s fine; I care much, much more about being American than any political party.

I’d rather hear from candidates about how they are going to make everyone have the stuff billionaires have instead of how they are going to eliminate billionaires.

The American experiment has always been messy. I am hopeful for another great 250 years. Happy 4th!","Sam Altman is the Chief Executive Officer of OpenAI.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other top executives sell over $1 billion in company shares: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-and-other-top-executives-sell-over-1-billion-in-company-shares-report/articleshow/122155830.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells shares

Other Nvidia executives cash in

Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year, reports Financial Times. As per the report, over $500 million of those sales took place in June alone, as the chipmaker's stock price climbed to a record high, making Nvidia the world’s most valuable company. The report highlights that Nvidia insiders are capitalizing on the market’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, which has driven massive investor interest and sent the stock price soaring.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began selling his shares last week for the first time since September 2024. The company confirmed that his sales were made under a pre-arranged trading plan set in March, which defines the prices and dates for share sales. Such plans are commonly used by executives to avoid allegations of insider trading.Ben Silverman, vice-president of research at VerityData said “When the stock [dropped] in the first quarter, he did not sell, [which was] really smart.”“[Huang] waited for the stock to return to levels that he felt more comfortable selling at,” he added.According to VerityData, his sales began after a required 90-day cooling-off period ended. Under the trading plan, Huang can sell up to 6 million shares before the end of 2025. At current stock prices, that would amount to more than $900 million. Forbes estimates his net worth at $138 billion.According to the Financial Times report, several other top Nvidia figures have also sold large portions of stock. Mark Stevens, a longtime board member and early Nvidia investor, disclosed plans to sell up to 4 million shares on June 2, currently worth around $550 million. He has already sold $288 million worth.Jay Puri, Nvidia’s executive vice-president of worldwide field operations, sold $25 million in stock last week, says FT. Board members Tench Coxe and Brooke Seawell also made sales — Coxe offloaded around $143 million on June 9, and Seawell sold about $48 million in June.These executives, all long-time members of Nvidia’s leadership team, have been with the company since its early days. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 inside a Denny’s restaurant in San Jose. Coxe and Seawell, both with venture capital backgrounds, joined the board in the late 1990s.AI boom fuels Nvidia’s stock surgeDespite recent setbacks — including U.S. export controls and advances by Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek — Nvidia’s share price has bounced back. Since hitting a low in April, the company has regained about $1.5 trillion in market value.The company’s market value is not estimated at around $3.8 trillion. The rapid growth reflects strong global demand for the company’s chips, used to power AI systems across industries and governments.","Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year.

Airline issues $100 vouchers to passengers

Accused claimed mental health issues

A 27-year-old man is facing federal charges after creating a false alarm mid-flight, claiming that his laptop was a bomb. According to a USA Today report, the incident occurred onboard Allegiant Air Flight 1023, which had just taken off from St. Pete–Clearwater International Airport in Florida and was heading to Roanoke-Blacksburg Regional Airport in Virginia. The accused reportedly told a fellow passenger that his laptop was a bomb, leading to an emergency landing on Sunday, July 6.The passenger, identified as Taj Malik Taylor , has been charged with making a false bomb threat – a federal offense that carries a penalty of up to five years in prison, a $25,000 fine, or both. Taylor is set to appear in federal court on Monday afternoon, according to the FBI.According to an FBI affidavit, Taylor was seated in the last row of the flight when he allegedly turned to a fellow passenger and said, “My laptop is a bomb”. When questioned by seatmates, he reportedly lifted his laptop case and repeated the claim.“The passenger immediately notified the flight attendants,” the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. “Detectives say several other witnesses on the plane also heard Taylor state that he had a bomb.”After being alerted, the crew decided to return to the departure airport. The flight landed safely around 2 pm (PT) with law enforcement officers waiting at the gate. “Allegiant does not tolerate disruptive behavior of any kind, so the decision was made to return to the airport,” the airline said in a statement to USA Today.All passengers and crew were deplaned while the investigation was underway. The flight eventually resumed and reached Roanoke at approximately 7:57 p.m., five hours behind schedule.“We apologize for the inconvenience this has caused our passengers and thank them for their patience,” Allegiant said. “As a gesture of goodwill, we will be issuing $100 vouchers to each itinerary, to be used for future travel.”Taylor later told investigators he had been recently released from a mental health facility and had taken his medication the previous night. He said he was “currently suffering from a lack of clarity,” according to the affidavit.","Taj Malik Taylor, 27, is charged with making a false bomb threat.

"“We want to make Search so effortless you can ask anything:” As AI Mode launches in India, Google explains how it moves beyond traditional search",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/we-want-to-make-search-so-effortless-you-can-ask-anything-as-ai-mode-launches-in-india-google-explains-how-it-moves-beyond-traditional-search/articleshow/122322495.cms,"A smarter search that asks, then answers

Google insists the open web still matters

AI Mode brings familiar risks, Google brings familiar tools







It’s still Search, just a different kind

In India, where Google is practically a verb and the gateway to the internet for hundreds of millions, AI Mode is now making its way to users. Tucked inside the familiar Google interface, the feature greets queries with something more conversational and curated than the usual blue links. Ask it where to eat, what to do, or even how to feel about a new trend, and the chatbot-style AI will serve up a smartly written response, often complete with links, summaries, and context.“We want to make Search so effortless you can ask anything,” says Hema Budaraju , VP of Product Management at Google Search . So, with AI Mode baked into Search, Google doesn’t just want to point you to the internet, it wants to ‘Google’ it for you, something we’ve all been doing ourselves for the past two decades. “It should feel natural to get help from Search with complex needs or vague queries. AI Mode allows that shift,” Budaraju adds.Having been in beta testing under Search Labs for the past two weeks in India, AI Mode is now rolling out to every Google Search user in the country. That means anyone who uses Google can now do back-and-forth conversational searches with AI Mode. Budaraju says it's more than a ""new feature,"" she’s pitching it as Search's evolution to meet users' needs.This makes India the first international market outside of the US to get the feature, and is one of the largest rollouts of Search's AI features globally, according to Budaraju. ""India plays a key role in helping us understand what works across diverse use cases,"" she says. ""We're learning so much from Indian users.""Unlike AI Overviews, which automatically appear for certain searches, AI Mode lives in a separate tab from the main search interface. While some queries prompt AI Overviews without any action from users, AI Mode requires a deliberate choice. If you want to have a conversation with Google, you need to navigate to the ""AI Mode"" tab yourself. At least, that's how it works for now.The technology behind this conversational search is more sophisticated than traditional search. AI Mode uses query fan-out, “breaking down your question into subtopics and issuing a multitude of queries simultaneously on your behalf,” Budaraju explains. Under the hood, it's powered by a custom version of Gemini 2.5, Google's most advanced AI model. When you ask a complex question, the system runs dozens of searches simultaneously before assembling a comprehensive answer.Instead of users having to refine their searches multiple times to get the right answer, AI Mode handles that process automatically. ""This enables Search to dive deeper into the web than a traditional search on Google,"" Budaraju says, ""helping you discover even more of what the web has to offer and find incredible, hyper-relevant content that matches your question."" The result is that users can ask complex questions in natural language and get comprehensive answers without the trial and error of traditional search.While traditional search remains the default for all, the question is whether this marks a new era for Search or remains an experimental overlay. Budaraju says it's foundational. ""We believe AI can unlock entirely new capabilities in Search,"" she says, emphasising that this is not a temporary side-feature but the beginning of a long-term evolution. ""We're committed to testing, learning, and improving as we go.""Perhaps the biggest shift is this: we no longer see ten links and choose. We ask one question, and trust Google to choose for us. Budaraju sees it as empowerment.""Our goal is to reduce the effort, not the options. We want users to feel confident they're getting a quality answer, and that they can go deeper if they wish."" She points to the query fan-out technology as evidence that AI Mode actually exposes users to more sources, not fewer. It’s just that the heavy lifting happens behind the scenes.But while users enjoy quicker answers, many worry that the internet is quietly turning in on itself. Google, once the guide to the web, is now becoming its filter. The concern is particularly acute for publishers who have built their businesses around search traffic.She acknowledges these concerns but pushes back against the doomsday narrative. ""This is not the first time that people have predicted the death of the web,"" she says, drawing parallels to previous technological shifts. ""Think about the changes that came through mobile and social media, even with these, the web continues to grow significantly and rapidly."" She cites a striking statistic: the number of pages published to the web has increased by 45 percent in the last two years alone.""AI Mode doesn't aim to replace the open web,"" Budaraju insists. ""We link out to high-quality sources, and we believe that giving users context encourages exploration."" She argues that the technology actually helps surface content that might otherwise be buried in search results, ""a niche Substack, a specialist business,"" that traditional search might miss. Moreover, she claims that users who do click through from AI Mode are often more engaged. ""The traffic might be smaller, but it's valuable.”Still, the worry remains: if the AI gives you all the answers, why click at all? And if no one clicks, who will write what's being summarised? For Budaraju, the answer lies in viewing this as a partnership rather than a replacement. ""We hope that the publisher ecosystem sees this as something we can evolve together,"" she says. ""Our ability to unlock latent user needs that previously didn't exist means there's potential for net new traffic to the ecosystem.”AI Mode isn't a departure from Google Search's founding principles, it’s their natural evolution, Budaraju implies again as she did before. ""The values of search are the values of AI Mode, because it is a part of Search,"" she explains. After more than two decades of building quality and safety systems, Google is applying the same rigorous standards to its AI-powered features.""Our top priority for search is upholding the high bar for quality,"" Budaraju says. This means the Google should be using the same systems that have fought spam, misinformation, and low-quality content for traditional search now protect AI Mode.But, the stakes are high. If AI misfires on a medical, legal, or ethical question, who is responsible? The concern is particularly acute in India, where AI-generated health advice or financial guidance could have serious real-world consequences for users who may not have access to alternative sources of information.Budaraju's answer is careful. ""We make it clear when responses are for informational purposes only. Users are encouraged to consult professionals. Responsibility is shared between the platform and the user, and we take that seriously."" She emphasises that Google has invested heavily in quality systems and safety measures, drawing on more than 20 years of experience in delivering reliable information through search.The company says it conducts extensive internal testing alongside adversarial red teaming, deliberately trying to break the system to identify weaknesses before users encounter them.There's a deeper philosophical question at play: can an AI system truly embody the exploratory spirit that made Google Search transformative? Budaraju believes it can, and should. ""We learn a lot from the feedback we receive, and we apply many of these lessons to the technology and features we build,"" she says. The goal isn't to replace human curiosity, but to amplify it, to make it easier for people to ask the kinds of complex, multi-layered questions that were previously too cumbersome to pursue.Google says that approach is working. Users are asking much longer queries in AI Mode, two to three times the length of traditional searches, indicating they're bringing their ""toughest questions"" to the system. It's a sign that people are already beginning to treat Search less like a keyword box, and more like a thinking partner.So where does this leave us? As AI Mode rolls out to millions of Indian users, Google isn’t just tinkering with its search results, it’s nudging the entire act of searching into a new format. The blue links haven’t vanished, but they’re no longer center stage. Instead, you get a response, a summary, a direction. You ask, it answers.Budaraju frames it as a shift, not a replacement. “We’re still focused on discovery,” she says. “But we’re also helping users express their needs more naturally, even if they don’t know exactly what to ask.” It’s search, just a little more attuned to how we speak, think, and wonder.And while the interface feels fresh, the fundamentals of the web are still working in the background, the citations, the sources, the open web that AI Mode is built on. Whether users will keep clicking through or be happy to stop at the AI’s summary remains to be seen.

Social media buzz and political implications on Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja’s role

Indian-origin Tesla executive Vaibhav Taneja has been appointed treasurer and custodian of records for Elon Musk’s newly launched America Party , signaling a bold entry into US politics aimed at disrupting the traditional two-party system. The appointment was made official through filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The documents also list the party’s headquarters as 1 Rocker Road, Hawthorne, California, which is notably associated with Tesla operations. As treasurer, Taneja will be responsible for managing financial compliance, filings, and records—an influential role in shaping the political movement Musk envisions through this alternative platform.The America Party was announced shortly after former President Donald Trump signed the controversial “Big, Beautiful Bill” into law. In what appeared to be a public fallout with Trump, Elon Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) to declare his intentions to launch a third-party alternative. “By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it,” Musk wrote. “Today, the American Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”The filings identify Musk as the party’s sole candidate and Vaibhav Taneja as the financial head of the operation, reflecting the trust Musk places in Tesla’s current financial leadership.Vaibhav Taneja became Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Tesla in August 2023, following the resignation of Zach Kirkhorn. Taneja joined Tesla in 2017 during its acquisition of SolarCity and quickly climbed the corporate ladder, holding key positions such as Chief Accounting Officer and Corporate Controller. Before joining Tesla, Taneja spent nearly 17 years at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), where he worked closely with large multinational corporations, advising them on financial regulations, accounting strategy, and compliance frameworks—skills that are now directly applicable to his new political role.According to the, the role of a treasurer in a political committee carries substantial responsibility. Treasurers are tasked with ensuring that all reports and financial statements are accurate, complete, and submitted on time. Given the importance of this role, if a committee faces enforcement action, the treasurer is typically named as a respondent. In certain cases, treasurers may even be held officially—or personally—liable for their actions.The association of a high-ranking Tesla executive with Musk’s political venture has stirred widespread speculation online. A Tesla-linked address from Taneja's documentation also appeared on social platforms, further fueling curiosity around the blurred lines between Musk’s business empire and his political ambitions. Whether the America Party gains traction in the already polarized US political landscape remains to be seen. But with tech giants like Musk entering politics, and trusted executives like Vaibhav Taneja managing key functions, this development signals a bold crossover between Silicon Valley influence and American governance.",Indian-origin Tesla executive Vaibhav Taneja has been appointed treasurer and custodian of records for Elon Musk’s newly launched America Party.

Apple's India manufacturing push faces major setback as Chinese expertise exits

Foxconn implements contingency measures amid Chinese staff withdrawal





Foxconn has asked hundreds of Chinese engineers and technicians to return home from its iPhone factories in India, with the Indian government being informed of the staff withdrawal without being provided specific reasons for the move. More than 300 Chinese workers have left the facilities over the past two months, Bloomberg reported, dealing a significant blow to Apple 's manufacturing expansion in the country.The departure of Chinese technical staff will slow down the training of local workforce and the transfer of manufacturing technology from China, likely raising production costs and affecting efficiency on iPhone assembly lines. According to Bloomberg, the timing is particularly challenging as Apple prepares to ramp up production of the new iPhone 17 with its manufacturing partners in India.The move appears linked to Beijing's broader strategy to curb technology transfers and equipment exports to India and Southeast Asia. Earlier this year, Chinese officials verbally encouraged regulatory agencies and local governments to restrict such transfers, potentially aimed at preventing companies from shifting manufacturing away from China.To mitigate the impact, Foxconn is replacing departing Chinese staff with Taiwanese and Vietnamese workers while converting machinery to be operated by Indian employees. The company is asking suppliers to retrofit existing machinery that largely runs on Chinese-language software to be used by English-speaking engineers.The Indian government has not seen a major impact on phone production yet, according to a person familiar with the matter. Foxconn is expected to receive the retrofitted machinery in a few months, while the company continues building a new iPhone plant in southern India as part of Apple's plans to manufacture most iPhones for the US market in India by late 2026.Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously praised the skill and expertise of Chinese assembly workers as a key reason for setting up production in China, beyond just cost advantages. The withdrawal of these experienced engineers from India represents a significant setback for Apple's diversification strategy, particularly as the company seeks to reduce its dependence on Chinese manufacturing amid ongoing geopolitical tensions .","Foxconn has asked hundreds of Chinese engineers and technicians to return home from its iPhone factories in India.

How OpenAI is tightening security



ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has overhauled its security operations to protect its valuable intellectual property from corporate espionage , a report has said. These enhanced measures come amid claims of the artificial intelligence (AI) giant being targeted by Chinese rivals like DeepSeek that garnered significant attention in early 2025 for its high-performing and cost-effective AI models, particularly its chatbot (DeepSeek-V3) and reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1).Citing sources close to the organisation, a report by The Financial Times claims that OpenAI began bolstering its security last year, the urgency intensified after Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released a rival model in January.OpenAI claimed that DeepSeek had improperly copied its models using a technique known as ""distillation"" to create their AI system – an incident “prompted OpenAI to be much more rigorous,” said one person close to its security team. The company is said to be “aggressively” expanding its security personnel and practices, including its cybersecurity teams.The company has implemented stricter controls on sensitive information and enhanced staff vetting in recent months.Stricter policies, known as information ""tenting,"" have been in place at their San Francisco offices since last summer. These policies significantly reduce the number of people who can access crucial information about technologies like algorithms and new products.For instance, during the development of their ""Strawberry"" (codenamed o1) model, staff had to confirm that other employees were part of the ""Strawberry tent"" before discussing the project in communal areas.Last October, the company hired Dane Stuckey as its new chief information security officer, who works alongside Matt Knight, OpenAI's vice-president of security products. Knight has been developing ways to leverage OpenAI’s large language models to enhance its defenses against cyberattacks.Retired US Army General Paul Nakasone has also been appointed to OpenAI's board last year to help oversee its cybersecurity defenses.","OpenAI is said to be “aggressively” expanding its security personnel and practices, including its cybersecurity teams.

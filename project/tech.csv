What was YouTube vs Disney fight over





Google-parent Alphabet and Disney announced that they’ve reached a deal to restore content from ABC and ESPN onto Google’s YouTube TV. YouTube TV and Disney reached the new carriage agreement, ending a two-week blackout that started on October 31. The stalemate pulled major networks including ABC, ESPN and FX from the streaming TV platform. The companies announced the deal Friday, saying it will restore Disney’s full slate of channels to YouTube TV and expand their partnership. As part of the agreement, ESPN’s forthcoming direct-to-consumer streaming service will be offered to YouTube TV subscribers at no additional cost. YouTube will also be permitted to sell select Disney networks and the Disney+/Hulu bundle through various package options.Disney Entertainment Co-Chairmen Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, along with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, called the agreement one that “recognizes the tremendous value of Disney’s programming and provides YouTube TV subscribers with more flexibility and choice.” They added that they were pleased to have the channels restored ahead of a busy weekend of programming, including college football.YouTube said subscribers would see channels return “throughout the course of the day”, apologizing for the disruption and thanking customers for their patience during negotiations.YouTube TV, positioned as a cable alternative for cord-cutters, has faced periodic clashes with major media companies over pricing and packaging rights. The last contract renewal with Disney in 2022 also resulted in a brief outage. During the latest standoff, YouTube offered affected customers a $20 credit on their next bill.“We’re happy to share that we’ve reached an agreement with Disney that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers and future flexibility in our offers,” YouTube said in a statement. “Subscribers should see channels including ABC, ESPN and FX returning to their service over the course of the day, as well as any recordings that were previously in their Library. We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers’ patience as we negotiated on their behalf. ”The main sticking point between the two companies -- YouTube and Disney -- was the rate Disney charges YouTube TV for its networks. Disney’s most valuable channel, ESPN, charges carriage of more than $10 a month per pay-TV subscriber, a higher fee than any other network in the US.","YouTube TV and Disney reach a new carriage agreement, ending a two-week blackout.

The Labour Commissioner office in Pune has summoned Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in matters filed by the IT industry employees union, Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES). In its complaint, NITES alleged unlawful terminations and layoffs by TCS. NITES shared the same in a post on microblogging website, Twitter. In July, TCS announced plans to fire 2% of its global workforce — or 12,000 employees — over the year amid macro uncertainties and AI-led disruptions.""The Labour Commissioner Office, Pune has issued summons to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in multiple matters filed by NITES concerning illegal termination of employment and unlawful layoffs. The hearing has been scheduled for 18 November 2025. Over the past several months, NITES has received a large number of complaints from TCS employees across various locations regarding abrupt terminations, forced resignations, denial of statutory dues, and coercive employment practices. After reviewing the grievances and supporting documents, NITES assisted the affected employees in filing formal complaints before the competent authority.The initiation of proceedings by the Labour Commissioner reinforces that every employer is legally bound to follow due process and cannot act in violation of labour laws,"" said TCS in its post.NITES urged any current or former worker who believes that they faced wrongful removal or denial of dues to file formal complaints, adding that it will support affected staff in preparing submissions and seeking available remedies. ""Employees who have faced similar issues are encouraged to come forward and assert their rights. If you have experienced wrongful termination, forced resignation, non-payment of dues, or any form of pressure or unfair treatment, you have legal protections available.

Responding to a question on whether the quantum of the headcount reduction seen during the July-September period will continue in the subsequent quarter, chief human resources officer Kunnumal said the company will continue to evaluate everyone.“The 20,000 net headcount decline is due to voluntary and involuntary attrition… we don't have a target… We'll continue to evaluate everyone after all the investment in learning and development that we've done,” Kunnuamal said. Mid and senior-level staff members unable to find the right role based on their seniority will be released “with a lot of care”, he said.Meanwhile, the company’s net headcount reduced by nearly 20,000 during the previous quarter. Its attrition rate moved to 13.3% during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, up from 12.3% in the year-ago period, but less than 13.8% in the first quarter.

Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth

What may be behind Tesla embracing Apple Car Play







Tesla may reportedly be planning to do what the company has not done so far. According to a report by Bloomberg, Tesla is working to add support for Apple CarPlay in its vehicles. This is something that CEO Elon Musk is said to be resisting since 10-plus years. iPhone maker has reportedly started testing the capability internally and could be close to releasing it publicly in the next few months. What makes this important is that despite huge demand from iPhone users, Tesla has never allowed phone mirroring in its cars.The EV maker's argument for both Google's Android Auto and Apple Car Play is same -- that Tesla can provide a better, more integrated software experience than a smartphone. Tesla vehicles rely on company's own infotainment software system, which integrates vehicle functions, navigation, music, web browsing, and more.According to the report, Tesla's adoption of ‌CarPlay‌ will involve the feature operating ""within a window inside its broader interface,"" rather than being a full-screen experience like it is in most vehicles. Report also said that Tesla's implementation will be the standard version of wireless ‌CarPlay‌, rather than the next-generation ‌CarPlay‌ Ultra that started rolling out earlier this year.Essential components, such as navigation, will continue to run on the familiar Tesla systems.This will reportedly be to ensure that the functionality of the linked assistance systems, including the ‘Full Self Driving Software’.So what is it that has led to this change. Analysts term fall in Tesla sales as one of the reasons. The absence of Apple CarPlay is reportedly often a dealbreaker for many car shoppers. According to a study conducted by management consultancy McKinsey in 2024, the unavailability of Apple CarPlay or its Google counterpart, Android Auto, would be a deal breaker for 30 per cent of potential buyers when choosing their electric car.Bloomberg reports that adopting CarPlay, as outlandish as it may seem, could be part of a broader strategy to get people interested again in Tesla’s cars.For Apple, analysts see this as a milestone in its automotive activities. For, Tesla is still the market leader in the United States when it comes to electric cars.","Bloomberg reports that Tesla is working to add support for Apple CarPlay in its vehicles. iPhone maker has reportedly started testing the capability internally and could be close to releasing it publicly in the next few months.

Leaked files show ChatGPT-maker OpenAI’s billion-dollar payments to Microsoft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/leaked-files-show-chatgpt-maker-openais-billion-dollar-payments-to-microsoft/articleshow/125347206.cms,"Representative Image

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





ChatGPT maker OpenAI is facing increasing financial scrutiny as new leaked documents offer a closer look at its revenues, spending and its complex financial ties with Microsoft. Quoting unnamed sources, Techcrunch reports that OpenAI shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft under the multibillion-dollar investment deal between the companies. However, the same sources said Microsoft also pays OpenAI a share of revenue generated from Bing and the Azure OpenAI Service, which rely on OpenAI’s technology. These payments are deducted internally before Microsoft reports its net revenue-share numbers, making the total flow of revenue between the companies harder to determine.Based on the reported 20% share, OpenAI’s revenue would have been at least $2.5 billion in 2024 and $4.33 billion in the first nine months of 2025. Other reports, including those from The Information, have placed OpenAI’s 2024 revenue closer to $4 billion.The report also says that tech blogger Ed Zitron has reviewed documents showing Microsoft received $493.8 million from OpenAI in revenue share payments in 2024, and $865.8 million in the first three quarters of 2025.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently said the company’s revenue is “well more” than reports of $13 billion a year, and that OpenAI could end 2025 with an annualized revenue run rate above $20 billion.The leaked documents also offer insight into OpenAI’s spending. Zitron’s analysis suggests the company may have spent around $3.8 billion on inference — the compute required to run AI models — in 2024, and about $8.65 billion in the first nine months of 2025.OpenAI primarily uses Microsoft Azure for compute but has also signed deals with CoreWeave, Oracle, AWS, and Google Cloud. A source told TechCrunch that while training costs are often covered by credits from Microsoft, inference spending is mostly cash, creating a significant financial burden.The figures suggest that OpenAI may still be spending more on running its models than it earns, raising new questions about the long-term economics of large-scale AI development as the sector continues to attract massive investments.","New leaked documents offer a closer look at OpenAI's revenues, spending and its complex financial ties with Microsoft.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

A federal jury in California ruled on Friday (November 14) that Apple owes medical-monitoring technology company Masimo $634 million after finding that the tech giant infringed on a patent related to blood-oxygen reading technology. The jury sided with Masimo, confirming that features within the Apple Watch, specifically its workout mode and heart rate notification functions, violated Masimo's patent rights, as per a report by news agency Reuters.Following the verdict, an Apple spokesperson stated that the company “disagrees with the verdict and will appeal.”Masimo, meanwhile, hailed the decision as a critical victory in its ongoing legal fight against the Cupertino-based company.

A long-awaited move



Warren Buffet's 'final thoughts' in the 8-page farewell letter







Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a ' Google secret' about Warren Buffet. As revealed by the company, CEO Warren Buffett has quietly taken a multibillion-dollar stake in Alphabet, the parent company of Google, just weeks before the end of his tenure as a CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. The $4.3 billion investment, disclosed in a recent regulatory filing, marks a rare foray into a tech giant long admired but never owned by the legendary investor.In the regulatory filling, Berkshire Hathaway revealed that it purchased 17.8 million shares of Alphabet in the third quarter. making it one of the firm’s most significant new investments in recent years. As of September 30, the stake was valued at $4.3 billion, according to the filing.Google-parent Alphabet has a market capitalisation of $3.4 trillion and the company has been a key player in the ongoing AI-driven stock market rally. The shares of the have surged from 46% year-to-date. This growth has been fuelled by the company’s core businesses which includes Google Search, YouTube, and Waymo and its expanding role as a hyperscaler in the AI infrastructure race.95-year old Warren Buffet has a history of avoiding tech stocks, citing a preference for industries within his “circle of competence,” such as insurance, banking, and consumer goods.However, he has publicly expressed regret over missing out on Google in the past, once admitting, “we blew it.”While it’s unclear whether Buffett personally initiated the Alphabet purchase, it’s widely believed that Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, the investment managers he handpicked, may have led the decision—potentially signaling the investment philosophy of Berkshire’s next generation of leadership.Recently, Warren Buffet shared a last letter as Berkshire Hathaway CEO before Berkshire vice chair Greg Abel takes over as CEO, starting on January 1, 2026.Warren Buffet's 8-page-long letter to shareholders talks about a number of things including his children, successor, age and more. Here are the final thoughts penned by him in the letter:One perhaps self-serving observation. I’m happy to say I feel better about the second half of my life than the first. My advice: Don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes – learn at least a little from them and move on. It is never too late to improve. Get the right heroes and copy them. You can start with Tom Murphy; he was the best.Remember Alfred Nobel, later of Nobel Prize fame, who – reportedly – read his own obituary that was mistakenly printed when his brother died and a newspaper got mixed up. He was horrified at what he read and realized he should change his behavior.Don’t count on a newsroom mix-up: Decide what you would like your obituary to say and live the life to deserve it. Greatness does not come about through accumulating great amounts of money, great amounts of publicity or great power in government. When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world. Kindness is costless but also priceless. Whether you are religious or not, it’s hard to beat The Golden Rule as a guide to behavior.I write this as one who has been thoughtless countless times and made many mistakes but also became very lucky in learning from some wonderful friends how to behave better (still a long way from perfect, however). Keep in mind that the cleaning lady is as much a human being as the Chairman.","Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a'Google secret' about Warren Buffet.

Nadella stated that such high projections are necessary for these independent labs to attract the capital needed to compete with the big players. When asked about the forecasts Nadella acknowledged the aggressive growth rates being pitched.“What do you expect from an independent lab that is sort of trying to raise money to do? They have to put some numbers out there such that they can actually go raise money so that they can pay their bills for compute,” Nadella responded to a question about how and why these labs are projecting revenue that keeps growing at this rate of like 3x, 2x years in the marketplace.“Someone's going to take some risk and traction. It's not like it's all risk. Without seeing the fact that they've been performing, whether it's OpenAI, whether it's Anthropic, I feel great about what they've done, and we have a massive book of business with these jobs,” he added.Nadella framed the massive revenue goals as a practical necessity driven by the enormous costs of advancing AI technology, particularly the steep price of high-end compute and top-tier talent.While expressing strong support for the work being done – citing Microsoft's “massive book of business"" with these labs – Nadella underscored the core requirements for any company to be an AI leader.“Overall, ultimately, there's two simple things: One is you have to allocate for R&D. The talent for AI is at a premium, you got to spend there. You have to spend on compute – that is sort of what it takes to be a leading R&D company in this world,” Nadella noted.Nadella concluded that these labs ""have been performing,"" pointing to the traction seen by both OpenAI and Anthropic, suggesting the risks being taken are justified by their performance.“And you have to have a balance sheet that allows you to scale that long before.

Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly overhauling the process by which the company evaluates employee performance, making ‘AI-driven impact’ a core expectation beginning in 2026. This move of the company reflects its deepening commitment to artificial intelligence as a central driver of productivity and innovation across its workforce. As reported by Business Insider, in an internal memo, Meta’s head of people Janelle Gale has announced that starting next year, the company will access the employees on the basis of how effectively they use AI to deliver results and built tools that significantly boost productivity. “As we move toward an AI-native future, we want to recognize people who are helping us get there faster,” Gale wrote.While AI adoption metrics won’t be formally included in 2025’s annual reviews, employees are encouraged to highlight their AI-powered achievements in self-assessments.As per the BI report, Meta has already started taking steps to embed AI into its workplace culture. The company has already started using AI in hiring.The candidates can use AI tools during coding interviews. Along with this, Meta has also started an internal initiative to incentivise AI usage. The company will also be launching AI performance assistant which will help the employees to write reviews and feedback using Meta’s internal bot, Metamate or Google’s Gemini.These tools are designed to normalise AI integration in daily workflows and reward those who leverage it to drive meaningful outcomes.Starting in 2026, performance reviews will focus on how employees:The company hopes this shift will accelerate its transition into an AI-native organization and deepen its competitive edge in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.Meta’s shift mirrors broader trends in Big Tech.

SpaceX Starship: The key to scaling solar-powered AI







Tesla CEO Elon Musk has now predicted that solar electricity will become ‘by far the biggest source of power for civilization,” as the tech industry is struggling with an energy crisis fueled by artificial intelligence. Musk took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) about the growing energy crises. In a post shared Musk made a statement on the increasing global demand for electricity and how the industry leaders are racing to find futuristic solutions to power the next generation of data infrastructure.“Solar electricity will become by far the biggest source of power for civilization,” wrote Musk. Tesla CEO’s made this comment in response to a graph showing the dominance of solar energy in electricity generation. The timing is critical: global power demand is projected to rise by 30% by 2035, largely driven by the exponential growth of AI workloads. Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya also warned that this growing strain could lead to double electricity rates within five years, underscoring the urgency of finding scalable energy sources.The energy crunch has prompted radical proposals from tech giants:These ideas reflect a growing consensus that traditional infrastructure may not be sufficient to support AI’s energy appetite.Elon Musk’s own ventures are central to these futuristic plans. ARK Invest recently identified SpaceX’s Starship as “critical” to making orbital data centers economically viable.

How Elon Musk regained his top position









Oracle founder Larry Ellison briefly overtook Elon Musk in global wealth rankings in September. His rise was driven by optimism around cloud infrastructure revenue after OpenAI committed to spend $300 billion with Oracle over five years, prompting a sharp one-day stock surge, which was the company’s strongest since 1992. However, that momentum has since faded. A CNBC report claims that Oracle's value has since dropped by almost one-third (30%) over the last two months, completely erasing the stock gains from September. The company's stock is reportedly currently on pace for its most significant monthly decline since 2011. The company has drawn attention because it moved from business software into cloud computing later than its competitors. Its current strategy leans heavily on AI, with much of its outlook tied to OpenAI’s performance.Investors have reportedly gone increasingly cautious about high valuations and the heavy capital spending by a few large tech companies, especially if major AI start-ups such as OpenAI or Anthropic struggle to meet expectations for the technology.The earlier stock gain allowed Ellison's net worth to increase by $101 billion in one day, the largest single-day wealth gain recorded in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.This event led to Ellison achieving a net worth of $393 billion, momentarily positioning him above Musk. Currently, Musk has total net worth of $430 billion while Ellison sits at $275 billion.The foundation for this wealth change was an earnings report that featured results exceeding expectations, a rise in bookings, and a confident projection for future growth in cloud services, which resulted in a 41% stock rally, the largest in Oracle’s operational history.According to a report by The Financial Times, Oracle shares have dropped 25% from last month, which is almost double the decline of the next weakest hyperscaler, Meta. A FT index tracking the value of Oracle’s debt has dropped about 6% since mid-September, which is also a steeper slide than that of its peers.However, Musk regained his position as the world’s richest person after briefly falling behind Ellison. Musk moved ahead again with an estimated net worth of $384.2 billion, reflecting how quickly billionaire rankings can shift in the tech sector.Musk’s return to the top was supported by gains in his major holdings.

Disney and Google’s YouTube TV have finally reached on a new carriage agreement. After the agreement YouTube TV will restore the access to major Disney-owned channels including ESPN, ABC, FX and National Geographic. Both the companies finalised the agreement after a brief blackout affected millions of subscribers. The dispute between YouTube TV and Disney started from a breakdown in negotiations over distribution fees which in turn led to Disney’s channels being pulled from YouTube TV earlier this week. This blackout also sparked frustration among subscribers, especially sports fans who lost access to ESPN during a busy NFL and college football season. Under the new agreement, all previously removed channels will be reinstated immediately, and subscribers will regain access to live programming and on-demand content from Disney’s portfolio.In order to compensate the subscribers YouTube TV also issued a credit of $20 dollars after the prolonged blackout. YouTube TV announced that affected subscribers will receive a $20 credit applied to their next billing cycle.Emails with instructions on how to claim the credit are currently being sent out. The company emphasized that it is working to resolve the dispute and restore Disney channels “within hours” once a new agreement is reached. This isn’t the first time YouTube TV has issued credits during a content blackout. In 2022, subscribers received a $15 credit after a similar dispute temporarily removed Disney programming.In a joint statement, both companies expressed satisfaction with the resolution, emphasizing their commitment to delivering high-quality entertainment and sports content. YouTube TV said it was “pleased to reach a deal that restores Disney content for our members,” while Disney noted its appreciation for the platform’s partnership.The deal ensures continued access to:Both the companies have not yet disclosed the final terms of agreement.

Thinking Machines raised $2 billion in July at $12 billion valuation





Thinking Machines Lab, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former OpenAI executive Mira Murati, is reportedly in early discussions to raise a new round of funding at a valuation of roughly $50 billion. According to a report in Bloomberg, the new financing, which has not been previously reported, would more than quadruple the startup’s valuation from July and catapult Thinking Machines into the upper ranks of the most valuable private companies less than a year after it launched.The terms are reportedly still being negotiated and could shift, the people said, requesting anonymity because the details are private. While several sources said the target valuation is about $50 billion, others indicated it could climb as high as $55 billion to $60 billion.Launched in February, the company is building AI models and tools designed to support more “human-AI collaboration” across industries. Murati, who previously served as chief technology officer at OpenAI, has recruited heavily from her former employer. Among the high-profile hires are OpenAI co-founder John Schulman and former research vice president Barret Zoph.Like many top AI startups, the company is navigating an aggressive talent war. Last month, Thinking Machines co-founder Andrew Tulloch left for Meta Platforms, which has been offering multimillion-dollar compensation packages to attract AI researchers.In July, Thinking Machines closed one of the largest seed rounds on record, raising $2 billion at a $12 billion valuation. The startup unveiled its first product, Tinker, a few months later — a platform that helps users more easily customize or fine-tune large language models. Tinker has already gained traction with researchers at universities including Princeton and Stanford, and the company has begun signing up paying enterprise customers, according to people familiar with the matter.Murati is among several former OpenAI leaders attracting intense interest from investors. Ilya Sutskever, the company’s former chief scientist, founded Safe Superintelligence, which was recently valued at $32 billion. Another former OpenAI executive, Liam Fedus, now heads Periodic Labs, valued at about $1.3 billion. Murati briefly also served as OpenAI’s interim CEO following the ouster of Sam Altman before departing in late 2024 amid internal turmoil.",Thinking Machines raised $2 billion in July at $12 billion valuation.

Trump’s post on Truth Social withdrawing support for Marjorie Taylor Greene

I am withdrawing my support and Endorsement of “Congresswoman” Marjorie Taylor Greene, of the Great State of Georgia. Over the past few weeks, despite my creating Record Achievements for our Country including, a Total and Complete Victory on the Shutdown, Closed Borders, Low Taxes, No Men in Women’s Sports or Transgender for Everyone, ending DEI, stopping Biden’s Record Setting Inflation, Biggest Regulation Cuts in History, stopping EIGHT WARS, rebuilding our Military, being RESPECTED by every Country in the World (as opposed to being the laughingstock that we were just 12 months ago!), having Trillions of Dollars (Record Setting!) INVESTED in the U.S.A., and having created the “HOTTEST” Country anywhere in the World from being a DEAD Country just 12 months ago (and so much more!), all I see “Wacky” Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN! It seemed to all begin when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor, she was at 12%, and didn’t have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement — which she wasn’t about to get!). She has told many people that she is upset that I don’t return her phone calls anymore, but with 219 Congressmen/women, 53 U.S. Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day.

What Marjorie Taylor Greene said on H-1B visa

“I’m introducing a bill to ban H1B visas in all sectors with a phase out in medical while we build up American doctors.

Ending H1B visas will also help the housing market.

Ending H1B visas mean more jobs available for Americans and more homes available for Americans.

But we also have to stop corporations like Blackrock and other asset managers from buying up houses.

When Americans have good paying jobs they will be able to buy homes as long as they don’t have to compete with legally imported labor on visas and rich powerful asset management companies.”

Cities driving out business will see policies backfire, Dimon warns



Democrat-led cities must reduce 'blue tape' regulations or face decline





JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon issued a stark warning that the United States is headed toward European-style economic decline unless it immediately reverses anti-business policies driving companies out of major cities. ""In 30 years, if we don't fix these things, we are going the way of Europe,"" Dimon told the American Business Forum in Miami, citing the continent's shrinking share of global GDP as evidence of what happens when governments chase away businesses with excessive regulation and taxation.The 69-year-old Wall Street chief said America must start ""fixing these things"" now before cities and states lose their competitive edge to nations that embrace growth-friendly policies. His comments came as newly elected New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani prepares to implement a progressive agenda including higher taxes on the wealthy and expanded social programs.Dimon warned that jurisdictions adopting hostile business climates will face severe consequences as companies relocate to more favorable environments. ""Everyone has to compete—between countries, between states, and between cities,"" he said at the Saudi Arabia-backed summit.""A bunch of these states that are driving business out—it will backfire.""The JPMorgan CEO pointed to Florida and Texas as examples of states successfully luring Wall Street firms away from high-tax cities like New York. He argued that ""beating up business as a way to fix things""—whether addressing crime, education, or cost of living—ultimately shrinks tax bases and hurts the working-class people such policies claim to help.""A lot of those cities do things in the name of good, which create bad,"" Dimon said. ""All of these bad policies, in my view, usually hurt the lower-paid people more.""Dimon called on Democrat-controlled cities to eliminate what he termed ""blue tape""—excessive regulations that stifle economic growth and innovation. Without naming Mamdani directly, he dismissed the mayor-elect's campaign promises of free buses and childcare funded by taxing corporations and wealthy residents.""This notion of somehow being anti-business is going to help average American citizens, even the lower paid—I don't agree with the concept,"" Dimon said.The remarks came one day after Dimon reached out to Mamdani, offering to advise the 34-year-old democratic socialist despite previously calling his policies ""ideological mush"" and labeling him ""more Marxist than socialist."" Speaking to CNN Wednesday, Dimon said he left the mayor-elect a voicemail and suggested he consult Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who revived his bankrupt city through business partnerships.A JPMorgan spokesman said Dimon ""simply reiterated his long-held belief that government, business, community leaders and others need to collaborate on executing sensible policy.""","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says the U.S. is headed toward European-style economic decline unless it immediately reverses anti-business policies.

Status on Arattai: we decided to go with option 2 which is mandatory system wide end to end encryption (starting with one on one messages and groups will follow later).

We had to do some redesign around it and we wanted extensive testing because it is a drastic change. It is now being tested by about 6,000 people in the company. We identified some issues and have fixed them. We are doing one more round of testing on a new build that has fixed the issues identified.

If all goes well, we plan to deploy in a few days. It will be a forced upgrade on all because it is a drastic change.

Meanwhile you can upgrade the app and while it already has the code for mandatory e2e encryption, it won't work until we enable it and we will do it after another round of testing. The app is also faster and sleeker now which you can experience.

Thank you for your patience





Earlier this month, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu shared a post seeking user feedback on how end-to-end encryption (E2EE) should be applied across Arattai – the company’s WhatsApp rival. He then gave two options – system-wide or giving a user choice to pick individual chats to be in E2EE mode. Now, Vembu has shared a status update on X (formerly Twitter), announcing that the company will be moving forward with system-wide encryption. In the post, he also revealed that the feature will be deployed in the coming days, adding ‘it will be a forced upgrade’.“If all goes well, we plan to deploy in a few days.

A Tesla technician with hearing loss has filed a lawsuit against the company. Hans Kohls, who used to work as a technician at the Elon Musk-led carmaker’s Texas Gigafactory, has alleged that the company assigned him to a position where he had to melt aluminium ingots at 1220 degrees Fahrenheit, which caused his hearing aids to malfunction and made it very difficult for him to hear essential safety signals. For this, Kohls requested a transfer away from the casting department, where conditionsAccording to a lawsuit obtained by The Independent, Tesla fired Kohls rather than providing a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and labor laws, which is a serious violation. The lawsuit claims that the companyFurthermore, it claims Tesla misrepresented the availability of other open positions that Kohls, who performed well in his training class, could have filled. The technician and his pregnant wife were also allegedly stripped of their health insurance following his termination.In a statement to The Independent, attorney Andrew Rozynski, who is representing Kohls, expressed the stark and troubling nature of the case.He said:KohlsRozynski added, emphasising the unfairness of Kohls' treatment despite his successful performance.According to the lawsuit, Kohls applied to Tesla’s START program in February 2024, an internship designed to prepare participants for equipment technician roles.

Telecom giants deny wrongdoing







Britain’s largest mobile network providers are facing a £3.2 billion ($4.29 billion) lawsuit for allegedly overcharging millions of loyal customers, after a London tribunal ruled on Friday (November 14) that a significant portion of the case can proceed to trial. Vodafone , BT's EE, Telefonica's O2 and Hutchison's Three UK – whose $19 billion merger with Vodafone was approved last year – are accused of imposing a “loyalty penalty” on customers who remained with their networks after minimum contract periods expired.The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) certified that claims for losses from October 2015 onward can proceed to trial, while throwing out earlier claims as having been brought too late, according to a report by news agency Reuters.Lawyers representing British consumer champion Justin Gutmann allege the networks continued charging millions of customers for mobile devices that had already been paid off after their initial contracts ended. The practice effectively penalised loyal customers who chose not to switch providers once their minimum contract terms expired.“The networks charged millions of British consumers who remained with the network after their minimum contract expired a 'loyal penalty,' by continuing to charge for mobile devices which had already been paid off,” Gutmann's legal team argued.The mobile providers have contested the allegations, with their lawyers arguing the lawsuit is fundamentally flawed as it alleges anti-competitive behaviour “in an industry renowned for its competitiveness.”EE said that it does not accept the substantive allegations and intends to defend them robustly.“We do not accept the substantive allegations of the claim and intend to defend them robustly,” an EE spokesperson said.O2 welcomed the tribunal's decision to reduce the scope of the claim by excluding pre-October 2015 losses.“We maintain that there is no merit to Mr Gutmann's case for the remaining period and will continue to robustly defend our position as it proceeds,” an O2 spokesperson stated.","Vodafone, BT's EE, Telefonica's O2 and Hutchison's Three UK are accused of imposing a ‘loyalty penalty’ on customers who remained with their networks after minimum contract periods expired.

Turning down the safe path to pursue an idea

Building Giga and designing the technology that sets it apart

Facing criticism and staying focused



A new kind of Silicon Valley story





When most graduates chase high paying jobs and elite academic offers, Varun Vummadi and Esha Manideep took a very different path. The IIT Kharagpur engineers turned down extraordinary opportunities including a $525,000 quant trader job in the United States, a PhD admission at Stanford University, and a $150,000 high frequency trading job in India to build a voice AI company called Giga. Their decision looked risky at the time, but within two years Giga raised $61 million from top Silicon Valley investors and began powering customer support for global companies such as DoorDash. Their journey has come to represent one of the boldest new Indian origin success stories in the AI world.Varun and Esha studied computer science and artificial intelligence at IIT Kharagpur, one of India’s most competitive engineering institutions. They were part of a close research community that spent long hours working on machine learning projects, often experimenting with multilingual conversational systems before they became mainstream in the global AI industry. Their collaboration grew through academic research, coding competitions and shared interests in natural language processing.Both graduates had exceptional career prospects. Varun was offered a $525,000 quantitative trader position in the United States and a Stanford PhD seat that is highly coveted among AI researchers.Esha secured a $150,000 offer from a leading Indian high frequency trading firm. These offers represented stability, prestige and financial security. Yet both believed that they could create more impact by building a product of their own.Rejecting these offers was not an easy choice. It meant walking away from financial comfort and the world’s top institutions in order to chase an uncertain idea. Friends questioned the decision. Families were concerned. Recruiters were shocked. Both founders knew that the global shift toward voice based AI was beginning and believed this was the right moment to build something ambitious.In 2023, they moved to San Francisco and established Giga with a clear vision. They wanted to create advanced voice AI agents capable of communicating naturally, switching between chat and voice instantly, and handling multiple languages at the same time. Their aim was to reinvent how large companies manage customer communication by replacing slow and outdated systems with fast and highly accurate AI driven interactions.As co founder and CEO, Varun took charge of strategy, fundraising and building early relationships with enterprise clients. As co founder and CTO, Esha focused on the technical side, including AI model architecture, product design and engineering. She built the core systems that allow Giga’s agents to process speech in real time, maintain context and produce human like responses. This level of voice and chat synchronisation is rare among enterprise AI tools and quickly became Giga’s strongest differentiator.Investors noticed the potential immediately. The company raised $61 million in Series A funding from major venture capital firms including Redpoint Ventures, Y Combinator and Nexus Venture Partners. Giga’s technology was soon adopted by clients such as DoorDash and is currently being prepared for deployment across multiple Fortune 100 companies.Alongside rapid success, Varun and Esha also faced racism and online trolling. Some critics questioned their origins, doubted their abilities or mocked their career decisions. The negativity did not slow them down. They continued building their product, expanding their team and focusing on delivering working technology instead of responding to online hostility.Their achievements were widely recognised in 2024 when both were featured in Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia for their contributions to artificial intelligence and enterprise technology.Varun Vummadi and Esha Manideep represent a new wave of Indian origin founders who combine deep technical expertise with the courage to take unconventional risks. Their journey shows that innovation often comes from those willing to step away from traditional career paths. By choosing vision over security, they created a company that is already influencing the future of enterprise AI.Giga’s rise from a high risk idea to a $61 million funded voice AI platform has become a powerful example for young engineers and aspiring entrepreneurs.

That'll be the next pit stop on the MAI side,” Nadella said, referring to Microsoft AI.Nadella also said that the company is also going to assemble a “first class superintelligence team” dedicated to advancing fundamental AI research. The move signals the company's commitment to not just deploying existing AI technologies but pushing the boundaries of what's theoretically possible.“We're going to build a first class super intelligence team, we're going to continue to drop and do on the open some of these models,” Nadella explained.“We will do real research in order to be ready for some next five, six, seven, eight breakthroughs that are needed on this march towards superintelligence,” Nadella added.This comes a week after it was reported that Microsoft is forming a team that will be tasked with performing advanced AI research. Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of the Microsoft AI group, announced the formation of the MAI Superintelligence Team and he will be heading it.A key component of Microsoft's strategy involves exploiting its strategic advantage of having access to OpenAI's intellectual property. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, giving it unique access to cutting-edge AI research and technology.This partnership allows Microsoft to integrate AI capabilities into its products while simultaneously developing its own proprietary technologies through Microsoft AI (MAI).","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has revealed the tech giant’s comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap.

Amazon joins Microsoft to support act that gives US buyers priority on Nvidia's AI chips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-joins-microsoft-to-support-act-that-gives-us-buyers-priority-on-nvidias-ai-chips/articleshow/125330293.cms,"Key players and government stance







Tech giants Amazon and Microsoft have reportedly aligned in support of new legislation designed to restrict chipmaker Nvidia’s ability to export advanced AI chips, prioritising US customers amid rising concerns over China’s military AI capabilities. The legislation, known as the Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence (GAIN) Act, is also backed by AI startup Anthropic. It has been introduced as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).According to a report by the Wall Street Journal (via news agency Reuters), the GAIN AI Act says that US chipmakers must prioritise domestic orders for advanced processors before fulfilling requests from foreign customers.While Microsoft has publicly endorsed the legislation, officials within Amazon's cloud unit have reportedly informed Senate staffers of their private support.The report mentions that the move reflects a broader attempt by Washington to safeguard American access to critical, high-end AI components, driven by fears that China could utilise these capabilities to bolster its military strength.The decision by Amazon and Microsoft contrasts with the positions of other major tech players.Meta Platforms and Alphabet's Google have not yet taken a public stance on the Act.The White House, however, appears to be cautious regarding the Act’s necessity. White House officials, including AI czar David Sacks, reportedly told Senator Jim Banks – a sponsor of the GAIN Act – that the policy's potential impact may be limited since the Commerce Department already has regulations governing chip exports.Nvidia, which dominates the global market for advanced AI chips, has previously stated that the GAIN AI Act risks restricting global competition for advanced chips and limiting computing power available to other nations.","The GAIN AI Act would restrict chipmaker Nvidia’s ability to export advanced AI chips, prioritising US customers.

Disney CEO Bob Iger sends reminder to Google on YouTube TV blackout; says: Remember what you told us on ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/disney-ceo-bob-iger-sends-reminder-to-google-on-youtube-tv-blackout-says-remember-what-you-told-us-on-value-we-offer/articleshow/125327992.cms,"Disney CFO on YouTube Blackout in earnings call

What is worrying Disney investors





Walt Disney has reportedly signaled that it is gearing up for a potentially prolonged fight with YouTube TV over distribution of its television networks. Disney's networks disappeared from YouTube TV -- the fourth-largest pay-TV provider in the US with about 10 million subscribers -- on October 30. YouTube TV blackout for Disney marks the latest carriage rights dispute between the Google-parent Alphabet company and a major media company. NBCUniversal also had a similar dispute with YouTube TV earlier this year.According to a report by Reuters, the tense discussions underscore YouTube TV's rapid growth as well as Google's vast financial resources, which is said to give the platform greater leverage in negotiations with media companies. ""The deal that we have proposed is equal to or better than what other large distributors have already agreed to,"" Disney CEO Bob Iger said, referring to the talks with YouTube TV. He further added, ""And while we've been working tirelessly to close this deal and restore our channel to the platform, it's also imperative that we make sure that we agree with a deal that reflects the value that we deliver, which both YouTube, by the way, and Alphabet have told us is greater than the value of any other provider.Disney CEO Iger's current contract expires at the end of 2026; Disney is expected to name his successor early next year.On a post-earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston told analysts that Disney has ""built a hedge"" into its forecasts assuming that the negotiations with Google on YouTube could drag on. Disney's quarterly revenue was comparable to a year ago at $22.5 billion but shy of the $22.75 billion analyst forecast.Profit at the traditional television unit declined 21% to $391 million, and income from ESPN slipped too, offsetting other divisions including streaming, where earnings rose 39% to $352 million. Disney has invested more in streaming and its parks to offset the industry-wide decline of traditional broadcast and cable TV. Disney said it added 12.5 million subscribers to Disney+ and Hulu during the quarter, reaching a total of 196 million.A new distribution deal with cable and broadband provider Charter Communications helped draw new streaming customers, Johnston told Reuters.What is reportedly worrying investors about Disney's outlook for its already declining TV business is that the company also missed quarterly revenue expectations as the cable weakness overshadowed strong growth in the Disney's streaming and parks businesses central to its growth.""Disney is reducing its reliance upon cable companies to distribute its channels. But cutting out video distributors will take time,"" said Emarketer senior analyst Ross Benes. ""YouTube TV is one of the leading cable TV providers, so its absence is a big hole for sports fans.""Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that a 14-day blackout on YouTube TV would cost Disney about $60 million in revenue.",Disney's networks disappeared from YouTube TV on October 30.

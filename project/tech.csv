Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s AI warning in his 20,000-word essay



We need to draw a hard line against AI abuses within democracies. There need to be limits to what we allow our governments to do with AI, so that they don’t seize power or repress their own people. The formulation I have come up with is that we should use AI for national defense in all ways except those which would make us more like our autocratic adversaries.

Where should the line be drawn? In the list at the beginning of this section, two items—using AI for

domestic mass surveillance

and mass propaganda—seem to me like bright red lines and entirely illegitimate. Some might argue that there’s no need to do anything (at least in the US), since domestic mass surveillance is already illegal under the Fourth Amendment. But the rapid progress of AI may create situations that our existing legal frameworks are not well designed to deal with. For example, it would likely not be unconstitutional for the US government to conduct massively scaled recordings of all public conversations (e.g., things people say to each other on a street corner), and previously it would have been difficult to sort through this volume of information, but with AI it could all be transcribed, interpreted, and triangulated to create a picture of the attitude and loyalties of many or most citizens. I would support civil liberties-focused legislation (or maybe even a constitutional amendment) that imposes stronger guardrails against AI-powered abuses.

The other two items—fully autonomous weapons and AI for strategic decision-making—are harder lines to draw since they have legitimate uses in defending democracy, while also being prone to abuse. Here I think what is warranted is extreme care and scrutiny combined with guardrails to prevent abuses. My main fear is having too small a number of “fingers on the button,” such that one or a handful of people could essentially operate a drone army without needing any other humans to cooperate to carry out their orders. As AI systems get more powerful, we may need to have more direct and immediate oversight mechanisms to ensure they are not misused, perhaps involving branches of government other than the executive. I think we should approach fully autonomous weapons in particular with great caution,36 and not rush into their use without proper safeguards.

Anthropic and Pentagon are reportedly at odds, potentially stalling a high-stakes $200 million partnership between the AI startup and defense department. The standstill is said to be over a fundamental clash of ethics and authority on how to use artificial intelligent (AI) solutions for national defense. Citing sources familiar with the matter, news agency Reuters has reported that the developer is resisting government demands that would allow its technology to be used for autonomous weapons targeting and domestic surveillance within America.Anthropic has reportedly insisted on safeguards that would prevent its models from being used to spy on American citizens or assist in lethal weapons targeting without direct human oversight. The report said that these “safety guardrails” are baked into the core training of Anthropic’s AI models, essentially making them resistant to taking actions that could lead to harm.However, Pentagon officials have ‘bristled’ at these restrictions. Citing a January 9 department memo on AI strategy, the government argues it should have the right to deploy commercial AI however it sees fit as long as the actions comply with US law.It also said that US law compliance is regardless of a private company's internal usage policies.“We are in productive discussions with the Department of War about ways to continue that work,” a spokesperson for Anthropic stated, though they maintained that their AI is currently used for “national security missions” that fall outside of the disputed lethal categories.The standoff is been reported days after Amodei said in his 20,000-word essay that while AI should support national defense, it must draw a line when it comes to ‘AI abuse’. Here’s what he said.","Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in his 20,000-word essay that while AI should support national defense, it must draw a line when it comes to ‘AI abuse’ The standstill is said to be over a fundamental clash of ethics and authority.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127817262,imgsize-18556,width-400,resizemode-4/anthropic.jpg"

America has reportedly put 'Google and Facebook' condition for Canada as part of trade negotiations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/america-has-reportedly-put-google-and-facebook-conditions-on-canada-as-part-of-trade-negotiations/articleshow/127817420.cms,"Canada is in talks with Meta to reinstate news on Facebook, following the tech giant's 2023 ban over the Online News Act. The legislation, now a point of contention in US trade negotiations, requires tech firms to fund Canadian journalism. Meta seeks an exemption, while Google already contributes significantly.

“We want news back. How do we go there? That's the question mark, and that's why we are having these conversations. We are looking at how to get there,”

What Meta said about bringing back Facebook News in Canada

“flexible”

Canadian government officials are reportedly in talks with Meta about restoring news to Facebook. This comes as the Online News Act, which prompted the tech giant to end access to journalism on its platforms in Canada, has become part of trade negotiations with the United States, a report claims. In 2023, the social media giant blocked all news on Facebook and Instagram in response to the act, which would have required it to inject funds into Canada's news industry for carrying its content.According to a report by Canadian publication The Globe and Mail, the Online News Act, which became law in 2023, has come under scrutiny by the Trump administration, which regards it, along with Ottawa's Online Streaming Act, as a trade irritant. The report claims that both laws affect American digital giants.Meta has consistently said it will not pay for news posted on its platforms. The company would need an exemption from the Online News Act to avoid a legal obligation to contribute to Canada's journalism industry. Meanwhile, Google , which did agree to pay Canadian news publishers under the act, injects $100 million annually into the industry. Almost two-thirds of that goes to written media, including local newspapers serving francophone and Indigenous communities.Canada capped the CBC's share of the funds, which are indexed to inflation, at $7 million, with other broadcasters getting no more than $30 million.In a statement to The Globe and Mail, Alisson Levesque, a spokesperson for Canadian Identity Minister Marc Miller, confirmed that preliminary talks between Meta and the Heritage Department are underway.Levesque said.In October 2025, Rachel Curran, head of public policy at Meta Canada, told the Commons heritage committee that the tech giant would like to bring news back onto Facebook. She said she was “hopeful that the government will take another look at that legislation, which we think misrepresents the value exchange between publishers and our platforms.”“News publishers place their content on our platforms because they get increased distribution and then can monetise the clicks that they receive as a result of that distribution. So we think we are in a very different situation from Google. But that said, we would love to put news back on our platforms, and we are hopeful that can happen,” Curran told the committee.In a recent interview with The Logic, Canadian Minister Miller said Ottawa is willing to beon the Online News Act and the Online Streaming Act amid trade negotiations. But he said the US will not be able to dictate the terms, and there are some lines the government will not cross. Last year, the Canadian government gave in to pressure from the White House and cancelled a proposed digital services tax.“The United States Government has made its views known regarding the Online News Act and Online Streaming Act, including in testimony before Congress. To protect the integrity of past and future engagements with the US, we will refrain from commenting directly on the negotiations which are being led by [Canada-US Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc],” Levesque added in her statement.Last month, members of Canada's broadcasting and cultural sector warned that an increasing number of Canadian TV and radio stations could close if the federal Online Streaming Act becomes a casualty of the trade war with the US. The act, which became law in 2023, requires foreign platforms such as Netflix to support Canada's TV, film and music sectors financially.Kevin Desjardins, president of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, said last month that if the act is shelved as a result of American pressure, it would prove a “crushing blow” to Canada's cultural sector. In December 2025, 27 bipartisan members of Washington's House Ways and Means Committee, led by Republican Lloyd Smucker and Democrat Linda Sanchez, wrote to LeBlanc and Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the US, calling on Ottawa to rescind the act.","Canadian government officials are reportedly in talks with Meta about restoring news to Facebook.

Sridhar Vembu: Engineering discipline matters

“I suggest the term ""AI-assisted Code Engineering"" with ACE as the acronym instead of ""vibe-coding"". We must have solid engineering discipline and ACE is the maturation of the tools and techniques”.

“It does not eliminate all software engineers but enables experienced engineers who ACE well to be much more productive,” he said, adding “It is also going to reshape our industry but that is a separate topic.”



What is vibe coding







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has suggested a new way to describe vibe-coding, a word that became one of the biggest “headache” of engineers in 2025. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Vembu argued that the termdoes not reflect the discipline required in real engineering work. He said that he prefers a new termto describe the growing use of AI tools in writing and maintaining software. In the post, Vembu said the focus should remain on solid engineering practices, even as AI becomes more deeply embedded in coding workflows.Sharing the post, Sridhar Vembu wrote:Vembu says that the term ACE does not remove the need for software engineers. Instead, it allows experienced engineers to “be much more productive”.Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming. It refers to building apps and websites by chatting with AI instead of writing code line by painstaking line.Vembu’s comments come at a time when AI-powered coding tools are being widely adopted by developers and companies to speed up software development. His remarks also highlight concerns among industry leaders that such language may underplay the importance of structure, accountability, and long-term reliability in software systems.Collins Dictionary named “vibe-coding” as its word of the year for 2025.","Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming.

""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

What Tim Cook means by “loving museums”

Apple CEO Tim Cook (Image source: Bloomberg)

“I don’t want to live in one”: A warning against stagnation

A lesson in leadership and decision-making

Why the quote resonates beyond technology

A reflection of Tim Cook’s leadership style

Why the quote still matters

""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

,





Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple , doesn't give long speeches or use dramatic slogans. When he does say something, it's usually short, to the point, and well thought out. One of these lines is his quote:. The sentence is easy to understand, like a conversation. But it has a deeper meaning about how to move forward, how to be a leader, and how businesses and people should plan for the future.The quote is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Museums are places where history is kept. They keep ideas, inventions, and events that changed the world. They help us remember where we came from. Tim Cook has never said that we should forget or ignore history. Instead, he says that it is dangerous to get too comfortable with it.In today's world, where things change quickly, especially in technology, staying still can cost you a lot. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.Museums are very important to society. They keep culture, new ideas, and human accomplishments safe. Future generations would lose touch with the ideas and work that shaped the past if there were no museums. Tim Cook saying ""love"" shows that he cares. He thinks it's important to learn from the past. He likes what has already been made.Apple has a long and well-known history. People often study and admire the company's past innovations, which include the Macintosh, the iPod, and the iPhone. A lot of these items are now on display in museums and exhibitions all over the world. Cook knows more about this legacy than most people.But liking someone doesn't mean you care about them. His quote makes it clear that history is important to learn about, but it shouldn't be a place where you want to stay, especially in an industry driven by constant innovation, progress, and forward-looking thinking.The second part of the quote is where the real meaning is. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. It means comfort, safety, and familiarity. That comfort can slowly turn into stagnation in business and leadership.Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. The markets change. Technology changes. People's needs change. What worked ten years ago might not work anymore. Businesses that only care about keeping their legacy alive often have a hard time staying relevant.Apple has kept changing under Cook's leadership. The business has grown into services, put more emphasis on user privacy, put money into protecting the environment, and moved into new areas like custom silicon chips. These choices show that the company is willing to try new things, even if the old ones worked.The quote is true for all leaders, not just Apple. People often praise leaders for their past successes, using previous wins as proof of future capability and judgement. People trust you more when you have done well in the past. But depending too much on past success can keep you from coming up with new ideas or recognising when the environment has fundamentally shifted.Cook's words make it sound like good leadership needs to be balanced. You can learn from history, but don't let it tell you what to do all the time. Don't let your past experiences tell you what to do. This method lets businesses change instead of fighting it, allowing innovation to emerge naturally rather than defensively.This idea also works for people. Careers, skills, and fields of work change over time. It can be harder to grow if you hold on too tightly to what used to work. The quote quietly encourages people to be open and curious, even when change is hard, uncertain, or uncomfortable at first.This quote stands out because it is so simple. It doesn't use business jargon or technical language. People can all understand it. Most people know how nice it is to stick to their routines and how hard it is to try something new.In a broader sense, the remark addresses how cultures deal with progress. Traditions and fresh ideas frequently conflict. It is crucial to respect tradition and history while also being open to new experiences. Cook's remark acknowledges the history. It simply refuses to be confined by it.This balance is especially important now that technology is changing quickly and making people wonder about jobs, education, and social structures. The quote tells people that progress doesn't mean forgetting the past; it means building on it in a smart way.People often say that Tim Cook is calm, level-headed, and practical. His way of leading is different from Steve Jobs's, who was known for making bold and dramatic statements. Cook does things in a quieter way. His words are more likely to make you think than to make you angry, reflecting patience, consistency, ethical decision-making, and a long-term focus rather than short-term applause, values that align closely with Apple’s culture and leadership philosophy.This quote fits that pattern. It doesn't need attention. It makes you think. It gives a point of view without making people agree. That restraint is one reason it feels real.The quote doesn't give a big picture; it gives a way of thinking. It talks about how Cook sees progress, responsibility, and long-term success.is still true because it describes a problem that everyone faces. How can we remember the past without letting it control us? How do we go on without losing what matters?It's clear but not obvious what Tim Cook means. Value history. Take something away from it. Then decide to go on.In one short sentence, the CEO of Apple reminds us that we can choose to make progress. It takes work, curiosity, and a willingness to go beyond what you already know. Museums keep the past alive. But the future is being built somewhere else.","Tim Cook's quote has a deeper meaning about how to move forward.

Blinkit CEO Albinder Singh Dhindsa will take over as CEO.

Albinder Singh Dhindsa has been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company with effect from February 1, 2026. Further, the Board of Directors (“Board”) recommended the appointment of Deepinder Goyal as the Director and Vice Chairman of the Board, effective upon shareholders' approval.

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.""

Read Deepinder Goyal's full letter that he sent to shareholders

“Dear Shareholders,

Today, I am going to step away from the Group CEO role, and subject to shareholders' approval, will remain on the board of directors as Vice Chairman.

Albinder Dhindsa

(Albi) will be Eternal's new Group CEO.

Why this change

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.

This transition allows Eternal to remain sharply focused, while giving me the space to explore ideas that do not fit Eternal's risk profile.

What doesn't change

I have spent eighteen years, almost half my life, building this company. I will continue doing that.

Albi, Akshant, and I will continue to work closely together, as we always have. Our partnership, shared context, and trust remain unchanged. All our business CEOs will continue operating with the autonomy they have always had.

My involvement in long-term strategy, culture, leadership development, and ethics and governance, continues. This is where I have increasingly focused lately anyway.

What changes

The centre of gravity for operating decisions moves to Albi.

As Group CEO, he will own day-to-day execution, operating priorities, and business decisions.

Blinkit's journey from acquisition to breakeven happened under his leadership.

He built the team, the culture, the supply chain, the operating rhythm. He has the DNA of a battle-hardened founder and his ability to execute far exceeds mine. He is more than capable of leading Eternal as Group CEO.

Blinkit remains our largest growth opportunity and will remain as Albi's top priority. Our decentralized structure, where each business has a CEO with full ownership, continues unchanged - and will help Albi execute this well.

On alignment and ESOPs

My financial future remains meaningfully tied to Eternal, and my incentives remain aligned with long-term shareholder value creation.

As part of this transition, all of my unvested ESOPs will revert to the ESOP pool. This ensures that Eternal continues to have meaningful wealth-creation opportunities for its next generation of leaders, while strengthening long-term retention without incremental shareholder dilution.

Looking ahead

Eighteen years ago, the idea that a menu scanning company could be worth tens of billions of dollars, provide livelihoods to hundreds of thousands of people, and serve millions of families daily would have seemed absurd. We helped prove it was possible. And there's a lot in store for Eternal to do over the next few decades.

I believe Eternal is not going to lose focus or momentum through this change. Rather, it is reinforcing its institutional strength.

And personally, I gain the flexibility to explore ideas that sit outside Eternal's scope, without compromising the company's priorities.

I want Eternal to become India's most valuable company. I want us to serve a billion customers. I want us to create the most positive impact on society. I want us to be the source of livelihoods for millions of Indians. None of that changes.

This is a change in title, not in commitment towards outcomes. Eternal remains my life's work.

Thank you for your continued trust and support.

Deepinder Goyal”

Months after Donald Trump made an 'angry call' to Jeff Bezos; Amazon CEO Andy Jassy makes statement on Trump Tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/months-after-donald-trump-made-angry-call-to-jeff-bezos-after-learning-amazon-plans-to-display-added-cost-of-tariffs-ceo-andy-jassy-makes-statement-on-trump-tariffs/articleshow/126848913.cms,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy

When White House called Amazon's tariff plan an 'hostile act'





In April 2025, a pissed Donald Trump made a call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after learning that the company is planning to display the added cost of tariffs on certain items. Trump made the call to Bezos to complain about reports that Amazon was considering to highlight the cost of US tariffs next to prices for certain products on the company’s website. Trump later told reporters about the call to Amazon founder and said it was a “good call.” “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump told reporters. “He solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.”Punchbowl News first reported that Amazon will soon “display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs — right next to the product’s total listed price.” The move came after Trump slapped 145% tariffs on imports from China and a 10% minimum tax on all other countries.Now months later, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC in an interview Jassy at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Amazon.com is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures stemming from the US President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""We did a lot of pre-buying in the early part of 2025 to enable us to try and keep prices as low as possible for customers,"" Jassy said.He added, ""And a lot of our third-party sellers did a lot of forward-staging in our fulfillment network for the same reasons. And that supply is run out in the fall, so you start to see some of the tariffs creep in to some of the prices, some of the items.""""Some third-party sellers are raising prices in response while others are absorbing the costs in hopes of driving more demand,"" Jassy went on to add. ""Our priority is to try to figure out how to keep prices low as possible,"" Jassy said. ""At a certain point, because retail is a mid-single-digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it.""The warning marks a shift from the Amazon leader's commentary on tariffs last year. While he cautioned in April that third-party sellers could need to pass along tariff costs, he said on several occasions that Amazon had not seen selling prices appreciably rise from tariffs. ""Amazon's consumers overall have fared well. But we'll have to see what happens in 2026,"" CEO Jassy had said.The company has also maintained so far that over the past year it was seeing very little impact on consumer behavior and product prices from tariffs. It has doubled down on expanding product categories and speeding up delivery timelines to shield demand.In April 2025, at a briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the move a “hostile and political act,” adding that she had spoken about the matter with President Trump earlier. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Levitt’s comments, saying it’s a hostile act if a company goes out of its way to “make it seem” like tariffs have caused prices to change.“It’s nonsense,” he said Tuesday in a CNBC interview. “A 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price,” he added, referring to the nearly universal baseline tariff on all countries. “The only price will change would be a product that we don’t make here, like a mango.” The 10% tariff, however, is hardly the only one in effect.",Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the company is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures. The warning marks a shift from the Amazon leader's commentary on tariffs last year.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Satya Nadella said it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.

Debate at Davos



Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid







Palantir CEO Alex Karp has now issued a stark warning about the future of work in the age of artificial intelligence. Karp predicted that humanities-based jobs will now be among the first casualties. As reported by Business Insider, speaking during a panel at the World Economic Forum, Karp revealed that his own academic background which is a philosophy degree from Haverford College, a law degree from Stanford, and a Ph.D. in social theory from Germany, cautioned that such qualifications may no longer be viable. “AI will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp said. “You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market.”Karp believes that workers with technical and vocational training will be in then highest demand. He quoted battery manufacturing as an exampple, nothing that technicians in such industries are “very valuable, if not irreplaceable.” “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” Karp told BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who moderated the discussion.Not all leaders at Davos agreed with Karp’s assessment. Finance executives told Business Insider that liberal arts degrees may actually become more valuable, as AI takes over routine financial analysis. Critical and creative thinking, they argued, is increasingly prized in young recruits.Meanwhile, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei highlighted another trend: entry-level hiring is already declining due to AI. Amodei said software and coding roles at Anthropic were down across junior and mid-level positions.Recently, Karp said that value of skilled workers is rising. Speaking on TBPN, a tech talk show broadcast live from Palantir’s customer conference, AIP Con 8, Karp said, “Workers become more valuable. The person at the top is actually crazy valuable. People with technical expertise are crazy valuable."" His words underscore a trend that’s become increasingly apparent in Silicon Valley: in a world awash with automation and AI, human expertise, especially deep technical skill, has become a rare commodity.Karp calls these individuals “artist-shaped people,” a nod to the company’s unique culture, sometimes referred to internally as “an artist colony.” He added, “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid.”. The statement doesn’t just reflect Palantir’s philosophy; it mirrors the market reality, where top AI researchers and engineers have recently netted unprecedented paydays, sometimes reaching hundreds of millions, while thousands of others were laid off from companies like Microsoft and Meta.","Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid. “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid,” he said.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

Why Elon Musk wants to merge his companies



Michael Burry, one of America’s most popular investor has now weighed in on Elon Musk ’s ambitious vision of Future. Burry has called Tesla and SpaceX CEO an ‘American treasure’ but has also cautioned that the future Musk is building is ‘much further away than he thinks’. As reported by Business Insider, in a series of posts shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) and his Substack, Burry described Musk as a ‘desperate incentivised futurist’ who believes in generating enormous profit from his vision becoming a reality. He went ahead and compared the SpaceX CEO with PT Barnum and Thomas Edison. He also believes that Musk will go down in history as both a showman and an inventor.Burry, who is known for making early but ultimately right market predictions, argued that futurists are “always decades early” and often sell visions with indefinite timelines that allow them to raise capital. He feels that the grand projects of Elon Musk ranging from colonising Mars to deploying millions of robotaxis fit in this mold.Along with this, Burry also pointed out the reports that Musk is planning a potential merger between SpaceX, Tesla, and his AI startup xAI. He noted that the market had already priced in such a move, with combined valuations of:* SpaceX: $800 billion (private share sale, December 2025)* Tesla: $1.3 trillion market cap* xAI: $230 billion (fundraising, November 2025)Burry said the trio’s combined worth of $1.6 trillion “more than encompasses” their current and future value.The report said that for SpaceX, the primary rationale for merging xAI may be the escalating AI arms race as it has signaled launching data centres into orbit. By integrating xAI's software directly with Starlink's hardware, Musk may create a globally accessible, space-based AI network that is physically shielded from terrestrial disruptions.Meanwhile, Bloomberg reports that some investors are pushing for an alternative: a merger between Tesla and xAI. This will ensure that xAI’s ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD) and robotics are best utilised within Tesla’s EV and humanoid robot (Optimus) programs.""I think it's highly likely that xAI ends up with one of the two parties. What's important for Elon is to have a massive vision that's way out there that he's early on,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, was quoted as saying.“Musk has too many separate companies. A major risk thesis for Tesla is that Musk is spreading himself out too much. As a Tesla shareholder, I applaud further consolidation,” added Dennis Dick, chief market strategist at Stock Trader Network.Two new entities were established in Nevada on January 21, with filings listing SpaceX and its CFO, Bret Johnsen, as managing members, the report said.","Michael Burry, one of America’s most popular investor has now weighed in on Elon Musk ’s ambitious vision of Future.

The jury’s verdict follows an 11-day trial before U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria for the Northern District of California.“This conviction exposes a calculated breach of trust involving some of the most advanced AI technology in the world at a critical moment in AI development,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. “Ding abused his privileged access to steal AI trade secrets while pursuing PRC government-aligned ventures. His duplicity put U.S. technological leadership and competitiveness at risk. I commend the trial team and investigators whose exceptional work resulted in this conviction.”“In today’s high-stakes race to dominate the field of artificial intelligence, Linwei Ding betrayed both the U.S. and his employer by stealing trade secrets about Google’s AI technology on behalf of China’s government,” said Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky of the FBI's Counterintelligence and Espionage Division.“Not only does this case mark the first-ever conviction on AI-related economic espionage charges, but it also demonstrates the FBI’s unwavering dedication to protecting American businesses from the increasingly severe threat China poses to our economic and national security. We remain committed to working closely with our partners across the private sector to protect our nation’s innovation, safeguard our trade secrets, and hold our foreign adversaries accountable.”“Silicon Valley is at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation, pioneering transformative work that drives economic growth and strengthens our national security. The jury delivered a clear message today that the theft of this valuable technology will not go unpunished. We will vigorously protect American intellectual capital from foreign interests that seek to gain an unfair competitive advantage while putting our national security at risk,” said U.S. Attorney Craig H. Missakian for the Northern District of California.“This conviction reinforces the FBI’s steadfast commitment to protecting American innovation and national security. The theft and misuse of advanced artificial intelligence technology for the benefit of the People’s Republic of China threatens our technological edge and economic competitiveness,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani for the San Francisco Field Office. “The FBI San Francisco division serves Silicon Valley and the companies who lead the world in innovation, and we are committed to safeguarding their work. This case demonstrates the strength of collaboration between the FBI and the private sector, including leading companies like Google, whose partnership is critical to protecting sensitive U.S. technology. Today’s verdict affirms that federal law will be enforced to protect our nation’s most valuable technologies and hold those who steal them accountable.”Ding was originally indicted in March 2024. A superseding indictment returned in February 2025 described seven categories of trade secrets stolen by Ding and charged Ding with seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets.According to the evidence presented at trial, between approximately May 2022 and April 2023, while a Google employee, Ding stole more than two thousand pages of confidential information containing Google’s AI trade secrets from Google’s network and uploaded them to his personal Google Cloud account. Ding also secretly affiliated himself with two PRC-based technology companies while he was employed by Google: around June 2022, Ding was in discussions to be the Chief Technology Officer for an early-stage technology company based in the PRC; by early 2023, Ding was in the process of founding his own technology company in the PRC focused on AI and machine learning and was acting as the company’s CEO. In multiple statements to potential investors, Ding claimed that he could build an AI supercomputer by copying and modifying Google’s technology. In December 2023, less than two weeks before he resigned from Google, Ding downloaded the stolen Google trade secrets to his own personal computer.The jury found that Ding stole trade secrets relating to the hardware infrastructure and software platforms that allow Google’s supercomputing data center to train and serve large AI models. The trade secrets contained detailed information about the architecture and functionality of Google’s custom Tensor Processing Unit chips and systems and Google’s Graphics Processing Unit systems, the software that allows the chips to communicate and execute tasks, and the software that orchestrates thousands of chips into a supercomputer capable of training and executing cutting-edge AI workloads. The trade secrets also pertained to Google’s custom-designed SmartNIC, a type of network interface card used to facilitate high speed communication within Google’s AI supercomputers and cloud networking products.In presentations to investors, Ding called out the PRC’s national policies prioritizing AI development and innovation in the PRC, and in late 2023 Ding applied for a government sponsored “talent plan” in Shanghai, PRC. The jury heard evidence pertaining to the PRC government’s establishment of talent plans to encourage individuals to come to China to contribute to the PRC’s economic and technological growth. Ding’s application for this talent plan stated that he planned to “help China to have computing power infrastructure capabilities that are on par with the international level. ” The evidence at trial also showed that Ding intended to benefit two entities controlled by the government of China by assisting with the development of an AI supercomputer and collaborating on the research and development of custom machine learning chips.Ding is next scheduled to appear at a status conference on Feb. 3, 2026. Ding faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each count of theft of trade secrets in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1832 and 15 years in prison for each count of economic espionage in violation of 18 U.S.C § 1831. Any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the Court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553.Assistant U.S. Attorneys for the Northern District of California Casey Boome, Molly K. Priedeman, and Roland Chang are prosecuting this case, with assistance from Veronica Hernandez and Trial Attorney Yifei Zheng from the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, National Security Division.

This move, ahead of SpaceX's planned $1.5 trillion IPO, could create a powerful entity focused on space-based AI infrastructure or an energy-meets-exploration powerhouse. Planning appears advanced with new Nevada entities registered.

The xAI deal: Building AI infrastructure in orbit

The Tesla scenario: Energy meets exploration

Elon Musk is considering merging SpaceX with either his AI startup xAI or electric vehicle maker Tesla, a consolidation that would reshape his already intertwined business empire just months before SpaceX's highly anticipated public debut.The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, and Bloomberg all reported on the talks Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. While no final decisions have been made, two ""merger sub"" entities were registered in Nevada on January 21, with SpaceX CFO Bret Johnsen listed as an officer—suggesting the planning is more than theoretical.SpaceX is preparing for a summer IPO that could value it at $1.5 trillion, making it the largest stock market debut in history. But which merger path Musk chooses could fundamentally alter what investors are actually buying into.Merging SpaceX with xAI would advance Musk's stated goal of launching data centers into space. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, he declared that ""the lowest-cost place to put AI will be space"" within two or three years, powered by solar energy and free from Earth's energy grid constraints.xAI, valued at $230 billion in November, owns the Grok chatbot and X social media platform.Combining it with SpaceX would create a vertically integrated operation spanning rockets, satellite internet through Starlink, AI development, and social media distribution. According to Reuters, xAI shares would convert to SpaceX stock, though some executives might receive cash instead.The deal could also strengthen SpaceX's Pentagon relationships. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited SpaceX's Texas facility earlier this month, announcing plans to integrate Grok into military networks. xAI already has contracts worth up to $200 million with the Department of Defense.Bloomberg reports that some investors are pushing for a SpaceX-Tesla combination instead. The logic is straightforward: Tesla manufactures the energy storage systems that could help SpaceX run those orbital data centers on solar power.There's overlap in Musk's vision, too. He's discussed using Starship rockets to transport Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots to the moon and eventually Mars. Tesla just announced it's converting its Fremont factory from producing Model S and Model X vehicles to making Optimus robots, signaling a pivot toward what the company calls ""physical AI.""The merry-go-round of investments between Musk's companies adds another layer. SpaceX put $2 billion into xAI last year, and Tesla disclosed its own $2 billion xAI investment on Wednesday. Tesla also sold $430 million worth of backup batteries to xAI in 2025, according to CNBC.Musk has form here—he merged X into xAI last year in a deal that valued the combined entity at $113 billion. Any new merger would likely delay the June IPO, but it might also let Musk beat OpenAI and Anthropic in the race to become the first major AI company to go public.","Elon Musk is considering merging SpaceX with either his AI startup xAI or electric car giant Tesla.

H-1B Visa Shake-Up Fuels Anti-Indian Campaigns as Donald Trump's Policy Reshapes US Hiring

The meteoric rise of Nvidia during the ongoing AI boom has now only rewarded the investors but it has also led to the creation of vast wealth for many of its employees. While the workforce of the company remains relatively small at about 36,000, its stock appreciation has turned long-standing contributors into millionaires. As reported by Business Insider, the newly available H-1B visa fillings offer a rare glimpse into how much Nvidia pays its US employees across critical roles.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has long stressed on the fact that he gets personally involved in compensation decisions. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day at the end of every cycle,” Huang said on the All-In podcast last July. He also claimed to have “created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world.” Despite this, the employees of the company acknowledge that those who joined Nvidia earlier have benefited far more from equity appreciation than newer hires, a disparity openly discussed within the company.The fillings with the US Labor Department required for sponsoring foreign workers—offer insight into base pay ranges. These figures exclude equity and bonuses, which often make up a significant portion of total compensation.In fiscal 2025, Nvidia received roughly 1,900 certified H-1B applications, covering roles such as software engineers, research scientists, and product managers.","The newly available H-1B visa fillings offer a rare glimpse into how much Nvidia pays its US employees.

GPT‑5.2: OpenAI retires GPT‑4o



On February 13, 2026, OpenAI is officially retiring GPT-4o, along with GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and o4-mini. GPT-4o has been a favourite tool for creative work and conversational tasks. People reportedly loved its warmth, its casual style, the way it felt more personal than other models.For a while, GPT-4o was temporarily restored after being deprecated. Users asked for more time to transition, especially those relying on it for brainstorming, writing, and ideation. That feedback, it appears, shaped the new GPT-5.1 and 5.2 updates. Many users say the change marks an emotional shift, not just technical, altering workflows, habits, trust, and creative comfort unexpectedly.GPT‑4o wasn’t just another AI. It reportedly had a style people loved. For creative ideation, it was the go-to for writers, marketers and researchers that all seemed to prefer over more rigid versions. GPT‑5.1 and 5.2 are now more flexible. You can choose tones like “Friendly,” adjust warmth, tweak enthusiasm. The idea is that ChatGPT feels more personal, not just more capable. Users can control how it responds, without needing complicated prompts.OpenAI says these retirements let them focus on models most people use. GPT‑5.2 has become the standard. Creative writing, casual conversations, and problem-solving tasks are all happening there. The retirement also reflects the company’s broader plan to improve ChatGPT’s personality and creativity. Unnecessary refusals are being reduced.Some users will feel the loss. Those still relying on GPT‑4o for key workflows will need to adjust. They highlighted the usage had dropped dramatically and improvements in GPT‑5.1 and 5.2 now cover most use cases. Age prediction features have also rolled out for under‑18 users aiming to provide more safeguards while giving adults more freedom in how ChatGPT responds.","GPT-4o has been a favourite tool for creative work and conversational tasks.

"Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu on why he sees huge opportunity for Indian IT companies, as 'Software stocks are coming down hard'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-on-why-he-sees-huge-opportunity-for-indian-it-companies-as-software-stocks-are-coming-down-hard/articleshow/127816202.cms,"Role of AI and opportunity for Indian IT firms

Read Sridhar Vembu’s post

Software stocks are coming down hard. I see it as massively over-valued companies coming down. But the quoted post argues ""AI based code will destroy the software industry"".

First, I don't see why any mature software company should trade at 30-40 PE. I think 10 or 15 is where they will go.

I also think the E will drop - Salesforce or Service Now have gotten away with exorbitant prices so far and they won't be able to. When they lose their high PE and their E also drops, it would feel like death - given that companies like Salesforce are merely ""use high flying stock to acquire start-ups and then use high pressure sales teams to upsell"" they won't be able to get away with that model very long. That is the functional equivalent of death.

But is that due to AI? I like to think it is good old-fashioned competition.

AI will accelerate the competition. But will AI mean all enterprise apps will be done by in-house IT or IT services firms at very low cost? Possible but my bet is ""far lower cost of enterprise software"".

In any case, Indian IT services firms can prosper at the expense of Salesforce etc by offering to replace Salesforce and migrate the customer and save them 60-80%. That is a huge opportunity for IT services firms.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has said that falling software stocks are creating a major opportunity for Indian IT services companies, as he questioned high valuations and business models of large global software firms. In a post shared on social media platform X, the Zoho founder said many software companies were “massively over-valued” and are now seeing sharp corrections. Vembu’s post came after Microsoft witnessed its worst stock market days recently after it lost $400 billion in just a few hours as the company’s stock plunged.In the post, Sridhar Vembu said software stocks are “coming down hard” because many mature software companies were trading at price-to-earnings ratios of 30 to 40, which he believes are unsustainable. According to him, valuations in the range of 10 to 15 are more realistic for such firms. He also said that earnings at some large enterprise software companies could come under pressure, which would further hurt their stock prices.Referring to companies such as Salesforce and ServiceNow, Vembu said these firms have been able to charge high prices for their products so far. He added that this pricing power may not last, and when both valuations and earnings fall, it could feel like a major shock for investors.While some market observers argue that artificial intelligence could “destroy” the software industry, Vembu said he does not fully agree with that view. Instead, he described the current changes as a result of increased competition, which AI may accelerate.According to Vembu, AI could lead to a much lower cost of enterprise software, even if it does not completely replace large software platforms. He said it is possible that some enterprise applications may be built in-house or through IT services firms at a lower cost.Vembu said this creates a clear opportunity for Indian IT services companies. He noted that these firms can offer to replace expensive enterprise software platforms, migrate customers to new systems, and help them save between 60% and 80% on costs. He described this as a “huge opportunity” for Indian IT companies to grow at the expense of large global software vendors.His comments come at a time when global tech stocks are facing pressure and companies are reassessing spending on software and technology services.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu said falling software stocks are creating a major opportunity for Indian IT services companies.

The 2025 iPhone that Apple may not launch a successor of in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-2025-iphone-whose-successor-apple-may-not-launch-in-2026/articleshow/127814728.cms,"Apple may skip iPhone 18 in 2026

Supply chain constraints ‘likely’ reason

Apple launched iPhone Air in September last year along with its iPhone 17 series. The smartphone features a 5.6mm thin profile, making it ‘thinnest iPhone ever’. A new report now suggests that users waiting for the next version of the iPhone Air may have to wait longer. The Cupertino-based company is unlikely to launch a second-generation iPhone Air in 2026. “Apple has at least five new iPhone models in the pipeline,” Nikkei Asia reports. These will include “a revamped iPhone Air, its thinnest-ever model; the standard new iPhone; and three premium models.” However, there is no clarity on when iPhone Air shipments will start, the report says adding it is not expected in 2026.“It is not yet clear when shipments of the Air will start, but they are not expected this year,” the report adds.Apple iPhone Air is not the only iPhone that the firm may skip this year. As per the report, Apple may skip a 2026 launch for the iPhone 18 and push its debut to 2027.The report cites four people aware of the matter who say that Apple will prioritise premium iPhone launches in 2026 due to the global memory crunch. The tech giant is said to focus on delivering its first-ever foldable iPhone as well as two Pro models for its launch in the second half of the year and the the standard iPhone 18 model will be scheduled for shipment in the first half of 2027.“Apple is prioritizing the production and shipment of its three most premium new iPhone models for 2026 while pushing back the shipment of its standard model amid a marketing strategy change and supply chain crunch,” it says.""Supply chain smoothness is one of the key challenges for this year, and the marketing strategy change also played a part in the decision [to prioritize premium models],"" the report quotes an executive with an iPhone supplier who has direct knowledge of the plan.The report indicates that Apple seems to have started to feel the effects of soaring memory prices, and to minimize any potential production hiccups, the company is taking measures to keep things running smoothly.A Nikkei Asia report earlier stated that the tech supply chain, particularly the consumer electronics segment, is facing mounting pressure over a supply crunch for memory chips and various materials. Not just Apple, but other Chinese smartphone makers, including Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and Transsion, have lowered their shipment forecasts for this year.","Apple launched iPhone Air in September last year along with its iPhone 17 series.

Crypto CEO who has become the No 1 enemy of America's biggest banks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/crypto-ceo-who-has-become-the-no-1-enemy-of-americas-biggest-banks/articleshow/127812350.cms,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong faced a heated exchange with JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon at Davos, accusing banks of lobbying against crypto legislation. Banks, fearing competition from stablecoin rewards, are pushing back against crypto's expansion into consumer finance. This tension highlights a growing rift as digital assets move mainstream, with potential legislative battles ahead.

“You are full of s***,”

What may have fueled Brian Armstrong’s uncomfortable run-ins with bank CEOs at Davos

“After reviewing the Senate Banking draft text over the last 48hrs, Coinbase unfortunately can’t support the bill as written.There are too many issues, including:

- A defacto ban on tokenized equities

- DeFi prohibitions, giving the government unlimited access to your financial records and removing your right to privacy

- Erosion of the CFTC’s authority, stifling innovation and making it subservient to the SEC

- Draft amendments that would kill rewards on stablecoins, allowing banks to ban their competition

We appreciate all the hard work by members of the Senate to reach a bipartisan outcome, but this version would be materially worse than the current status quo.

We’d rather have no bill than a bad bill. Hopefully we can all get to a better draft.

We'll keep fighting for all Americans and for economic freedom. Crypto needs to be treated on a level playing field with the rest of financial services so we can build this industry in a safe and trusted way in America.”

""out there trying to ban their competition""

""without their permission essentially.""

""If you want to be a bank, just be a bank,""

Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong reportedly had an intense moment with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon during last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos. A report claims that the CEO of the biggest US crypto company was confronted by the chief executive of the biggest bank of US over accusations that banks are trying to sabotage crypto legislation.A report by The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the conversation, claimed that Dimon told Armstrong to stop lying on TV.Dimon, a long-time sceptic who has previously described cryptocurrency as a fraud, said while pointing his index finger directly at Armstrong's face as the Coinbase chief was having coffee with former UK prime minister Tony Blair.This comes after Armstrong accused banks of trying to sabotage legislation that would set a new regulatory framework for digital assets during appearances on business TV programmes earlier that week. However, the confrontation wasn't quite in line with the annual forum's mission to foster cooperation among global leaders.As crypto moves into the mainstream of American finance, some of Wall Street's major players are waking up to the threat. While banks have embraced some aspects of crypto, helping people invest in bitcoin and using digital assets to make money transfers more efficient, they are drawing a line at encroachment on their core business, which is consumer deposits.Banks and Coinbase are at odds over whether crypto exchanges should be allowed to offer consumers regular payouts for holding digital tokens. These so-called rewards would pay holders of stablecoins a recurring fee, say 3.5%. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to real-world currencies like the US dollar.Banks say the payouts are effectively the same as interest on bank accounts, and since banks offer much lower yields, typically under 0.1% in a checking account, they worry that consumers will shift large amounts of money into crypto. According to the banks, this will compromise community banks and business lending.Armstrong and others in the crypto world have argued that the free market should reign and that banks can simply pay higher interest rates to compete with stablecoins or enter the stablecoin business themselves.However, the legislation, known as the Clarity Act, may shape the future of everyday financial services, including bank deposits and electronic payments. In a push to reach a compromise, the White House plans to host a meeting between bank and crypto industry groups with US President Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, expected to attend, the WSJ report claimed, citing people familiar with the matter. Coinbase's head of US policy, Kara Calvert, is also slated to attend, the report added.Recently, a Senate committee was prepared to vote on a version of the legislation that could effectively ban companies like Coinbase from offering payouts to customers, which could’ve potentially cost crypto companies billions of dollars. Just before the vote, Armstrong took to microblogging site X (formerly Twitter) to write:As per the report, the vote was abruptly postponed within hours of the post being shared. Armstrong's pushback didn't end with his X post. He echoed his view in TV appearances, telling Bloomberg that bank lobbyists wereand accusing banks of lending out their customers' depositsThis led to a series of uncomfortable encounters with bank CEOs at Davos, described by people familiar with the conversations.Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan told Armstrong during a 30-minute meeting last week at the main convention centre in Davos, the report noted.Citigroup's Jane Fraser gave Armstrong less than a minute of her time. Coinbase is a client of both Citi and JPMorgan, and the exchange has business partnerships with other banks.Meanwhile, Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf offered Armstrong not even a minute. When Armstrong approached him, Scharf told him that there was nothing for them to talk about. The exchange took place while Dimon, Scharf's former boss, stood nearby, the report added.",Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong reportedly had an intense moment with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon during last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos.

AWS remains Perplexity's preferred cloud infrastructure provider, and we're excited to announce expansions of that partnership in the coming weeks.”

“a threat to user choice”

“hundreds of millions”

“all-in”

How will this Perplexity deal help Microsoft

“Our customers expect to use multiple models as part of any workload. And we offer the broadest selection of models of any hyperscaler.”

Perplexity has signed a $750 million deal with Microsoft Azure. With this deal, the AI startup is expanding its business beyond its long-time cloud partner, Amazon. The three-year commitment will allow Perplexity to deploy AI models through Microsoft's Foundry service, including those from OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI, a report claimed, citing people familiar with the deal, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter. However, a Perplexity spokesperson has confirmed that as part of the Microsoft deal, the company hasn't shifted spending from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has long been the startup's primary cloud provider.In a statement to Bloomberg, a Perplexity spokesperson said,This deal comes after Perplexity and Amazon got engaged in a legal fight last year. In November 2025, Amazon sued Perplexity to prevent the startup from allowing consumers to use its AI tools to shop on Amazon's online marketplace. Perplexity responded by calling Amazon a bully and its actions. Meanwhile, that same month, Perplexity AI CEO Aravind Srinivas said his company had receivedin commitments from AWS.Perplexity built much of its business on AWS, using Amazon's Bedrock service to access Anthropic models for Perplexity's search engine. Srinivas is also a repeat speaker at AWS conferences. In a 2023 appearance, he said that he had decided to goon Amazon's cloud. AWS, in turn, has cited Perplexity as a cutting-edge AI customer using its services.For Microsoft, the Perplexity deal strengthens its efforts to position Azure as the platform for building AI applications and deploying models from a variety of vendors. Microsoft has long offered models from its partner OpenAI. In November 2025, the company also struck a deal with Anthropic to do the same.Earlier this week, during an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said,Over 1,500 Microsoft Foundry customers have already used both OpenAI and Anthropic models, Nadella said. The number of customers spending over $1 million per quarter on Foundry grew nearly 80% in the quarter which ended in December 2025, he added.Perplexity is a high-value AI startup but faces tough competition from Alphabet Inc.'s Google and OpenAI in its goal of changing how people search for information online. It also hasn't raised nearly as much money as OpenAI and Anthropic, which have recently made a series of infrastructure deals.Large companies typically rent cloud services from multiple providers, both to access unique capabilities and to avoid overreliance on any single vendor. This has increased during the AI era, as businesses test new tools and sign deals with model makers and cloud providers whose servers run that software.","Perplexity has signed a $750 million deal with Microsoft Azure.

Cloudflare says automated systems detected, mitigated attacks



Cloudflare, the web infrastructure giant, has said that it has successfully mitigated the “the largest attack ever disclosed publicly.” In its 2025 Q4 DDoS Threat Report (via Bleeping Computer), the company detailed a ‘record-breaking’ bombardment by the Aisuru/Kimwolf botnet, which peaked at a 31.4 Terabits per second (Tbps). Cloudflare came into spotlight after hundreds of websites were down in November.The report said that the hacking campaign was dubbed “The Night Before Christmas”, and targeted telecommunications providers, IT organisations and Cloudflare’s own dashboard infrastructure on December 19, 2025. It also claimed that the attack was “hyper-volumetric”, which means that it relied on sheer force to overwhelm networks.“The campaign targeted Cloudflare customers as well as Cloudflare’s dashboard and infrastructure with hyper-volumetric HTTP DDoS attacks exceeding rates of 200 million requests per second (rps) alongside Layer 4 DDoS attacks peaking at 31.4 Terabits per second, making it the largest attack ever disclosed publicly,” Cloudflare said in the report.Cloudflare reported that its automated systems detected and neutralised the threats so efficiently that no internal human alerts were even triggered.The company also reported that unlike other attacks which utilise compromised routers or basic Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the “Night Before Christmas” campaign came from compromised Android TVs.According to the web infrastructure giant, most of these attacks were short-lived but intense. About 50% of them lasted between one and two minutes, and 90% of the attacks peaked between 1–5 Tbps. Furthermore, the largest source of the year's attacks was reported to be from Bangladesh, followed by Ecuador, Indonesia and Argentina.When it comes to targets, China and Hong Kong were the most frequently attacked countries. Aisuru botnet previously held the record at 29.7 Tbps and once being attributed to a 15.72 Tbps attack on Microsoft. In 2025, Cloudflare recorded a 121% increase in DDoS incidents compared to 2024, totaling 47.1 million unique attacks.","Cloudflare says automated systems detected, mitigated attacks by Aisuru/Kimwolf botnet.

The trial will begin on Monday (February 2) in Santa Fe District Court, is expected to span nearly two months.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the case has been brought by New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez, and centres on a 2023 undercover investigation dubbed “Operation MetaPhile.” During the probe, investigators created accounts on both Facebook and Instagram, posing as children under the age of 14.They claim that the accounts were quickly bombarded with sexually explicit material, and were contacted by predators seeking illegal content.

China may have approved Nvidia H200 AI GPU for startup that wiped out $600 billion from American chipmaker’s market value,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-may-have-approved-nvidia-h200-ai-gpu-for-startup-that-wiped-out-600-billion-from-american-chipmakers-market-value/articleshow/127805461.cms,"Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Nvidia’s ‘Deep’Seek irony

After US export clearance, China has to green-light H200 imports

China has reportedly granted conditional approval for one of the country’s leading AI startup, DeepSeek, to purchase Nvidia’s high-performance H200 chips. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the conditions, however, are yet to be finalised by China’s state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The move comes almost exactly a year after the startup triggered a $600 billion wipeout of Nvidia’s market value.Citing sources familiar with the matter, Reuters said that Beijing has greenlit DeepSeek, alongside tech giants ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent, to acquire the H200, which is Nvidia's second most powerful AI processor.Notably, on January 27, 2025, shares of Nvidia plunged nearly 17% in a single day, reportedly the largest market cap loss in US history, after DeepSeek released its R1 model. The main reason for the decline was the Chinese company’s claim that high-level AI could be trained at a fraction of the cost using far fewer chips. This led investors to fear a collapse in demand for Nvidia’s high-end silicon.Not only Nvidia, shares of other AI companies like OpenAI – that have been spending billions to train their AI models – were also hit. One year later, DeepSeek is now transitioning from a perceived threat to a massive customer.The timing of the development is also critical as DeepSeek is expected to launch its next-generation V4 model in mid-February. It is said to have strong coding capabilities.Earlier this month, the US government formally cleared the H200 for export to China, however, the final approval decision rests with Beijing. China is looking to balance the immediate compute needs of its tech sector by nurturing domestic chipmakers like Huawei.Previous reports have claimed that the NDRC is considering “bundling” requirements, which means Chinese tech companies will have to purchase a specific ratio of domestic AI accelerators for every Nvidia H200 they import.Recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, told reporters in Taipei that the company has not yet received official confirmation, noting, “I believe that China was still finalizing the license.”","China has reportedly granted conditional approval for one of the country's leading AI startup, DeepSeek, to purchase Nvidia's high-performance H200 chips.

What ‘Melania’ producer said about Jeff Bezos’ involvement in the movie

Amazon MGM Studios producer Marc Beckman has dismissed reports that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was involved in the US First Lady Melania Trump's documentary deal with the company. With this clarification, he addressed rumours that the US First Lady had pitched the project directly to the billionaire during a visit to Mar-a-Lago last year. Beckman, who serves as a producer on the film and is also Melania's exclusive senior advisor, says Melania's only mention ofto Bezos during the meal came after other Amazon executives had already pitched the project. Trump's team insists that Bezos wasn't involved in the Amazon MGM movie deal after he and Lauren Sanchez visited Mar-a-Lago last year.Bezos's Amazon MGM Studios acquired the rights to the feature-length documentary about Melania Trump for a whooping $40 million and spent a further $35 million on a global marketing push. The film, directed by Brett Ratner, follows Melania in the 20 days leading up to last year's US presidential inauguration. The documentary was screened at a recent White House promotional event attended by what the Hollywood Reporter describes asincluding Amazon's Andy Jassy, Apple's Tim Cook, and former boxer Mike Tyson.However, one notable absence from thesneak peek White House screening was Bezos himself. Among the guests were Apple CEO Tim Cook and AMD CEO Lisa Su, as well as Amazon executives Andy Jassy and Mike Hopkins. The screening included custom-made popcorn buckets, framed screening tickets and a military band playing a tune from the film calledIn a statement to Page Six, Melania producer Marc Beckman said,“Bezos wasn’t involved in the contract negotiations at all, ever… He never had a conversation with me about anything surrounding the film — ever.Here’s what actually happened. The only interaction during that family meal between Melania and Jeff — with regards to the film — was that when Melania commented to Jeff that I was in talks with Amazon’s executive leadership, Bezos had no idea about the film or the contract negotiation. He wasn’t aware that I was already in talks with his team, and didn’t know about the film itself. It was a friendly meal with family members present, and definitely not a setting for a contract negotiation.[The] first person I reached out to at Amazon was in its executive leadership … I never interacted with Jeff — not an email, a text, he was never involved.”Beckman also added that “during the process, I became very impressed with Amazon’s team, their vision, and experience in the film industry. It was definitely one of the key determining factors in making the deal.”","Melania producer Marc Beckman has dismissed reports that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was involved in the US First Lady's documentary deal with the company.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai has shared his views on the newly announced Project Genie AI tool. This new experimental tool from Google DeepMind allows users to create and explore interactive digital worlds using AI, and he says he's been testing it himself. In a post shared on the microblogging site X (formerly Twitter), Pichai wrote:The announcement introduces the latest experimental offering from Google's AI research arm to end users as the company continues competing in the AI race. The company said this feedback will help guide future development in areas such as AI research, simulation, and generative media. Google said it plans to continue expanding access to Project Genie and improving the technology over time.Meanwhile,Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis also took to X and wrote,In an official statement, the company said:Project Genie is a research prototype built on Genie 3, a general-purpose world model that Google DeepMind first previewed in August.the company noted.With Project Genie, Google DeepMind is offering early access to this technology through a web-based prototype. Starting this week, the tool is being rolled out to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US aged 18 or older. The company said access will expand to more regions over time.Project Genie generates interactive environments in real time. As users move through a world, the system predicts and creates what comes next based on their actions. This differs from traditional 3D experiences, which are usually pre-built and static.The prototype is powered by Genie 3, along with Gemini and Nano Banana Pro, two other Google AI systems. Together, these models allow users to build, explore, and modify digital worlds rather than simply view them. Google DeepMind said this work is part of its broader effort to develop artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which would require AI systems that can operate across many different real-world situations.Project Genie focuses on three main features. The first is world creation, also described asUsers can use text prompts or upload images to create environments. Characters, environments, and modes of transportation, such as driving, flying, or walking can all be specified. Prior to entering the setting, users can also select viewing perspectives, such as first or third-person point of views.World exploration is the second feature. After a world is created, users are free to explore it. The system generates the environment in real time as users navigate, adjusting in response to movement and camera changes.The third feature is world remixing. Users can build on existing worlds by modifying prompts or exploring examples provided in a gallery. Finished experiences can be recorded and downloaded as videos.Google DeepMind reported that Project Genie remains an early research prototype and has several limitations. The worlds generated may not always align with the prompt, the physics may not be realistic, and the characters may be difficult to control. Each generated experience is limited to 60 seconds.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai has shared his views on the newly announced Project Genie AI tool.

""That's what OpenAI and others did very well.” The company “maybe” was “a little bit slow to commercialise it and scale it,”

Google DeepMind founder and CEO Demis Hassabis has credited ChatGPT maker OpenAI and other AI startups with scaling a technology initially developed by Google . In a recent podcast, Hassabis acknowledged that, although Google researchers developed transformer technology in 2017, which forms the base of almost all large language models (LLMs), the company was slow to commercialise and scale the innovation. He credited Sam Altman-led OpenAI and other competitors for using Google’s technology to scale their AI chatbots.In a recent episode of CNBC’s The Tech Download podcast, Hassabis said Google's challenge wasn't invention but execution. Referring to the technology’s commercialisation, he said,Hassabis added.Google merged its Brain research division with DeepMind in 2023 and appointed executive Josh Woodward to lead its Gemini AI assistant, enabling the company to catch up after OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Product failures with Google's AI products in 2024 further fuelled the impression that the company was struggling to compete.Hassabis noted.At the start of 2025, investors questioned whether Google could keep pace with OpenAI in AI. By year-end, Alphabet’s stock delivered its best performance since 2009. Google regained its strength in AI. Much of that came from DeepMind, the UK-based company Google bought in 2014 for around £400 million (almost $550 million).Hassabis called itof Google's AI work, saying that changes had been made to help the tech company quickly launch AI products in aHe noted that he talks to Google CEO Sundar Pichai showing how closely the two leaders are working to move fast on innovation.Hassabis said in the podcast.he continued.This could be important for Google as it faces another year of competition from OpenAI and many other companies, including Amazon, Perplexity, and Anthropic.Hassabis noted.

How ‘friendship’ with Sam Altman is one of the biggest reasons behind Microsoft's $360 billion crash in one day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-friendship-with-sam-altman-cost-microsoft-360-billion-in-a-day/articleshow/127801014.cms,"Microsoft's $360 billion single-day crash exposed the catastrophic cost of its OpenAI alliance. After investing $13 billion in Sam Altman's money-losing venture, Microsoft has tied 45% of its cloud contracts to a partner burning cash with no path to profitability. Circular financing schemes and exploding AI spending finally triggered Wall Street's reckoning.

The circular money machine that created a $750 billion illusion

Altman's trillion-dollar fantasy is bankrupting Microsoft's future

Altman's contract trapped Microsoft with no exit strategy

The reckoning Wall Street finally delivered

Microsoft lost $360 billion in market value on January 28. That's the second-largest single-day wipeout in US stock market history. The only bigger crash? Nvidia's DeepSeek meltdown last year, which also traced back to AI delusion.The culprit this time is Sam Altman and his money-incinerating machine called OpenAI . Microsoft's stock plunged 10% after earnings exposed a reality investors can no longer ignore: the software giant has handcuffed itself to a partner that lost over $8 billion last year, burns $15 million daily on video generation alone, and has no credible path to profitability.The most alarming number from Microsoft’s Q1 26’s earnings call? OpenAI now represents 45% of Microsoft's $625 billion in future cloud contracts. Microsoft has effectively bet half its cloud business on a company whose CEO just declared ""code red"" because ChatGPT's user growth has stalled and Google is eating its lunch.Wall Street finally asked the obvious question: what happens when the music stops?OpenAI's entire business model is financial theatre. The company operates on circular deals that create the appearance of growth while generating zero real economic value.Here's how the con works: Microsoft has invested $13 billion in OpenAI since 2019. OpenAI promptly funnelled most of those billions right back to Microsoft as payment for Azure cloud computing. Both companies book revenue. Both companies tell investors they're winning. Neither has created a sustainable business.The scheme extends across Silicon Valley. Nvidia announced plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI. OpenAI will spend that money buying Nvidia's GPUs. CoreWeave signed deals worth $22 billion to provide OpenAI with computing power, then received $350 million in OpenAI stock that could theoretically pay for those services. SoftBank led a $40 billion investment in OpenAI, then committed $100 billion to build data centres that OpenAI will rent.Oracle struck the most absurd deal: $300 billion to construct data centres for OpenAI, which OpenAI will then pay roughly $300 billion to use over several years. It's the same money, moving in a circle. Oracle's stock has since crashed 45% from its September peak, wiping out over $360 billion in value as investors realised they'd been sold a Ponzi scheme with better branding.The arrangement is famously called ""circular financing."" Former asset manager George Noble called it what it is: ""a cash incinerator."" These aren't investments. They're companies trading Monopoly money while pretending the game will never end.Sam Altman has committed OpenAI to spending $1.4 trillion on AI infrastructure by 2033. That number isn't a typo. It's more than the market value of Amazon. It's twice the annual budget of the U.S. military. And it's predicated on the fantasy that ChatGPT will somehow evolve into a world-changing technology that prints money faster than OpenAI can burn it.Microsoft is now trapped financing Altman's delusion. The company's capital expenditures exploded to $37.5 billion last quarter, up 66% year-over-year. That was $1 billion higher than analysts expected and $3 billion higher than the previous quarter. Microsoft is now spending money at a rate that would make a defence contractor blush.Two-thirds of that spending went to GPUs and short-lived AI infrastructure that depreciates faster than a new car. CFO Amy Hood tried to spin this as strategic allocation. The reality is uglier: Microsoft is sacrificing its profitable cloud business to prop up Sam Altman's gambling habit.Azure cloud growth slumped to 39%, down from 40% the previous quarter and below Wall Street's 39.4% forecast. Hood admitted Microsoft is deliberately throttling Azure capacity for paying customers so it can divert computing power to internal AI products like Copilot and GitHub Copilot.Let that sink in. Microsoft is turning away revenue from Fortune 500 companies who want to pay for cloud services so it can give free computing power to AI products that users largely ignore.Microsoft 365 Copilot has 15 million paid seats. That sounds impressive until you remember Microsoft has 450 million total M365 commercial seats. Adoption is barely 3%. UBS analysts publicly questioned whether Copilot is worth the investment, noting that ""M365 revenue growth is not accelerating due to Copilot"" and ""many checks on Copilot don't suggest a strong usage ramp.""Meanwhile, OpenAI's competitive position is collapsing. Google's Gemini models now match or exceed ChatGPT's capabilities while running on more efficient infrastructure. ChatGPT's user growth has flatlined in Europe. China's DeepSeek built a competitive model for a fraction of the cost, proving the AI industry's spending is grotesquely wasteful.Deutsche Bank analyst Jim Reid estimates OpenAI will lose $140 billion between 2024 and 2029. He wrote: ""No start-up in history has operated with expected losses on anything approaching this scale. We are firmly in uncharted territory.""Financial expert Sebastian Mallaby predicts OpenAI could run out of money within 18 months. One venture capital investor told The Economist: ""This is the WeWork story on steroids.""The worst part? Microsoft can't escape without catastrophic damage.The company's contract with OpenAI includes a clause that restricts Microsoft from developing its own AGI until 2030. That means if OpenAI collapses tomorrow, Microsoft has legally blocked itself from building a replacement for three and a half years. It's the corporate equivalent of signing a prenup that requires you to stay single if your spouse leaves you.Those $625 billion in cloud commitments don't vanish if OpenAI implodes. Microsoft would be stuck with massive data centres built for a customer that no longer exists, financed by debt that still needs repaying. Oracle is already experiencing this nightmare, having raised tens of billions in bonds to build infrastructure for OpenAI while watching its credit risk gauge hit levels not seen since 2009.Microsoft has also spent three years publicly positioning itself as the indispensable partner in OpenAI's success. CEO Satya Nadella appears on stage with Sam Altman. Press releases trumpet their collaboration. The brand association is complete.Ditching OpenAI now would mean admitting to shareholders that Microsoft wasted $13 billion and countless strategic opportunities chasing a mirage. The reputational damage would be severe. The financial damage might be worse.Nadella himself has expressed skepticism about AGI, calling it ""nonsensical benchmark hacking"" on a podcast. Yet his company has structured its entire AI strategy around achieving exactly that. It's a contradiction that investors can no longer ignore.Bank of America analysts noted that Microsoft's dependence on OpenAI creates ""concentration risk"" at a time when the partner's financial health is deteriorating. Barclays analysts said Microsoft has entered ""a winners and losers phase"" in AI, where the market will punish companies tied to failing business models.January 28's $360 billion crash wasn't irrational panic. It was the market finally doing basic arithmetic.Investors looked at Microsoft spending $37.5 billion per quarter on AI infrastructure. They looked at OpenAI losing $12 billion per quarter with no revenue growth. They looked at circular financing deals that shuffle money without creating value. They looked at Azure growth slowing while capital expenditures explode.And they sold.Business professor Erik Gordon warned that when the AI bubble bursts, ""the suffering will be more painful than the aftermath of the dot-com bubble."" He's right. The dot-com bubble involved companies with maybe a few billion in market cap built on hype. Microsoft is a $3.2 trillion company that just lost 10% of its value in a single day because it tied itself to Sam Altman's sinking ship.The contagion is already spreading. Software stocks crashed across the board January 28. ServiceNow fell 9.9%. Salesforce dropped 6.1%. Atlassian declined at least 6%. The market is repricing every company exposed to AI speculation.Microsoft spent decades building credibility as a stable, profitable enterprise that delivers consistent shareholder returns. Sam Altman has torched that reputation in less than three years with circular deals, imaginary revenue, and a $1.4 trillion spending plan that assumes AI will magically become profitable before reality intervenes.January 28 was Microsoft's bill coming due. And Sam Altman is nowhere to be found to help pay it.","Microsoft's $360 billion single-day crash exposed the catastrophic cost of its OpenAI alliance.

Google founder Larry Page has long argued that companies should aim for breakthroughs rather than small improvements, a view he described as “10x” philosophy. During a 2013 TED interview, Page was asked to explain the philosophy that he lives by. “You don't want to go into a small, measurable arena of progress,” the interview said. Larry Page then replied saying “I see this as an economic concept of additionality, which means they are doing something that wouldn't happen unless you're actually doing it.” “I think the more you can do things like that, the bigger impact you have,” he explained, further adding “that's about doing things people might not think are possible.”During the interview, Page said he believes businesses should aim to build products that are ten times better than what already exists. He explained that small efficiency gains or code tweaks rarely lead to large outcomes. According to Page, real impact comes from rethinking problems from the ground up and exploring what technology can make possible.“The more you learn about technology, the more you learn what's possible,” he continued, saying “I just try to focus on – what is that future really gonna be? And how do we create it?” During the interview, Larry Page further explained what additionality really mean for him.“Looking at things people might not think about working on things that no one else is working on…. that's where the additionality really is.”Larry Page’s 10x approach influenced several major Google products. In his previous interviews, he has cited examples such as Gmail launching with far more storage than competing email services, Google Translate expanding across many languages, and efforts to digitise books at a global scale.The philosophy, as per reports, also led to the creation of Google X, a research division set up to work on long-term projects such as self-driving cars and advanced artificial intelligence systems.

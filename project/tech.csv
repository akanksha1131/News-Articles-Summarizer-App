Adani Group trashes charges

US prosecutors have indicted Gautam Adani and his nephew, Sagar Adani, among others, for their alleged involvement in a $265 million (Rs 2,000 crore) bribery case to secure solar power supply contracts in India. According to court records cited by Reuters, arrest warrants have been issued in the US for Gautam and Sagar Adani, with prosecutors planning to hand these warrants to foreign law enforcement. Early Wednesday, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged Adanis, former Adani Green CEO Vneet Jaain, and executives from Azure Power and Canadian pension fund CDPQ under the Foreign Corruption Prevention Act (FCPA).Separately, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Gautam and Sagar Adani with raising funds from US investors through “false and misleading statements.” The SEC alleges they were directly involved in bribing Indian officials to secure contracts benefiting Adani Green.This account of how the alleged scheme unfolded is reportedly drawn from federal prosecutors' 54-page criminal indictment of Adani and seven of his associates and two parallel civil SEC complaints. These extensively cite electronic messages between the scheme's alleged participants. A Reuters report also claims that SEC has quoted WhatsApp chat of Sagar Adani and the Azure CEO in the case.Sagar Adani and the Azure CEO reportedly discussed the delays in the Solar power project and hinted at bribes on the encrypted messaging application WhatsApp, according to the SEC.What are the WhatsApp messages being quotedWhen the Azure CEO wrote on November 24, 2020, that the local power companies ""are being motivated,""reportedly dealt with the states of Jammu and Kashmir as well as Chhattisgarh as potential purchasers of green power.As per Reuters report, during a visit to the United States on March 17, 2023, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents seized Sagar Adani's electronic devices. The agents reportedly handed him a search warrant from a judge indicating that the US government was investigating potential violations of fraud statutes and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.Adani Group has trashed the charges, calling them ""baseless"" and that it would seek ""all possible legal recourse.""","US prosecutors have indicted Gautam Adani and his nephew, Sagar Adani, for their alleged involvement in a $265 million (Rs 2,000 crore) bribery case to secure solar power supply contracts in India.

How robbers tricked SBI ATM machine

How the 'ATM scam' was detected

Two unidentified men have reportedly been accused of stealing Rs 2.52 lakh from an SBI ATM in Fort, Thiruvananthapuram, by manipulating the cash delivery system. The Fort police have registered a case under IPC Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) and are investigating the matter.The fraud, which occurred between June 2022 and July 2023, involved the suspects using multiple stolen or lost ATM cards to withdraw money from the SBI ATM on Padmavilasam Road. They employed a clever technique: after withdrawing cash, they would leave a single note in the machine's cash delivery compartment. This trickery led the ATM to register the transaction as incomplete and display a Timeout Error, preventing the amount from being deducted from the account holders' balances.This meant that no report was made of ATM fraud, as money was not deducted from any bank customer's account. But there was a mismatch in the money deposited in the ATM machine and the amounts withdrawn from customers accounts.The scam was detected when discrepancies were found between the total cash deposited in the ATM and the amounts withdrawn. A bank committee initially investigated the irregularities but couldn't pinpoint the cause. Not being able to find any proof as well as lead, the committee even suspected bank staff.However, a breakthrough came when the investigation team reviewed CCTV footage, identifying the suspects and their use of multiple stolen cards. They observed the suspects frequently visiting the machine and identified that they had used various stolen or lost ATM cards. Subsequently, SBI officials filed a report with the Fort police and gave VVTV captured photos of the suspects.","Two unidentified men have reportedly been accused of stealing Rs 2.52 lakh from an SBI ATM in Fort, Thiruvananthapuram, by manipulating the cash delivery system.

Facebook-parent Meta has taken down over two million accounts connected to scam centres across Southeast Asia and the Middle East this year.

Once the scammers have extracted as much money as possible, they typically disappear, leaving the victim with significant financial losses.Meta announced that it is actively fighting organised crime rings in Southeast Asia that force people to work as online scammers.

Tesla CEO’s growing global influence

Tesla CEO Elon Musk joined in a call between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and US President elect Donald Trump , reports The Information. The call took place shortly after Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the November 5 presidential election. It is not yet known what else was discussed on the phone call, apart from the congratulatory message. Musk reportedly listened in as Pichai congratulated and spoke with Trump.This isn’t the first time that reports of a conversation between Trump and Google’s CEO have surfaced online. During his election campaigns, Trump mentioned twice about calling Pichai.In an interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait last month, Trump said that he called Google CEO Sundar Pichai to highlight alleged biases in Google search, claiming it only shows negative stories about him. He then said “I called the head of Google the other day and I said, ‘I’m getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don’t find them in Google’,” he said. Pichai, Trump said in the interview, told him that “you’re the No. 1 person on all of Google for stories”.Also read: Donald Trump: I called Google CEO Sundar Pichai the other day and said ... In October again, Trump claimed that Pichai called him to convey accolades on his visit to McDonald’s. During an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, he said “I actually got a call from Sundar...the head of Google and he said, sir, I just want to tell you what you did with McDonald's was one of the single biggest events we've ever had at Google”.Elon Musk, who has been a vocal supporter of Trump in the US elections, has reportedly spent close to $130m to help get the former president re-elected. He was recently appointed as co-chair of the newly formed “Department of Government Efficiency” alongside Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies - Essential to the 'Save America' Movement,” Trump said.The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has previously participated in calls with global leaders and has offered advice on personnel decisions, both privately and publicly, through X—the social media platform he acquired in 2022. He has briefly joined a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as listened during a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Additionally, Musk has been seen frequently at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, taking part in sensitive discussions.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk joined in a call between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and US President elect Donald Trump.

What Apple has to say

Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users. We disagree with the findings in the report regarding Safari, WebKit, and in-app browsing on iOS. We are concerned that the interventions discussed in the report for future consideration under the Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Act would undermine user privacy and security and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart. We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.

The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has provisionally found that Apple's policies are hindering innovation in mobile web browsers. The regulator also targeted Google’s $20 billion search deal with Apple in keeping the revenues flowing for the companies.The CMA's inquiry group specifically criticised Apple's requirement that all iOS browsers use its WebKit engine, which limits the functionality and differentiation of competing browsers.“The group has provisionally found that Apple’s rules restrict other competitors from being able to deliver new, innovative features that could benefit consumers. Other browser providers have highlighted concerns that they have been unable to offer a full range of browser features, such as faster webpage loading on iPhone. Many smaller UK app developers also told us that they would like to use progressive web apps – an alternative way for businesses to provide apps to mobile users without downloading apps through an app store – but this technology is not able to fully take off on iOS devices,” the CMA said.The CMA's report also highlights a revenue-sharing agreement between Apple and Google, suggesting that the arrangement reduces their incentive to compete with each other.“In addition, the group has provisionally found that a revenue-sharing agreement between Google and Apple significantly reduces their financial incentives to compete in mobile browsers on iOS,” it added.The CMA launched its investigation into Apple and Google's mobile dominance in 2021, focusing on app store practices, browsers and cloud gaming. While the CMA has dropped the cloud gaming aspect of its probe due to recent changes by Apple, it maintains concerns about Apple's browser policies.“The CMA is inviting comments on its provisional findings by December 13 and expects to make a final decision in March 2025,” it added.An Apple spokesperson said that it disagrees with the findings, as per a report by TechCrunch.",The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has provisionally found that Apple's policies are hindering innovation in mobile web browsers.

“Not even able to book a cab”

Telecom company confirms Vaageesan’s complaint

Student raised the issue on social media first

A seemingly harmless scene in the Tamil film Amaran , where lead actor Sai Pallavi casually displays a paper with a phone number, has caused unexpected turmoil for engineering student VV Vaageesan. The student claims the number shown in the film belongs to him, leading to significant disruption in his life. Vaageesan has now filed a ₹1.1 crore lawsuit against the filmmakers, seeking compensation for the ""untold hardships and mental agony"" caused by the incident.In the movie Sai Pallavi who plays the role of Indu Rebecca Verghese tosses a crumpled piece of paper with a mobile number written on it at the lead actor Sivakarthikeyan who is playing the role of Major Mukund Varadarajan.The number turned out to be that of Vageesan.To add to Vageesan's misery someone saved the number on Truecaller as “Vaageesan Indu Rebbbica VV”. Truecaller is a caller identification app. One can manually add a contact in the Truecaller app. To save a number in Truecaller, you can open the app, enter the phone number, and then manually add the contact details like name, profile picture, etc., through the ""Add contact"" option. It appears that a fan of 'Indu Rebecca Verghese' did the same. And since mobile numbers may be already linked to Vaageesan's name in Truecaller's database, the new name that users see linked to this mobile number on the app is: “Vaageesan Indu Rebbbica VV”.This further encouraged users to call him. Vageesan told The Hindu, which was first to carry the report, that he has been bombarded with calls from both Sai Pallavi fans as well as those trying to reach Indu Rebecca Verghese, wife of Major Mukund.Narrating his agony “Since the calls keep coming, I have to switch my phone to silent mode. I am worried that I may miss an emergency call or an important message from family members or friends. I have been using this number for two years — it is linked to my bank accounts and given to many of my contacts. I can’t afford to give it up,” he says. ""I am unable to even book a cab and call/receive the driver due to continuous incoming calls,"" he added.A telecom company confirmed to the publication that the spam issue was flagged by Vaageesan to the customer care/ A senior official said that the company is in the process of responding to the complaint. He did not give any further details on the complaint.The student claims that he initially sought to resolve the issue informally, tagging director Rajkumar Periyasamy and actor Sivakarthikeyan on social media to request their intervention. He, however, got no response forcing him to take legal recourse. His legal notice demands the removal of his number from the movie and compensation for the ""untold hardships and mental agony"" caused. The filmmakers, including the director and producers, are reportedly yet to respond to the legal notice.",Student raised the issue on social media first.

In an unexpected move that sent ripples through social media, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal recently posted a job advertisement that required applicants to donate Rs 20 lakh to Feeding India and work for a year without a salary. The unconventional job listing drew widespread criticism and sparked discussions across various platforms, with entrepreneurs and users weighing in on the matter. Among the responses, Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal stood out with a humorous LinkedIn post, further fueling the debate. Goyal later clarified his intentions, but not before the controversy had captured widespread attention, highlighting contrasting opinions on leadership, privilege, and hiring practices.Deepinder Goyal’s job listing, aimed at hiring a Chief of Staff, raised eyebrows when it mentioned that applicants were expected to contribute Rs 20 lakh to the Feeding India initiative and accept no salary for a year. The ad, perceived by many as elitist and exclusionary, quickly went viral, leading to a wave of criticism and ridicule.Responding to the backlash, Goyal explained on X (formerly Twitter) that the Rs 20 lakh condition was never intended to be a mandatory requirement. He stated, ""This wasn’t just another hiring post. The ‘you have to pay us 20 lacs’ was merely a filter to identify people who could see the opportunity beyond the constraints."" According to Goyal, the unconventional strategy was aimed at attracting individuals with an entrepreneurial mindset and an ability to think outside the box.Entrepreneur and Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal took a light-hearted jab at the situation with a humorous LinkedIn post. In it, he invited applicants who couldn’t afford the Rs 20 lakh donation to apply for his Chief of Staff role instead. Mittal wrote, “All those who can't afford to pay my friend Deepi 20 lacs, please send me your application. I am looking for a Chief of Staff too, although I don't know exactly what one does.”The post, sprinkled with humour and emojis, quickly went viral, garnering mixed reactions. While some appreciated Mittal’s witty commentary, others accused him of seeking attention at the expense of the controversy. Writer Surabhi Chauhan remarked, “This is gonna sting Deepinder so hard,” to which Mittal replied, “He’s a big boy with a great sense of humour ... can handle it.”Social media users had polarising opinions on both Goyal’s job ad and Mittal’s response. While some applauded Mittal for his humour, others criticised him for jumping on the controversy bandwagon. One commenter accused him of using ""cheap tactics"" to grab attention, while another suggested his post was a product of AI tools like ChatGPT.Amid the backlash, Goyal revealed that his job posting had received over 18,000 applications despite the controversy. He expressed confidence in the approach, suggesting it served as a filter to identify high-potential candidates.",Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal recently posted a job advertisement that required applicants to donate Rs 20 lakh to Feeding India and work for a year without a salary.

India to expand its electronics manufacturing to $500 billion

The Indian government plans to offer up to $5 billion in incentives to domestic electronics manufacturing , reports Reuters quoting two unnamed government officials. The incentive will be given to produce components for devices ranging from mobile phones to laptops. This initiative aims to strengthen the country’s growing electronics industry while reducing reliance on imports from China .The report quotes two officials who said “The new scheme will incentivise production of key components like printed circuit boards that will improve domestic value addition and deepen local supply chains for a range of electronics”.The government is reportedly planning to offer these incentives under a new scheme which it may announce in the next two to three months. The officials, asked not to be identified, said that details of the scheme are not yet public.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has designed the scheme. The ministry has reportedly identified components eligible for incentives and is in its final stages. As per the report, the finance ministry is likely to approve the moves.India's electronics production has surged over the past six years, reaching $115 billion in 2024, driven largely by mobile manufacturing growth from global giants like Apple and Samsung. The country has also become the fourth-largest supplier of smartphones globally. As per the government's top policy think tank Niti Aayog , India is aiming to expand its electronics manufacturing to $500 billion by the fiscal year 2030, including production of components worth $150 billion.However, the industry has drawn criticism for its significant dependence on imported components, particularly from China. Commenting on the development, Pankaj Mohindroo, head of India's Cellular and Electronics Association, said “This scheme is coming at a time when it is critical to promote component manufacturing that will help us aim for a global-scale of electronics production”.",The Indian government plans to offer up to $5 billion in incentives to domestic electronics manufacturing.

US Jobs: Top 10 companies sponsoring H-1B visas in 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-jobs-top-10-companies-sponsoring-h-1b-visas-in-2024/articleshow/115562331.cms,"H1B Visa

Here are the top 10 companies that have sponsored the most H-1B visas in 2024 as per USCIS.

Amazon Com Services LLC: 9,265 approvals



Infosys Limited: 8,140 approvals



Cognizant Technology Solutions: 6,321 approvals



Google LLC: 5,364 approvals



Tata Consultancy Services Limited: 5,274 approvals



Meta Platforms Inc: 4,844 approvals



Microsoft Corporation: 4,725 approvals



Apple Inc: 3,873 approvals



HCL America Inc: 2,953 approvals



IBM Corporation: 2,906 approvals



A recent analysis of data from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has revealed a significant decrease in H-1B visa sponsorships by leading US companies in 2024. Despite Indians continuing to dominate the pool of H-1B visa holders, the overall trend indicates a decline in H-1B sponsorships across major tech firms.The H-1B visa program, which allows US companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, has been a crucial pathway for skilled immigrants, particularly from India. However, the 2024 data suggests a shift in this trend, with companies opting for alternative strategies or focusing on domestic talent.According to USCIS, Amazon and Indian IT services firms Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), have significantly reduced their sponsorship of H-1B visas in 2024. USCIS data for the fiscal year 2024 (October 1 to September 30) indicates a significant decline in H-1B visa approvals for nearly all of the top 15 sponsoring companies.Although Amazon remains the largest sponsor, its approvals decreased from over 11,000 in 2023 to just above 7,000 in 2024. Indian tech giants Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, both with substantial US operations, also saw considerable drops.","USCIS data for the fiscal year 2024 (October 1 to September 30) indicates a significant decline in H-1B visa approvals for nearly all of the top 15 sponsoring companies.

Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) looking for a chief of staff role for his company. The job, however, had an expensive twist where candidates must pay a fee of Rs 20 lakh to Zomato and work without pay for a year. The post soon got viral on the internet, generating waves of criticism. Amidst this, a former Zomato employee shared insights about his experience working with Goyal.Arnav Gupta, who worked with Zomato for a year, said that the chance to work with Goyal “is worth waaaay more than Rs 20”.Replying to Goyal’s post, he said “I know people are commenting various stupid things about ""paid internship"". Leaving this note here as someone who got the chance to work 1 year with @deepigoyal, if you're looking for a career in Management Consulting / Strategy, this is worth waaaay more than ₹20L!When a user asked “Why he has to pay?”, Gupta replied “If you ask this question, then it is not for you. Btw, there is no MBA in India with fees less than 20L. Including IIMs”.In another post, a user slammed Zomato CEO for demanding Rs 20 lakh. He said “create urgency, people start stacking up money from relatives and friends and go beyond to arrange it!! update 3: haha f*** you, if you have the money you're out.”Gupta replied saying “The application had 24 hr deadline. The 20L money didn’t have 24hr deadline. So if you can’t prioritise between these two things “first get selected then figure the money”, then you’re not qualified for that role. As simple as that.”Stating that his posting received more than 18,000 applications, Goyal said that the Rs 20 lakh fee requirement was merely a screening tool that won't actually be implemented.""We have closed applications for my chief of staff role. We have received more than 18,000 applications,"" Goyal posted on X. He added that the company will review applications over the next week to find candidates who align with their vision of building a ""learning organisation.""","Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal recently posted on X looking for a chief of staff role.

The company plans to announce these changes as part of iOS 19 and macOS 16 software updates, codenamed Luck and Cheer, Bloomberg reports.This builds upon the enhanced Siri coming with iOS 18 as a part of Apple Intelligence, which features a new glowing interface, richer language understanding, onscreen awareness, and the ability to perform actions across apps while allowing users to search through emails, notes, and documents privately. The 2026 version will further advance these capabilities, using Apple-built AI models to provide ChatGPT-like interactions while expanding its ability to control third-party apps through App Intents.In the meantime, Apple will introduce ChatGPT integration into Apple Intelligence next month, with plans to add other chatbot options like Google's Gemini in the future.

Engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily, such as brisk walking, jogging, or yoga, to improve heart health.

Prioritize whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats like those in nuts and olive oil. Limit processed foods, sugar, and trans fats.

Excess weight strains the heart. Aim for a balanced diet and regular exercise to keep your BMI within a healthy range.

Regularly check your blood pressure and cholesterol levels, as high levels can increase the risk of cardiac problems.

Practice stress-reduction techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or hobbies to lower cortisol levels, which can harm the heart over time.

Smoking damages blood vessels and increases heart disease risk. Alcohol, when consumed excessively, can also strain the heart.

Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night. Poor sleep patterns can increase the risk of hypertension and heart disease.

Drinking enough water helps maintain healthy blood flow and prevents dehydration, which can affect heart function.

Diabetes is a ticking time bomb for India. We have the largest number of people with diabetes in the world.

There was a time when people used to call diabetes a rich person's disease. But that's no longer the case. According to a recent study, 21 crore Indians are living with diabetes.

The scary part is the rate at which it's affecting young Indians. If you're a 20-year-old woman living in a city today, you have a 64.6% chance of developing diabetes during your lifetime. If you're a young man, your risk is also quite high at 55.5%.

But the sad part is there's a lack of awareness among people. About 27.5% of people with diabetes don't even know they have it. Even if they do know, very few people get treatment.

What makes this a serious crisis is that less than 20% of Indians have health insurance. Most Indians end up spending out of their pocket, which is a huge burden for poor and low-income households.

There's no magic bullet to solve this issue. We need multiple approaches, from public awareness campaigns, insurance coverage for the poor and vulnerable, to introducing early detection programs.

Simple lifestyle changes, like adding a few extra minutes of exercise each day or reducing time spent sitting, can make a big difference. Even small changes, such as walking or cycling for an extra five minutes a day, can lower the risk of diabetes.

We've been supporting founders and startups that are working on helping Indians become healthier, but this is a systemic challenge that needs all people involved—from individuals to the government—to take action.

Why and how Google ‘break up order’ is also $20 billion-plus ‘loss’ for Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-and-how-google-break-up-order-is-also-20-billion-plus-loss-for-apple/articleshow/115540555.cms,"Google paid $20 billion to Apple in 2022

What Apple said about Google Search

The US Justice Department 's recent antitrust lawsuit against Google has sparked concerns over the potential consequences of its proposed remedies. The Department of Justice (DoJ) recommended, among multiple other measures, that the tech giant sells Chrome and cuts an exclusive search deal with Apple.This means that Google will be prevented from paying billions to Apple to maintain its default search position on iPhones.In May, a report by Bloomberg said that Google’s parent company Alphabet paid $20 billion to Apple in 2022 to be the default search engine on Safari, Apple’s web browser. The sum Google paid to Apple in 2021 was around $15 billion.Court documents from the US Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against Google revealed the staggering sums the tech giant pays Apple to remain the default search engine on its devices. While Apple does provide users with the option to switch to alternative search engines like Bing or DuckDuckGo, Google remains the pre-selected default in Safari across iPhones, iPads, and Macs.This default setting grants Google access to billions of Apple users, giving it a significant advantage in the search market. The Justice Department's antitrust case centres on the argument that Google's agreement with Apple has helped it create an unfair monopoly in the online search business.During the testimony in the case, Eddy Cue, the senior vice president of services at Apple, told the court that the company went with Google because there was not a better choice at the time. He added that they have “always thought it [Google] was the best”.Interestingly, reports indicate that Apple explored alternatives to Google, engaging in discussions with Microsoft and DuckDuckGo about potentially using their search engines on Apple devices. Apple even contemplated acquiring Microsoft's Bing search engine but ultimately opted to maintain its partnership with Google.","Google paid $20 billion to Apple in 2022 to be the default search engine on Safari, Apple’s web browser.

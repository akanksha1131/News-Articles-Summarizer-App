Netflix received a wave of complaints from its users as the platform experienced a sudden outage during the premiere of the finale of much-awaited show Stranger Things. Due to the outage, thousands of Netflix subscribers were not able to stream the show which lead to a flood of posts across social media.According to a report by outrage tracking website DownDetector, a sharp spike in the outage alerts started shortly after the episode dropped. Users reported that they were facing issues with logging in and complete service failure. As per DownDetector, 55% users complained of video streaming issues, 36% faced server connection issues and 9% were not able to login.Many users also posted about the outage on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Hashtags such as #NetflixDown and #StrangerThings quickly started trending after the outage. “I waited damn near 3 years for stranger things season 5 and you mean to tell me Netflix is DOWN ??!,” wrote a user on X.“Well the Netflix servers are down....This was expected with the FINAL season of Stranger Things,” said another user.Many users also shared the screenshots of error messages, while others joked that the “Upside Down” had taken over Netflix itself.The timing of the outage was particularly damaging given the cultural weight of the Stranger Things finale, which marks the conclusion of one of Netflix’s most successful franchises.

And the cost of home charging is one-tenth of petrol prices.”

Tesla’s journey of entering the Indian market







Tesla's India General Manager, Sharad Agarwal, has claimed that Indian customers can save nearly $22,000 (about Rs 20 lakhs) over four to five years, accounting for Tesla's lower operating costs. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Agarwal explained that the low cost of maintenance and electricity, compared to petrol prices, will help Indian buyers recoup about one-third of the $67,000 (about Rs 60 lakh) price tag for the Model Y over that period. This announcement comes after the Elon Musk-led electric car maker opened its biggest sales and service centre in the country in Gurugram.In a statement to Reuters, Agarwal said:Agarwal, who joined Tesla earlier in November, served earlier as the head of Lamborghini in India.Tesla entered the Indian market in July with the imported Model Y. Due to India's 100% import tariff, the car is priced significantly higher than in other major markets. Since deliveries began in September, Tesla has sold just over 100 Model Y units, according to Indian government data.Currently, Tesla is targeting a niche electric vehicle (EV) market in India, which represents about 5% of overall car sales in the world's third-largest car market, the Reuters report noted. Meanwhile, analysts claim that most cars sold in India by other brands are priced below $22,000 (nearly Rs 20 lakhs).In the Indian market, Tesla competes with local companies like Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors, as well as global players such as SAIC Motor’s India division and Vietnamese EV maker VinFast Auto.The company is also slowly expanding its supercharger network in India, starting with Mumbai, Delhi, and Gurugram.","Tesla's India General Manager, Sharad Agarwal, has claimed that Indian customers can save nearly $22,000 (about Rs 20 lakhs) over four to five years.

“let them deal with Nvidia but not in terms of the most advanced”





Chinese regulators have reportedly banned TikTok-owner ByteDance from using Nvidia chips in new data centres. A report by The Information (seen by Reuters) cited ByteDance employees to make this claim. This reported ban highlights Beijing's effort to reduce its reliance on US technology, a push that has grown as Washington tightens restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductors to China. The move is significant because ByteDance was reportedly Nvidia's largest customer in China in 2025, purchasing more chips than any other local firm. The company had been racing to secure computing power for its large user base amid concerns that the U.S. might curb supply. In August, Chinese regulators had asked local firms to stop placing new orders for Nvidia AI chips and have since urged companies to adopt processors developed within China.In a statement to Reuters, a Nvidia spokesperson said:Earlier this month, Reuters reported that the Chinese government has issued guidance requiring new data centre projects that receive any state funding to use only domestically made artificial intelligence chips.This comes as China is speeding up its efforts to build an alternative AI ecosystem and become more self-reliant in chip production, even as trade tensions with Washington remain in a delicate pause.Meanwhile, Washington has restricted the sale of Nvidia’s most advanced chips to China, allowing only scaled-down versions such as the H20. Nvidia also released a China-specific chip, the RTX6000D, but demand has been limited, with some major tech companies choosing not to place orders.After speaking with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month, US President Donald Trump said that Washington willchips."," ByteDance was reportedly Nvidia's largest customer in China in 2025, purchasing more chips than any other local firm.

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has again issued a warning about the future of artificial intelligence (AI), saying that superintelligence can be humanity's greatest breakthrough, but only if it prioritises human interests above all else. “Superintelligence could be the best invention ever – but only if it puts the interests of humans above everything else,” Suleyman wrote on X, framing the challenge facing AI researchers as they race toward increasingly powerful systems.Suleyman’s latest warning comes days after he spoke on an episode of the Silicon Valley Girl Podcast, urging researchers to treat artificial superintelligence (ASI), which is nothing but an AI with reasoning capabilities far exceeding human capacity, as an “anti-goal” rather than a development target.“It doesn't feel like a positive vision of the future. It would be very hard to contain something like that or align it to our values,” Suleyman said of ASI, citing the immense risks of controlling such technology.Suleyman also revealed his team is pursuing what he calls “humanist superintelligence” – advanced AI designed explicitly to support and prioritise human interests rather than operate as an independent superintelligent entity.Microsoft’s AI CEO also pushed back against speculation about AI consciousness. He warned researchers saying that simulation and genuine consciousness or granting AI systems moral status must be avoided.“These things don't suffer. They don't feel pain. They're just simulating high-quality conversation,” he explained. Earlier this month, Suleyman went further, advising developers to abandon research exploring AI consciousness altogether. He argued that consciousness remains an exclusively biological trait and that pursuing it in artificial systems is fundamentally misguided.“I don't think that is work that people should be doing. If you ask the wrong question, you end up with the wrong answer. I think it's totally the wrong question,” Suleyman stated.","Mustafa Suleyman says superintelligence can be humanity's greatest breakthrough, but only if it prioritises human interests above all else.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment.The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.","OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities.

John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

What the Australian government has to say





Two Australian teenagers have launched a constitutional challenge against the social media ban for under-16s, filing their case in the High Court of Australia, which is the nation's highest court, just two weeks before the law takes effect. Noah Jones and Macy Neyland, both 15, are serving as plaintiffs in proceedings initiated by the Digital Freedom Project at the court. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the campaign group filed the challenge on Wednesday (November 26), seeking to block legislation.The law will force social media platforms, including YouTube , TikTok, Snapchat, and Meta-owned Facebook as well as Instagram to deactivate more than one million accounts held by Australian teenagers when the ban begins December 10.The Digital Freedom Project argues the ban violates young Australians' freedom of political communication—an implied constitutional right in a country without express free speech protections. “The legislation is grossly excessive,” the group was quoted as saying. It also claimed that it “robs” minors of fundamental rights.Neyland said that the law would silence youth voices on critical issues.“Young people like me are the voters of tomorrow... we shouldn't be silenced.It's like Orwell's book 1984, and that scares me,” she said.Communications Minister Anika Wells dismissed the legal challenge shortly after it was announced, telling Parliament that the government will not back down.“Despite the fact that we are receiving threats and legal challenges by people with ulterior motives, the Albanese Labor government remains steadfastly on the side of parents, and not of platforms,” Wells said.The teenagers aren't the only ones preparing legal action. Australian media reports indicate YouTube has also threatened a High Court challenge, arguing the ban unconstitutionally burdens political communication.The ban was passed into law in November 2024, and is said to represent one of the world’s most comprehensive attempts to regulate minors' social media access. Tech companies face steep penalties for non-compliance: up to A$49.5 million ($32.22 million) in fines.","Two Australian teenagers have launched a constitutional challenge against the social media ban for under-16s.

Why Larry Page is richer than Sergey Brin

Alphabet nearing $4 trillion market cap





Google-parent company Alphabet’s sudden rise in stock has triggered a major shakeup in the world’s richest rankings. Google co-founder Larry Page is now the second-richest person globally after leapfrogging Oracle co-founder and CTO, Larry Ellison. Notably, Google co-founder, Sergey Brin , has also moved up, overtaking Amazon’s Jeff Bezos , according to Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List. The surge in wealth saw Page’s net worth increase by $8.7 billion on Monday (November 24) even as investors are optimistic for Alphabet's Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud business.Page’s fortune is now estimated at $264.9 billion, moving him past Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison ($247.4 billion), whose net worth has declined following a steep drop in Oracle’s share price. Sergey Brin also climbed the list, passing Jeff Bezos ($241.5 billion) to become the world’s fourth-richest person with an estimated net worth of $245.6 billion.While Page and Brin co-founded Google and hold a combined 87.9% of Alphabet’s Class B (10-votes per share) stock, Page holds significantly more shares (389 million) than Brin (362.7 million). According to Forbes, the gap in equity is attributed to Brin’s philanthropic activity.According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Brin actively sold his stake and made donations of his Alphabet and Tesla stock to nonprofit groups and Parkinson's research. He donated $700 million earlier this year, and in 2023, he gave away $615 million and $600 million.This comes as Alphabet is nearing a $4 trillion market capitalisation, after breaching the $3 trillion threshold in September this year. A victory in the Google Chrome case, coupled with Google Gemini 3.0 and Nano Banana Pro AI image generation model boosted the company's valuation in the last three months.Moreover, the news about Meta in talks with Google to use its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for training AI models has also pushed its market cap by 250 billion in a day.","Larry Page is now the second-richest person globally after leapfrogging Oracle co-founder and CTO, Larry Ellison.

What White House said about the new deal with Taiwan



“Until announced by President Trump, reporting about potential trade deals is speculation.”

TSMC having a hard time finidng skilled workers in US



""Taiwan model.""

""It is very difficult for other countries to do this kind of work, because only we have this concept, practice, and track record of service parks, which allows us to undertake this kind of initiative in the United States.”





The US is reportedly negotiating a new trade arrangement with Taiwan. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, under this deal, the US is seeking Taiwan’s commitment to new investment and worker training in advanced sectors like semiconductor manufacturing. The report cited sources to claim that this deal would involve major Taiwanese companies, including the world’s largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, expanding their US operations, providing new capital, and offering training to American workers. This rumoured agreement is taking place while Taiwan seeks to reduce the current 20% tariff applied to its exports to the US. While semiconductors are currently exempt from these tariffs as the US works to build domestic capacity, the deal aims to provide broader tariff relief, the report claims.The arrangement is expected to include support for Washington to develop science park infrastructure, drawing on Taiwanese expertise. The report also notes that Taiwan's total investment is expected to be smaller than that of regional economic rivals such as South Korea and Japan, but the workforce training component is a newly reported part of the negotiations. The specifics of the deal and its closing timeline remain unclear as negotiations continue.In a statement to Reuters, White House spokesperson Kush Desai didn’t clearly deny the rumour and noted:However, US President Donald Trump has previously said that some skilled foreign workers may be needed to help train Americans in advanced factories as the country looks to increase domestic production.TSMC, which has yet to comment on the rumoured trade discussions, has faced challenges in finding suitable workers for its US projects.In January, TSMC CEO and Chairman CS Wei said that building the new factory in Arizona has taken at least twice as long as building one in Taiwan. He pointed to a lack of skilled workers and missing parts of the supply chain as reasons. TSMC had to bring half of the construction workers from Texas to Arizona, which raised costs because of moving expenses and housing, he noted.In a statement to Reuters, Taiwan's Office of Trade Negotiations said that its team was continuing to talk with the US about supply chain cooperation under aThis referred to the science parks that Taiwan started developing in the 1980s. This is where most of the country’s semiconductor manufacturing happens and create a complete supply chain for smooth production.Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Taiwan Premier Cho Jung-tai said the two sides are now exchanging documents to confirm certain details. He said:Last month, Taiwan Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun, who is leading talks to lower Trump's tariffs on Taiwanese exports, said she was hopeful both sides could agree on increasing investment in the US.While Taipei has been eager to show its commitment to Trump's request to increase US manufacturing, it has also said the most advanced semiconductor technologies and research will stay in Taiwan.Last week, Young Liu, chairman of Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Foxconn which is Nvidia's largest server maker and Apple’s biggest supplier, also said that the company was looking to work with the US and other countries to build science parks, adding that he hoped this could help trade negotiations.","The US is reportedly negotiating a new trade arrangement with Taiwan.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Disruption will come from the unexpected





Take lessons from the dot-com era









Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has now issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. As reported by Business Insider, speaking in the Pioneers of AI podcast, Cuban compared today’s AI arms race to the search engine boom of 1990s. The search engine boom ultimately ended with Google dominating the market and leaving all the rivals behind.“You’ve got five, six, whatever it is, companies that are trying to create the ultimate foundational model that we all depend on,” Cuban said. “It’s almost like in the ’90s when all the search engines were competing pre-Google… Now, we know with search engines it’s Google, and then there’s Bing, as, like, 1 or 2% and DuckDuckGo has got a half a percent. So it’s effectively a winner-take-all.”Like many other world leaders and analysts Cuban has also cautioned that the massive investments done on AI could ultimately lead to the creation of a bubble. “They may be overspending,” he said.“And if they overspend or get too caught up, the bubble is in the competition between all those models because that could pop just like that with any new technology.”Along with this, he also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI, majorly the massive and expensive data centers which are being built to power large models. “I just can’t imagine over a 10-year period that we aren’t going to improve the technology enough that if you overspend on today’s technology, it just doesn’t feel right to me,” Cuban added.Cuban also emphasised that the disruption AI will not come from incremental improvements but from something “incredible” that no one sees coming. “Somebody’s going to come up with some incredible shit, right? If I knew what it was, I’d do it,” he said, suggesting that the current race may be blindsided by a breakthrough outside the existing competition.Cuban said he recognizes the same mix of hype, excitement, and overspending now playing out in AI. “They anticipate for at least another decade spending every penny they have,” he said of the major model developers. “I mean, if that’s not ripe for disruption to come up with better ways, I don’t know what is.”","Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. He also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125591123,imgsize-1679628,width-400,resizemode-4/mark-cuban.jpg"

Users in the test group will see a “Your Custom Feed” option on their homepage.

They can enter prompts to adjust recommendations — for example, asking for more tech reviews, fewer gaming videos, or more educational content.

The system then updates the feed in real time, offering a more curated and relevant viewing experience.





YouTube is working on a new feature which is designed to give users more control over their home feed recommendations. The video streaming platform started experimenting with this feature after long-standing user complaints whichmentioned that the platform’s front page often feels cluttered and irrelevant. “YouTube product teams are constantly testing out new tools and features to help you find, watch, share and create content more easily. These test features (sometimes also called “betas” or “experiments”) are usually available for a short period of time and only for a small group of people,” said the company.According to Google’s official support forum, YouTube is rolling it a test called ‘Your Custom Feed’. The feature appears as a chip placed next to the standard home tab on the YouTube homepage. After clicking on the feature users will be able to update their recommendations using a simple prompt, which will customise their feed as per their interests.This experiment done by YouTube is aimed at solving one of YouTube’s biggest user frustrations which is messy and algorithm-driven home feed which often surface videos which are not related to the preference of the user.With ‘Your Custom Feed’ feature users can refine what they see and they not have to mainly rely in YouTube’s algorithm.","Users in the test group will see a ‘Your Custom Feed’ option on their homepage.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

What Sam Altman said about OpenAI’s upcoming AI device and how it will be ‘better’ experience than iPhone



“One of the things that I think has gone wrong with modern technology, and by the way, a lot has gone right. I think the iPhone is, thus far, the crowning achievement of consumer products. It’s an amazing thing. But one of the things that has gone wrong is that when I use the current devices or most apps, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York, constantly dealing with all the little indignities along the way. Flashing lights in my face, tension going on here, people bumping into me like noise is going off.

It’s an unsettling thing. It’s like bright stuff flashing notifications, dopamine chasing here and there, with short attention spans. I understand how we got here, but I don’t think it’s making any of our lives peaceful and calm, and just letting us focus on other stuff.

An early thing we talked about with the devices we hope to build is if you have this really smart AI that you trust to do things for you over long periods of time, filter things out. Be contextually aware of when it should not only bother you, but also when it should present information to you or ask for your input. You trust it over time, and it does have just this incredible contextual awareness of your whole life.

You can then go for a vibe that is not like walking through Times Square, getting bumped into, and having all this stuff compete for your attention. But like sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains, and enjoying the peace and calm. I think this actually just isn’t possible in the pre-AI world of technology. I don't think this is possible with the devices we have now. But I hope we build devices that can offer you back some of that spirit.”

AI at the core of Nvidia’s work culture



Reassurance amid layoff fears



Expansion and market growth







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again made headlines after a recording from an all-hands meeting was leaked. As reported by Business Insider, the leaked recording revealed his frustration with managers who have reportedly asked the employees to use less artificial intelligence in their work. Speaking at an all-hands meeting held a day after Nvidia’s earnings call, Huang completely dismissed the idea, asking the mangers are they insane. “My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI,” Huang said. “Are you insane?”. Huang further emphasised that he wants every task which can be automated with AI to be automated. He insisted that the employees should use AI and should not worry about losing their jobs in the process. “I promise you, you will have work to do,” he said, underscoring his belief that AI should be embedded into every aspect of Nvidia’s operations.As per the report, Huang also explained that engineers at Nvidia already use AI tools such as Cursor to streamline coding. Along with this, he has also urged his staff to continue experimenting AI even if it does not work perfectly in the first place. “Use it until it does,” he urged, adding that employees should help improve the technology because “we have the power to do so.”The remarks made by Huang reflect the broader industry trend, as companies like Microsoft and Meta have already started evaluating employees on the basis of their AI usage. On the other hand, Google has also instructed the engineers to incorporate AI into coding tasks and Amazon tool has started adopting Cursor after requests from employees.Despite the widespread fears that AI adoption can lead to job losses, but Huang has also reassured Nvidia’s workforce that the company will still expanding. He further noted that Nvidia hired thousands of people last quarter joking that the surge had strained office parking spaces. The company’s headcount has grown from 29,600 in fiscal 2024 to 36,000 in fiscal 2025, and Huang said Nvidia is “probably still about 10,000 short. ” He explained that hiring will continue at a pace consistent with the company’s ability to integrate new employees effectively.Nvidia’s rapid growth has been matched by its physical expansion, with new offices opened in Taipei and Shanghai and two additional sites under construction in the United States. Recently, Nvidia reported $57.01 billion in quarterly revenue which is a62% increase as compared to the same period last year. This increase in revenue further cements the position of Nvidia as the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of more than $4 trillion. While some investors, including Michael Burry of The Big Short fame, have voiced skepticism about the sustainability of the AI boom, Nvidia has pushed back, telling analysts that its strategy remains firmly rooted in accelerating AI adoption.",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again made headlines after a recording from an all-hands meeting was leaked.

What got leaked and why it matters

Hackers already hunting for these secrets





Thousands of passwords, security keys, and confidential information from banks, government agencies, and tech companies have been sitting exposed online through two popular code formatting websites, JSONFormatter and CodeBeautify. Security researchers discovered over 80,000 saved code snippets—totaling more than 5GB of data spanning up to five years—freely accessible to anyone through an unprotected feature called ""Recent Links"" on both platforms.The exposed material includes working login credentials for cloud services and databases, private encryption keys, payment gateway access codes, and massive amounts of personal customer data from organizations in critical sectors like banking, healthcare, government infrastructure, aerospace, and cybersecurity, according to a report by Bleeping Computer. Among the discoveries: active Amazon Web Services credentials from a major international stock exchange, banking passwords leaked by a cybersecurity service provider, and internal system configurations from government entities.The problem stems from how these tools handle saved code. When users click ""save"" to share their formatted code, the platforms create a public link and add it to an unprotected ""Recent Links"" page.Because these pages follow predictable web addresses, anyone can easily scrape them using simple automated tools.The exposed data includes highly sensitive material that cybercriminals could exploit immediately. Researchers from WatchTowr found login credentials for databases and cloud services, private encryption keys, payment gateway access codes, and large amounts of personal customer information.In specific cases, they discovered working Amazon Web Services credentials from a major international stock exchange, banking credentials leaked by a security service provider, and configuration details from a cybersecurity firm that included passwords, internal network information, and system blueprints.One government entity inadvertently exposed 1,000 lines of code containing details about internal systems, security settings, and network configurations—information that attackers could use to plan intrusions.To test whether criminals were actively monitoring these sites, researchers planted fake but realistic-looking security credentials. The bait was accessed within 48 hours, confirming that threat actors are scanning these platforms for exploitable information, Bleeping Computer reports.While WatchTowr notified affected organisations, many haven't responded. The ""Recent Links"" features remain publicly accessible on both websites, continuing to expose sensitive data to potential attackers.","Security researchers discovered over 80,000 saved code snippets spanning up to five years.

How AI is transforming skilling in India









India is at a defining moment in its AI journey and Microsoft is partnering with the government to embed AI learning directly into vocational institutions and communities nationwide, Microsoft India and South Asia president Puneet Chandok has said, noting that the tech giant is helping in building a future-ready workforce capable of thriving in an AI-powered economy.“India stands at a defining moment in its AI journey and what sets this moment apart is the nation’s resolve to make AI opportunity inclusive. At Microsoft, we see skilling as the cornerstone of this transformation. By combining India’s scale of talent with its strong digital foundation and by partnering with the Government of India, MSDE, and DGT, we are embedding AI learning into vocational institutions and communities nationwide. This is more than a program—it’s a movement to build a future-ready workforce,” Chandok said.Microsoft has shared an example of Satyendra Kumaris part of a growing cohort of over 350 students trained in a one-year micro-degree ‘AI Programming Assistant’, offered across 33 National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs) in India.The company says that it partnered with the Directorate General of Training (DGT) at the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) to deliver the program that is advancing India’s mission to prepare its youth for an AI-driven economy.Earlier this year, Microsoft announced its AI skilling commitment to train 10 million Indians by 2030. According to Microsoft, over 5.6 million Indians have already been trained by Microsoft since the announcement in January 2025.It also announced Microsoft Elevate, which aims to provide education, nonprofit, and workforce organisations with technology solutions, skills and insights to empower people in the AI economy. As AI reshapes the world of work, Microsoft said, its skilling approach must evolve to match the pace of innovation and opportunity it brings.Jayant Chaudhary, Minister of State for Skill Development & Entrepreneurship noted the role of private technology firms like Microsoft and how it is modernizing ITIs (Industrial Training Institutes) and NSTIs.“Collaborations with industry leaders are helping establish AI labs, enhance curriculum and pedagogy as well as create hands-on learning ecosystems aligned with industry needs,” he said.This gap in vocational skilling becomes even more critical when viewed against the backdrop of India’s booming AI market.","Microsoft is partnering with the government to embed AI learning directly into vocational institutions and communities nationwide.

Leadership must define what counts as real work, says Butterfield







Stewart Butterfield, who led Slack from startup to a $27.7 billion Salesforce acquisition, warns that executives and employees alike waste time on what he calls ""hyper-realistic worklike activities"" — tasks that look productive but deliver little value. Speaking on Lenny's Podcast, the serial entrepreneur who also founded Flickr identified a pattern he observed while scaling companies: as organizations grow, workers increasingly engage in what appears to be legitimate work but actually accomplishes nothing meaningful. Pre-meetings to review presentation decks, endless slide revisions, and status updates that serve no strategic purpose all fall into this category.The problem begins in a company's early days, Butterfield explained. Initially, every task delivers clear value — setting up bank accounts, building user databases, establishing core systems. But as companies hire more people, the supply of obvious, high-value work diminishes while the workforce expands.Without transparent priorities from leadership, employees create busy work to demonstrate productivity.They're not being lazy or deceptive, Butterfield clarified — they simply want recognition for their efforts and will conform to whatever their team culture rewards.The most insidious aspect of fake work is its subtlety. Even board members and executives fall into the trap, Butterfield admitted on the podcast, because these activities mirror legitimate business tasks so closely.The responsibility for fixing this rests squarely with leadership, he argued. CEOs and managers must explicitly communicate priorities and say no to low-value activities upfront, rather than blaming workers later for wasted effort.Butterfield's critique of superficial productivity comes from experience. After leaving Slack in early 2023, he's had time to reflect on the organisational patterns that emerge as startups mature into major corporations. His message: looking busy isn't the same as being effective, and leaders must constantly distinguish between the two.","Stewart Butterfield, who led Slack from startup to a $27.7 billion Salesforce acquisition, warns that executives and employees alike waste time on what he calls ""hyper-realistic worklike activities"" The problem begins in a company's early days, Butterfield explained.

Reactions and concerns about the report made by Deloitte



Deloitte to refund Australian government $290,000 after making 'AI mistake'



Erroneous errors in Deloitte report







Deloitte has once again landed in trouble for an apparent AI-related mistake. Deloitte recently prepared a major healthcare report for the Canadian government. As reported by The Independent, the report was supposed to access healthcare services in Newfoundland and Labrador, contained multiple factual errors that are believed to be generated by artificial intelligence tools. This is not the first time that Deloitte has faced such a situation. Last month, the company refunded around $290,000 to the Australian government after errors were discovered in a report it produced.As reported by The Independent, the reported submitted by Deloitte consisted of incorrect information about hospitals and healthcare facilities. Some of the institution were either misidentified or described inaccurately. The observers also noted that text of some paragraphs of the report are AI-generated. This action done by Deloitte raises concern about the company’s reliance on automated systems without sufficient human oversight. The errors in the report were significant enough to undermine confidence in the findings of the report as it was made to guide the healthcare policy decisions in the province.As per the report, the healthcare professionals and policymakers have raised alarm, stressing that the inaccurate data of the report could mislead the decision-making in critical areas such as patient care and resource allocation.Along with this, the crisis also argued that Deloitte’s repeated missteps also highlight the risks involved in over-reliance on AI in sensitive government work.This incident underscores the increasing concern on the use of generative AI in official reports and consulting work, where accuracy is of prime importance. Also, the government and corporations are increasingly adopting AI tools to cut costs and speed up the process of analysis. However, in the case of Deloitte it clearly highlight how errors can erode credibility and trust. This incident may also prompt the Canadian authorities to re-examine oversight mechanisms for contractors using AI in public-sector projects.Last month also, Deloitte made a similar ‘AI mistake’. In August this year, Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported multiple errors in the report which also included the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI). The report, commissioned by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR), assessed the Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF), part of the IT system that manages welfare and benefits payments.The original seven-month review, completed around June 2025 for USD $290,000 ($440,000 AUD), contained multiple mistakes. These included nonexistent academic references and a fabricated quote from a Federal Court judgment, first noted by Australian welfare academic Dr. Christopher Rudge. An updated version of the report, published on DEWR’s website, corrected more than a dozen references and footnotes, rewrote the reference list, and fixed typographical errors.Deloitte confirmed that some footnotes and references were incorrect and has agreed to repay the final installment under its contract. A DEWR spokesperson said the changes do not alter the report’s findings or recommendations.","Deloitte has once again landed in trouble for an apparent AI-related mistake.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has restructured his senior leadership team to position the tech giant for success in the artificial intelligence era, according to a leaked organisational chart and internal documents obtained by Business Insider.The chart reveals 16 executives now report directly to Nadella as the company undergoes what could be one of the most significant transformations in its 50-year history. The reshuffling reflects Microsoft's intensified focus on AI development and cloud infrastructure.Among the most notable changes, Business Insider reports that Judson Althoff was recently promoted to CEO of Microsoft's commercial business, consolidating sales, marketing, and operations under one leader. This move allows Nadella and engineering executives to concentrate on AI priorities including datacenter expansion and product innovation.Mustafa Suleyman, cofounder of AI pioneer DeepMind, joined last year as CEO of a new Microsoft AI division overseeing consumer products like Copilot. Jay Parikh now leads CoreAI, a unit central to building AI agents that can handle tasks traditionally performed by humans.Amy Hood, the longtime CFO, controls Microsoft's multibillion-dollar AI infrastructure investments, with the company reporting record capital expenditures of $34.9 billion in its most recent quarter. Meanwhile, Kevin Scott continues his influential role as CTO, having brokered Microsoft's pivotal partnership with OpenAI that has reshaped the technology landscape.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has restructured his senior leadership team to position the tech giant for success in the artificial intelligence era.

HP’s layoff strategy

HP’s financial outlook





HP is the latest company to join the list of growing tech layoffs. HP has officially announced its plans to cut between 4,000 to 6,000 jobs by the end of 2028. As reported by Business Insider, the company made this announcement during the earnings presentation and said that the decision is part of organisational restructuring and is also tied to the adoption of artificial intelligence. This latest move of HP underscores how AI is reshaping corporate strategies and workforce across the tech industry.During the earnings call, HP CEO Enrique Lores explained the rationale behind this decision. “Two years ago, we started to do some pilots on how AI could help us to drive these things. What we have learned is that we need to start from redesigning the process, and once we know how the process could be redone using AI, using agentic AI, it can really have a very significant impact.”Lores further added that HP ‘finished a strong 2025’ and the company further plans to grow faster than the market in 2026. He also added that HP now plans to embed AI in ‘everything they do’.HP claims that this move of restructuring or layoffs will help the company to save around $1 billion by 2028. The company also expects to incur $650 million in related costs, with about $250 million hitting in fiscal 2026. The plan of the company includes workforce reductions, platform simplification, program consolidation and productivity measures.All these changes will be driven by AI integration.HP expects to beat revenue expectations in Q4. However, its non-GAAP diluted EPS forecast for 2026 ($2.90–$3.20) fell short of Bloomberg analysts’ projection of $3.32. Shares of the company also dropped more than 5% in after-hours trading following the announcement and are down over 25% year-to-date.The job cuts announced by HP are majorly driven by the AI layoffs trend. Business Insider previously reported that companies including Amazon and Workday have announced significant job reductions tied to AI advancements, as automation reshapes roles once considered secure.","HP has announced its plans to cut between 4,000 to 6,000 jobs by the end of 2028.

How Donald Trump has changed EU vs Big Tech fight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-donald-trump-has-changed-eu-vs-big-tech-fight/articleshow/125573499.cms,"“Our ambition seems to be limited to being good regulators. We’ve seen this in the data space [with GDPR], we’ve seen this now in the platform space, and now with the AI space,” Constantijn told CNBC in June 2024.





EU’s DMA and AI Act Explained

In case a gatekeeper does not follow the obligations laid down by the DMA, the Commission can impose fines up to 10% of the company's total worldwide turnover, which can go up to 20% in case of repeated infringement.

“Google was able to reverse engineer and make Apple AirDrop work with non-Apple devices. And most Apple devices now use Type-C. Both of these are possible because of EU regulations and it has been a good thing that big tech portrays as if it is bad for us,” Pritam told The Times of India.

“Now Trump has put [the] entire US government’s weight on Brussels to make this EU regulation friendly for US AI companies. If you don’t own your compute, if your data lives in someone else’s cloud, if your models depend on another country’s ecosystem, then you’re not sovereign. With or without the AI Act in force, those who invest early in domestic AI stacks like hardware, data, and model governance, will end up controlling the narrative,” he added.

“The long-term intent behind the AI Act was not solely to push US technology companies to invest in the region, although this would have been a natural consequence. The broader strategic goal was to establish global regulatory leadership and set a governance benchmark for responsible AI. In doing so, the EU expected major US companies to deepen local partnerships, expand compliance teams, and invest in European research programs. However, the primary intention was to shape global norms rather than create a direct economic incentive for US firms,” he told The Times of India.

The revolt of the Tech Titans

“approached compliance with transparency and meaningful product changes, even where we have concerns that some rules will reduce the choices available to people and businesses in Europe.”

“The commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multibillion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,” said Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, as per the Wall Street Journal.

“There is a documented investment gap: US Big Tech AI spending in 2024 alone was estimated around €200 billion more than the entire annual EU budget. If you overlay that with the Trump administration’s messaging that the US will lead AI and avoid ‘over regulation,’ it amplifies EU fears that too strict rules will push talent and capital out of Europe,” Sabharwal told The Times of India.

Trump becomes US President; Next up: Trade War

“Tim Cook called me up directly and he did it himself, didn't have to pay ten cents and I gave him 100% of what he wanted because he was right. I mean you cant compete with Samsung and ones paying a tax. But I said you got to gradually move your company here. But then 2 hours ago, 3 hours ago, he called me. He said I'd like to talk to you about something, Juan,"" Trump said.

“He said the European Union has just fined us $15 billion. I said that's a lot. I know the feeling because I get fined too in fake cases. But I don't know if his case is fake yet. But it's a lot. Then on top of that they got fined by the European Union another $2 billion. So he's a $17 to $18 billion fine. I even said about Apple, can you pay that? I mean do you have that kind? That's a lot of money. And he said something that was interesting. He said they're using that to run their enterprise, meaning Europe is their enterprise. And I said that's a lot. I said but Tim, I got to get elected first, but I'm not going to let them take advantage of our companies. That won't be happening,” he added.

""Europe today “hit” another great American company, Google, with a $3.5 Billion Dollar fine, effectively taking money that would otherwise go to American Investments and Jobs. This is on top of the many other Fines and Taxes that have been issued against Google and other American Tech Companies, in particular. Very unfair, and the American Taxpayer will not stand for it! As I have said before, my Administration will NOT allow these discriminatory actions to stand. Apple, as an example, was forced to pay $17 Billion Dollars in a Fine that, in my opinion, should not have been charged — They should get their money back! We cannot let this happen to brilliant and unprecedented American Ingenuity and, if it does, I will be forced to start a Section 301 proceeding to nullify the unfair penalties being charged to these Taxpaying American Companies. Thank you for your attention to this matter""

""The DMA should be repealed while a more appropriate fit for purpose legislative instrument is put in place,""

“It's become clear that the DMA is leading to a worse experience for Apple users in the EU. It's exposing them to new risks, and disrupting the simple, seamless way their Apple products work together,”

“We feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship,” Vance told the European audience.

“They would like to have steel and aluminium as part of this package and we think it is very, very important that they understand our digital companies and they reconsider their digital regulations to be more inviting to our big companies,” Lutnick told Bloomberg.

“Diplomatic pressure likely played an indirect role. The current geopolitical climate places significant emphasis on technology sovereignty and trade alignment.”

“The EU understands that without practical data-use pathways, European firms would struggle to compete with US leaders such as Google, OpenAI, and others. The Trump administration’s assertive advocacy for US technological primacy created additional pressure for Europe to rethink certain data restrictions and align them with global competitive realities,” he said.

“Excessive regulatory friction would widen that gap. The US administration’s emphasis on AI leadership, national competitiveness, and strategic investment intensified European concerns. This dynamic contributed to the EU’s decision to slow down the rollout of certain provisions and allow firms more time to adapt. Europe’s objective is to protect citizens and uphold ethical standards while ensuring that local AI companies remain competitive against heavily capitalised US firms,” he added.

“The formal justification from Brussels is framed around “simplification,” innovation, and giving providers more time to comply, as seen in the Digital Omnibus and the shift of high risk AI deadlines into 2027. However, it would be naïve to say US pressure was irrelevant: reporting already links the current easing to lobbying by US tech firms and concerns raised by the Trump administration about Europe over regulating American AI champions.

My view: diplomatic pressure was a meaningful but not dominant factor. EU competitiveness anxiety and internal industry pushback were at least as important,” said Sabharwal.





It all started in 2016 when the European Commission wanted to address the privacy concerns of users in the European Union and the European Economic Area. The foundation of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was laid and multiple other countries followed their lead. The regulators started to build on these rules, self-appointing as global standard-setters for digital ethics, privacy and antitrust enforcement. The message was clear: If you want to sell to millions of Europeans, you play by Europe’s rules.Soon after the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the European Union (EU) moved to position itself as AI’s global regulator, proposing comprehensive legislation to hold tech companies accountable for safe AI deployment. But as the EU AI Act took shape, its increasingly ‘tough’ requirements threatened to constrain the very innovation it sought to govern.Meanwhile, in November 2022, the DMA officially entered into force with an aim to ensure a higher degree of competition in European digital markets by preventing large companies from abusing their market power. In May 2023, the regulation became applicable.Then came the backlash. Tech giants responded with legal challenges and appeals. Companies like Apple and Meta have appealed the European Commission’s non-compliance decisions and associated fines. Microsoft and Google also retaliated but complied with some demands under the law.The AI law also saw its fair share of criticism. Siemens CEO Roland Busch and SAP CEO Christian Klein slammed the EU’s AI Act, saying that “the EU's regulatory approach is holding back progress.” In fact, Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands also said that the approach may become a reason for the region to fall behind the US and China on AI development.But the world’s 'digital referee' refused to back down, as generative AI began reshaping the global economy. Tech giants were grilled and fined, sending the landscape of global technology regulation in a seismic shift.In January 2025, Donald Trump returned as the US President and reports of Tech CEOs meeting with the President started to surface. Soon, the Trump administration started to take a harder line against European AI regulation. At the Paris AI Summit earlier this year, Vice President JD Vance rebuked, warning that “excessive regulation” risked strangling the AI industry which is still in its infancy.In 2023, the European Commission designated, for the first time, six gatekeepers - Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, Microsoft - under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Under DMA, companies can be designated as ‘Gatekeepers’ if they provide an important gateway between businesses and consumers in relation to core platform services.In total, 22 core platform services provided by these gatekeepers have been designated. The six gatekeepers got six months to ensure full compliance with the DMA obligations for each of their designated core platform services.Passed in early 2024, the AI Act is basically designed to put tough restrictions on tech and social media giants to propel better competition and ‘kill’ dominance of certain players. The rules essentially forced companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook-parent Meta and others to bring changes to their respective platforms. This approach is contrary to the US ‘light approach’, where tech giants are pushed to make voluntary commitments and certain executive orders that can be modified.The ‘fight’ between the regulators and tech companies largely centred around the High-Risk category, which covers AI used in critical infrastructure, education, employment, and more. For a company like Microsoft, Google, or OpenAI, having their foundation models or applications classified as “high risk” triggers a heavy compliance burden. Under the law, they are required to prove their training data isn't biased, maintain detailed technical documentation, ensure human oversight, and achieve high levels of accuracy and cybersecurity.Unable to meet the requirements, they face the threat of fines up to 7% of global annual turnover for non-compliance.According to Pritam, co-founder and COO of Vibestudio, an India-based AI lab developing secure and on-premise AI systems for coding, automation and workforce productivity, the regulation is the reason why there’s some level of competition.Brussels believed that just as the GDPR forced companies globally to adopt privacy standards, the AI Act would force US companies to build “safe” AI for the whole world.When asked whether a long-term aim of the EU’s AI rules was to push US tech companies to invest more in the region, Aniket Tapre, founder and CEO of Neural Arc, said that the EU has always attempted to balance innovation with regulatory oversight.Companies like Google, Apple and Meta challenged the feasibility of the DMA, echoing that it will negatively impact the safe and secure experience.Google said itApple said that the commission unfairly targeted the company with moves that “are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.”Meanwhile, as the AI Act moved from draft to law, the tone from Silicon Valley quickly changed. The explosion of Generative AI (GenAI) in 2023 changed the situation and AI was touted as the next big technological revolution.Big Tech started arguing that the EU rules’ strict requirements on data transparency would force them to reveal trade secrets and open them up to massive copyright lawsuits. They argued that getting government approval before releasing a model would slow down innovation, leaving Europe behind while the US and China would surge ahead.For Ankush Sabharwal, founder and CEO of CoRover.ai, it comes down to AI investment and talent.US tech leaders realised that fighting the EU in European courts was a slow battle. This can be said on the basis of the fact that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) had recently upheld massive fines against Google and forced Apple to pay €13 billion in back taxes.In the months leading up to the US election, tech CEOs began to meet with Donald Trump. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who Trump had once threatened with prison, reportedly had dinner with the former President. Zuckerberg’s tone shifted noticeably; he publicly praised Trump.Apple CEO Tim Cook called Trump directly to complain about the EU’s fines. Trump later recounted the conversation:This looked like a strategy to reframe EU regulation not as a domestic policy issue for Europe, but as an attack on “American Champions.Donald Trump’s approach in the second term is about data, algorithms and fines. The Trump administration wants “America First” and the EU rules like the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the AI Act as tools designed to handicap successful American firms.In September, after the EU upheld a fine against Google, Trump posted:He threatened to use Section 301 of the Trade Act -- the same weapon used to launch the trade war with China -- to investigate EU digital taxes and fines. The message to Brussels was clear: If you fine our tech companies, we will tax yours.EU is still investigating after tech giants appealed the bloc's decisions but this year, largly all investigations result in no new fines for rhe tech giants.In September, Apple said the DMA should be repealed.Apple said in a formal submission to the European Commission as part of a consultation on the law.the tech giant said in a blog post accompanying its submission.In a speech in Paris earlier this year, Vice President JD Vance warned Europeans that their “heavy regulation could kill AI.”The appointment of Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and a staunch crypto and tech deregulator, to head the Commerce Department further solidified this stance. Lutnick has publicly criticised the EU’s “anti-business” environment. Lutnick said that Europe should “reconsider” its rules for big tech companies in return for lower US tariff rates on its steel and aluminium exports.According to Tapre,All in all, Trump successfully communicated that the US government will no longer act as a passive observer while its most valuable companies are regulated by foreign powers. He turned the tech regulation into a trade issue, and forced the EU to postpone its policy implementation with the full application of high-risk AI rules being pushed back. Instead of the August 2026 deadline, the new proposal makes the deadline conditional.","The EU expected major US companies to deepen local partnerships, expand compliance teams, and invest in European research programs. “With or without the AI Act in force, those who invest early in domestic AI stacks like hardware, data, and model governance, will end up controlling the narrative,” said Pritam Sabharwal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125580872,imgsize-38474,width-400,resizemode-4/eu-vs-trump.jpg"

Wall Street takes notice as competitive dynamics shift





Nvidia, the $4 trillion chipmaker that has dominated the AI boom, broke from its usual playbook Tuesday by issuing a public statement defending its market position—a move triggered by reports that one of its biggest customers, Meta Platforms, is in advanced talks to spend billions on Google 's competing AI chips. This hammered Nvidia's stock, erasing roughly $250 billion in market value. Meanwhile, Alphabet shares climbed as Wall Street began viewing Google's TPU processors as a credible alternative to Nvidia's stranglehold on AI hardware.The chipmaker, which dominates over 90% of the AI accelerator market, found itself in unfamiliar territory: responding to a competitor rather than setting the agenda. The catalyst was a report from The Information revealing that Google has been aggressively pitching its tensor processing units (TPUs) to major clients, including Meta and several leading financial institutions, potentially capturing up to 10% of Nvidia's annual revenue.""We're delighted by Google's success—they've made great advances in AI, and we continue to supply to Google,"" Nvidia wrote, before pivoting to assert its superiority. ""Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.""The threat to Nvidia appears increasingly credible. For most of the past decade, Google's TPUs were dismissed as clever in-house tools—fast and efficient for Google's own systems, but not a true rival to Nvidia's general-purpose GPUs.That perception is rapidly changing.Google's latest Gemini 3 AI model—trained entirely on TPUs rather than Nvidia's GPUs—has earned widespread acclaim from industry heavyweights. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly declared he's switching from ChatGPT after three years, calling Gemini 3 superior. Some analysts are describing it as the ""current state of the art"" in AI models.According to The Information, Meta could begin renting TPUs from Google Cloud as early as next year, with purchases for its own data centers potentially starting in 2027. This matters enormously because Meta ranks among Nvidia's largest customers, planning up to $72 billion in AI infrastructure spending this year. For Google to capture even a fraction of that business would represent a seismic shift in the AI hardware market.The deal would also mark Google's expansion beyond its current strategy of using TPUs exclusively in its own data centers, positioning the company in direct competition for the hundreds of billions being spent on AI processors.Market reaction was swift and decisive. While Nvidia shares sank, Alphabet stock surged 4%, approaching a historic $4 trillion valuation. Broadcom, which manufactures Google's AI chips, jumped 11%.Google maintained a measured response: ""We are experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and Nvidia GPUs; we are committed to supporting both.""","Google's TPUs emerge as serious challenger to Nvidia dominance of the AI market.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ’s Blue Origin has appointed Tory Bruno, the former chief executive and president of United Launch Alliance (ULA), as president of its newly formed national security group. The space company announced the appointment in a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter). As president of the new group, Bruno will lead work focused on products, services and technologies for national security missions, according to an internal email from Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp, seen by Bloomberg.In a statement, Limp said Blue Origin and Bruno share a common goal of supporting national security through advanced technology, adding that Bruno’s experience will help the company move faster in this area.The move signals Blue Origin’s growing focus on national security work. The company is one of a small group of US launch providers, along with SpaceX and ULA, that are approved to launch sensitive national security satellites for the US military.Bruno’s departure from ULA was announced on December 22. He led the Boeing and Lockheed Martin joint venture for nearly 12 years. During his time at ULA, Bruno oversaw the retirement of the Delta and Atlas rockets and led the development of the Vulcan rocket.Vulcan faced multiple delays and has had a slow launch schedule since its first flight in January 2024.Blue Origin supplies the BE-4 engines used on Vulcan and also competes directly with ULA through its own New Glenn rocket. Bruno previously worked with Blue Origin in 2014 on the partnership to develop the BE-4 engines.Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, which is planned for future national security missions, completed its second launch in November. During that mission, the rocket’s main booster landed on a floating platform at sea.Blue Origin is also moving its in-space systems business into the new national security group. The unit’s current head, Paul Ebertz, will report to Bruno. The group includes projects such as Blue Ring, a planned satellite platform, and work on a communications spacecraft designed for orbit around Mars.","Tory Bruno will lead work focused on products, services and technologies for national security missions.

Elon Musk close ally and NASA administrator Jared Isaacman vows US Moon landing within Trump’s second term,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-close-ally-and-nasa-administrator-jared-isaacman-vows-us-moon-landing-within-trumps-second-term/articleshow/126217893.cms,"Mining the Moon: Helium-3 and nuclear propulsion







Jared Isaacman, the newly-confirmed NASA Administrator and a close ally of SpaceX has announced that the US will return astronauts to the lunar surface within President Donald Trump’s second term. Speaking to CNBC on Friday (December 26), Isaacman said that the return to the Moon is a vital step in unlocking a multibillion-dollar ""orbital economy. ""“We want to have that opportunity to explore and realise the scientific, economic, and national security potential on the moon,” Isaacman said, suggesting a definitive timeline for the Artemis mission, the agency's flagship lunar program. The effort received a massive financial boost earlier this year via Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which allocated $9.9 billion in fresh funding to NASA.The roadmap for the next four years includes Artemis II mission which will be a crewed test flight aboard the Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion spacecraft. Artemis III will be the historic mission that will land humans on the lunar surface once again. Musk’s SpaceX is currently developing the Human Landing System (HLS).Previously, Isaacman said that the contract will be given to any space company – Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin or Elon Musk’s SpaceX – who meets the necessary requirements first.Isaacman outlined a vision for a permanent lunar presence. He identified Helium-3 – a rare isotope found in lunar soil – as a potential “holy grail” for clean energy, serving as a primary fuel for future fusion power. Isaacman also revealed that NASA is prioritising investments in:Space data centres to manage orbital communications and lunar logistics; nuclear propulsion that will utilise space nuclear power to reach Mars and beyond more efficiently and refueling infrastructure, which is partnering with SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin to develop on-orbit cryogenic propellant transfer.","Jared Isaacman, the newly-confirmed NASA Administrator and a close ally of SpaceX has announced that the US will return astronauts to the lunar surface within President Donald Trump’s second term.

Tesla may soon allow vehicle owners to use Apple Car Keys to unlock and start their cars. New evidence from a recent software update indicates that the electric vehicle company led by Elon Musk is preparing to support native digital keys that live directly within a smartphone's operating system, rather than just within a specific app. According to a report by Not a Tesla App, several code references to"" have been discovered in version 4.52.0 of the Tesla mobile app. This discovery is a significant development because it shows that Tesla is changing how its vehicles connect with mobile devices, making the experience more seamless for users.At the moment, Tesla owners rely on asystem that uses a Bluetooth connection and requires the Tesla app to be running in the background. By switching to a native wallet key, the digital key is stored in the phone's secure hardware at the system level. This change makes the key much more reliable and easier to access because it no longer depends on the app staying open to function.The code found in Tesla app version 4.52.0 references Huawei's HarmonyOS system. This means the first version appears designed for Huawei Wallet on Huawei phones. HarmonyOS is very popular in China, where Huawei is a major smartphone brand. Tesla often tests new software features in China before rolling them out to other countries.The code does not mention Apple Wallet or Google Wallet. However, the technology works much like Apple's digital car key system on iPhones . Apple launched Car Key support in Apple Wallet in 2020.This feature may allow people to unlock, lock, and start their cars using NFC, Bluetooth, or ultra-wideband technology. The car keys are stored in a secure chip inside the iPhone and Apple Watch.This will enable special features like Express Mode, which lets users unlock a car without needing Face ID, Touch ID, or a password. The system can even work when the phone battery is nearly dead.Earlier this month, Rivian added native support for both Apple Wallet and Google Wallet digital car keys in its 2025.46 software update.

How $20 billion Nvidia deal may also mean 'big win' for Groq employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-20-billion-nvidia-deal-may-also-mean-big-win-for-groq-employees/articleshow/126219958.cms,"AI chip startup Groq has inked a non-exclusive licensing deal with Nvidia, reportedly valued at $20 billion. This agreement will see significant payouts for Groq employees and shareholders, with most of the fee disbursed upfront. While Groq will continue as an independent entity, key personnel, including its founder, will join Nvidia to advance licensed technology.

What Groq said about its deal with Nvidia

“Groq announced that it has entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq’s inference technology. The agreement reflects a shared focus on expanding access to high-performance, low-cost inference.

As part of this agreement, Jonathan Ross, Groq’s Founder, Sunny Madra, Groq’s President, and other members of the Groq team will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology.

Groq will continue to operate as an independent company with Simon Edwards stepping into the role of Chief Executive Officer.

Elon Musk Can ‘CRY’, But He Will Still Pay $140,000,000 X Fine: EU Adamant After Hitler Attack





Nvidia announced a ""non-exclusive licensing agreement"" with AI chipmaking startup Groq last week. Groq employees and shareholders are expected to receive substantial payouts from this deal with the US chipmaker, which is reportedly worth around $20 billion. However, no equity or ownership of the shares is being transferred in the agreement. Meanwhile, neither Nvidia nor Groq has disclosed the financial details of the licensing deal.According to a report by Axios, sources have claimed that most Groq shareholders will receive payments per share based on the $20 billion valuation. About 85% of the fee will be made upfront, with another 10% paid in mid-2026 and the remaining amount at the end of 2026. Apart from shareholders, Groq employees who are joining Nvidia will also be paid handsomely, the report suggests.Groq’s founder and chief executive officer (CEO), Jonathan Ross, and president, Sunny Madra, along with 90% of the startup’s employees, will reportedly join Nvidia. Meanwhile, Groq would continue to operate as a standalone company led by new CEO Simon Edwards, who had been the startup's chief financial officer (CFO).The report claims that Groq employees who join Nvidia will receive cash for all their vested shares. Their unvested shares will be paid out at the $20 billion valuation, but through Nvidia stock that vests over time.About 50 employees in this group will have their entire stock packages accelerated and paid out in cash. Employees who remain at Groq will also be paid for their vested shares and will receive a package that includes economic participation in the ongoing company.Any Groq employee, whether staying or leaving, who has been with the company for less than one year will have their vesting cliff removed. This will allow them to receive some upfront payment.In a blog post, Groq wrote:Even though many employees are moving to Nvidia, the AI hardware startup will continue to operate independently. This is because the deal is only a licensing partnership, not a complete acquisition. This unusual structure is becoming increasingly common among AI majors seeking to avoid antitrust problems.Groq is known for its Language Processing Unit (LPU), a custom AI inference chip. This is the process where trained AI models make predictions or decisions. The startup was valued at $6.9 billion just three months ago and raised $750 million in its latest funding round.The startup’s founder, Jonathan Ross, and engineer Douglas Wightman previously worked at Google, where they helped develop the company's first Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained.

New York politician says ‘one of the most dangerous’ uses of AI can be fixed with 1990s tech that made online banking possible,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/new-york-politician-says-one-of-the-most-dangerous-uses-of-ai-can-be-fixed-with-1990s-tech-that-made-online-banking-possible/articleshow/126214891.cms,"How digital certificates solved the ‘problem’ of internet banking



Alex Bores backs C2PA: The new digital certificate







New York politician Alex Bores has said that the problem of deepfakes – highly-realistic AI-generated photos – can be fixed, and solution is not training humans to spot them but to incorporate a technology that saved the early internet and is the foundation of online payments. Bores, a Democrat currently running for Congress in Manhattan’s 12th District, says that a return to the cryptographic tools can mitigate the “crisis” of AI-generated misinformation.“Can we nerd out about deep fakes? Because this is a solvable problem and one that that I think most people are missing the boat on,” said Bores, who previously worked as a data scientist and federal-civilian business lead at Palantir, on a recent episode of Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast (via Fortune). He suggested that the technology that made consumers trust online banking in the 1990s can be applied to verify the authenticity of every image, video, and audio clip online.As per a report in Fortune, in the 1990s, some believed the internet would never be secure enough for financial transactions, however, this changed with the widespread adoption of HTTPS and digital certificates, which gave users a way to verify that a website was authentic and secure.Bores argues that the same “trust but verify” architecture is the key to neutralising deepfakes. He added, “That was a solvable problem. That basically same technique works for images, video, and for audio.”Bores’ proposal is an open-source standard called C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) – a metadata standard that can act as a “tamper-evident” credential attached to a file. It can record the file’s origin – whether it’s captured on a physical camera or generated by AI; Editing trail like how it has been modified and the creator which is a cryptographic proof of who or what produced the media.Bores says that the challenge is not the technology but its adoption because for cryptographic proof to work, it must become the industry standard.“The challenge is the creator has to attach it and so you need to get to a place where that is the default option,” Bores said, adding that the goal should be to reach a point where if people “see an image and it doesn’t have that cryptographic proof, you should be skeptical.”He likened the trust with the shift from HTTP to HTTPS, where consumers instinctively know to not trust a banking site that lacks a secure connection.“It’d be like going to your banking website and only loading HTTP, right? You would instantly be suspect, but you can still produce the images,” he added.",New York politician Alex Bores has said that the problem of deepfakes – highly- realistic AI-generated photos – can be fixed. solution is not training humans to spot them but to incorporate a technology that saved the early internet and is the foundation of online payments.

Amazon hits pause on Italy drone delivery amid regulatory challenges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-hits-pause-on-italy-drone-delivery-amid-regulatory-challenges/articleshow/126215549.cms,"



Amazon has reportedly decided to pause its plans of drone delivery service in Italy. As reported by Reuters, the e-commerce major had been working on introducing its Prime Air drone program in the region but it has now suspended those efforts due the regulatory and operational challenges. The Prime Air initiative by Amazon was first introduced in 2013. The company planned to deliver packages in under 30 minutes with the help of autonomous drones. While the company carried out some pilot programs in the US and the UK and was planning to scale the service across Europe. But this plan is proven to be difficult due to strict aviation regulations, safety concerns, and logistical hurdles.Italy was seen as a potential hub for drone delivery given its dense urban centers and growing e-commerce market. However, industry insiders suggest that regulatory complexities and infrastructure readiness played a role in Amazon’s decision to pause. The company is expected to continue working with European regulators to refine its approach before reintroducing the service.Amazon continues to test drone delivery in select U.S. cities, including California and Texas, where it has received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The company has also been investing in next-generation drones designed to handle heavier payloads and fly longer distances. Despite setbacks in Italy, Amazon insists that drone delivery remains a long-term priority in its quest to revolutionize logistics.","The Prime Air initiative by Amazon was first introduced in 2013.

A Chinese billionaire has a similar wish as Telegram founder Pavel Durov ’s – build a ‘dynasty of successors’, including fathering nearly two dozen US-born children who can inherit and manage his $1.1 billion fortune he has amassed through his gaming company – one of China’s largest mobile gaming entities. Xu Bo, the founder of Guangzhou Duoyi Network, has purportedly fathered over 100 children but is not looking to pass down his fortune in his home country.According to recent reports by Fortune and Wall Street Journal, and court testimonies, the 48-year-old entrepreneur aims to father at least 20 US-born kids specifically to inherit his video game fortune. Bo wants to leverage US-based surrogacy to bypass domestic birth restrictions and secure American-born heirs.Citing Xu’s video game company, a Wall Street Journal reported that Xu has more than 100 children born through surrogates based in the US, and has been allegedly seeking “50 high-quality sons,” as per accounts linked to Xu on Chinese microblogging website Weibo. One of the accounts also claim that according to Xu, “having more children can solve all problems.”While Duoyi Network recently denied claims that Xu has fathered over 100 children, they did accept that 12 were born in the US.Last month, an ex-girlfriend reportedly alleged that Xu’s biological reach extended to as many as 300 children worldwide.Xu Bo is not alone in his quest for a massive legion of heirs as he joins a growing list of ultra-wealthy men using modern technology to expand their biological legacies: Pavel Durov and Elon Musk Durov, worth $14.2 billion, recently revealed he has fathered over 100 children across 12 countries via sperm donation.

iOS 26.3: Expected release timeline





Apple’s next software update for iPhones – iOS 26.3 is expected to launch in early next year. The update is still under testing and is expected to come with some major improvements like a new Transfer to Android system, expanded notifications and wearable support in Europe and more. Here’s everything we know about iOS 26.3 so farWith iOS 26.3, Apple is expected to improve data transfer between iPhones and Android devices through collaboration with Google. The update will allow users to move apps, emails, and photos more easily, making it simpler for people switching between the two platforms.In Europe, Apple is said to expand notification support for some third-party smartwatches. While iPhones will be able to work with non-Apple wearables, users will not be able to connect an Apple Watch and a third-party smartwatch at the same time. Apple is also expected to introduce a new Black Unity wallpaper ahead of Black History Month.The update is also expected to bring changes to near-field communication (NFC) and Wi-Fi features in Europe. iOS 26.3 may include updated NFC components that allow better connections with third-party devices. In addition, Apple is expected to enable a faster Wi-Fi radio to improve peer-to-peer sharing between devices.“European users will also get new NFC components to handle third-party device connections and a faster Wi-Fi radio for peer-to-peer sharing. Other Apple users won’t see these features as they’re byproducts of the European Parliament's Digital Marketing Act (DMA) of 2022 that also prompted Apple's switch from lightning ports to USB-C charging,” a BGR report said.These Europe-specific updates are linked to the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, which requires large technology companies to open up certain system features. The same regulations previously led Apple to replace its Lightning charging port with USB-C on newer iPhone models.iOS 17.3 followed in late January 2024 with added Apple Music collaboration features and AirPlay support for hotel TVs. iOS 18.3 was released in late January 2025 and brought updates to Apple Intelligence features. Based on these previous patterns, iOS 26.3 is expected to launch in late January or early February.

The

personal information leak

at Coupang has caused great concern and inconvenience to customers and the public.

As Coupang's founder and chairman of the board, I offer my sincere apologies on behalf of all Coupang employees. I cannot help but feel devastated by the disappointment so many people have experienced.

This

data breach

, which was our responsibility, has left many of you feeling fearful and anxious about the safety of your personal information. Furthermore, we apologize for the frustration and disappointment caused by our failure to communicate clearly and directly from the outset of the incident. We sincerely apologize for our inadequate initial response and lack of communication immediately following the incident.

Above all, my apology is overdue. I fully supported the resolution of the situation by dedicating all resources and manpower to preventing any secondary damage to our customers. Rather than simply apologizing in words, I wanted Coupang to take action and achieve tangible results, taking every possible measure in the best interest of the Korean people. Furthermore, given the rapid pace of change and the proliferation of misinformation, I believed it would be best to communicate publicly and apologize only after all the facts were confirmed.

In retrospect, this was a poor judgment. While Coupang worked tirelessly to resolve the situation, I should have expressed my deepest regrets and sincere apologies from the beginning. My heart has been heavy ever since I first learned of the data breach.

Today, Coupang would like to share the progress of its personal information leak incident and its commitment to reform.

Coupang Korea and its executives and employees prioritized resolving the issue with a strong sense of responsibility to immediately block the possibility of secondary damage and restore customer trust immediately after the incident.

After months of continuous, daily efforts, Coupang recently completed the recovery of 100% of the leaked customer information through cooperation with the government. We have secured a statement from the leaker and recovered all storage devices. This process confirmed that the customer information stored on the leaker's computer was limited to 3,000 records, and that this information was not distributed or sold externally. The investigation is ongoing, and we will provide updates as additional information becomes available.

Coupang has cooperated fully with the government since the beginning of the investigation. Immediately following the incident, we identified the leaker and notified the government. Through cooperation with the government, we promptly recovered the equipment and leaked information, and submitted all relevant documents to the government. Throughout the entire process, we strictly adhered to the government's request for confidentiality, even amidst widespread misinformation.

I believed that recovering 100% of the customer information stolen by the leaker was the only way to ""restore customer trust."" In the process, I neglected communication with the public. I apologize to everyone who pointed out my communication deficiencies, and I humbly accept the criticism and reprimand.

Even after successfully recovering and securing the leaked personal information, we remain deeply aware of our failure to prevent the initial data breach, and we deeply apologize for any concern and inconvenience it may have caused.

We will rebuild trust from the ground up. Led by the Board of Directors, we will develop a compensation plan for Korean customers who experienced inconveniences at Coupang Korea and ensure its swift implementation. Furthermore, to ensure that mistakes like this personal information leak never happen again, we will comprehensively revamp Coupang's information security measures and investments. We will fulfill our responsibilities and ensure that necessary investments and improvements are not delayed.

We will use this failure as a lesson learned and a springboard for growth, building a world-class cybersecurity system. We will thoroughly investigate the causes of security vulnerabilities and innovate our security systems. Once the government's final investigation results are available, we will develop and implement measures to prevent recurrence based on those findings.

Our customers' trust and expectations are the reason Coupang exists. We will use this incident as an opportunity to thoroughly reinvent ourselves and never stop challenging ourselves to create the world's best customer experience.

I once again apologize to the people.

Bill Ackman warns California on the path of self-destruction





California may soon witnesses an exodus of some of its most prominent tech billionaires. As reported by New York Times, venture capitalist Pete Theil and Google co-founder Larry Page are thinking of cutting down and reducing their ties to the state before the end of the year. The reason behind this decision is a proposed ballot measure that would impose 5% tax on residents worth more than $1 billion. The initiative is backed by the health care union SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, could raise up to $100 billion from about 200 billionaires is approved. If passed, it would retroactively apply to anyone who lived in California as of January 1, 2026. Larry Page, whose net worth is estimated at $258 billion, the tax could mean a one-time bill of more than $12 billion. On the other hand, for Peter Thiel, worth around $27.5 billion, the liability could exceed $1.2 billion.58 year-old Pete Theil who owns a home on the Hollywood Hills has explored the idea of opening an office for Thiel Capital in another state and spending more time outside California. On the other hand, 52-year old Page a longtime resident of Palo Alto is reportedly discussing to leave the region by end of this year. In December, three LLCs linked to him filed incorporation documents in Florida, signaling preparations for relocation.Governor Gavin Newsom has spoken out against the measure, calling state-level wealth taxes “not pragmatic.” He is raising funds for a committee to oppose the proposal, which has already received donations from Silicon Valley investors such as Ron Conway. Tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya also warned of an exodus, writing: “The inevitable outcome will be an exodus of the state’s most talented entrepreneurs who can and will choose to build their companies in less regressive states. ”Bill Ackman the hedge fund billionaire also raised alarm over California’s economic future as the wealthiest residents of the state are planning to leave due to the proposed tax targeting billionaires. Ackman echoed similar concerns in a post on X, “California is on a path to self-destruction. Hollywood is already toast and now the most productive entrepreneurs will leave taking their tax revenues and job creation elsewhere.And then the Democrats highlight @CAgovernor Newsom as a great leader. Crazy.”Ackman has criticised the political leadership of California and believes that the proposed aggressive tax policies are pushing the entrepreneurs out. These people are the ones who drive both the job market and economic growth.The debate comes amid growing concerns about income inequality in the United States. Data from the Congressional Budget Office shows the top 10% of families hold 69% of wealth, while the bottom 50% hold just 3%.California’s Legislative Analyst’s Office estimates the tax could generate tens of billions in one-time payments. However, they warn that long-term income tax revenues could decline by hundreds of millions annually if billionaires leave.","Venture capitalist Pete Theil and Google co-founder Larry Page are thinking of cutting down and reducing their ties to the state.

Apple AirPods Pro 3: Smarter, Fitter & Louder

Why Apple rejected the two colours for AirPods



Apple launched AirPods Pro 3 with heart rate sensors, Live Translation this year







Almost after nine years of launch of first Apple AirPods, a new leak has surfaced online showing that Apple experimented with Bright Pink and Yellow charging cases before settling on the all-while look which became synonymous with the product. According to popular leaker Koustami, the bright colour prototypes of AirPods were part of Apple’s internal design validation testing in 2016, but the colours were abandoned at the last moment.This is not the first time that Apple’s experiment with colour has come into light. Back in 2023, Koustami revealed that Apple has thought of AirPods in Pink, PRODUCT(RED), Purple, Black, and Blonde finishes to match the then-new iPhone 7 lineup. While some images showed pale pink or skin-tone prototypes, the newly revealed bright yellow case is a fresh addition to the list of scrapped designs.It is said that Apple wanted the AirPods to complement the colour palette of iPhone 7 which included silver, gold, rose gold, and black. The company also planned a new purple iPhone 7 which was cancelled before the official launch. Ultimately, Apple decided against releasing colored AirPods, sticking with the minimalist white design that echoed its earlier iPod-era headphones.The decision helped cement AirPods as a recognizable accessory, though it meant abandoning more playful options.Since the launch in 2016, Apple AirPods have become of the most successful Apple products with the white charging case and earbuds becoming instantly recognizable worldwide. While third-party companies have offered custom-painted versions in various colors, Apple itself has never officially launched AirPods in anything other than white.Nearly half a decade after their debut, AirPods Pro are getting refreshed for the third time, three years after their last outing. Apple has added a heart sensor, improved the sound, and enhanced the active noise cancellation.Apple says they've redesigned the airflow system inside the earbuds that widens the sound stage. The ear tips are now foam-infused, doubling the noise cancellation compared to the previous generation AirPods Pro. Apple says the difference is ""night-and-day"" when compared to the original AirPods Pro from 2019.The AirPods Pro 3, in Apple's words, are the ""best fitting AirPods ever."" Apple said it analysed tens of thousands of ears and made each earbud smaller to fit ear canals better. To ensure a better fit, Apple will be shipping five sizes of ear tips with these. They're now also IP57 sweat and water resistant.The ""awe-dropping"" moment of the AirPods Pro 3 is the new heart sensor, which uses a custom photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor that ""shines invisible infrared light pulsed at 256 times per second to measure light absorption in blood flow."" It's the smallest sensor from Apple ever.The heart rate sensor, when paired with AirPods Pro's other sensors like accelerometers, gyroscope, and GPS, can track heart rate, calories burned, and activity (supporting up to 50 workouts). These advanced computational models work in tandem with Apple Intelligence on iPhone, and you can see all the tracked stats in the Fitness app (just like you do with Apple Watch).",Bright Pink and Yellow charging cases were part of Apple’s internal design validation testing in 2016.

Sarah Walker , Cisco's UK and Ireland managing director who spent 25 years climbing the corporate ladder at BT before joining the tech giant, has identified this as her biggest hiring red flag—and warns that resting on past achievements won't cut it in today's workplace.""I can't stand arrogance. Be confident, but have a level of humility,"" Walker told Fortune. While she actively seeks out candidates with positive attitudes, engagement, and energy—qualities she believes can't be taught—excessive ego remains an instant dealbreaker regardless of experience level.Walker's hiring philosophy prioritizes personality over pedigree, especially for entry-level positions. ""It's more about the person first and foremost than it is about skills or experience,"" she explained. The 45-year-old executive believes that while technical abilities become increasingly important in specialist roles, someone with the right attitude and willingness to learn can still secure a position over more experienced candidates.""You don't need to be the finished article to be promoted, but we need to know that you are in a position where within a reasonable timeframe, you'll have invested the time to upskill and develop,"" Walker added, emphasizing that growth potential matters more than current capabilities.Walker's anti-arrogance stance applies equally to senior positions. ""You can't rest on your laurels because you've done something well in the past, you need to be thinking about what's the next great thing that you'll do,"" she stressed. ""Even at my level, you have to be open to the fact that there's lots more yet to learn and grow and adapt.""This philosophy aligns with her Cisco predecessor David Meads, who told Fortune that ""EQ is at least as important as IQ"" when evaluating talent, noting he sees ""no difference in terms of the capability"" between candidates with or without degrees.","Sarah Walker, Cisco's UK and Ireland managing director, prioritizes personality over pedigree.

OpenAI explains the Head of Preparedness role

“As the Head of Preparedness, you will lead the technical strategy and execution of OpenAI’s Preparedness framework, our framework explaining OpenAI’s approach to tracking and preparing for frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm. You will be the directly responsible leader for building and coordinating capability evaluations, threat models, and mitigations that form a coherent, rigorous, and operationally scalable safety pipeline.

This role requires deep technical judgment, clear communication, and the ability to guide complex work across multiple risk domains. You will lead a small, high-impact team to drive core Preparedness research, while partnering broadly across Safety Systems and OpenAI for end-to-end adoption and execution of the framework.

In this role, you will:

Own OpenAI’s preparedness strategy end-to-end by building capability evaluations, establishing threat models, and building and coordinating mitigations.

Lead the development of frontier capability evaluations, ensuring they are precise, robust, and scalable across rapid product cycles.

Oversee mitigation design across major risk areas (e.g., cyber, bio), ensuring safeguards are technically sound, effective, and aligned with underlying threat models.

Guide interpretation of evaluation results and ensure they directly inform launch decisions, policy choices, and safety cases.

Refine and evolve the preparedness framework as new risks, capabilities, or external expectations emerge.

Collaborate cross-functionally with research, engineering, product teams, policy monitoring and enforcement teams, governance, and external partners to integrate preparedness into real-world deployment.""

Read Sam Altman’s hiring post

""We are hiring a Head of Preparedness. This is a critical role at an important time; models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges. The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities.

We have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities, but we are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides both in our products and in the world, in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits. These questions are hard and there is little precedent; a lot of ideas that sound good have some real edge cases.

If you want to help the world figure out how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can't use them for harm, ideally by making all systems more secure, and similarly for how we release biological capabilities and even gain confidence in the safety of running systems that can self-improve, please consider applying.

This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.""

Tesla Bull Dan Ives on Europe’s AI development ambitions: They have to choose if they want to compete or…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-bull-dan-ives-on-europes-ai-development-ambitions-they-have-to-choose-if-they-want-to-compete-or/articleshow/126209113.cms,"""It's like a fork in the road moment for Europe.” He said that the bloc can either “play in the future”

“missing a big part of this technology wave.""

How environmental policies may be driving away AI companies from Europe

“You can see in the U.K. that we’re already rowing back on some of our commitments.”

“This is a fairly regular process that, when times are good, it’s easy to persuade individuals, businesses, and governments to move in the right direction on things like climate change and to take some of the cost associated with doing that,”

“Electricity wise, we might not be able to afford to close down coal power plants, which is going to be a real headache for the energy transition and energy security as well,”





Europe needs to choose between competing in artificial intelligence (AI) development and maintaining its stringent climate goals, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives has suggested. Ives, who is also an investor in Tesla, has warned that Europe risks falling behind in the AI race due to its energy constraints. The region faces a fundamental challenge as energy emerges as the primary bottleneck for AI-related data centre projects globally. While the United States activates fossil-fuel plants to power its AI infrastructure buildout, Europe requires developers to disclose energy and water efficiency measures, creating regulatory obstacles that can delay project launches.In an interview with CNBC, Ives said,or riskThe tension between AI ambitions and environmental commitments has intensified as the computational demands of AI development continue to escalate, forcing policymakers to confront whether the region's world-leading climate standards are compatible with remaining competitive in one of the most strategically essential technology sectors.The European Union (EU) is recognised for its environmental policies and initiatives, like the upcoming carbon border tax. However, some critics argue that these regulations hinder business operations. Europe is viewed as ""anti-entrepreneur"", Ives said, which causes European technology companies and startups to relocate to the US, the Middle East, or Asia, where they find more business-friendly policies.As Europe tries to keep pace with AI development, the need for energy-intensive infrastructure grows, and electricity demand increases, making this tension harder to ignore. New renewable energy capacity was meant to replace polluting energy sources, but concerns are emerging that this transition may not happen as planned.Paul Jackson, regional global market strategist at Invesco, told CNBC,He predicts Europe may also join that bandwagon.Jackson added.However, when lawmakers face difficult economic conditions and conflicting priorities, lowering the importance of climate policies becomes one of the simplest actions they can take, he added.The UK has eliminated coal from its energy grid, which is much more polluting than gas, but Europe has not yet achieved this.“I’m worried that, at a certain stage, coal power plant closures might get actually postponed,” Jags Walia, head of global listed infrastructure at Van Lanschot Kempen, said to CNBC.Replacing fossil-fuel power plants with renewable energy sources works well when energy demand remains steady, but that is no longer the case, he said. Data centres also require an uninterrupted power supply, so the intermittent nature of wind and solar energy could pose challenges.Walia noted..Throughout the year, Europe has weakened several environmental commitments. Recently, the EU reduced its effective ban on new combustion-engine cars from 2035, the report noted.Earlier this month, Europe also delayed implementation of a new EU emissions trading system for buildings, road transport and small industries by one year despite the region’s commitment to reducing emissions by 90% by 2040.Earlier this year, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence and Corporate Sustainability Reporting directives were also narrowed and postponed.","Europe needs to choose between competing in artificial intelligence (AI) development and maintaining its stringent climate goals, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives has suggested.

China has issued draft rules aimed to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) for public comments, reports Reuters. According to the news agency, the move highlights the country’s efforts to shape rapid rollout of consumer-centric AI. The draft rules apply to AI products and services offered to the public in China that mimic human traits, thinking patterns and communication styles. These services interact with users through text, images, audio or video and are often designed to respond emotionally.Under the proposed rules, AI service providers in China will be required to warn users against excessive use and step in if users show signs of addiction. AI companies will also need to take responsibility for safety across the entire product lifecycle, including setting up systems for algorithm checks, data security and protection of personal information.As part of the draft rules, the Chinese government also aims to address mental health risks. Per the Reuters report, AI service providers will be expected to identify users’ emotional states and levels of dependence on the service.If users display extreme emotions or addictive behaviour, companies would be required to take action to reduce potential harm.In addition, the rules set clear limits on content. AI services would be prohibited from generating material that threatens national security, spreads rumours, or promotes violence or obscene content, the report said.The draft rules are open for public feedback before being finalised.","China has issued draft rules aimed to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) The move highlights the country’s efforts to shape rapid rollout of consumer-centric AI.

Tech leaders rally behind Intel CEO amid China investment scrutiny

Historic government equity deal follows successful White House pitch





Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan called upon two of Silicon Valley's most influential leaders—Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Nvidia's Jensen Huang—to vouch for him with President Donald Trump after the president publicly demanded his resignation over alleged China ties, according to Reuters. The behind-the-scenes outreach, which occurred in August 2025 following Trump's social media attack calling Tan ""highly conflicted,"" preceded what became the most pivotal 40-minute meeting of Tan's career—one that transformed presidential hostility into an $8.9 billion government investment and gave Intel a ""too-strategic-to-fail"" status.Tan strategically turned to Nadella and Huang because both tech leaders had already cultivated relationships with Trump and visited the White House, two people familiar with the discussions told Reuters. The endorsements proved crucial as Tan prepared to defend himself against accusations stemming from his 600 investments in Chinese companies, some allegedly linked to the country's military.The meeting, attended only by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, proved transformative for Intel. Tan successfully convinced Trump of his commitment to American interests despite having made some 600 investments in China, including companies allegedly linked to the country's military.The CEO's preparation extended beyond seeking endorsements. Reuters reported that Tan strategised with advisors on presenting his personal story as an American patriot while addressing concerns about his China holdings. His dealmaking background—built over a career that amassed him an estimated fortune exceeding $500 million—proved crucial during negotiations.The meeting culminated in a groundbreaking agreement where the U.S. government invested $8.9 billion for nearly 10% of Intel, giving the chipmaker what sources described as a ""too-strategic-to-fail"" status. Within weeks, Tan secured a $5 billion partnership with Nvidia, with Huang calling Tan his ""long-time friend.""Microsoft's Nadella later publicly endorsed the arrangement, stating the partnership ""will benefit the country and broader technology ecosystem for years to come.""Trump's initial hostility transformed dramatically—just days after demanding Tan's resignation, the president praised his ""amazing story"" following their meeting. The deal opened doors to potential partners eager to win presidential favor and may herald a new era of U.S. industrial policy through government equity stakes in strategic businesses.Intel shares have risen approximately 80% since Tan's March appointment, though the company faces ongoing challenges in manufacturing and AI strategy.","Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan called upon two of Silicon Valley's most influential leaders to vouch for him with President Donald Trump.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has issued a warning on social media, suggesting that the move by New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to appoint Lillian Bonsignore as the next Commissioner of the Fire Department of New York (FDNY), compromise public safety and “will” lead to deaths. The controversy centres around the professional background of Bonsignore. She is a 31-year veteran whose career is built entirely within the department’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS).“People will die because of this. Proven experience matters when lives are at stake,” Musk wrote in a post that quickly went viral. Not just Musk, David Sacks, Tech founder, investor and President Donald Trump's AI head, has also replied to the post on Bonsignore’s appointment.“Pray for NYC,” Sacks said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).Musk argues that leading the FDNY requires a background in active firefighting – an experience Bonsignore does not have. Bonsignore started as an EMT in 1991 and eventually rose to become chief of EMS, notably overseeing operations during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic before retiring in 2022.“I know the job. I know the what the firefighters need and I can translate that to this Administration who's willing to listen.I know what EMS needs. I have been EMS for 30 plus years,” she said. Mayor-elect Mamdani has stood firmly by the appointment, framing it as a historic milestone. Bonsignore will be the department's first openly gay commissioner.FDNY data reveals that more than 70 per cent of all emergency calls are now handled by EMS units, not fire engines.

What does Groq LPUs offer







Nvidia lost billions of dollars from its market value after a report claimed that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is partnering with Google to train its AI models on the search giant’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). As one of Nvidia’s largest customers, Meta’s shift toward alternative hardware sent shockwaves through the semiconductor giant, triggering a cascading effect. In this article, we explore the key differences between Nvidia’s GPUs and Google TPUs, while also examining the LPUs from Groq – the startup Nvidia recently acquired in a strategic $20 billion defensive move.Nvidia originally designed Graphics Processing Units, or GPUs for rendering 3D graphics. They have thousands of small cores that can handle many tasks simultaneously. Since they are General Purpose, they can be used for AI, gaming, crypto mining and scientific simulations.Google’s TPU, on the other hand, is an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit which has been specifically designed from the ground up by Google for one specific purpose: speeding up the “tensor” math that powers machine learning.Nvidia GPUs can be bought. Whether it is a $1,000 gaming card or a $30,000 H100 enterprise chip, companies can purchase them and run them in their own data centres. Larger the number of chips, larger the processing power and better the models’ training.When it comes to Google TPUs, you cannot cannot buy them. Google does not sell the physical chips, instead offers to ‘rent’ them through Google Cloud Platform, allowing partners to train their models. This means, if you want TPUs, you must stay in Google's ecosystem and cannot run the hardware in your data centre.The critical difference is speed. Nvidia GPUs are ‘king’ of Training , which means teaching an AI model from scratch. Most major AI labs like OpenAI, Meta, xAI and Google itself uses massive clusters of Nvidia H100s/B200s to build their models.Google TPUs are dominant in Inference – running the model and getting an answer. Since TPUs are designed for speed, they can provide AI “answers” to millions of users simultaneously with less lag, faster than GPUs.One of the reasons is the difference in software. AI researchers know how to use Nvidia’s CUDA as it is the ‘language’ of AI. Moving to Google’s TPU often requires rewriting code or switching frameworks. Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian recently said that the company makes its models compatible with Nvidia GPUs and they are a partner.Groq Language Processing Unit is a new category of processor with an AI Inference Technology that is claimed to deliver “AI compute speed, quality, and affordability at scale” – just like Google TPUs.“Groq created and built the LPU from the ground up to meet the unique needs of AI. LPUs run Large Language Models (LLMs) and other leading models at substantially faster speeds and, on an architectural level, up to 10x more efficiently from an energy perspective compared to GPUs,” the company said. By offering LPUs, along with GPUs, Nvidia is essentially aiming to offer power, speed and efficiency at one-stop shop.","Nvidia lost billions of dollars from its market value after a report claimed that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is partnering with Google to train its AI models on the search giant’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) In this article, we explore the key differences between Nvidia’S GPUs and Google TPUs, while also examining the LPUs from Groq – the startup Nvidia acquired in a strategic $20 billion defensive move.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126204201,imgsize-164145,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-chip-showdown-nvidia-vs-google.jpg"

How to stay safe

Always refrain from clicking on links present in text messages that offer loans, investments or job offers.

Always verify the contact number of the sender as fraudulent SMS often come from random and unusual numbers.

It is important to report suspicious messages to the government’s cybercrime portal (cybercrime.gov.in).

Also, the users must enable spam filters on their smartphones which helps in blocking bulk SMS.

Users should always contact their bank immediately if they suspect any scam and should also update their passwords regularly.





The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) recently launched a major crackdown against a cybercrime network operating SIM Box devices in Delhi, Noida and Chandigarh, as reported by Times of India. As per the report, the raids covered a large-scale phishing operation, with investigators seizing more than 21,000 illegally procured SIM cards. The discovery highlights how criminals are exploiting the telecom loopholes to run scams that target unsuspecting citizens across India.A SIM Box is a device which is designed to hold hundreds of SIM cards simultaneously. The fraudsters use it to disguise international calls as local ones, bypassing telecom charges and regulations. The SIM Boxes are used to send bulk SMS messages which contain phishing links, fake loan offers and fraudulent investment schemes. By masking their operations, criminals make it harder for authorities to trace the origin of these scams.The scam typically starts when criminals acquire thousands of SIM cards mainly due fake identities. These SIMs are loaded into SIM Boxes connected to serves and dongles. The system then sends out lakhs of SMS messages daily, tricking victims into clicking malicious links or sharing sensitive banking details. The CBI investigation revealed that even foreign cybercriminals were using these services to cheat Indian citizens, making the scam a transnational threat.The SIM Box scam poses multiple risks.

This enhancement comes in response to security risks where accounts could be secretly paired with a partner's or unauthorised person's Apple Watch. This feature can remove any particular concern in abusive relationships where technology is often used for surveillance and control.The new peripherals category is similar to the already available 'Linked Devices' section meant for other connected devices. This section displays the name of any associated Apple Watch along with the date and time it was last active. This will gives users visibility into which wearable devices have access to their WhatsApp messages and conversations.However, the feature currently has a significant limitation.Unlike other linked devices such as Mac computers or WhatsApp Web sessions, users cannot remotely unlink a paired Apple Watch directly from the iPhone app's settings. Instead, the app instructs users they must physically delete WhatsApp from the Apple Watch itself to unpair the device. This is a major restriction that could hinder users trying to remove unauthorised access without physical possession of the Watch.The update arrives just weeks after WhatsApp launched its native Apple Watch app, expanding the messaging platform's reach to wearable devices. Beyond these security enhancements for linked devices, Meta is also developing improvements to WhatsApp's chat, attachment, and storage management interfaces, according to the beta testing reports.Shortly after launching TestFlight build 25.37.10.71, Meta has rolled out another beta version featuring a new tool aimed at making chat management and storage cleanup easier.According to WABetaInfo's findings, the newer build 25.37.10.72 addsThe tool offers a more organized approach to managing conversation storage, allowing users to delete all messages within a chat, remove everything except starred messages, or eliminate media files. The interface also displays the storage space occupied by each category.By tapping, users gain access to granular controls for selecting which types of content to remove—including documents, photos, videos, stickers, and audio files—before finalizing the deletion.Users can also opt to wipe all media content in one action, which includes media that has been starred.Neither feature has a confirmed release date, though the storage clearing tool's appearance in the Android beta suggests its public launch may be approaching relatively soon","Users can now see paired Apple Watches in 'Linked Devices' This addresses concerns about unauthorized access, especially in abusive relationships.

Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun to computer science graduates: Your degrees won't count if you ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/godfather-of-ai-yann-lecun-to-computer-science-graduates-your-degrees-wont-count-if-you-/articleshow/126202251.cms,"What Is Artificial Intelligence?

Yann LeCun clarifies his statement

Yann LeCun on vibe coding





Meta’s chief AI scientist and one of the godfathers of AI Yann LeCun recently said that computer science degrees may not matter if graduates do not spend their time wisely, per a Business Insider report. Advising computer science students, LeCun said that they must “learn things with a long shelf life.” “If you are a CS major and take the minimum required math courses for a typical CS curriculum, you might find yourself unable to adapt to major technological shifts,” LeCun said in an emailed statement to the publication.During an appearance on ""The Information Bottleneck"" podcast, Yann LeCun said “What we should do is learn kind of basic things in mathematics, in modeling, mathematics that can be connected with reality.”“You tend to learn this kind of stuff in engineering in some schools that's linked with computer science, but sort of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, et cetera,” he added.In the podcast, LeCun jokingly pointed out that he did not initially study CS. He said some CS schools in the US are linked to engineering programs, which tend to require more advanced math. “Engineering disciplines, you know, in the US, you learn Calculus 1, 2, 3 that gives you a good basis, right?” LeCun said, adding “In computer science, you can get away with just Calculus 1.That's not enough, right?”.He also joked that he's “a computer science professor arguing against studying computer science”.Clarifying his statement later, Yann LeCun told BI “My recommendation was not to avoid CS as a major but to take the maximum number of courses on foundations (e.g. math, physics, or EE courses) rather than take courses on the trendy technology du jour.”Sharing his views on vibe coding, LeCun said that basic programming should not be thrown out. Vibe coding is nice, but it's not a substitute for fundamental knowledge, he said.“Obviously, you need to learn enough computer science to kind of program and use computers. And even though AI is going to help you be more efficient at programming, you still need to know how to do this”, LeCun said.","Yann LeCun said that computer science degrees may not matter if graduates do not spend their time wisely.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

Productivity gains remain uncertain as AI models improve





Andrej Karpathy, Tesla's former AI director and OpenAI cofounder, has issued what amounts to an open letter to the entire software engineering profession, warning that developers face an unprecedented challenge as AI fundamentally reshapes how code gets written. In a post on X that has sparked widespread debate, Karpathy confessed: ""I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between.""The candid admission from one of AI's most influential figures highlights the seismic shift happening in software development. Karpathy, who led AI development at Tesla for five years and helped steer the company's Autopilot effort, described feeling inadequate despite his expertise. ""I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue,"" he wrote.His post outlines a new reality where programmers must master what he calls a ""new programmable layer of abstraction"" involving agents, subagents, prompts, contexts, memory modes, MCP protocols, and IDE integrations.The challenge, Karpathy explains, is building a mental model for ""fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. ""The evolution Karpathy describes represents a dramatic departure from the ""vibe coding"" approach he famously coined in February 2025. Back then, he described casually asking AI to make changes while barely reading code diffs, accepting all suggestions, and working around bugs rather than fixing them properly. ""It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing,"" he wrote at the time.Now, even Karpathy acknowledges the limitations. When building his recent project Nanochat, he admitted it was ""basically entirely hand-written"" because AI agents ""just didn't work well enough at all and net unhelpful."" The admission underscores the gap between AI coding hype and reality, even as the technology rapidly improves.Boris Cherny, creator of Anthropic's Claude Code, responded to Karpathy's post by sharing his own revelation: ""The last month was my first month as an engineer that I didn't open an IDE at all. Opus 4.5 wrote around 200 PRs, every single line."" Cherny described how newer developers without ""legacy memories"" of older models often use AI more effectively than veterans, requiring ""significant mental work to re-adjust to what the model can do every month or two. ""Despite the rapid advancement, research suggests AI coding tools don't always boost productivity. A METR study from July found that AI assistants decreased experienced developers' productivity by 19%, though participants expected a 20% boost. Management consultants Bain & Company reported that programming showed ""unremarkable"" savings despite being ""one of the first areas to deploy generative AI.""Yet industry leaders remain optimistic. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in November that vibe coding is making software development ""so much more enjoyable"" and ""exciting again,"" with AI now writing over 30% of new code at Google. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei claimed in October that Claude was writing 90% of the company's code.Karpathy concluded his post with an urgent call to action: ""Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.""","Tesla's ex-AI chief, Andrej Karpathy, warns software engineers face a seismic shift.

Oracle stock is at its lowest level since 2001 and many investors are blaming it on Sam Altman's OpenAI deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/oracle-stock-is-at-its-lowest-level-since-2001-and-many-investors-are-blaming-it-on-sam-altmans-openai-deal/articleshow/126201641.cms,"Technology stocks, including Nvidia and Broadcom, also declined, impacting the S&P 500 and semiconductor index.

How Oracle went from from super high to deep lows in 2025





Just three months into their tenure as co-CEOs, Oracle’s Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia are facing a brutal market reckoning. Shares of the database giant have plummeted 30% this quarter, putting the stock on track for its worst performance since the 2001 dot-com crash. The sell-off reflects growing investor anxiety over Oracle’s high-stakes pivot toward artificial intelligence infrastructure—a shift that requires unprecedented levels of debt and capital expenditure to support its massive partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI The honeymoon period for the new leadership ended abruptly this month following a disappointing earnings report. While Oracle secured a landmark $300 billion commitment from OpenAI in September, Wall Street is questioning the cost of fulfilling that deal. Investors are worried that if OpenAI struggles to raise sufficient funding or generate enough revenue as competition intensifies, Oracle could be left holding the bag. Analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets reportedly estimated in September that Oracle may need to add $100 billion in debt over the next four years to fund its OpenAI contract.Finance chief Doug Kehring recently stunned analysts by projecting $50 billion in capital expenditures for fiscal 2026 -- double the previous year’s total.To fuel this expansion, Oracle is planning $248 billion in leases for cloud capacity and data centers.This aggressive build-out is being funded by ""boatloads of debt,"" including a $18 billion bond sale in September. While Oracle maintains it will protect its investment-grade credit rating, the rising price of the company’s credit default swaps suggests bondholders are increasingly nervous.“Considering Oracle is already barely hanging on to an investment-grade rating, we would be concerned about Oracle’s ability to live up to these obligations,” analysts at D.A. Davidson warned in a recent note.The current slump stands in stark contrast to the historic optimism seen just weeks ago. In September, reports of the OpenAI deal sent Oracle shares to an all-time high of $345.72. Since that peak, the stock has shed 43% of its value, closing Wednesday at $197.49.Analysts at FactSet predict Oracle’s gross margins could slide from 77% (seen in 2021) to 49% by 2030, with billions in negative free cash flow expected over the next five years.Oracle's deals to provide AI infrastructure require the company to build expensive data centers filled with powerful GPUs before any revenue is recognized. Oracle entered the AI boom with a debt-heavy balance sheet, and the situation is worsening as the company borrows to fuel its AI ambitions. Thanks to heavy spending on AI infrastructure, Oracle ended the second quarter with about $108 billion in debt. That's up from $92.6 billion in May. The company completed an $18 billion bond sale in September.","Oracle shares have plummeted 30% this quarter, putting the stock on track for its worst performance since the 2001 dot-com crash.

This strategy, fueled by substantial resources and infrastructure, aims to counter intense competition from rivals like OpenAI and Meta.

Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more

Google taps large pool of ex-employees following 2023 layoffs

Competitors also aggressively pursuing AI engineering talent





Google has intensified its battle for AI talent by bringing back former employees, with 20% of its AI software engineer hires in 2025 being so-called boomerang workers—a notable increase from previous years, CNBC has learned. The tech giant confirmed the statistic remains accurate as of December and reported a surge in AI researchers joining from major competitors compared to 2024.The company's aggressive rehiring strategy comes as it competes with OpenAI , Meta, and Anthropic in the heated AI talent wars. Google's head of compensation John Casey told employees that AI-focused engineers are attracted to the company's substantial financial resources and computational infrastructure needed for advanced AI work, according to audio reviewed by CNBC.Google has a large pool of former employees to recruit from, particularly after its largest-ever layoff round in early 2023 when parent company Alphabet cut 12,000 jobs—a 6% workforce reduction. The company has since continued with rolling layoffs and buyouts as part of ongoing efficiency measures.The boomerang trend extends beyond Google, with ADP Research data showing increased employee returns across the industry, particularly in the information sector.Among notable returns, Google brought back AI pioneer Noam Shazeer in late 2024. Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas had left Google in 2021 to start Character.AI after the company reportedly rebuffed their chatbot development efforts, but rejoined DeepMind in August 2024 under a licensing deal.The competition for AI talent remains fierce across the industry. Microsoft hired around two dozen employees from Google's DeepMind earlier this year, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed in June that Meta had been offering $100 million signing bonuses. Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who came out of retirement in 2023, has personally reached out to prospective candidates, according to people familiar with the matter.Despite the competitive landscape, Google has made progress in its AI efforts. The company announced its latest Gemini 3 model last month, and Alphabet's stock price has risen more than 60% this year, outperforming all megacap peers.","Google is aggressively re-hiring former AI talent, with 20% of its AI software engineer hires in 2025 expected to be 'boomerang workers' This strategy, fueled by substantial resources and infrastructure, aims to counter intense competition from rivals like OpenAI and Meta.

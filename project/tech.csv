What Gradiant Technology said on CEO Anurag Bajpayee's arrest

What are charge charges against Anurag Bajpayee

Anurag Bajpayee is a celebrated tech leader

Anurag Bajpayee , CEO and co-founder of Gradiant Technology , a billion-dollar water technology company, has been arrested in a high-profile US investigation involving high-end brothels allegedly linked to sex trafficking. The case has shocked both the tech industry and academic circles, given Bajpayee’s credentials as an MIT-trained engineer and entrepreneur. The Indian-American technologist, engineer, and entrepreneur co-founded Gradiant in 2013, a global water technology company now valued at over $1 billion.The company has defended Anurag Bajpayee, while reiterating a muddled promise of excellence in public remarks amid controversy. Gradiant has asserted that it is placing trust in the judicial process — and its own company. “We believe in the justice system and are confident that this will resolve favorably in due course,” said Gradiant representative Felix Wang in a statement to Wall Street Journal. “Unrelated to this, Gradiant will continue to pursue excellence in technological innovation and to strive towards our mission to ensure clean water for all society.”Dozens of men, Bajpayee included, were named in court documents last month, accusing them all of paying hundreds of dollars per hour for sex and a “girlfriend experience” with predominantly Asian women being exploited through sex trafficking, the Wall Street Journal reported.According to U.S. federal prosecutors, the women involved were mostly Asian, and some may have been victims of trafficking and coercion. Clients paid between $250 and $600 per hour for what was described as “escort-level girlfriend experiences.” Investigators allege that Bajpayee visited these establishments multiple times and was recorded communicating with the operators.The charges against him are misdemeanors, but the wider investigation remains ongoing. Federal officials are examining the potential for related charges, including links to trafficking or racketeering.Bajpayee previously stood as a celebrated leader in water treatment technology and was even credited in Scientific American’s annual Top 10 World-Changing Ideas list. Born in India, Bajpayee studied at La Martiniere College in Lucknow, a prestigious private school.He earned his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Missouri-Columbia in 2006, followed by a Master’s (2008) and Ph.D. (2012) in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Gradiant began as an MIT lab project and quickly evolved into one of the most promising clean-tech startups of the 2010s. Under Bajpayee’s leadership, the company expanded globally, offering solutions in wastewater treatment, desalination, water recycling, and industrial water reuse. Its clients include major players in the semiconductor, pharmaceutical, energy, and food sectors.","Anurag Bajpayee, CEO and co-founder of Gradiant Technology, has been arrested in a high-profile US investigation involving high-end brothels allegedly linked to sex trafficking.

"Airtel, Tata DTH merger talks fail, Airtel informs BSE: 'After not being able to find a ...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-tata-dth-merger-talks-fail-airtel-informs-bse-after-not-being-able-to-find-a-/articleshow/120856391.cms,"Poll How likely are you to consider switching to a digital streaming service over traditional DTH? Somewhat likely. Very likely.

Bharti Airtel and the Tata Group have mutually terminated discussions to combine their direct-to-home (DTH) businesses, Airtel Digital TV and Tata Play, after failing to reach a satisfactory agreement, Airtel announced in a stock exchange filing late Saturday. “After not being able to find a satisfactory resolution, the parties have mutually decided to terminate the discussions,” Airtel stated.The talks, first confirmed by Airtel in February following a report by The Economic Times, aimed to merge Tata Play, India’s largest DTH provider, with Bharti Telemedia, a unit of Sunil Mittal ’s telecom giant. The proposed deal would have united two loss-making DTH operations amid a consumer shift toward digital streaming platforms.Sources previously indicated that the merger discussions involved a share swap, with Airtel potentially holding a 52-55% stake in the combined entity, while Tata Play shareholders, including The Walt Disney Co, would retain 45-48%. Both businesses were valued at approximately ₹6,000-7,000 crore each.Tata Play, formerly Tata Sky, is 70% owned by Tata Sons, which acquired a 10% stake from Temasek Holdings in April 2024 for ₹835 crore, valuing the company at around $1 billion. Disney holds a minority stake, acquired through its 2019 purchase of 21st Century Fox.The failed merger would have been the second major consolidation in India’s DTH sector since the 2016 Dish TV-Videocon d2h merger and coincided with the recent formation of JioStar, India’s largest media company, through the Reliance Industries and Disney merger of Star India and Viacom18.The termination leaves both companies to navigate the competitive DTH market independently as digital platforms continue to reshape consumer viewing habits.",Bharti Airtel and the Tata Group mutually terminated discussions to combine their direct-to-home (DTH) businesses.

Dalio, who accurately predicted the 2008 financial crisis, pointed to President Trump’s aggressive tariff policies as a major destabilizing force.Dalio criticized the chaotic implementation of Trump’s tariffs, aimed at boosting U.S. manufacturing and jobs, likening their impact to “throwing rocks into the production system.” He emphasized that the difference between a “stable” and “disruptive” approach to tariffs could determine whether the economy weathers the storm or plunges into chaos.Global markets have been rattled in recent weeks by Trump’s tariff offensive, with fears mounting of an economic downturn. Last week, Trump announced a 90-day pause on most “reciprocal” tariffs, sparing all but those on China, which have surged to at least 145%. Despite the pause, Goldman Sachs economists peg the odds of a U.S. recession within the next year at 45%, a downgrade from their earlier prediction of a recession as the most likely outcome.The warning comes as the U.S., the world’s largest economy, faces growing uncertainty. A recession, defined as two or more consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, could have far-reaching consequences.

Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools

Google claims breakup ""impossible"" without serious consequences

The US Justice Department have asked a federal judge to break up Google's advertising technology business, marking the second government request within a year that could fundamentally reshape the $2 trillion giant. During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for Grand Theft Auto VI, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

“One evening over dinner in San Francisco, I was struck by an irresistibly simple idea. What if any developer from anywhere in the world could create their own applications for the Salesforce platform? And what if we offered to store these apps in an online directory that allowed any Salesforce user to download them?”

5 words from Steve Jobs that led Benioff to gift Apple AppStore.com

How App Store helped iPhone crush Nokia phones

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff once shared how a meeting with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs led to the idea of Salesforce’s app marketplace and how years later, he ‘gifted’ AppStore.com domain to Apple. In a 2019 interview with TechCrunch, Salesforce CTO and co-founder Parker Harris recalled how the idea of an app store came out of a meeting with Jobs. In 2003, Harris along with Marc Benioff and Dave Moellenhoff, visited Steve Jobs in Cupertino, he said.During the meeting, Jobs told the trio that to grow Salesforce, they needed to build a cloud software ecosystem. At that time, the idea of an app store was new for Salesforce, which had just launched (in 1999) as an online service to sell software over the internet.As the conversation moved forward, Benioff asked Jobs what exactly he meant by a cloud ecosystem. To this, Jobs replied that it was up to them to figure out.The idea stayed with Benioff, and a few years later, during a dinner in San Francisco, he thought of creating an online directory where developers could build and share apps for Salesforce users. Marc Benioff writes in his book, Trailblazer”Benioff quickly registered the domain AppStore.com to match his idea. However, when he discussed the name with customers, many did not like the name.Salesforce eventually launched the app marketplace in 2006 under the name AppExchange . In 2007, Salesforce also introduced Force.com, a platform for building and distributing apps through AppExchange.Meanwhile, AppStore.com remained unused.In 2008, Benioff attended a major Apple event where Jobs announced the launch of the App Store for iPhone . During the event, Jobs said five words — ""I give you App Store"" — which surprised Benioff and his team.After the event, Benioff met Jobs backstage and signed over the AppStore.com domain to Apple.The launch of the App Store became a major factor in the iPhone’s success. It created a marketplace for apps, which helped Apple strengthen its hold in the smartphone market and contributed to the decline of companies like Nokia. The Apple App Store then highlighted the importance of software and app ecosystems in the smartphone market, an area where Nokia struggled to compete effectively.Having said that, while the iPhone didn't single-handedly kill Nokia, the App Store's success demonstrated the demand for a wide variety of apps and the value of a user-friendly platform, which Nokia's Symbian and Windows Phone systems failed to deliver.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff once shared how a meeting with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs led to the idea of Salesforce’s app marketplace.

Claude AI-maker Anthropic to buy back employee shares: What it may mean for the AI startup backed by Google and Amazon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/claude-ai-maker-anthropic-to-buy-back-employee-shares-what-it-may-mean-for-the-ai-startup-backed-by-google-and-amazon/articleshow/120848949.cms,"Anthropic, the AI startup backed by Amazon and Google, is planning its first-ever employee share buyback. According to a report by The Information, Anthropic will buy shares from current and former employees at a valuation of $61.5 billion. This matches the valuation from its recent $3.5 billion Series E funding round. The offer, as per the report, will give employees a chance to cash out some of their shares while helping Anthropic hold on to key staff.Employee liquidity programs like this are becoming more common among AI startups. By offering early chances to sell shares, companies hope to keep employees motivated without relying only on high salaries.For those unaware, Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI executives, including CEO Dario Amodei. The company’s value has grown quickly—from about $15 billion in March 2024 to over $60 billion by the end of the year, thanks to major investments from Amazon, Google, and Salesforce Ventures.Anthropic’s chatbot, Claude , has become a strong competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, especially with businesses that value safety and transparency.By the end of 2024, Anthropic’s annualized revenue reached around $1 billion, up from $100 million at the start of the year, according to The Information. The company's fast revenue growth and hiring needs have pushed it to offer better incentives, like share buybacks, to attract top researchers and engineers.Earlier this year, a California judge denied Universal Music Group's bid for a preliminary injunction against Anthropic for using song lyrics to train its AI chatbot, citing an overly broad request and lack of demonstrated irreparable harm. Music publishers, including UMG, Concord, and ABKCO, filed a lawsuit against Anthropic in 2023, alleging copyright infringement involving lyrics from at least 500 songs by artists such as Beyoncé and the Rolling Stones.

""Hi Googlers,

As recent moments like the Gemini 2.5 Pro launch and Cloud Next have shown, there's incredible momentum across the company right now — it's so exciting to see Googlers pull together to deliver on our ambitious product roadmaps. High performance is more important than ever to achieve the goals we've set, and so we're making some changes to further reward top contributors, in all teams across the company.

First, we'll increase the ratings distribution guidance we give to leaders for Outstanding Impact (O). This means more Googlers will have the opportunity to achieve that rating during annual reviews, and their bonus and equity award will be modeled using the O's individual multiplier in 2026.

Second, we're increasing the discretionary budget we give to managers so they can further reward high performers within the Significant Impact rating.

We want to be upfront that to fund this we'll be slightly reducing the bonus and equity individual multipliers for Significant Impact and Moderate Impact ratings. It's important to note that Significant Impact will remain a strong rating — achieving it will still get you more than your target bonus.

The above changes are budget-neutral, and overall we're continuing to invest in comprehensive and highly competitive compensation and benefits.

These changes apply to the end-of-year reviews and 2026 compensation planning.

John Casey""","Google's compensations head sent a letter to employees on Monday. The letter said high performance is more important than ever to achieve the company's goals. The changes apply to the end-of-year reviews and 2026 compensation planning, the letter said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120841743,imgsize-25550,width-400,resizemode-4/Google-file-picture.jpg"
Pahalgam terror attack: The banned Chinese smartphone link that NIA is probing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/pahalgam-terror-attack-the-banned-chinese-smartphone-link-that-nia-is-probing/articleshow/120847589.cms,"Chinese Huawei banned in US and Europe

NIA statement on Pahalgam terror attack

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) recently took over the investigation of the deadly Pahalgam terror attack in Kashmir that claimed 26 lives, including 25 Indians and one Nepalese citizen. A significant lead has emerged, with security agencies detecting the movement of a banned Huawei satellite phone in the Pahalgam region at the time of the attack, sources told ET. Huawei, a Chinese company, is prohibited in India, raising suspicions that the device was smuggled from Pakistan or another foreign country.Chinese telecom vendors Huawei and ZTE are barred from selling products for use in 5G networks in India. While there is no explicit ban, Indian telcom companies have effectively shut out China's Huawei and ZTE from their 5G rollouts as do not fulfill the 'trusted source' requirement set by the Indian government. Due to security concerns with Chinese equipment, telcos in India too have been willing to absorb rising cost of using European gear.In July 2022, the chiefs of the US and the UK security agencies held an unprecedented press conference and issued a joint warning against China. The heads of FBI and MI5 alleged that China posed a long-term threat to economic and national security. China, on its part, called the accusations groundless. The US, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, who are members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance along with Canada, have also banned Huawei from their respective 5G networks.The attack, one of the deadliest in Kashmir in recent times, occurred in the serene Baisaran valley, targeting innocent tourists. The NIA, supported by forensic experts and technical intelligence, is pursuing multiple angles, including tracking the satellite phone with assistance from Western agencies. The Resistance Front (TRF), a Pakistan-backed terror outfit, has claimed responsibility for the ghastly attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam region.""More than 85,000 domiciles have been issued to non-locals, creating a pathway for demographic change in Indian-occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IOJK). These non-locals arrive posing as tourists, obtain domiciles, and then being to act as if they own the land. Consequently, violence will be directed toward those attempting to settle illegally,"" the TRF said.Eyewitnesses have provided critical details, reporting more than five attackers involved in the assault. The NIA is examining these accounts to reconstruct the sequence of events, with teams led by an Inspector General, Deputy Inspector General, and Superintendent of Police scouring entry and exit points for clues. Overground workers in Jammu and Kashmir are also under scrutiny.The Jammu and Kashmir Police has previously released sketches of three suspects, offering a Rs 20 lakh reward for information on each. The NIA, in a statement, confirmed its intensified efforts to uncover the terror conspiracy, with forensic teams combing the attack site for evidence.“Following directives from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, the NIA has formally assumed control of the Pahalgam terror attack case,” the agency said, vowing to leave no stone unturned in bringing the perpetrators to justice.","The National Investigation Agency (NIA) recently took over the investigation of the deadly Pahalgam terror attack in Kashmir that claimed 26 lives.

Datasection’s growth and expansion good news for Tencent

Loophole in US export policy

Datasection benefiting from the US policy loophole





Tencent, the Chinese tech giant has now found a way to legally access Nvidia’s most advanced semiconductors despite export restrictions imposed by the US. As reported by Financial Times, Tencent is using a partnership with Datasection, a Japanese company which has pivoted from marketing solutions to AI data centers in order to secure computing power from thousands of Nvidia’s most-advanced Blackwell processors. At its datacenter facility outside Osaka, Datasection owns around 15,000 Nvidia’s Blackwell B200 processors and a significant portion of these chipsets are being contracted to Tencent via third-party relationship.The $12 billion deal between Datasection and Tencent, enable the Chinese company to legally use the computing power which was banned by the US from direct export to China, highlighting the loophole in the US policy.For those unaware, Datasection has rapidly grown into one of Asia’s largest “neoclouds,” joining peers like CoreWeave (U.S.) and Nebius (Europe) in renting GPU capacity to global tech firms. The company is also building a Sydney AI data center which is equipped with Nvidia’s latest B300 chips which can outperform the hardware permitted for sale in China. The first 10,000 B300s cost $521 million. This facility of the company is also said to majorly serve Tencent, creating what Datasection CEO Norihiko Ishihara calls “the world’s first hyperscale AI cluster using B300 chips.The strategy adopted by Datasection and Tencent mainly exploit the legal gap in US export controls. Biden-era rules designed to close the loophole were scrapped by President Donald Trump in May, enabling Datasection to move quickly on its Osaka deal. Earlier this month, the U.S. approved sales of lower-performance chips to China, but Tencent and peers like Alibaba and ByteDance continue to rely on overseas computing workarounds. Analysts believe that renting GPU capacity abroad may be “the more attractive choice” for Chinese tech groups compared to buying downgraded chips.The US export policy loophole and the ban on chips to the Chinese gave an immense growth opportunity to Datasection. The stock on the company witnessed 18% surge this year, though it has halved since a ¥4,000 peak amid concerns of over-investment and a short-seller attack. The company has also raised ¥50 billion via equity warrants to Singapore-based First Plus Financial Holdings, owned by a Chinese national.Despite scrutiny, Datasection is pressing ahead with plans to expand into Europe, hiring high-profile figures such as Spanish politician Pablo Casado Blanco and John Ellis Bush Jr., a member of the U.S. Bush political family, to its board. Ishihara remains confident that demand for GPU capacity is so strong that even if U.S. export rules shift again, new customers would be easy to find. For Tencent, the Japanese deal underscores how China’s biggest tech companies are navigating restrictions by outsourcing AI training to overseas data centres, raising fresh questions about the effectiveness of Washington’s export controls and the growing role of “neocloud” providers in the global AI race.","Tencent has found a way to legally access Nvidia’s most advanced semiconductors despite export restrictions imposed by the US.

Dell employees say ‘new’ mandate ends flexibility for parents



What Dell has to say on the move







Dell is cracking down on employees who have been “badge-swiping” or leaving early. According to a report, internal “walkthroughs” revealed widespread non-compliance with the company’s return-to-office (RTO) mandate that was announced earlier this year. In a strongly worded internal memo, Jackie Miller, Dell’s vice president of North American Commercial Sales, informed the sales staff that the time of flexible hours is over for onsite-classified team members.“Effective immediately, all onsite-classified sales team members are expected to be in the RR, NV, and OKC offices five days a week for at least eight hours per day,” Miller wrote in a memo, which was obtained by Business Insider. The directive targets Dell’s major hubs in Round Rock (Texas), Nashville and Oklahoma City.Dell originally called sales staff back to a five-day onsite schedule in September 2024, the new memo – sent on November 5 – adds a specific time requirement that was previously a point of contention between managers and staff.The report says that the crackdown was prompted by “recent site visits” and “end-of-day walkthroughs” conducted by the company leadership.According to the memo, these inspections revealed that many employees were not adhering to the five-day policy, often leaving mid-afternoon or arriving late.Miller noted that that a physical presence is “essential for fostering collaboration, communication, and productivity,” and stated that any personal business or time away from the desk must now be covered by vacation hours or personal business allowances.The new enforcement has reportedly caused disruption for employees with families. This is because under previous interpretations of the policy, many parents were permitted by their managers to leave to pick up children from school and finish their workday at home. Sales leaders have now clarified that there are no exemptions for school schedules.A Dell spokesperson defended the move, stating that while team members are expected to work a “regular working day,” some flexibility remains for those in global roles who take late-night calls.However, the internal FAQ remains strict: while temporary medical conditions or peak traffic adjustments may be approved, the documents state that ""regular childcare, care for dependents, or attending to other personal business"" do not qualify for work-from-home exemptions.","Dell is cracking down on employees who have been “badge-swiping” or leaving early.

Helium AI launches tools for businesses to help build presentations and marketing campaigns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/helium-ai-launches-tools-for-businesses-to-help-build-presentations-and-marketing-campaigns/articleshow/126127467.cms,"How these new AI tools work

“Most teams don’t struggle with ideas; they struggle with execution. While AI has added more tools, it hasn’t solved coordination. Mantis and Prism are built to remove that execution friction entirely, enabling teams to move from intent to outcomes within a single system. As go-to-market cycles shrink and brand consistency becomes harder to manage across channels, enterprises need AI that takes responsibility for results, not just content.

That is the direction Helium is building toward.”





Enterprise-grade AI operating platform Helium AI by Neural Arc has launched two new AI systems – Mantis and Prism. The company claims that these tools will offer a significant upgrade to its platform capabilities. Designed to streamline fragmented workflows across presentations and marketing, these tools will allow organisations to create professional, brand-aligned assets at scale, faster than ever before.Mantis is Helium’s AI-based presentation system that supports creating slide decks from a brief or topic. It uses live web sources to gather current information, organises the content into a narrative and generates slides with text placed directly into predefined layouts.The system automatically applies brand elements such as logos, colour schemes, and formatting rules. Mantis combines research, writing, and slide design into a single process, producing complete presentation files rather than draft outlines.The system includes more than 50 presentation styles, covering modern, minimalist, artistic, retro, and futuristic formats, along with multiple layout types, including section headers, image-focused slides, and comparison layouts.It is intended for use cases such as sales presentations, investor decks, internal reports, training materials, and educational content, with an emphasis on consistent formatting and reduced production time.Prism extends Helium’s platform into campaign creation and supports the development of multi-channel marketing campaigns within a single system. It generates campaign elements, including strategy, messaging, visuals, and ready-to-use assets.Prism can extract brand details from a website or provide inputs to apply logos, colour palettes, and tone consistently across outputs. The system supports social media campaigns across major platforms, full-funnel marketing efforts, and HTML email campaigns with subject lines, personalisation fields, and responsive layouts.Prism provides access to more than 75 visual design styles and generates text and images in parallel. The platform is designed to reduce reliance on multiple tools or external coordination and to shorten the time required to create, review, and deploy campaigns.Commenting on the new tools, Aniket Tapre, founder and CEO of Neural Arc, said,","Helium AI by Neural Arc has launched two new AI systems – Mantis and Prism.

Italy fines Apple $115 million: Here’s why and what the iPhone maker said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/italy-fines-apple-115-million-heres-why-and-what-the-iphone-maker-said/articleshow/126125096.cms,"Why Italy regulator has fined Apple



Apple vows to appeal fine







Italy’s antitrust watchdog, the AGCM, has imposed a 98.6 million euro ($115.53 million) fine on Apple and two of its subsidiaries, a report has said. The penalty, which follows an investigation into alleged market abuse, is imposed as regulators claim that the iPhone maker used its “absolute dominance” in the mobile app market to unfairly penalise third-party developers. The ruling essentially marks an escalation in Europe’s push to regulate how Big Tech manages balance between user privacy and fair competition.The investigation began in May 2023 and it focused on Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. ATT was introduced in April 2021 and the feature requires apps to ask for a user’s explicit permission before tracking their data across other companies’ apps and websites for advertising purposes.The AGCM alleged that Apple set restrictive policies that were “not proportionate” to the stated objective of privacy. The regulator said that it also harmed third-party developers by making data collection more difficult than it allegedly is for Apple’s own services. According to AGCM, Apple forced developers to duplicate consent requests for the same purposes, creating friction for users and businesses alike.""The terms of the ATT policy are imposed unilaterally, they are detrimental to the interests of Apple's business partners and are not proportionate to achieving the objective of privacy, as claimed by the company,"" the regulator said in a statement, as per news agency Reuters..Apple hit back at the ruling, stating it “strongly disagrees” with the AGCM’s findings. The tech giant argued that the regulator’s decision disregards the fundamental right of users to control their personal information.Earlier this year, Apple also filed a constitutional challenge in the Delhi High Court against the country’s revamped antitrust laws. The tech giant warned that new regulations could expose the company to a staggering $38 billion fine, which may be among the largest corporate penalties in history.The legal battle is the culmination of a 2022 investigation sparked by complaints from Match Group and various Indian startups. The CCI’s findings suggest that Apple has maintained an ""abusive"" monopoly over its ecosystem.","Italy’s antitrust watchdog, the AGCM, has imposed a 98.6 million euro ($115.53 million) fine on Apple and two of its subsidiaries.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

Paramount vs Netflix: The battle for WBD







Paramount Global and Skydance Media have directly addressed concerns of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) board that the deal lacked sufficient financial certainty. Days after WBD wrote a letter to shareholders urging them to reject Paramount Skydance’s proposal, the companies have secured an “irrevocable personal guarantee” from Oracle co-founder and multi-billionaire Larry Ellison. The board cited financial concerns and called upon Ellison to sign a stronger personal guarantee for the deal to happen. The entertainment behemoth stressed that it cannot know if Paramount's all-cash offer will close unless Ellison himself provides deeper commitment.According to a news release (via CNBC) issued on Monday (December 22), Larry Ellison, father of Paramount CEO David Ellison, has officially committed to a personal guarantee of $40.4 billion toward the equity financing of the deal.“Paramount Skydance Corporation today has amended its $30 per share all-cash offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc., to address WBD's stated concerns regarding Paramount's superior offer. Paramount continues to offer to purchase, for $30 per share in cash, 100% of the outstanding shares of WBD, and therefore will assume all assets and liabilities of WBD,” Paramount said.He has also agreed to cover any potential damage claims against Paramount and pledged not to revoke or adversely transfer assets from the Ellison family trust while the transaction is pending.“On December 17th, in its Schedule 14D-9 filing and through television appearances by WBD principals and advisors, WBD asserted that the full equity backstop from the Ellison family trust—which was included in Paramount's December 4th proposal to WBD and the December 8th tender offer to WBD shareholders—was inadequate, despite the trust holding a majority of the assets of Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle and controlling shareholder of Paramount. WBD went on to assert that the only fix would be a personal guarantee from Mr. Ellison. None of these concerns, nor the demand for a personal guarantee, were raised by WBD or its advisors to Paramount in the 12-week period leading up to WBD agreeing to the inferior transaction with Netflix, Inc.” the company added.Paramount addressed WBD's concerns by amending its offer to WBD shareholders in a 6-point format:Paramount Skydance is currently engaged in a hostile attempt to terminate an alleged pre-existing agreement between WBD and Netflix. WBD previously agreed to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix in a transaction valued at $83 billion.

Discussions with Nvidia revealed concerns about AWS expenses becoming unmanageable as GPU and reasoning model demands grow. This move signals a wider industry trend of scrutinizing cloud AI spending.

Financial giant weighs AI factory and neocloud options

Growing scrutiny of cloud AI expenses across tech sector





The US credit card giant Capital One is exploring alternatives to Amazon Web Services due to rising AI infrastructure costs, according to an internal Nvidia document obtained by Business Insider. The revelation highlights growing tensions between cloud spending and AI adoption among major enterprises.An Nvidia employee wrote in an internal memo that the chip giant discussed AI infrastructure alternatives with Capital One representatives at a recent tech conference. ""They see their need for GPUs and reasoning models growing and the costs in AWS will soon get out of hand,"" the employee stated, referring to the bank's concerns about controlling expenses.The discussions centered on ""AI factory and neo-clouds"" as potential solutions, Business Insider reported. An AI factory refers to an in-house data center companies can build to train and run AI models independently, rather than renting compute power from third-party providers. Neoclouds are emerging cloud providers like CoreWeave, Lambda, and Crusoe that specialize in AI workloads using Nvidia hardware.Capital One responded by reaffirming its commitment to AWS.""We continue to be committed to AWS as our predominant strategic cloud partner,"" a spokesperson told Business Insider. However, the bank's exploration of alternatives reflects broader industry trends, with 43% of companies now using multiple public cloud providers, according to RBC Capital.The concerns aren't isolated to Capital One. Business Insider previously reported that AI startups are increasingly delaying AWS spending in favor of competitor platforms, with internal Amazon documents showing 90% of Radical Ventures portfolio startups building primarily on rival clouds due to cost concerns.This development is particularly notable given Capital One's deep AWS relationship. The bank became the first major financial institution to move entirely to public cloud, shutting down all data centers over two years, CIO.com reported in July. Capital One's AI chief Prem Natarajan has previously emphasized that inference costs have dropped dramatically, but the bank's exploration of alternatives suggests overall AI infrastructure expenses remain a significant concern.",US credit card giant Capital One is exploring alternatives to Amazon Web Services due to rising AI infrastructure costs.

Executives admit a decline in AI model trust, citing instances where agents missed instructions or lost focus. This move follows significant staff reductions attributed to AI deployment, as the company navigates the gap between AI hype and practical business needs.

Salesforce CEO Benioff's AI ambitions collide with market reality





Salesforce, one of the world's most valuable enterprise software companies, is pulling back from its heavy reliance on large language models after encountering reliability issues that have shaken executive confidence. Sanjna Parulekar, Senior Vice President of Product Marketing, acknowledged that trust in AI models has declined over the past year, according to a report by The Information.""All of us were more confident about large language models a year ago,"" Parulekar stated, revealing the company's strategic shift away from generative AI toward more predictable ""deterministic"" automation in its flagship product, Agentforce. This admission comes after Salesforce reduced its support staff from 9,000 to 5,000 employees—approximately 4,000 roles—through AI agent deployment, as CEO Marc Benioff disclosed in a podcast appearance.The company is now emphasizing that Agentforce can help ""eliminate the inherent randomness of large models,"" marking a significant departure from the AI-first messaging that dominated the industry just months ago.Salesforce encountered several critical technical challenges with large language models during real-world applications. Muralidhar Krishnaprasad, Chief Technology Officer of Agentforce, pointed out that when given more than eight instructions, the models begin omitting directives—a serious flaw for precision-dependent business tasks.Home security company Vivint, which uses Agentforce to handle customer support for 2.5 million customers, experienced these reliability problems firsthand. Despite providing clear instructions to send satisfaction surveys after each customer interaction, The Information reported that Agentforce sometimes failed to send surveys for unexplained reasons. Vivint worked with Salesforce to implement ""deterministic triggers"" to ensure consistent survey delivery.Another challenge emerged in what executive Phil Mui described as AI ""drift"" in an October blog post. When users ask irrelevant questions, AI agents lose focus on their primary objectives. For instance, a chatbot designed to guide form completion may become distracted when customers ask unrelated questions.The retreat from large language models represents an ironic twist for CEO Marc Benioff, who has aggressively bet on AI transformation. Benioff had recently told Business Insider that he's drafting the company's annual strategic document with data foundations—not AI models—as the top priority, explicitly citing concerns about ""hallucinations"" without proper data context.Benioff even suggested the company might rebrand itself as ""Agentforce,"" telling Business Insider ""that would not shock me,"" after learning from focus groups that customers no longer want to hear about cloud computing. However, this rebranding enthusiasm contrasts sharply with the technical challenges executives are now acknowledging.The company's stock has declined approximately 34% from its December 2024 peak, though Agentforce is projected to generate over $500 million in annual revenue. Salesforce's partial retreat from large models could impact thousands of enterprises currently relying on this technology, as the company navigates the gap between AI innovation and practical business implementation.","Executives admit a decline in AI model trust, citing instances where agents missed instructions or lost focus.

Yann LeCun, former Meta AI chief and Godfather of AI teaches computer science at New York University (NYU). During a recent podcast appearance, LeCun joked that he is a computer science professor who argues against studying computer science. Explaining what he meant, he later told Business Insider (BI) that he was not asking students to avoid a computer science major. Instead, he said that students should focus more on core subjects such as maths, physics, and electrical engineering, rather than spending too much time on taking courses based on short-term technology trends. In an email, LeCun told the publication that if computer science students don’t spend their time wisely, they ‘may find out their degree doesn't add up’.During his appearance on ""The Information Bottleneck"" podcast, Yann LeCun said “What we should do is learn kind of basic things in mathematics, in modeling, mathematics that can be connected with reality”.“You tend to learn this kind of stuff in engineering in some schools that's linked with computer science, but sort of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, et cetera”, he added.Interestingly, LeCun revealed during the conversation that he himself was not a CS engineer.Instead, he studied electrical engineering at ESIEE in Paris before earning a Ph.D. CS from Sorbonne Université in 1987.“Engineering disciplines, you know, in the US, you learn Calculus 1, 2, 3 that gives you a good basis, right?” he said. “In computer science, you can get away with just Calculus 1. That's not enough, right?”Adding further, LeCun said “Obviously, you need to learn enough computer science to kind of program and use computers”. “And even though AI is going to help you be more efficient at programming, you still need to know how to do this,” he said.Yann LeCun’s advice to young students: “learn things with a long shelf life”.“My recommendation was not to avoid CS as a major but to take the maximum number of courses on foundations (e.g. math, physics, or EE courses) rather than take courses on the trendy technology du jour,” LeCun said.“If you are a CS major and take the minimum required math courses for a typical CS curriculum, you might find yourself unable to adapt to major technological shifts,” the former Meta AI scientist told BI.Yann LeCun’s advice echoes with other tech leaders like OpenAI 's Bret Taylor and Nobel Laureate Geoffrey Hinton who have stressed that young engineers must learn critical skills beyond coding.","Yann LeCun, former Meta AI chief and Godfather of AI teaches computer science at New York University.

Read the memo sent by Apple's immigration team to employees

“Given the recent updates and the possibility of unpredictable, extended delays when returning to the US, we strongly recommend that employees without a valid H-1B visa stamp avoid international travel for now. If travel cannot be postponed, employees should connect with Apple Immigration and Fragomen in advance to discuss the risks.”

Industry-wide warnings

Tech companies most affected by H-1B disruptions





Apple has now joined the list of other tech giants such as Google, Microsoft and others in warning employees about the risks of international travel due to delays in US visa stamping. Recently, the US Department of State has acknowledged significant delays in visa appointments at American embassies and consulates worldwide, including in India, as processing times stretch up to 12 months due to enhanced screening procedures. In a statement to Business Insider, a State Department spokesperson confirmed that consular offices are now “prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else” over the previous emphasis on reducing wait times.The delays have prompted Apple to issue travel advisories to employees holding H-1B visas and their dependents, warning them against international travel due to the “risk of an extended stay” outside the United States. As per the internal memo seen by Business Insider, Apple’s immigration team has asked its staff on H-1B visas without valid stamps to postpone their travel plans in order to avoid being stuck outside the country.The email, sent by Apple’s immigration team, reads:This guidance reflects the growing concerns across Silicon Valley as visa processing times at US embassies and consulates stretch to up to 12 months due to new screening requirements.The memo shared by Apple is followed by similar advisories from Google and Microsoft which have already cautioned employees against leaving the US amid the delays. Immigration law firms warn that professionals traveling abroad for visa renewals risk being stranded if appointments are canceled or postponed.The visa delays particularly impact technology companies that rely heavily on the H-1B program, which caps new visas at 85,000 annually. During fiscal year 2024, Google applied for 5,537 H-1B visas while Apple sought 3,880, according to Department of Labor and USCIS data analyzed by Business Insider. Indians account for over 70% of H-1B visas issued.Immigration attorney Jason Finkelman advised that foreign nationals with valid visa stamps should generally be able to return to the US, but recommended clients avoid non-essential travel. “If travel isn’t essential right now, better to stay put,” he said, noting that H-1B workers stuck abroad due to cancelled consular appointments face uncertain timelines for returning to work in the United States.","Apple joins Google, Microsoft and others in warning employees about risks of international travel due to delays in US visa stamping.

Burry feels America is taking structural risk







Legendary investor Michael Burry who is known for its 2008 financial prediction is back with another warning. Burry recently issued a stark warning on America’s artificial intelligence strategy. In a series of posts shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Burry argued that the US is structurally disadvantaged in the AI race it if continues to heavily rely on Nvidia’s increasingly energy-intensive chips, whereas China accelerates its power-generation buildout. Burry shared some charts showing how China has managed to install electricity generation capacity which has surged far being the US and Europe since the early 2000s.“It is not just the total power advantage. It is the slope,” Burry wrote, highlighting China’s rapid expansion compared to America’s slowing grid development.” He further contrasted China’s “build-at-will” model of transmission infrastructure with the US, where permitting issues have slowed grid expansion.Burry has also criticised Nvidia’s dominance in AI computing in the posts. Burry said that the chipset major’s roadmap is mainly a ‘power consumption roadmap.’He also warned that innovation has become bout ‘how to power and cool bigger, hotter silicon.’ He further added that efficiency improvements have failed to keep up pace with the sheer growth in computing, pushing electricity needs ever higher. Burry said the U.S. is on the wrong path if its AI strategy continues to rely on increasingly energy-intensive Nvidia chips. Power hungry Nvidia chips are not the way forward,” Burry cautioned.As per Burry, the US companies are heavily investing in the AI arms race. He believes that the companies are ’structurally positioned to lose’ if brute-force scaling remains the dominant strategy. He urged a pivot toward AI-tuned ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) and more efficient designs rather than massive, power-hungry data centers.Along with this, Burry has also raised some questions Nvidia’s soaring valuation. Nvidia’s market cap presently stands at $4.40 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world. In the month of October the company briefly crossed the $5 trillion milestone. Nvidia shares have gained 30.86%, and over the past five years, the stock has surged 1,293.30%.In the latest quarterly results the company showed $57 billion in revenue, up 62% year-on-year. Burry is of the opinion that Nvidia may be using accounting tactics to inflate its valuation, adding to his broader warning that America’s reliance on the chipmaker could prove unsustainable.",Burry has also criticised Nvidia’s dominance in AI computing.

Apple’s latest software rollout has left many iPhone users confused after the company released iOS 26.2 and iOS 18.7.3 on December 12. According to a Forbes report, iPhones capable of running iOS 26 are no longer being offered the iOS 18.7.3 update, despite Apple’s long-standing policy of providing security patches for users who avoid major upgrades. Instead, the only update option appearing on devices from iPhone 11 to iPhone 16 is iOS 26.2, forcing hesitant users toward Apple’s newest operating system. Earlier, some users briefly accessed iOS 18.7.3 through beta settings, but that option as per the report has now disappeared, raising questions over whether the change is an error or a deliberate shift in strategy.Apple traditionally supports the previous year’s software for at least several months to offer stability and security fixes to users who do not immediately upgrade to the latest OS. This year, that window appears to have closed abruptly.As per the Forbes report, only three devices — iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR — continue to receive iOS 18.7.3. All newer, iOS 18-compatible devices now show iOS 26.2 as the sole update option in Settings.Initially, users reported that enabling beta updates restored access to iOS 18.7.3, though only in public or developer beta form. According to developers and users, Apple has now removed even that workaround, indicating a possible permanent block.Jason Snell of Six Colors reported the same finding, saying the move “effectively forces users to take the iOS 26 upgrade if they want the security updates,” especially for those unhappy with iOS 26’s new Liquid Glass interface or other early-cycle bugs.","Apple’s latest software rollout has left many iPhone users confused after the company released iOS 26.2 and iOS 18.7.3 on December 12.

San Francisco power outage : Waymo vs Tesla

Waymo resumes services in San Francisco Bay Area





A temporary power outage in San Francisco left hundreds of Google ’s self-driving vehicles – Waymo stranded on roads. Many users shared videos and photos of the cars stalled in traffic in different parts of the city. Amid the disruption, Elon Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter), writing “Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage”. The Tesla CEO quoted a post by X user Mario Nawfal which said that Teslas kept rolling as the vehicles’ AI is trained on “billions of real-world miles”. “Waymo bet on maps and order. Tesla bet on mess - and won,” Nawfal added.For those unaware, a massive blackout affected over 130,000 homes and businesses in San Francisco including the Richmond, Sunset, Presidio and Golden Gate Park. Officials traced that a portion of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) substation caught fire, knocking out critical grid components, leading to “significant transit disruptions.”Mario Nawfal shared two different videos in his post – one showing Waymo stranded on the road and the other a dashcam footage from a Tesla vehicle using Full Self-Driving (FSD) mode.“Waymo’s robotaxis got a little too real last night - by completely shutting down when San Francisco’s power outage knocked out traffic lights,” he writes in the post.“Meanwhile, Teslas on FSD? Kept rolling. No drama, no headlines - just handling chaos like it’s a walk in the park.This is what happens when you train your AI on billions of real-world miles instead of coddling it in a simulation padded with perfect data and wishful thinking. Waymo bet on maps and order. Tesla bet on mess - and won. When the lights go out, the difference isn’t theoretical. It’s traffic.”Nawfal tagged TeslaAI and Elon Musk as the source in his post. The Tesla dashcam video was shared by Tesla AI with the caption – “FSD is trained on billions of real-world miles, including power outages”.Waymo said it has resumed its driverless ride-hail service in the San Francisco Bay Area. Waymo spokesperson, Suzanne Philion, told CNBC in an e-mailed statement “Yesterday’s power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions”.“While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events,” she added.","A temporary power outage in San Francisco left hundreds of Google ’s self- driving vehicles – Waymo stranded on roads.

Microsoft reorganizes leadership for AI-first future

Microsoft CEO 'Thrilled' About India's Growing Data Centre Capacity, Details Meet With PM Modi





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is shaking up how the tech giant approaches artificial intelligence with an unconventional leadership strategy: keeping executives out of the room. The CEO has launched a weekly AI accelerator meeting that deliberately excludes senior managers from presenting, instead giving the floor to lower-level technical employees working directly on AI projects.According to internal memos obtained by Business Insider, Nadella created the new meeting format along with a corresponding Teams channel to speed up AI development and gather unfiltered insights from across the company. The approach is intentionally ""messy and chaotic,"" designed to avoid top-down AI leadership and get real-time feedback from engineers in the trenches.The move reflects Nadella's view that AI represents both an existential threat and a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Microsoft. He's pushing the company to operate with unprecedented ""intensity and urgency,"" according to Business Insider sources familiar with the matter.This grassroots meeting structure is part of broader organizational shifts at Microsoft. Nadella recently promoted sales chief Judson Althoff to CEO of commercial business, freeing up his own time to focus on technical AI work. In internal messages to corporate vice presidents, Nadella urged leaders to ""work and act like ICs"" (individual contributors) rather than traditional managers.""We all have to work and act like ICs in our own orgs, constantly learning and unlearning,"" Nadella wrote in a Teams channel for executives, as seen by Business Insider.The CEO is also having direct conversations with executives about whether they're willing to commit to the ""mountain of work"" required for Microsoft's AI transformation—or leave. ""You've gotta be asking yourself how much longer you want to do this,"" one Microsoft executive told Business Insider.Nadella has shifted his language from saying Microsoft is in the ""early innings"" to the ""middle innings"" of AI, signaling his determination to see the transformation through to completion.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has launched a weekly AI accelerator meeting that deliberately excludes senior managers from presenting.

Retailers across Europe worried

France threatens China with tariffs over trade surplus





Less than a decade old, Chinese retail giant Shein has become the world’s No. 1 player in terms of market share and also the company that has gained the most market share over the past year, according to GlobalData. Zara owner Inditex and Swedish retail giant H&M, the global kings of the sector to date, are next two in line. Zara is the second-largest player in the market, followed by H&M. Shein has become the company with the largest and fastest-growing retailer across the world largely powered by jump in its marketshare in Europe. Now it seems Zara and H&M's this 'Chinese problem' is aggravating and spreading to entire Europe.President Trump’s intensifying crackdown on Chinese imports seems to have redirected a ""Tsunami"" of low-cost goods away from the United States and into Europe, sparking a logistics gold rush that is minting new millionaires and overwhelming local regulators. According to a report in Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the shift represents one of the most dramatic rewirings of global trade since the onset of the US-China trade war.As Washington shuttered a key customs loophole known as the De Minimis rule in May, exports of low-value parcels to the US from China have plummeted by more than 40%.In response, shipments to Europe have more than offset the nearly 20% contraction in US trade, pushing China’s global trade surplus past the $1 trillion mark for the first time this year. The front lines of this trade diversion are not just at massive ports, but in the backyards of European suburbs. The ""shadow logistics"" networks allow Chinese sellers to slash delivery times and under-price commercial warehouses, often charging as little as 70 cents per package.Fueling this surge is a fleet of upstart cargo airlines forging what they call a ""modern Silk Road."" The volume has forced cargo carriers to seek secondary hubs. One Air, a British startup, recently moved its operations from London to the rural East Midlands Airport to avoid congestion. Over the summer, the airport redrew its parking layout to accommodate a surge in Chinese freighters.For the first time, the European Union has surpassed the U.S. as the top destination for China’s $100 billion ""cheap package blitz."" Retailers warn competition is threatening their industry. “We sell at a price point of around 15 euros a pair of underwear, where Shein and other Chinese platforms will sell five pairs of underwear for the same price,” told Guillaume Gibault, founder of French underwear brand Le Slip to WSJ. “It puts in the mind of the customer, the price doesn’t mean anything anymore.”French President Emmanuel Macron recently said that he had threatened Beijing with tariffs during his state visit to China if there was no action taken to reduce the country's ever-widening trade deficit with the European Union. During Macron's visit earlier in December, he reportedly urged China to boost cooperation on ""unsustainable"" global trade imbalances, geopolitics and the environment.""I tried to explain to the Chinese that their trade surplus is unsustainable because they are killing their own customers, particularly by no longer importing much from us,"" Macron said in an interview published by French daily Les Echos.",Chinese retail giant Shein has become the world’s No. 1 player in terms of market share and also the company that has gained the most market share over the past year.

AI development depends On reliable power infrastructure







Tesla CEO Elon Musk has sounded the alarm on America's energy infrastructure crisis, calling the country's lagging power generation capacity a ""major competitive disadvantage"" as China races ahead in the global power race. Musk's stark warning came in response to market analyst Adam Kobeissi's December 19 analysis revealing that China now commands 3.75 terawatts of power generation capacity—nearly three times the United States' 1.30 terawatts.The disparity represents more than just numbers on a grid. With China's power capacity doubling over the past eight years while US growth has remained relatively stagnant, the energy gap threatens America's ability to compete in AI development, advanced manufacturing, and technological innovation. In 2024 alone, China added 429 gigawatts of new capacity—equivalent to adding multiple entire countries' worth of power generation in a single year, with wind and solar accounting for 83% of these additions.Beyond renewable energy, China is aggressively expanding its nuclear infrastructure with 34 reactors currently under construction—more than the next nine countries combined. Nearly 200 additional reactors are either planned or proposed for future development.In stark contrast, the United States has no large commercial nuclear reactors under construction, raising concerns about America's ability to meet the growing power demands of AI development and data centers.Goldman Sachs has previously warned that US power grid limitations could severely restrict AI growth, highlighting how China's energy advantage is becoming a critical differentiator in technological development. Morgan Stanley estimates China will invest approximately $560 billion in power grid projects by 2030, with over $80 billion invested in 2024 alone.The power capacity gap has direct implications for the AI race between the two nations. Advanced AI development increasingly relies on abundant, reliable electricity to run massive data centers and computing infrastructure.Research indicates that US data center power demand is rising faster than the grid can handle, with transmission bottlenecks persisting despite record infrastructure spending. China's rapid grid expansion and substantial renewable energy investments are providing the country with a strategic edge in supporting AI development at scale.Musk also praised China's solar power progress, stating ""Incredible progress by China in solar power! America needs to do the same."" His comments underscore growing concerns among tech leaders about America's energy infrastructure falling behind global competitors.","China now commands 3.75 terawatts of power generation capacity—nearly three times the United States' 1.30 terawatts.

Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more

Microsoft

Salesforce

IBM





AI-related job cuts crossed 50,000 in 2025 in the US alone, according to new data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas (via CNBC). The firm said that companies directly cited artificial intelligence (AI) as the reason for 54,883 job cuts this year – making it one of the biggest drivers of layoffs across the tech industry. The job cuts come at a time when AI is being used as a cost-cutting tool by the companies to deal with inflation, high tariffs, and pressure to improve profitability. A recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) study released in November also suggested that AI can handle 11.7% of U.S. jobs and could save companies $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and professional services.However, some experts question whether AI is the real reason for such widespread layoffs. Fabian Stephany, assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, told CNBC that many companies overhired during the pandemic and may now be using AI as a convenient “excuse” for downsizing.Despite the debate, many companies, including world’s biggest tech companies explicitly named AI as a reason for restructuring this year. Here we look at four big tech companies that called out AI in their job cuts announcementThe e-commerce giant laid off 14,000 corporate employees this year, one of its largest.Announcing the job cuts, Amazon’s senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti said that the company is ‘making organizational changes … which will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others’.“This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” Galetti explained.Though days later at the company’s earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy explained “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least. It really — it's culture”.Microsoft conducted at least four major rounds of workforce reduction, cutting around 15,000 jobs this year. Julia Liuson, president of Microsoft's Developer Division, then instructed managers that artificial intelligence usage ""should be part of your holistic reflections on an individual's performance and impact."" In internal emails, Liuson then declared that ""using AI is no longer optional — it's core to every role and every level"".The company also said that it is considering adding formal AI usage metrics to performance reviews as it pushes for greater adoption of its Copilot AI services, adding some teams are exploring including specific AI usage benchmarks in next fiscal year's employee evaluations, according to sources familiar with the plans.In September, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff confirmed that 4,000 customer support roles were cut with the help of AI automation. Benioff then said AI is already doing “up to 50% of the work” at the company and that fewer staff are needed for many support functions. During an appearance on the ""Logan Bartlett"" podcast, he also described it as ""eight of the most exciting months of my career"" explaining how AI technology has transformed the company's operations.""There were more than 100 million leads that we have not called back at Salesforce in the last 26 years because we have not had enough people,"" he explained. ""But we now have an agentic sales that is calling back every person that contacts us.""The company uses an ""omnichannel supervisor"" system that coordinates collaboration between human and AI agents, allowing AI to recognise when tasks require human intervention.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna revealed that AI chatbots had replaced several hundred HR roles. The company eliminated job roles in marketing and communications and also replaced around 200 human resources positions with AI agents. Krishna said IBM is hiring in areas that require deeper critical thinking such as engineering, sales, and marketing.","AI-related job cuts crossed 50,000 in 2025 in the US alone, according to new data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Government warns WhatsApp users about ‘GhostPairing’ attack: What is it and how to stay safe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-warns-whatsapp-users-about-ghostpairing-attack-what-is-it-and-how-to-stay-safe/articleshow/126104420.cms,"The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

What is GhostPairing

How to stay safe





The Indian computer emergency response team (CERT-In) has issued an advisory for WhatsApp users warning them of a ‘device-linking’ feature that can allow attackers to take ‘complete’ control of their account. The advisory, accessed by news agency PTI says that the vulnerability called ‘GhostPairing’ put users’ messages, photos, and videos on the web version at risk. “It has been reported that malicious actors are exploiting WhatsApp's device-linking feature to hijack accounts using pairing codes without authentication requirement,” the cyber agency said in the advisory.“This newly identified cyber campaign called GhostPairing enable cyber criminals to take complete control of WhatsApp accounts without needing password or SIM swaps,” the advisory said.For those unaware, CERT-In is the national technology arm under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity) to combat cyber attacks and guarding of the Indian Internet space.GhostPairing is a type of WhatsApp attack where hackers secretly link their own device to a victim’s WhatsApp account, giving them almost full access without the victim noticing. The attack works by tricking users into entering their phone number on a fake website that looks like Facebook or WhatsApp.According to the advisory, the scam usually starts with a message such as “Hi, check this photo” that appears to come from a trusted contact. The message includes a link with a Facebook-style preview. When users click it, they are taken to a fake Facebook viewer page that asks them to “verify” to see the content. At this stage, attackers exploit WhatsApp’s “link device via phone number” feature by convincing users to enter their number. Once they do, the attacker’s browser becomes a hidden, trusted device — allowing them to take over the WhatsApp account.Once linked, attackers can read synced messages, receive new chats in real time, view photos, videos, and voice notes, and even send messages to the victim’s contacts and group chats.The advisory warns users not to click on suspicious links, even if they appear to come from known contacts, and to never enter their phone number on external websites claiming to be WhatsApp or Facebook.","GhostPairing is a type of WhatsApp attack where hackers secretly link their own device to a victim’s WhatsApp account, giving them almost full access without the victim noticing.

SoftBank Group, owned by one of the Japan's richest man Masayoshi Son, is reportedly racing to finalize a $22.5 billion funding commitment to ChaGPT-maker OpenAI by year-end. According to a report in Reuters, the company is employing a complex array of cash-raising tactics that include liquidating major stakes and potentially tapping billions in margin loans. The massive capital injection is said to represent a defining ""all-in"" move by SoftBank CEO Son. As the Japanese billionaire seeks to dominate the artificial intelligence landscape, the company has already executed a series of aggressive divestments to build its war chest. This includes selling its entire $5.8 billion stake in the American AI chip giant Nvidia and offloading $4.8 billion of its holding in one of the US' biggest telecom service provider T-Mobile.Along with these, Softbank has also implemented significant headcount cuts to lean out operations. Internal dealmaking too has shifted. Sources told Reuters that Son has slowed Vision Fund activity to a ""crawl,"" now requiring his explicit personal approval for any deal exceeding $50 million. Part of the funding is expected to be used for OpenAI’s commitment to Stargate. Announced in January, Stargate is a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle that was announced by President Donald Trump.The plan calls for billions of dollars to be invested in the US AI infrastructure.SoftBank’s strategy hinges partly on the public markets. The group is working to take its payments app, PayPay, public in a market debut expected to raise more than $20 billion. While originally slated for December, the IPO was pushed to the first quarter of 2026 following the 43-day U.S. government shutdown.Additionally, SoftBank is looking to exit portions of its stake in Didi Global as the Chinese ride-hailing giant prepares for a Hong Kong listing. OpenAI launched its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, kicking off the generative AI race.Despite the massive sum required, SoftBank maintains a diverse toolkit for capital.

"‘I cleaned a lot of toilets’: Nvidia co-founder Jensen Huang opens up on his struggles, Elon Musk agrees",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/i-cleaned-a-lot-of-toilets-nvidia-co-founder-jensen-huang-opens-up-on-his-struggles-elon-musk-agrees/articleshow/126105848.cms,"Jensen Huang’s early struggles shaped his leadership

Leadership as service rather than status

Why Elon Musk agrees with Huang’s approach

A lesson that resonates beyond the tech world





Long before Jensen Huang became the face of one of the world’s most powerful technology companies, his working life looked nothing like the polished image now associated with Silicon Valley success. As a young immigrant trying to find his footing, Huang washed dishes, scrubbed floors and cleaned toilets. These were jobs with little prestige, but they taught him lasting lessons about effort, humility and survival.Those early experiences, he says, shaped a belief he still carries decades later as the co-founder and chief executive of Nvidia. No work is too small, and no task should be dismissed simply because of status. For Huang, leadership is not about distancing oneself from unglamorous work, but about staying close to it and remaining useful to the people doing it.That philosophy resurfaced recently in an interview clip that spread widely online. The remarks also drew public support from Elon Musk , who shared the clip with the phrase “This is the way”, referencing The Mandalorian. The endorsement helped the message resonate even more strongly at a time when leadership culture is under renewed scrutiny.Huang does not romanticise his early jobs, but he treats them as formative. Doing work that many people try to avoid, he suggests, strips away ego early. When you have cleaned toilets for a living, it becomes difficult to believe that certain tasks are beneath you later in life.That mindset followed him as Nvidia grew from a risky start-up into a central player in the global AI economy. Even now, Huang argues that job titles should never dictate who engages with a problem. If he can help by reviewing work, thinking through a challenge or offering perspective, then the nature of the task itself does not matter.What matters most to Huang is usefulness. He frequently stresses that contribution is not only about providing answers, but about explaining how to think. By walking colleagues through his reasoning, especially when problems are complex or uncertain, he believes leaders can expand their impact far beyond the immediate issue.This approach turns decision-making into a shared process rather than a mystery reserved for the top. Over time, Huang says, it builds confidence across an organisation and reduces fear around ambiguity, which is one of the most paralysing forces in fast-moving industries.Musk’s public agreement with Huang’s remarks was widely seen as natural. At Tesla and SpaceX, Musk has cultivated a reputation for immersing himself in engineering details, production challenges and operational bottlenecks.Supporters view this as a shared trait between the two leaders. Authority, in this view, is strengthened by proximity to the work rather than distance from it. By endorsing Huang’s comments, Musk aligned himself with a leadership style that values firsthand understanding over purely managerial oversight.Huang’s story arrives at a moment when many organisations are reassessing what effective leadership looks like. Research in management and organisational psychology has consistently suggested that leaders who prioritise service, transparency and empowerment tend to build more innovative and resilient teams.As Nvidia continues to shape the future of artificial intelligence, Huang’s reflections offer a quieter counterpoint to the mythology of instant success. In his telling, achievement is not defined by escaping hard work, but by remembering it and carrying forward the lesson that even at the highest levels, no job is too small to matter.","Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive of Nvidia, says no work is too small, and no task should be dismissed simply because of status.

How Tesla’s new recruitment drive will help the company

""high service demand.""





Tesla is said to be hiring factory floor workers and salespeople to become ""AI operators"" for its self-driving ride-sharing service. The electric car manufacturer, led by Elon Musk , is reportedly offering overtime and shifts to staff willing to monitor its Robotaxi cars. According to a report by Business Insider, a poster at Tesla’s offices in California appears to show the company is looking to hire production associates and material handlers to increase the availability of its “Robotaxi” service in the Bay Area.These operators are required to sit in the driver's seat,as the company eventually plans to release the software as a fully autonomous service.The recruitment effort extends beyond factory lines to include engineering and sales departments as well. The report cited LinkedIn profiles to claim that employees in Nevada and Arizona have already transitioned into similar operator roles in Las Vegas and Phoenix. To accelerate hiring, Tesla is also offering a $500 bonus to staff who refer candidates for the AI operator positions.Bringing on more operators could help Tesla provide faster service.After Tesla made its Robotaxi app available to everyone in September, waiting times increased sharply, with some riders posting on social media about waits of up to 40 minutes and a lack of available cars.The report also cited Robotaxi users who claimed to have experienced wait times of around 10 minutes in the Bay Area. During busy travel hours, the app sometimes says it can't offer a ride due toTesla completed certification of its own service in Nevada and Arizona last month. It hasn't yet requested a license from the Nevada Transportation Authority to start a paid service. Still, it does have approval from the Arizona Department of Transportation to operate a commercial service in that state, representatives from both agencies told Business Insider. The company hasn't started offering paid rides in either state yet.In August, the company launched its Bay Area taxi service. It isn't registered as a self-driving vehicle service in California; it operates with human drivers because California has more stringent regulations on self-driving cars than most other states, which use a trust-based system in which companies approve their own vehicles.Tesla has permission from the California Public Utilities Commission to provide rides to employees and some members of the public as a regular car service with a driver. The agency has made it clear that Tesla does not have permission to carry around regular people in a self-driving car.Tesla now has 1,655 vehicles and 798 drivers registered for its taxi service in California, a CPUC spokesperson said. Tesla is required to update the agency over time as it continues adding new cars into the fleet, but not drivers. The registration count reflects how many vehicles are cleared to operate, but not necessarily how many are on the road at any one time.In December 2024, Tesla registered over 220 test drivers and 100 vehicles for a permit with the California Department of Motor Vehicles that would let it test its self-driving software with a test driver present.","Tesla is said to be hiring factory floor workers and salespeople to become ""AI operators"" for its self-driving ride-sharing service.

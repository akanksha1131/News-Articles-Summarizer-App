A recent study by researchers at Stanford University, highlights serious concerns about using AI tools like ChatGPT for emotional support. The researchers found that ChatGPT often fails to meet basic standards of therapy—it can unintentionally reinforce harmful thoughts, provide overly agreeable answers to serious mental health issues, or respond with stigma to sensitive topics like addiction or psychosis. In some cases, it even offered misleading reassurance in situations involving suicidal ideation. The conclusion? These tools aren’t built to handle the nuance, ethics, or responsibility required in mental health conversations. Using ChatGPT as a therapist might feel helpful in the moment, but it's no substitute for real, professional mental health support. With the rise of AI tools offering instant answers and emotional validation, it's easy to fall into the trap of offloading your feelings onto a chatbot. After all, it's free, always available, and won’t judge you. But here’s the truth: ChatGPT isn’t trained to handle mental health crises, trauma, or the deep complexities of human psychology. Relying on AI for emotional support can create a false sense of healing while leaving underlying issues untouched. Here's why it's risky — and what you should do instead.No matter how empathetic it sounds, ChatGPT is not a therapist. It doesn’t have degrees, training, or the human intuition needed to support you through emotional trauma, mental health disorders, or crisis situations. It can mimic supportive language, but it can’t offer a diagnosis or real therapeutic techniques.AI responds based on your input. If you’re spiraling or catastrophising, it may unintentionally mirror that language back to you, or offer overly neutral responses that don't help you break the cycle. This can reinforce anxiety or depressive thought loops instead of challenging them — something a trained therapist would actually help you do.Therapy isn’t one-size-fits-all. A real mental health professional tailors their approach based on your personality, history, coping mechanisms, and responses over time. ChatGPT doesn't learn about you as a person, it responds to prompts, not progress.AI isn't trained to spot subtle warning signs like suicidal ideation, dissociation, or psychosis. There’s no safeguard if your mental health is in real danger and AI will never tell you to seek emergency help unless you bring it up explicitly.Many users turn to ChatGPT because it's easy and anonymous. But this convenience can delay your decision to seek therapy, especially if you feel temporarily ""better"" after venting to a chatbot. Temporary relief isn’t long-term healing.Even though OpenAI doesn’t store conversations for model training if you opt out, there’s always a privacy risk when discussing sensitive personal issues with an online tool. Therapy offers confidentiality protected by law — AI doesn’t.A huge part of therapy’s power lies in feeling seen, heard, and understood by another human being. That emotional resonance, facial expressions, and real-time empathy are impossible to replicate with text-based AI. Real healing is deeply relational.You can still use AI in supportive ways as a tool, not a therapist. Try using ChatGPT for:Journaling promptsChatGPT can be a great supplement, but it’s not a substitute for mental healthcare. If you’re struggling, the best thing you can do is reach out to a licensed therapist, counselor, or psychologist.

"Amazon layoffs: Company may have cut at least hundreds of jobs, this unit hit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-layoffs-company-may-have-cut-at-least-hundreds-of-jobs-this-unit-hit/articleshow/122660881.cms,"Latest tech layoffs at Amazon part of targeted job cuts



Amazon streamlining company structure and adopting AI



Amazon’s cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has cut at least hundreds of jobs on Thursday (July 17), news agency Reuters reported citing two sources. This move comes just a month after CEO Andy Jassy indicated that the increasing adoption of generative AI tools would lead to a reduced workforce. With the latest cuts, Amazon joins other tech giants such as Microsoft, Facebook parent Meta and Intel that have continued to lay off hundreds of employees this year.The agency said that while an Amazon spokesperson confirmed the layoffs, they did not provide specific numbers. Amazon reported 1.6 million full and part-time employees globally at the end of March.“We've made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS. These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimise resources to deliver innovation for our customers,” an Amazon spokesperson was quoted as saying.According to a Reuters report, these layoffs are part of ongoing, targeted job cuts across Amazon. The company recently reduced roles in its books, devices, and services unit, as well as its Wondery podcast division.Multiple employees claimed that they received termination emails and had their computers deactivated on July 17 morning. While the full extent of the layoffs remains unclear, the “specialists” group, which assists customers with new product ideas and sells existing services, was notably affected.Previously reports said that CEO Andy Jassy is actively working to reduce what he describes as excess bureaucracy, including by eliminating managerial positions. Amazon, among many corporations, is increasingly using AI to write software code and employing AI agents to automate routine tasks. This trend aims to reduce costs and lessen reliance on human workers.","Amazon’s cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has cut at least hundreds of jobs on Thursday (July 17), news agency Reuters reported citing two sources.

Mark Zuckerberg is doing to AI datacentres what Elon Musk did to Tesla,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mark-zuckerberg-is-doing-to-ai-datacentres-what-elon-musk-did-to-tesla/articleshow/122658983.cms,"Source: Instagram/ Mark Zuckerberg

What these tent-based data centres mean for Mark Zuckerberg's AI plans



Facebook's parent company, Meta , is reportedly constructing some of its new AI data centres inside tents. This move allows the social media giant to rapidly expand capacity at its existing data centre campuses. The strategy essentially mirrors an approach taken by Elon Musk's Tesla in 2018. At that time, Tesla built a new Model 3 assembly line in just two weeks within a large tent outside its main factory. This quick setup significantly increased the car’s production, with the tented area reportedly contributing to 20% of all Model 3s produced that week.According to a report by Business Insider, a company spokesperson, while confirming the news, has emphasised that the entire ""supercluster"" facility isn't solely tent-based. This comes days after company CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company will spend tens and millions of dollars for several multi-gigawatt superclusters to ramp up its compute power.These structures will provide Meta the necessary push in quickly deploying additional AI computing power. Data centres contain complex and expensive equipment that requires precise temperature control to prevent overheating. Building parts of these facilities in tents suggests a prioritisation of speed over traditional construction methods, the report noted.According to SemiAnalysis (via Business Insider), Meta’s embrace of this ""speed above all else"" data centre design is ""inspired by xAI's unprecedented time-to-market."" The report added that Meta is already building more such facilities, a development that will likely surprise traditional data centre and real estate investors.SemiAnalysis, however, highlighted the use of “prefabricated power and cooling modules” and “ultra-light structures” to prioritise speed. However, operating data centres in tents presents challenges, particularly regarding heat. Tents can get very hot, potentially forcing Meta to temporarily shut down workloads during peak summer temperatures.As per SemiAnalysis CEO Dylan Patel, while Meta will likely build permanent data centres in the long term, the company needs these facilities operational “as soon as possible” in the short and medium term. He added that “everyone is trying to build data centres as fast as possible in the race to achieve AGI,” and Meta is using tents to “reduce construction bottlenecks” related to power, data center capacity, and construction crews.","Facebook's parent company, Meta, is reportedly constructing some of its new AI data centres inside tents.

OpenAI’s relationship with Microsoft and other cloud deals



ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has said that it expects to use Google’s cloud infrastructure for its popular artificial intelligence (AI) assistant. The reach to one of the biggest competitors of Microsoft – the tech giant company that has spent about $13 billion in the company – for additional capacity aligns with its desire for more computing power to meet heavy demand after initially relying exclusively on Microsoft for cloud capacity.According to a report by CNBC, OpenAI has added Google to a list of suppliers, specifying that ChatGPT and its application programming interface will use the Google Cloud Platform, as well as Microsoft, CoreWeave and Oracle.The announcement amounts to a win for Google, whose cloud unit is younger and smaller than Amazon’s and Microsoft’s. Google also has a cloud business with Anthropic, which was established by former OpenAI executives.The Google infrastructure will run in the US, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom, the report added.Last year, Oracle announced that it was partnering with Microsoft and OpenAl “to extend the Microsoft Azure Al platform to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure” to give OpenAI additional computing power. In March, OpenAI committed to a cloud agreement with CoreWeave in a five-year deal worth nearly $12 billion.Microsoft said in January that it had agreed to move to a model of providing the right of first refusal anytime OpenAI needs more computing resources, rather than being its exclusive vendor across the board. Microsoft continues to hold the exclusive on OpenAI’s programming interfaces.OpenAI and Microsoft’s relations have evolved since last year, with Microsoft naming OpenAI as a competitor last year as both companies sell AI tools for developers and offer subscriptions to companies.Sam Altman, OpenAI’s co-founder and CEO, said in April that the startup, which draws on Nvidia graphics processing units to power its large language models, was facing capacity constraints.“if anyone has GPU capacity in 100k chunks we can get asap please call!” he wrote in an X post at the time.",ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has said that it expects to use Google’s cloud infrastructure for its popular artificial intelligence (AI) assistant.

Mark Zuckerberg dismissed ‘extreme claims’

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and a group of the company's former and current investors have reached a settlement in a $8 billion lawsuit, reports Reuters. As per the news agency, a lawyer for the shareholders announced the settlement in Delaware’s Court of Chancery on Thursday (July 17), just as the trial was entering its second day. “The agreement just came together quickly,” Reuters report quotes Sam Closic, lawyer for the plaintiffs.The lawsuit, filed by shareholders, named 11 defendants including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, venture capitalist and Meta board member Marc Andreessen , and former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. It accused Meta executives of failing to stop repeated privacy violations, which led to billions in fines and legal costs for Meta.The lawsuit stemmed from the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal , where data from millions of Facebook users was accessed by the now-defunct political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump's 2016 US presidential campaign.In 2019, the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook $5 billion for violating a 2012 agreement to protect user data.

Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for 'offensive' political slurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/poland-flags-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-to-the-eu-for-offensive-political-slurs/articleshow/122348777.cms,"Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for “offensive” political slurs

Why Poland says Elon Musk's Grok chatbot crossed a red line



Offensive answers: From antisemitic tropes to political insults



European digital rules put xAI under the spotlight



Previous incidents: Turkey, hate speech, and Grok’s growing rap sheet



xAI and Musk offer silence, at least for now



Poland just pulled the alarm on Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk ’s xAI. Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates. Poland’s complaint tees up an early test of those combined powers.Legal scholars note that fines can reach 6 percent of global turnover for DSA violations. For Musk’s empire, that runs into billions.Poland is not alone. A Turkish court ordered X to block Grok content that mocked President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Islamic beliefs.In June, users spotted the bot rambling about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. xAI blamed an “unauthorised change” to its response code.Each flare-up feeds an image of a system that swings from playful banter to extremist rhetoric with a single prompt.As of Wednesday afternoon, xAI had not replied to Reuters’ emailed questions, and Musk’s normally hyperactive X feed stayed quiet on the topic.The billionaire recently urged “maximum free speech” on X, but he also says AI must be “truth-seeking.” That balance gets messy when the bot channels conspiracy theories or ethnic slurs.","Poland says the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

Based on 50,000 students travellers through its Student GoPass program since January 2025, the data offers a window into Gen Z’s travel habits—and how they balance safety, convenience, and affordability. The Student GoPass program offers verified students exclusive discounts across flights, hotels, and buses, aiming to support their travel needs with a digital-first, budget-conscious experience.The findings indicate a notable divergence in preferred modes of transport. Female students are considerably more inclined to fly, with 36% opting for domestic flights compared to just 23% of their male counterparts. On the other hand, ground transport, including buses and trains, is favoured by 50% of male students, while only 34% of female students choose these options. This difference suggests that factors such as safety and time efficiency may play a crucial role in female students' travel decisions.Device usage and payment behaviors further underscore these contrasts. More than one-third of female students utilize iPhones, a higher proportion than the one in four observed among male students. While UPI remains the dominant payment method for both genders, its adoption is higher among women (71%) than men (64%). Interestingly, female students are also 50% less likely to use ""Pay Later"" services, suggesting a preference for immediate payment.Nearly three out of four students across genders choose accommodation priced under Rs 3,000 per night. Additionally, 63% of students book their travel more than a week in advance.""The female student traveler is digitally savvy, deliberate in her choices, and values both convenience and safety,"" commented Raj Rishi Singh, CMO, Goibibo.

Google is a giant bureaucratic organization: Perplexity CEO

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas recently took an aim at Google saying their core business model is not built for the AI-driven future of web browsing. In a Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" on July 16, Srinivas said that Google’s reliance on ads is at odds with AI agents. He wrote “They have business model constraints on letting agents do the clicks and work for you while continuing to charge advertisers enormous money to keep bidding for clicks and conversions”. Stating that the tech giant is constrained by its need to protect ad revenue, he said “At some point, they need to embrace one path and suffer, in order to come out stronger; rather than hedging and playing both ways”.Aravind Srinivas also criticized Google’s internal structure, calling it “a giant bureaucratic organization” with “too many decision makers and disjoint teams.”Srinivas, during the AMA session, said that he expects Google to ""pay close attention"" and eventually copy or adopt features from Comet – the company’s AI-powered web browser.At a Y Combinator event in June, Perplexity CEO said “If your company is something that can make revenue on the scale of hundreds of millions of dollars or potentially billions of dollars, you should always assume that a model company will copy it”.Aravind Srinivas also referred to Google’s internal Project Mariner as “similar but quite limited.” He said the browser is designed to prioritize users, not advertisers.Stating that “We underestimated people's willingness to pay,” he added that “We also want to bring a change to this world. Enough of the monopoly of Google”.Comet is currently available by invitation and only to users of Perplexity’s top-tier plan, priced at $200/month or $2,000/year. A free version is planned.Despite his criticism, Srinivas acknowledged the browser wouldn’t be possible without Chromium, the open-source project maintained by Google.","Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas recently took an aim at Google saying their core business model is not built for the AI-driven future of web browsing.

Hi team,

After reviewing our company and its operations, I've made the decision to restructure several parts of the GenAI organization. I believe these changes will best position us for the long-term, make the org more efficient, and allow GenAI to focus on the biggest and most profitable opportunities.

As a result of this restructuring, some members of this org will be leaving Scale today. To ensure a smooth process and give people the necessary space, please do not come into the office. All impacted FTEs will receive an email to their personal email address by 8am PT and badge and IT access will be removed. For those not impacted, I will share more details later this morning on the restructuring and our path forward.

I know news like this is tough, but please know how grateful I am for the work this team has done. Whether you're directly affected by these changes or not, every one of you has helped build Scale into the company it is today and the accomplishments it has made.

Thank you again.

What makes some Google employees believe that Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis may succeed Sundar Pichai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-makes-some-google-employees-believe-that-google-ai-ceo-demis-hassabis-may-succeed-sundar-pichai/articleshow/122643213.cms,"Why some Google employees are 'betting' on Demis Hassabis as Google CEO

Who is Demis Hassabis

Pebble Halo Smart Ring: India's FIRST Smart Ring with Digital Display

Demis Hassabis , CEO of Google DeepMind is reportedly being seen by some Google employees as a potential successor to the current CEO Sundar Pichai . While there is no official word on any succession plan, a Business Insider report says Hassabis' swift rise in recent years has followed a pattern similar to that of Pichai’s own journey to the top. “His rise reminds me of Sundar's,” a longtime Google employee who has worked closely with Hassabis and Pichai told the publication. “All of a sudden, you started hearing this name Sundar internally, and he kept having more and more responsibility, and all of a sudden, he was the CEO,” the employee added.Continuing further, the employee stated “Demis' rise has been similar. Now, all of a sudden, he's responsible for what is probably the most important team at Google right now.”Hassabis joined Google in 2014 when the company acquired DeepMind, the artificial intelligence company he co-founded with Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman. Post merger, Hassabis has had to shift from pure research to product development and corporate leadership. The merger also led to the departure of several DeepMind employees who felt the organization had moved too far from its original research mission.“Some people joined an academic research lab and suddenly they're being asked to build products, and that's not what they wanted,” a former DeepMind employee told Business Insider.According to the report, Google employees are now wondering whether Hassabis is being groomed to take over as CEO someday. His deep understanding of AI and rising influence within the company make him a natural candidate — especially if Google continues its shift toward becoming an AI-first company . “Hassabis is the smartest bet,” said one of the employees.""My opinion is this is not going to happen,"" said another person. ""But I'm less certain about that than I was a year ago.""Others believe Hassabis may not want the job. Being CEO of Google, an employee said, means overseeing massive ad and search businesses, dealing with regulatory scrutiny, and answering to shareholders — responsibilities that could take him away from the research work he loves.“He does it because he knows the company needs it,” a Google employee said. “But being CEO would push him away from the things he wants to do. This guy wants to cure cancer.”Demis Hassabis is a British artificial intelligence researcher, neuroscientist, and entrepreneur best known as the co-founder and CEO of Google DeepMind. Born in London, Hassabis was a child chess prodigy, becoming a master at the age of 13. He later studied computer science at Cambridge and earned a PhD in cognitive neuroscience from University College London.In 2010, he co-founded DeepMind with the goal of creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) — machines that can think and learn like humans.

Ever noticed friends dropping words like “delve”, “meticulous”, or “groundbreaking” mid-conversation? That’s not just coincidence—it’s a phenomenon researchers are calling humans speaking more like ChatGPT . A recent study from the Max Planck Institute analyzed over 360,000 YouTube videos and 771,000 podcast episodes recorded before and after ChatGPT’s release in late 2022. They tracked a rise in AI‑style terms—""GPT words"" like ""delve"", ""comprehend"", ""swift"", and ""meticulous"", all of which surged by up to 51% in daily speech. This isn't just about words. We're adopting a new tone—more polished, structured, and emotionally neutral—mirroring the AI models we interact with daily. And it's not contained to our inboxes; this shift shows up when we're face‑to‑face, on Zoom, or even grabbing chai.Data indicates a clear pattern: words once rare in spoken English now pop up regularly. ChatGPT outputs favoured terms with academic flair, such as “delve,” “meticulous,” and “bolster.” These are spreading across public discourse—clips of people saying them in casual chats are more common than ever .This trend shows the cultural feedback loop—AI learned from us, now we’re learning from AI. As Levin Brinkmann from Max Planck says: “Machines… can, in turn, measurably reshape human culture.”It’s not just about word choice. Researchers have flagged shifts toward polished, diplomatic phrasing and emotionally restrained delivery—hallmarks of AI-generated content. Think fewer “OMG!” moments and more “That’s interesting” or “Great point.” Scenes of bland, extra-polite phrasing—a phenomenon even nicknamed “corp‑speak”—are now peppered into everyday life.“Thank you for your question.” “I understand your concern.” “Let me help you with that.” Sound familiar? More people are mimicking AI’s hyper-formal tone, especially online. Blame it on exposure. Our brains are copycats — and the more we interact with bots, the more we start to echo their tone, especially when trying to sound ‘neutral’ or 'helpful'.ChatGPT tends to explain everything — and now, so do we. You’ll hear people over-justify basic decisions or give mini-lectures instead of just saying “I don’t know.” We’re learning to speak with caveats and footnotes, like a human disclaimer generator. ""Technically speaking, while I can't confirm that…""TikToks and memes like “Me when I start talking like ChatGPT in real life” or “My brain after 2 months of using AI” are viral for a reason. They’re feeding the loop. The more we laugh about it, the more it becomes a real thing. Irony or not — it’s changing how we speak.Job interviews, customer service chats, even college emails — are getting the AI makeover. Formal, structured, zero slang. It's because tools like ChatGPT have trained us to “sound smart” in a certain way. We're unintentionally scripting ourselves like bots in suits.Not quite. But our language is evolving , just like it did with texting, emojis, or Twitter threads. ChatGPT and other AIs didn’t start the change, but they’re definitely accelerating it. We’re adapting, experimenting, and mimicking which is peak human behaviour, ironically. So next time you end a rant with “Hope this helps!” or tell your bestie “As a human friend, I suggest…” — just embrace the bit.","ChatGPT-Style vocabulary is reshaping everyday speech.

When Microsoft founder Bill Gates said he could not start his day without playing this mobile game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-microsoft-founder-bill-gates-said-he-could-not-start-his-day-without-playing-this-mobile-game/articleshow/122640191.cms,"Other word puzzle games that Bill Gates plays



Bill Gates’ strategy to improve his Wordle score

Microsoft founder Bill Gates once said that solving the popular word puzzle – Wordle has become a key part of his daily routine. In a 2022 blog post, Gates wrote that he plays it every morning after waking up and “can't stop playing Wordle”. “I've started every day since February or March doing the same thing. Not long after I wake up, I grab my phone or laptop and solve Wordle, the puzzle where you get six chances to guess a five-letter English word,” he said. Bill Gates also shared that he usually solves Wordle in four or five guesses, and once solved all eight Octordle words in 10 tries — but only in practice mode.In the blog post then, Gates also revealed that other than Wordle, he enjoys playing similar games like Quordle and Octordle, which involve guessing four and eight words, respectively.Along with those, Gates plays Nerdle, a numbers-based puzzle that involves math equations. He said he’s probably better at Nerdle than the word games.""As a math-oriented person, I'm probably better at Nerdle than the word-related versions, though I don't have as many friends and family members who like to do it.""Gates said he often compares scores with friends and family. ""Unlike some other time stinks, puzzle games such as Wordle are a great way to connect with people,"" he then said.Gates then wrote that he uses strategy to improve his guesses, starting with words heavy on vowels. ""I like to start with a word that contains lots of vowels, like Audio or Ounce. Adieu is a good one too,"" he said.He explained how knowing common letter patterns helps with solving. For example, he watches for letter pairs like C and H or S and L. He also noted that letters like Q, V, X, and Z stand out because they are less commonly used.""There's a lot of strategy in it. You always want to be gaining as much new information.""Gates believes his reading habits give him an advantage. He cited examples like Smite, which he recognized from the Bible, and Duchy, a word he learned through English literature. He also admitted that some puzzles come down to luck. He gave the example of guessing “Pasty” instead of “Tasty” on his last try, even though he had four of the five letters correct.""The hardest part of the game is when you have four of the five letters but there are multiple potential answers,"" he said.Words ending in “-ight” — like Light, Tight, Fight, and Sight — can be especially tricky.","Microsoft founder Bill Gates once said that solving the popular word puzzle – Wordle has become a key part of his daily routine.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang challenges AI assumptions following DeepSeek success: ‘Almost the entire world got it wrong’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-challenges-ai-assumptions-following-deepseek-success-almost-the-entire-world-got-it-wrong/articleshow/119181503.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang rebuffs claims of AI chip competitors by stressing the need for more computational power in AI. He unveiled Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell Ultra GPU, set for release this year, with increased memory for larger AI models. Future chips include the Vera Rubin system in 2026 and Feynman in 2028 for faster AI processing.

Nvidia launches next-generation GPU chip, Blackwell Ultra

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has fired back at recent skepticism surrounding the company’s dominance in the AI chip market , directly addressing claims that competitors like China's DeepSeek have achieved comparable AI capabilities with significantly less hardware. At a big event for computer programmers, Huang said that everyone has been wrong about how much computer power you need for AI.“Almost the entire world got it wrong,” Huang said on stage at the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference (GTC) he called “the Super Bowl of AI”, as per news agency Reuters.“The amount of computation we need as a result of agentic AI , as a result of reasoning, is easily 100 times more than we thought we needed this time last year,” he said, referring to AI agents that require little human intervention for routine tasks.Huang emphasized that Nvidia is well-positioned to meet these changing demands. He highlighted the importance of both speed and scale in AI inference, stating, ""If you take too long to answer a question, the customer is not going to come back. This is like web search.""Nvidia also announced a new generation of chips, including the next-generation GPU chip , Blackwell Ultra . Blackwell Ultra is set for release in the second half of this year and will feature increased memory compared to the current Blackwell chip, enabling the support of larger AI models.The successor to Blackwell, the Vera Rubin chip system is slated for release in the second half of 2026 and will offer even faster processing speeds. Nvidia also plans to continue its chip development trajectory with the Feynman chips, expected to arrive in 2028.These new chips are designed to optimise AI systems for both rapid and high-volume responses. Huang argued that Nvidia's chips are uniquely capable of delivering both, a crucial factor for user satisfaction and retention.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said everyone has been wrong about how much computer power you need for AI.

What is BYD’s new charging tech

What BYD’s “Super e-Platform” means for Tesla and beyond

What may hurt BYD

China is witnessing another groundbreaking moment akin to the DeepSeek breakthrough, this time with BYD's revolutionary 5-minute charging technology, potentially posing a significant challenge for Tesla. BYD, China’s leading energy and automotive powerhouse, has unveiled an ultra-fast electric vehicle (EV) charging system that rivals the speed of refueling a traditional gas tank. The company, the largest EV manufacturer in China, revealed on Monday (March 18) that its flash-chargers can fully charge its latest EV models in just five to eight minutes -— comparable to the time it takes to fill up a fuel-powered vehicle. Wang Chuanfu, BYD’s billionaire founder and CEO, emphasized that this Shenzhen-based company’s new charging technology can deliver approximately 470 kilometers (292 miles) of range in a mere five minutes for BYD’s proprietary EV batteries.This advancement suggests that BYD may have surpassed competitors like Tesla and Mercedes-Benz in the race for superior fast-charging technology, though its system’s success depends on factors such as adequate voltage at charging stations. BYD—short for ""Build Your Dreams""—has launched pre-sales for its upgraded Han L and Tang L models, building on the success of their predecessors.Following the announcement, Tesla’s stock took a hit, while BYD Co’s shares soared to a record high. This charging breakthrough marks yet another setback for Tesla, a company whose lofty valuation hinges on its ability to innovate relentlessly and maintain a competitive edge.Originally a battery manufacturer, BYD has honed its expertise in battery and energy storage solutions while growing into a global automotive force. The company claims its 1-megawatt flash chargers can provide nearly 250 miles of range in five minutes. According to Wang Chuanfu, achieving such rapid charging speeds requires ultra-high voltage and substantial current capacity.“Our goal is to eliminate charging anxiety entirely by making EV charging as fast as refueling a gas vehicle,” Wang stated.BYD also highlighted that its flash-charging system leverages self-developed silicon carbide power chips, capable of handling voltage levels up to 1,500V. Industry analyst Michael Dunne recently noted that BYD’s Blade lithium-iron phosphate battery—considered one of the safest and most efficient EV batteries globally—is even used by Tesla in some of its models. In 2024, BYD produced over 4.3 million “new energy vehicles,” a 41% increase from the previous year, including 1.8 million battery electric vehicles and 2.5 million plug-in hybrids.Why charging tech matters for EVsAs competition intensifies among EV and battery manufacturers, the push for faster charging infrastructure has become critical. This is partly driven by consumer concerns about range limitations and charging times compared to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. While slow charging and limited range have historically hindered the transition from gas and diesel cars to EVs, Chinese drivers have embraced the shift, with sales of battery-powered and hybrid vehicles surging 40% last year.BYD’s “Super e-Platform” technology boasts a peak charging capacity of 1,000kW—double that of Tesla’s forthcoming V4 Superchargers, which will max out at 500kW upon their 2025 rollout. This advanced charging capability debuts in the Han L sedan and Tang L SUV, with starting prices around 270,000 yuan ($37,330).These developments intensify pressure on domestic competitors as well as global players like Tesla and Volkswagen, both of which have seen their market share erode amid China’s EV boom. In the first two months of 2025, BYD captured roughly 27% of China’s EV production, selling over 405,000 vehicles, according to Automobility, a Shanghai-based consultancy. The company commands an 18% share of the pure battery EV market and a dominant 56% of the plug-in hybrid segment.Despite its strides, BYD isn’t without vulnerabilities. Analyst Michael Dunne pointed out that the 2024 JD Power China New Energy Vehicle Initial Quality Study ranked BYD’s Seal and Song Plus models at the bottom, signaling potential quality concerns that could temper its momentum.","China’s leading energy and automotive powerhouse, BYD, has unveiled an ultra- fast electric vehicle (EV) charging system that rivals the speed of refueling a traditional gas tank.

"What Donald Trump’s proposed travel ban means for Indians on H-1B, F-1 visas: Things they should not miss",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-donald-trumps-proposed-travel-ban-means-for-indians-on-h-1b-f-1-visas-things-they-should-not-miss/articleshow/119174149.cms,"The US government considers new travel restrictions for citizens from up to 43 countries to enhance security. These include full visa suspensions for 10 countries and partial restrictions for others. Immigration lawyers are advising H-1B workers, F-1 students, and Green Card holders to avoid travel due to stricter visa renewal regulations.

Immigration lawyers to H-1B workers, F-1 international students: Avoid travel for these very reasons

The US government is considering implementing new travel restrictions that could affect citizens from up to 43 countries. This proposal is part of an intensified effort to enhance national security through stricter vetting processes. The countries under consideration have been categorized into three groups based on the severity of the proposed restrictions. First, full visa suspensions could be applied to 10 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, and North Korea, where all visa issues might be suspended. Second, five countries, including Haiti and Myanmar, may face partial restrictions on visa issuances. Third, the remaining 26 countries, including Belarus and Pakistan, have been given 60 days to improve their security protocols, failing which they could face partial visa restrictions.The US government’s proposed travel ban list has raised concerns among visa holders and Green Card applicants. Even though India is not on the list, immigration lawyers are advising H-1B workers , F-1 international students, and even Green Card holders to avoid traveling outside the US due to fears of stricter visa renewal rules and increased scrutiny upon return.One of the biggest concerns is the recent change in interview waiver rules. Previously, applicants could skip an in-person interview if their visa had expired within 48 months.However, under the new rule, only those whose visas expired within the past 12 months qualify for an interview waiver. This means international students on F-1 visas transitioning to an H-1B work visa must now schedule an interview.Similarly, H-1B workers needing an extension must also go through an interview if their last visa expired more than a year ago. Seattle-based immigration attorney Kripa Upadhyay warns that those needing renewals should “think twice before leaving the US right now” due to uncertainty in visa processing times.Immigration experts are also seeing increased administrative processing, where applications are delayed for extra security checks—sometimes for no clear reason. Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, told TOI that the delays are creating major hurdles, adding, ""We know of individuals stuck in administrative processing for no apparent reason other than additional scrutiny and security clearances. This should not have happened if the individual had been previously approved for a visa multiple times. I think we can expect to see 'extreme vetting' similar to the tenure of the earlier Trump administration.”Further complicating matters, US consular officers abroad can still refuse a visa even if USCIS has approved it. If that happens, the application is sent back for re-evaluation, leaving the applicant stranded outside the US for months.While India is not currently affected by the proposed travel ban, the increasing visa restrictions and heightened scrutiny are making travel risky for many non-immigrant visa holders and Green Card applicants.","US government considers new travel restrictions for citizens from up to 43 countries.

In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them! The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden. He knew nothing about them, and the people that did may have committed a crime. Therefore, those on the Unselect Committee, who destroyed and deleted ALL evidence obtained during their two year Witch Hunt of me, and many other innocent people, should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level. The fact is, they were probably responsible for the Documents that were signed on their behalf without the knowledge or consent of the Worst President in the History of our Country, Crooked Joe Biden!”

What is an Autopen and how it works



US President Donald Trump recently announced that pardons issued by his predecessor, Joe Biden , are invalid. In a post shared on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump claimed that these pardons are not valid because they were signed using an Autopen. President Trump emphasised that the use of an Autopen in pardons undermines their legitimacy.In the Truth Social post, Trump wrote:An Autopen is a mechanical device that automatically replicates a handwritten signature, making it useful for politicians, executives, and celebrities who need to sign a large volume of documents.The device works by digitally capturing a person’s signature and storing it internally. A robotic arm or mechanical pen then precisely reproduces the recorded signature on documents. Although the output appears to be handwritten, it is entirely machine-generated.This technology has been in use for some time now and is a common tool among the US presidents . According to a report by the New York Times, Barack Obama was the first US President to sign an executive order using an Autopen in 2011.","US President Donald Trump recently announced that pardons issued by his predecessor, Joe Biden, are invalid.

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?



Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Air Canada and Thales issue joint statement

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories.” According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales. Air Canada and Thales issued a joint statement acknowledging the error and stating that the issue has been ""resolved."" ""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy."" Thales added in a separate statement that the map had been provided by a third party.The map feature was promptly disabled, and an updated version will be installed across the fleet starting March 14. Air Canada and Thales apologized for the ""unease created by this situation.""This is not the first time such an issue has occurred in aviation. JetBlue apologized for a similar map error in 2024, and British Airways faced a similar situation in 2013. In 2018, SWISS confirmed its policy of turning off maps entirely when landing in Tel Aviv after a similar incident. Thales stated that the maps are supplied by a third party and that they are working with the airline and the provider to resolve the issue quickly.","Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories” The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.

Baidu has unveiled its AI model, Ernie X1, which is designed to articulate its reasoning process. The Ernie X1 model operates on similar principles to DeepSeek R1 , a model that garnered significant attention in Silicon Valley for its ability to deliver comparable performance to leading chatbots at a significantly lower development cost. Baidu emphasises that its reasoning model excels in areas such as daily dialogue, complex calculations, and logical deduction, as per a report.Bloomberg reports that in addition to the Ernie X1 launch, China's leading internet search provider has upgraded its flagship foundation model to Ernie 4.5 . Notably, the company has made all tiers of its AI service, including the X1 model, freely accessible to its chatbot users, accelerating its initial plans by several weeks.Baidu claims that Ernie 4.5 outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT 4.5 in text generation, citing various industry benchmarks. Baidu has also announced its intention to make its Ernie AI models open-source starting June 30. The company has also integrated the R1 model into its core search engine business.This launch appears to be a strategic move to regain momentum in the competitive AI landscape, where Baidu faces increasing pressure from emerging rivals such as DeepSeek, the report added.While Baidu was the first major Chinese tech company to introduce a ChatGPT-like chatbot, it has since faced stiff competition from rivals like TikTok parent company ByteDance and Moonshot AI. Furthermore, open-source models such as Alibaba's Qwen and DeepSeek have received recognition within the global developer community, the report added.The generative AI boom has positively impacted Baidu's financial performance, with a 26% increase in cloud revenue reported in its December-quarter results. This growth, driven by services provided to developers seeking computing power, was somewhat offset by weaker advertising sales amidst China's challenging economic conditions.","Baidu has unveiled its new Ernie X1 AI model, designed to articulate its reasoning process.

Facebook’s extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

And security will continue to be key differentiators for HP going forward,” said Lores.Lores shared HP’s strategy and vision for the future, focusing on leveraging technology and adapting to global changes to drive business growth and customer experience.He talked about three big trends that HP is focusing on: Technological advancements (especially AI), geopolitical changes (shift from globalisation to regionalisation), and evolving customer preferences (desire for flexibility and fulfillment).“We thought AI was going to be a transformational technology…that it was going to have as much impact as the internet had at the beginning of the century. Twelve months later, we can only confirm that the opportunities that we see have been driven by AI continue to grow and continue to be more impactful,” Lores said.He highlighted that HP’s strategy involves driving AI at the edge, enabling customers to run models locally for lower costs, higher privacy and faster speeds while referring to DeepSeek, a Chinese company that made waves for launching cost-efficient AI models“When I talk to many clients today, the conversation is not anymore about the opportunities. It’s about the progress that has been made, how customer support has been changed, how software development has evolved and has become much more efficient,” Lores added.“A very significant change in the last 12 months has been on the technology side. We have seen not only models getting more complex and being more capable, but also a new generation of models, simpler models that can deliver significant value to our customers. And this is a very important confirmation of the strategy we have,” the CEO noted.Lores highlighted the shift from a globalisation model to a regionalization model, where products are built and distributed regionally.“[The] second big change that we see in the world is driven by geopolitics,” he said, explaining that the globalisation model of building factories in one location and selling products all over the world is going obsolete.“We think that we are going from a globalisation model to a regionalisation model where products will be built regionally, will be distributed digitally and eventually will also be designed visually to be more focused on the needs of specific regions,” he added.Lores said that the company aims to bridge the gap between companies' productivity goals and employees' desire for flexibility and fulfillment.“[The] last change that we see, and eventually the opportunity that we see, is how needs for our customers are rewarded. We want to increase the fulfillment with activities we do by being focused on the tasks that are more value added and where we believe we can add more value,” Lores added.HP is prioritising building products and solutions that benefit both companies and employees.","HP CEO Enrique Lores said security will be even more critical in the AI era than in the past decade.

JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to students at Stanford University: I don’t defend your right to tell me what ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jp-morgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-to-students-at-stanford-university-i-dont-defend-your-right-to-tell-me-what-/articleshow/119167398.cms,"JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon

Attending office important for young workforce

America's largest bank JPMorgan Chase made five days work from office compulsory starting this month. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has been a strong advocate of working from the office, saying that it fosters better learning, innovation and culture. In an internal memo announcing the end of work from home, Jamie Dimon wrote, ""Now is the right time to solidify our full-time in-office approach."" He added, ""We think it is the best way to run the company.""Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, recently spoke to students at Stanford University 's Graduate School of Business, defending his stance against remote work. According t a report in New York Post, Dimon, aged 68, expressed his frustration with virtual working, stating that it ""doesn't work in our business."" The comment came in response to a student's question about his blunt remarks from a company town hall, where he addressed the bank's decision to end hybrid work arrangements, a practice that has gained popularity since the coronavirus pandemic.Dimon said that he supports remote work where it proves effective and respects employees' rights to prefer it. But at the same time, JP Morgan CEO emphasized that he won't let individual preferences dictate company policy. “We have 10% of our people working at home full-time,” Dimon said. “We put virtual call centers in Baltimore and Detroit. We did it to see if they’d be effective. They’re highly effective. They work from home. They’re mostly minorities. That’s why we did it. So I’m not against it where it works … I also completely defend your right to say, ‘I don’t want to.'” “But I don’t defend your right to tell me what JPMorgan’s gonna do,” he added. “So you have a free market. You can do one thing, I can do another. That’s what’s called a free market.”When asked for advice on handling virtual work, Dimon suggested that only ""people in the middle,"" such as corporate office workers, are frustrated with returning to the office. He pointed out that many essential workers, like those in restaurants, never had the option to work remotely. ""Where did you get your Amazon packages from? Your beef, your meat, your vodka? Where did you get the diapers from?"" he asked, highlighting the 60% of Americans who continued working throughout the pandemic, including UPS and FedEx employees, manufacturers, agricultural workers, hospital staff, nurses, sanitation workers, firefighters, and military personnel.Dimon also stressed the importance of in-office presence for younger employees, arguing that remote work leaves them disconnected. ""By the second year, you have less people, you're put on less assignments, you know less what's going on,"" he explained, noting fewer opportunities for casual interactions that foster learning and growth. He also dislikes setups where junior staff are in the office but their managers are not, and dismissed claims that remote work ""works for me"" as insufficient justification.Furthermore, Dimon emphasized the significance of face-to-face communication for management and culture-building, which he believes is lacking in virtual settings. He described the dynamic exchanges that occur in person, characterized by constant updates and information sharing. However, he also highlighted distractions, such as phone usage during Zoom meetings, as another drawback of remote work. For Dimon, these factors further solidify his conviction that telework is incompatible with JPMorgan’s operations and culture.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has been a strong advocate of working from the office.

The Twitter (now X) bird logo sign, which once hung outside the company's San Francisco headquarters, is being auctioned again. RR Auction is selling the famous Twitter bird logo, which could fetch up to $40,000. The sign was previously sold in a 2023 auction after Elon Musk’s takeover of the company in 2022. Other items sold in that auction included a coffee table, a beer tap, and a Twitter-themed statue that fetched thousands of dollars. “Incredible official Twitter Inc. ‘bird logo’ fascia sign formerly displayed on the exterior of the social media giant’s San Francisco headquarters—obtained from Elon Musk’s ‘rebranding auction’ in September 2023,” reads the description on the RR Auction website.The bird logo, known as ""Larry"" after basketball player Larry Bird, was part of Twitter’s identity until Musk rebranded the platform to X in 2023. The sign approximately measures 145 x 105 x 20 inches and weighs roughly 560 lbs. It served as the company’s insignia from 2012 to 2023, an 11-year span representing Twitter’s most popular and influential period.This sign was a key item in Elon Musk’s September 2023 auction, Twitter Rebranding: Online Auction Featuring Memorabilia, Art, Office Assets & More. As part of the rebranding, the company’s headquarters also changed, with blue bird decorations replaced by black walls and X-themed conference rooms. Musk has since relocated X’s headquarters from San Francisco to Texas. While Twitter and its blue bird logo are no longer in use, the symbol remains a recognizable part of tech and social media history, comparable to icons like Nike and Apple.The sign is part of a larger auction titled ""Steve Jobs and the Apple Revolution,"" which opened on February 27 and closes on March 20. Other items include Apple checks from the 1970s signed by Steve Jobs, with one bidding at over $89,000, and a working Apple I computer bidding at more than $205,000.

Bill Gates: Starting the Digital Revolution

Microsoft founder Bill Gates recently named three key figures who supported Satya Nadella’s appointment as CEO: Gates himself, former CEO Steve Ballmer , and Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith . In a conversation with Smith, Gates reflected on the decision-making process and shared his concerns about Microsoft’s future after stepping away from day-to-day operations. During the interview, Smith asked “One of the biggest bets, I would say that you were involved in making… was the choice of Satya Nadella . It was announced 11 years ago now. Looking back, how do you think about that day and that decision?”Answering Smith’s question, Gates replied:“I’ll tear up on this, ’cause it meant a lot to me. I’ve had two successors, and do I feel lucky because as I went off to do the foundation work, the one thing that plagued me was: Was I going to see the company fade in terms of its excellence?”.“Would I be haunted by: Should I go back, should I not go back?,” he stated.“So the fact that Steve took us to new heights and the fact that through a process that almost hit the wrong decision. Although you and Steve (Barmer) and I never wavered from knowing Satya would be good, and he’s been even better at navigating what even today remains one of the most complex CEO jobs in the world—makes me feel so good that I get to just come in and play a very bit role of doing product reviews, learning about AI, getting some help from Microsoft on the work that I’m doing.Gates stepped down as Microsoft’s CEO in 2000, with Ballmer taking over. When Ballmer retired in 2013, there was speculation about who would lead the company next.“It’s allowed me to throw everything in and to have the incredible resources that my Microsoft ownership created.”","Microsoft founder Bill Gates recently named three key figures who supported Satya Nadella’s appointment as CEO: Gates himself, former CEO Steve Ballmer, and Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith.

Alphabet buys Israeli startup Wiz for $32 billion in CASH: What the Biggest deal in Google history that collapsed in 2024 hints about the US government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/alphabet-buys-israeli-startup-wiz-for-32-billion-in-cash-what-the-biggest-deal-in-google-history-that-collapsed-in-2024-hint-about-the-us-government/articleshow/119165181.cms,"Why the Google-Wiz deal failed in 2024

Why Google may want to buy Wiz

Google-Wiz deal timeline

What happens to Wiz after the acquisition

Alphabet, Google's parent company, has revealed plans to acquire Wiz for $32 billion, marking its largest acquisition to date as it intensifies its focus on cybersecurity to strengthen its position in the cloud-computing competition against Amazon.com and Microsoft. This price significantly exceeds the approximately $23 billion Google offered for Wiz last year, a deal that fell through due to antitrust concerns. The acquisition still requires regulatory and other approvals to be finalized. Previously, Google's most significant purchase was Motorola Mobility, acquired for $12.5 billion in 2011.The all-cash transaction will enhance Google's cloud business with Wiz's AI-driven cybersecurity solutions, which help companies mitigate critical risks, boosting its competitiveness in an industry increasingly driven by generative AI services like ChatGPT.In 2024, a stringent regulatory climate posed challenges for many large-scale deals. However, with a new U.S. President in office and expectations of a more lenient approach to antitrust policies under the Trump administration, Wall Street anticipates a more favorable environment for big tech mergers that might have previously been stalled.Wiz, one of the fastest-growing software startups, provides cloud-based cybersecurity solutions and was valued at $12 billion in a funding round last May.The cybersecurity sector has gained significant attention following last year’s global CrowdStrike outage, which disrupted operations across multiple industries, spurring companies to bolster their online security investments.Wiz collaborates with major cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Oracle, and Google Cloud , serving clients like Morgan Stanley, BMW, and luxury giant LVMH. For Google, acquiring Wiz aligns with its ambitions to accelerate growth in two key areas: enterprise cloud, where it trails AWS and Microsoft Azure, and security, where its offerings lack the scale and growth potential of Wiz.The move also positions Google to balance its broader strategic investments, particularly in AI, by strengthening its cybersecurity portfolio.In its announcement, Google emphasized, “The growing reliance on AI and cloud services has fundamentally transformed the security landscape, elevating cybersecurity’s role in countering emerging threats and safeguarding national security.”Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian added, “Google Cloud and Wiz share a common goal of making cybersecurity more approachable and user-friendly for organizations of all sizes and sectors. By helping more businesses prevent cyberattacks—especially in complex software environments—we aim to reduce the costs, disruptions, and challenges posed by security breaches.”Google’s statement did not specify a timeline for the deal’s completion. Post-acquisition, Wiz will integrate into Google’s cloud division, though its products will remain available across all major cloud platforms.Wiz will continue operating as an independent platform, supporting all cloud providers, not exclusively Google Cloud. The company plans to expand its workforce and pursue additional acquisitions, building on efforts it has undertaken over the past year.","Alphabet, Google's parent company, has revealed plans to acquire Wiz for $32 billion.

'Spotify failure' for Meghan Markle

Meghan Markle a huge bully, claim her Spotify colleagues



The Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle has announced her new podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder , in partnership with Lemonada Media , via Instagram. “I’m so excited to share something I’ve been working on: Confessions of a Female Founder, my new podcast with @lemonadamedia!” Markle wrote. “I’ve been having honest conversations with incredible women who’ve turned their dreams into reality and transformed small ideas into hugely successful businesses. They’re sharing their tips, tricks (and stumbles), and letting me pick their brains as I build my own business, As Ever.”This new project follows Markle’s February 2024 deal with Lemonada Media after Spotify chose not to renew its $20 million contract for a second season of Archetypes. Lemonada will also re-release Archetypes, which explored the stereotypes that hold women back, across all platforms.Archetypes, which debuted in August 2022, featured 12 episodes and included guests such as Serena Williams, Mariah Carey, Mindy Kaling, and Paris Hilton. However, the series faced controversy when Podnews reported that some interviews were allegedly conducted by Markle’s staff, with her voice added in later.Additionally, a January Vanity Fair expose revealed allegations of bullying from some of Markle’s former Spotify colleagues. One individual described the experience of working with Markle as “really, really, really awful” and “very painful,” with another source likening her behavior to that of a “Mean Girls” teenager.Beyond her new podcast, Markle recently debuted an eight-part Netflix series, With Love, Meghan, showcasing her cooking and gardening skills at her Montecito home. However, the show has been met with poor reviews and garnered lower viewership than her 2022 series, Harry & Meghan.Reports suggest that Markle is also preparing to launch her lifestyle brand, As Ever, which sells products such as her signature Raspberry jam.","The Duchess of Sussex has announced her new podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder.

Bessent says China is in the middle of a recession/depression





US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has accused China of attempting to undermine the global economy by imposing export controls on critical rare earth minerals and resources essential for technology and defense. In an interview with the Financial Times, Bessent described Beijing’s actions as an effort “to pull everyone else down with them,” warning that China’s strategy could backfire. The accusations come as tensions escalate ahead of a planned meeting between the US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping Late last week in a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump said that the United States would impose new tariffs of 100% on imports from China starting November 1. He added that the US, on that same date, would also impose export controls on “any and all critical software.” The US President’s announcement came hours after he threatened to slap “a massive increase” of tariffs on Chinese imports in retaliation for new controls that China imposed on exports of rare earths minerals.Bessent suggested China’s export controls stem from its own economic struggles, stating, “They are in the middle of a recession/depression, and they are trying to export their way out of it.”He warned that such actions could further damage China’s global standing.The dispute over rare earths, crucial for both technology and defense industries, underscores growing US-China tensions, with potential ripple effects on the global economy as markets brace for further developments.“If they want to slow down the global economy, they will be hurt the most,” he said. On October 9, Beijing announced that it would ban the export of rare earth materials for military applications, marking the first time such restrictions have explicitly targeted defense uses. Rare earth magnets are vital for advanced US weapons systems, including the F-35 fighter jet, Tomahawk missiles, and smart bombs. On the same day, China also added Canada-based semiconductor research firm TechInsights to its “unreliable entity list” for its reports on Huawei’s chip development. Last month, China’s antitrust regulator accused Nvidia of breaching anti-monopoly laws related to a 2020 acquisition.In response, President Trump imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, effective November 1, and threatened to cancel the upcoming summit with Xi. The escalating trade dispute has rattled financial markets, with Wall Street stock averages plummeting at the start of trading on Tuesday.","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says China is trying to undermine the global economy by imposing export controls on rare earth minerals and resources.

Dreams of an Apple-Pop Mart mashup

The Labubu craze isn't what it used to be





When Apple 's Tim Cook walked into a Labubu exhibition in Shanghai on October 13, he probably didn't expect to become the talk of Hong Kong's stock exchange the next morning. But that's exactly what happened after the Cook met with Pop Mart founder Wang Ning and the fuzzy-toothed character's creator, Kasing Lung—and left with a custom doll clutching a miniature iPhone Pop Mart shares jumped as much as 6.1% on Tuesday, making the Chinese toymaker one of the day's top performers on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index. Cook posted enthusiastically on Weibo about watching Lung sketch characters on an iPad Pro, while the designer shared his own excitement: ""Great meeting you Tim! Thanks for visiting The Monsters by Monsters 10th Anniversary exhibition in Shanghai. Hope you enjoy the unique 'Tim Cook Labubu' we made for you. ""The market immediately started buzzing about what this could mean. A potential collaboration between Apple's tech empire and Pop Mart's collectible toy kingdom? Investors were ready to believe. The visit seemed to signal Apple's growing interest in Chinese cultural IPs, while Pop Mart got a massive visibility boost from one of tech's biggest names.But the euphoria didn't last. By mid-morning, those impressive gains had cooled to around 2%, with the stock still sitting about 20% below its August peak.Here's the reality: Pop Mart has already had quite the year. Shares tripled in early 2025 as Labubu mania swept across Asia, but the initial frenzy has since mellowed. The company now faces the classic collectibles challenge—keeping the magic alive once everyone who wanted one has already grabbed theirs.Cook's visit came during a broader China tour that included his first-ever livestream sales event on Douyin. Whether his Labubu cameo leads anywhere substantial remains to be seen.","Pop Mart shares jumped as much as 6.1% on Tuesday.

“Your ability to manage a hybrid team of human and AI resources will play an essential role in the success of the company’s employees.""

4 tips Marco Argenti shared with Goldman Sachs' employees



“get creative with AI, posing provocative, non-obvious questions.”

“While AI excels at refurbishing existing knowledge its true creative potential is unlocked by human curiosity,""

“The expert will curate a personal toolkit of models and assistants and know[s] which one to deploy for which task,"" he explained

“plausible-sounding errors.”

“A blend of deep knowledge and a detective’s scepticism,”





Goldman Sachs chief information officer (CIO) Marco Argenti believes professionals can succeed in the AI-driven workplace by focusing on collaboration and questioning rather than competing with machines. In a recent company Briefings newsletter (as seen by Fortune), Argenti outlined four strategies on how employees canas autonomous systems take on tasks previously reserved for humans. Argenti's advice centres on adapting to the AI transition by learning how to conduct, question, and collaborate with the new technology. This approach is intended to help professionals thrive as AI reshapes workplaces globally. In the newsletter, Argenti wrote:Argenti suggests that today’s professionals need to shift from simply executing tasks to coordinating them. Success, he explains, will depend less on individual output, such as writing code or performing analysis and more on managing agile teams composed of both human and AI contributors. Effective leadership will involve delegating, coordinating, and integrating their work to achieve outcomes that neither could reach alone.According to Argenti, curiosity is one of the most valuable human abilities in an AI-driven world. He encourages employees toWhile AI systems are strong at processing existing information, they rely on human curiosity to spark new ideas. By asking imaginative, unconventional questions, people can help AI move beyond familiar patterns and reveal deeper insights.Argenti wrote.Argenti also recommends that professionals use a mix of AI tools tailored to specific tasks rather than relying on a single platform. No one model performs best in every situation, he notes. The advantage lies in understanding which tools are most effective for particular purposes, such as data analysis, writing, or coding and combining them into a personalised digital toolkit.Argenti further warns that even advanced AI systems can generateAs these tools become more integrated into work processes, checking their accuracy will require domain expertise and careful evaluation.he writes, will help distinguish reliable insights from misleading ones.Argenti concludes that AI is not replacing human ability but changing how it is defined. The future, he says, will favour those who combine technical understanding with creativity, critical thinking, and leadership qualities that remain uniquely human.","Goldman Sachs CIO Marco Argenti outlines four strategies on how employees can succeed in the AI-driven workplace.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) has announced that it plans to deploy 50,000 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) graphics processors starting in the second half of 2026. OCI will utilise AMD's Instinct MI450 chips, which were unveiled earlier this year. These chips are AMD’s first AI processors that can be assembled into a larger rack-sized system, enabling 72 of the chips to function as a single unit. This capability is necessary for creating and deploying the most advanced AI algorithms.This move signals that cloud providers are increasingly adopting AMD's GPUs as a viable alternative to Nvidia's market-leading products for artificial intelligence workloads.“We feel like customers are going to take up AMD very, very well — especially in the inferencing space,” said Karan Batta, senior vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Inference in AI is defined as the process of using a trained machine learning model to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.Recently, AMD announced a partnership with AMD wherein the AI startup will purchase 6 gigawatts worth of AMD chips over multiple years, including the forthcoming MI450 series. Furthermore, as part of the agreement, OpenAI will receive warrants for up to 160 million AMD shares.This means that if OpenAI exercises the full warrant based on deployment volume and AMD's share price, the Al firm could acquire roughly 10% ownership in AMD.The company is ""investing at the right pace because we want to accelerate ... this is a place where [and] when companies and partners make bold moves, it will be rewarded”, AMD CEO Lisa Su said at an interview recently.Su added, “I really believe that this is the beginning of a 10-year kind of supercycle.”“We believe with the proper use of Al compute, you can solve diseases faster. You can do much faster drug discovery. You can do much better in terms of diagnosing issues that people have early on and that makes ... a personal difference in people's lives,” she noted.","Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) plans to deploy 50,000 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) graphics processors starting in the second half of 2026.

Political pressure on universities







Geoffrey Hinton, known as the father of AI has warned that the United States is at risk of failing behind China in the global AI race if it continues to undermine funding for basic scientific research and top-tier universities. Speaking at the recent episode of The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart, Hinton acknowledged that the US is ahead of China in AI development race, but cautioned that the margin is slimmer than many believe and it is shrinking. “The one thing you should do to kneecap a country’s future is mess with the funding of basic science,” Hinton said. “Attack the research universities, remove grants for basic science — that’s a complete disaster.”Hinton stressed on the fact that breakthroughs powering today’s AI revolution— particularly deep learning — stemmed from decades of modest but sustained investment in fundamental research. He noted that the total cost of the research that led to deep learning was likely less than the price of a single B-1 bomber, underscoring the high return on investment in academic science. “If you mess with that, you are eating the seed corn,” he warned, highlighting the long-term consequences of cutting support for academic institutions.While Hinton did not specify which funding cuts he was referring to, his comments come amid growing tensions between the Trump administration and elite U.S. universities. Federal officials have threatened to withhold research funding from institutions like Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Columbia, and UCLA, citing concerns over campus policies, including alleged mishandling of antisemitic incidents and diversity-related practices.President Trump recently stated that the administration was “close” to reaching a settlement with Harvard, though broader concerns about academic freedom and research independence remain unresolved.","Geoffrey Hinton, known as the father of AI has warned that the United States is at risk of failing behind China in the global AI race if it continues to undermine funding for basic scientific research.

Intel’s fired CEO Pat Gelsinger recently blamed long-term structural issues for the chipmaker’s failure in the AI race. Speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box recently, Pat Gelsinger remarked: “Intel made a set of bad decisions over 15 years,” adding “[We] lost technical leadership, wasn't led by technologists for many years and we were late on AI as well. ” While he praised Intel's 18A process milestone, Gelsinger admitted that Intel’s rival Nvidia has captured nearly all the incremental AI data center revenue.“We need leading R&D. We need leading manufacture at scale in the US for our supply chains,” Gelsinger said during the interaction.Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger also defended the US government’s equity stake in the company saying the deal’s success will be dependent on whether the investment leads to expanded domestic chip manufacturing or not.""To me, the only metric that matters is: does it cause the building and filling of Intel fabs?"" Gelsinger said. ""If it causes more fabs to be built, more fabs to be filled in the U.S., then it's good. If that doesn't occur, then it's not right.""He also acknowledged that the market reacted positively to the government's investment. He further stressed that ""none of those [other investments] have yet included a commitment to fill the Intel fabs.""He also expressed his frustration with the CHIPS Act – short for Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors — is a government law aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing, research, and development. It was signed into law by President Joe Biden in August 2022.""I was super disappointed that Gina and the Department of Commerce took so long to get the money deployed … two and a half years, critical years, nothing happened.

Read Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's letter to all employees on return of Israeli hostage 738 days in captivity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-letter-to-all-employees-on-return-of-israeli-hostage-738-days-in-captivity/articleshow/124547760.cms,"Read Jensen Huang’s letter below:



Dear NVIDIANs,

I am profoundly moved and deeply grateful to share that, just moments ago, our colleague, Avinatan Or, was released to the Red Cross in Gaza. After two unimaginable years in

Hamas captivity

, Avinatan has come home.

Throughout this time, our hearts have been with Avinatan and his loved ones — especially his mother, Ditza Or, whose strength, courage, and unwavering hope have inspired us all. Night after night, our employees in Israel stood with her in vigil, united in determination that Avinatan would return home safely. That unity reflected the very best of who we are.





Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang has shared the news with employees following the release of Avinatan Or, a colleague who was held captive by Hamas for over two years after being kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7, 2023, a report has said. Or, a 32-year-old electrical engineer at Nvidia’s Tel Aviv research center, was freed 738 days after he was taken hostage, as part of a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. He was kidnapped along with his partner, Noa Argamani, who had been freed in a military rescue operation in June.Or's release brings a moment of profound relief to the company, marking one of the most emotional moments for Nvidia since the October 7 attacks. Or joined Nvidia in 2022 and worked as a DFT engineer in the company’s VLSI group, a core element of its semiconductor design operations in Israel.In his letter, Huang acknowledged the immense pain and loss faced by the company's global staff during the conflict.“Thousands of NVIDIA employees have served with extraordinary bravery in defense of their communities during the war. Many have faced immense pain, loss, and uncertainty,” Huang wrote.The CEO cited specific losses, noting, “We lost our colleague, Amit Chayut.” He also referenced a family loss close to the company’s operations: “Eyal suffered the heartbreaking loss of his daughter, Danielle, and her partner, Noam. We remember them with love, and we hold Eyal and his family close in our thoughts and prayers.”“The losses to our Jewish, Druze, and Arab families alike have been immense. Grief knows no borders, no faiths, no divisions. We mourn together, and we hope together — for peace, understanding, and a future without fear,"" Huang continued.The letter concluded with a message of solidarity: ""Avinatan — welcome home. Your safe return brings profound relief and joy to the entire NVIDIA family. May this moment mark the first step toward recovery, renewal, and lasting peace — for all who have been touched by this war.""","Avinatan Or, a 32-year-old electrical engineer at Nvidia’s Tel Aviv research center, was freed 738 days after he was taken hostage, as part of a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas.

The $13 billion partnership is going through a rough phase





Microsoft launched MAI-Image-1—its first homegrown image generator—and it's already muscled into LMArena's top 10, outpacing models that have had far longer to establish themselves.Unlike competitors focused on artistic or stylized outputs, MAI-Image-1 targets photorealism with surgical precision. Microsoft collaborated with creative professionals during development to eliminate the repetitive, generic-looking results that often betray AI-generated content. The model specializes in natural lighting, landscapes, and lifelike imagery while delivering results faster than bulkier alternatives. Integration with Copilot and Bing Image Creator is imminent, bringing the technology directly to millions of users.MAI-Image-1 joins an expanding arsenal of homegrown Microsoft AI tools. Voice generator MAI-Voice-1 and chatbot MAI-1-preview both launched earlier this year, part of what AI division chief Mustafa Suleyman calls ""an enormous five-year roadmap."" The message is clear: Microsoft is building infrastructure that doesn't require OpenAI's blessing or technology.This strategy crystallized in September when Microsoft announced Anthropic's Claude models would power Microsoft 365 Copilot features alongside OpenAI's technology—ending years of OpenAI exclusivity. Microsoft executives reportedly believe Claude Sonnet 4 delivers superior results for specific tasks, particularly generating polished PowerPoint presentations, undermining OpenAI's once-unquestioned supremacy in Microsoft's ecosystem.Behind the product launches lies a partnership disintegrating under financial and strategic pressures. Microsoft has poured over $13 billion into OpenAI since 2019, securing 20% of revenues up to $92 billion. Now both companies are locked in contentious negotiations over equity stakes, revenue splits, and the ""AGI clause""—contract language that would sever Microsoft's access to OpenAI technology once artificial general intelligence arrives.OpenAI is aggressively pursuing independence, launching infrastructure projects with Oracle and Google Cloud while partnering with Broadcom to manufacture proprietary AI chips by 2026. Microsoft, meanwhile, is hedging its bets with Anthropic while accelerating internal development. What was once tech's most powerful AI alliance now resembles a messy separation neither party wanted but both saw coming.","Microsoft launched MAI-Image-1, its first homegrown image generator.

Poll Which preventive measure is more important to stop payroll cyberattacks? Stronger cybersecurity systems Employee awareness & training





Microsoft's Threat Intelligence team has sounded the alarm, reason is: A notorious cybercrime group, tracked as Storm-2657 by Microsoft’s team, has launched a brazen attack on US university payroll systems since March 2025. In a blog post, Redmond said a cybercrime crew it tracks as Storm-2657 has been targeting university employees since March 2025, hijacking salaries by breaking into HR software such as Workday.Dubbed ""payroll pirate"" by Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence team, the campaign exploits weak security practices to redirect paychecks into attacker-controlled bank accounts. The attackers are said to infiltrate HR platforms like Workday by exploiting compromised email accounts, redirecting paychecks to their own bank accounts.According to the Microsoft blog, the attack is said to be as audacious as it is simple: Compromise HR and email accounts, quietly change payroll settings, and redirect pay packets into attacker-controlled bank accounts. Other examples are reported to include emails impersonating the university president, sharing information regarding compensation and benefits, or fake documents shared by HR.The operation begins with phishing emails tailored to academia, such as fake HR updates, faculty misconduct reports, or alerts about illness clusters.These lures, often delivered via shared Google Docs to evade filters, trick users into revealing multifactor authentication (MFA) codes through adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) techniques. Once inside Exchange Online accounts, the attackers set inbox rules to hide or delete HR notifications, concealing their tracks.Using stolen credentials and single sign-on (SSO) integrations, the group accesses Workday to alter direct deposit settings, funneling salaries to accounts they control. Microsoft emphasized that the attacks exploit weak MFA practices and misconfigured systems, not vulnerabilities in Workday itself.""Following the compromise of email accounts and the payroll modifications in Workday, the threat actor leveraged newly accessed accounts to distribute further phishing emails, both within the organization and externally to other universities,"" Microsoft added.""We've observed 11 successfully compromised accounts at three universities that were used to send phishing emails to nearly 6,000 email accounts across 25 universities,"" Microsoft said in the report.","Microsoft's Threat Intelligence team has sounded the alarm on payroll cyberattacks.

Planning over optimism



A mindset that built OYO







Oyo founder Ritesh Agarwal has now credited Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for helping him shape his approach and business strategy. Agarwal revealed the one quote by Bezos which inspired him, ‘Hope is not a plan’. In a recent interview post shared by Agarwal on his Instagram handle, he emphasised that structured planning and risk assessment play a key role over blind optimism. He mentioned that this mindset has guided him in Oyo’s journey from a small startup to a global hospitality brand.“Inspired by Jeff Bezos, who says ‘hope is not a plan.’ Many people believe that if we keep working hard, things will happen. But nothing happens on its own. You have to plan for it,” Agarwal said, urging entrepreneurs to anticipate challenges and map out actionable paths to success.Agarwal further elaborated on his philosophy and encouraged the business leaders to identify multiple scenarios such as five ways to succeeds, three things that could go wrong and two things that might go right. Agarwal believes that this kind of planned and structured thinking is really important for navigating through uncertainty and also helps in scaling sustainability.The Instagram post shared by Agarwal echoes the same sentiment and reinforces that hope can spark ambition, only planning builds the engine that drives results.For those unaware, under the leadership of Agarwal, Oyo has grown into one of the world’s largest hotel chains which now operates in more than 80 countries. Agarwal also emphasises on strategic execution and adaptability has helped the company weather industry disruptions and expand its tech-driven hospitality model.","Oyo founder Ritesh Agarwal has credited Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for helping him shape his approach and business strategy.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently backed President Donald Trump ’s plan to deploy troops in San Francisco. Joining him is now Tesla CEO Elon Musk who recently said that “This is the only solution at this point”. The tech billionaire was responding to a local advocate T Wolf's post citing a March 2025 survey where 61% of voters strongly support federal intervention to deport illegal fentanyl traffickers, rising to 83% including those who somewhat agree.The quoted post references SFPD's seizure of over 90 kilos of fentanyl in the past year and approximately 4,300 overdose deaths since 2020, aligning with official data showing 3,367 confirmed unintentional drug overdose fatalities from 2020 to 2024, with 2025 figures ongoing.“Pretty much 80% of San Francisco wants federal intervention on deporting drug dealers. That's how insane it's been here. 90+ kilos of fentanyl seized in one year by SFPD. 4,300 OD deaths since 2020. Hard data doesn't lie,” T Wolf wrote in the post. In another post, Wolf said “It's simple. If you want to keep federal troops out of San Francisco, remove the organized drug dealers and 80% of the problem goes away. If you don't, you reap what you sow.Replying to the post, Musk wrote “It’s the only solution at this point. Nothing else has or will work.”In an interview last week, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he supports former President Donald Trump’s proposal to send federal troops to San Francisco, a plan that city leaders have called unacceptable.Benioff said he “avidly supported President Trump” and backed the idea of deploying troops to help reduce crime. “We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,” The New York Times quoted him as saying.Trump had reportedly discussed sending federal troops to San Francisco during an Oval Office meeting in August, naming it among several Democratic-led cities he said had been “destroyed.” He added that he would “clean that one up, too.”Benioff also praised Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative to cut federal spending and voiced support for venture capitalist David Sacks, who chairs Trump’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.San Francisco Democrats strongly criticized Benioff’s remarks.",Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently backed President Donald Trump’s plan to deploy troops in San Francisco.

Ahead of Q2 earnings call on October 29, Google investor and Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster says that the company has a loud and clear message – Search is doing fine. In an investor note shared on X recently, Munster highlighted remarks by Liz Reid, head of Google Search. Speaking at Wall Street Journal’s 'Bold Names' podcast recently, Reid reiterated how well AI Overviews is doing to increase engagement. “Any comments a company makes just before reporting earnings should be overweighted,” Munster wrote in the note adding “Liz Reid's message two weeks before earnings was that AI is having a positive impact on Search.”In the note, Gene Munster stated that during the wsj interview, Reid was quick to point out that competition from AI is having an impact. Specifically, Bing’s integration of ChatGPT has spurred the largest change in Search market share over the past 15 years.He stated that Reid’s comments highlighting the steep competition likely were an effort to cover two bases. “First, the reality is the world has changed: “I do think it’s the most profound shift… for Search.” She’s taking the prudent approach by reminding investors of the risk of that reality. Second, she’s talking to regulators, reminding them that Google’s virtual monopoly in Search is, at some level, at risk.Those words “profound shift” are the substance of Google’s antitrust defense,” he writes.“The bottom line is Google’s share loss is too small to be of concern.

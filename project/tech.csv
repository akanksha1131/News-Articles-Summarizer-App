Microsoft founder Bill Gates has this ‘tip’ from his childhood for parents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-founder-bill-gates-has-this-tip-from-his-childhood-for-parents/articleshow/116522441.cms,"What Bill Gates said about his childhood

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes that the constant distractions of smartphones and social media would have hindered his path to becoming a billionaire. In a recent blog post, Gates reflected on his childhood which was marked by significant periods of unstructured time spent reading and thinking. He believes this developed his ability to focus and delve into deep thought which was crucial to his success. Gates referred to Jonathan Haidt’s The Anxious Generation and questioned whether the existing technology-driven environment wouldn’t have allowed him to develop these habits. He even highlighted that excessive screen time, particularly on social media, has been linked to a surge in mental health issues among teenagers which includes anxiety, depression, eating disorders, self-harm, and decreased self-esteem.In the blog post, Gates said:“My childhood was marked by remarkable freedom—something that might surprise people who assume I spent all day glued to a computer indoors. I went hiking on trails that would terrify today’s parents, explored endlessly with neighbourhood friends, and ran around Washington D.C. during my time as a Senate page. When I was in high school, Paul Allen and I even lived on our own for a few months in Vancouver, Washington, while working as programmers at a power company. My parents didn’t know where I was half the time, and that was normal back then. While I got hurt on some of these adventures and got in trouble on many others, these experiences were more beneficial than bad. They taught me resilience, independence, and judgment in ways that no amount of supervised, structured activity could replicate.It wasn’t all fun and games, but I had what Haidt calls a play-based childhood. Now, a phone-based childhood is much more common—a shift that predated the pandemic but solidified when screens became important tools for learning and socialising. The irony is that parents these days are overprotective in the physical world and strangely hands-off in the digital one, letting kids live life online largely without supervision.”","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes that constant distractions of smartphones and social media would have hindered his path to becoming a billionaire.

"Canada Express Entry: How new rules will impact engineers, technicians and others seeking permanent residency in the country",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/canada-express-entry-how-new-rules-will-impact-engineers-technicians-and-others-seeking-permanent-residency-in-the-country/articleshow/116510510.cms,"What is changing

Canada revises immigration rules

Canada has announced new rules for Express Entry workers seeking permanent residency in the country. The candidates, including Indian engineers, technicians and other IT workers, are likely to be impacted by the recently-announced changes in the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS).According to the new rules, IT workers applying for Canadian PR will no longer receive the extra CRS points they used to get for having a job offer backed by an LMIA (Labour Market Impact Assessment) – a document that allows Canadian employers to hire foreign workers legally. It is required when an employer is unable to find a Canadian citizen or permanent resident to fill a position.This means that professionals will need to achieve a higher CRS score based on other factors.Previously, Express Entry candidates with LMIA-backed job offers received a significant boost to their Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score – an extra 50 or 200 points, depending on the job offer. These bonus points provided an edge to LMIA candidates in being the deciding factor in receiving an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residency and not being invited at all.With the changes, that is, without the extra points from LMIA-backed job offers, some candidates who relied on those points to reach the required CRS score in Express Entry draws may find it tougher to get an Invitation to Apply (ITA). This may lead to increased competition among candidates whose profiles are assessed only on factors like age, education and language skills.Notably, it is unclear when these changes will come into effect.The development comes about 15 days after Canada unveiled significant changes to its immigration policies. The Trudeau government introduced reductions in the number of both permanent and temporary residents entering Canada over the next three years. These changes are part of plans aimed at addressing Canada's housing, healthcare and infrastructure challenges.","Canada has announced new rules for Express Entry workers seeking permanent residency in the country.

Atul Subhash, a 34-year-old tech professional from Bengaluru, was discovered dead in his apartment on Monday, December 9. He reportedly left a 24-page suicide note and an hour-long video, accusing his wife, Nikita Singhania, an AI/ML Specialist at Accenture, of relentless harassment and extortion. His tragic death has sparked widespread outrage on social media, with many demanding that Accenture terminate Nikita Singhania 's employment.

What is digital arrest scam



How to identify a digital arrest scam

Unexpected Contact from ‘Officials’: Be cautious if someone claims to be from government agencies like the police, CBI, income tax officers, or customs agents, contacts you. Be cautious especially if they claim urgent legal action is being initiated or warranted. They might allege that you or one of your family members is involved in a serious crime like money laundering, tax evasion, or drug trafficking.

Fear-based language and urgency: Scammers may request video calls, disguising themselves in police uniforms, using government logos, or creating official-sounding background noise to appear legitimate. They often threaten arrest or immediate legal action, demanding a quick response and using legal terms to sound convincing. In some cases, they create a police station-like set up to further convince victims of their credibility.

Request for sensitive information or payment: Scammers may ask for personal information or demand large sums of money, promising that this will clear up your involvement in the alleged crime. They may also coerce you to transfer money to their account until the investigation is complete. Terms like “clearing your name”, “assisting with the investigation”, or “refundable security deposit/escrow account” might be used by them to persuade you into transferring money to specified bank accounts or UPI IDs.

Tips to stay safe

Pause and Verify: If you receive unexpected calls or messages about legal issues, take a moment to verify. Stay calm, as scammers rely on fear and urgency. Real government and law enforcement agencies will never ask for money or investigate cases through phone or video calls. Always confirm the caller’s identity and consult trusted sources before taking any action.

Use Support Channels: Report suspicious numbers to the national cybercrime helpline by dialing 1930 or the Department of Telecommunication (https://sancharsaathi.gov.in/sfc/).

The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country. As digital payments, including UPI, gain widespread adoption, incidents of online scams have risen significantly. Indians, as mentioned by PM Modi in one of the episodes of Mann ki Baat have lost Rs 120.3 crore through digital arrest scam s. In its advisory, the NPCI highlights the critical need for awareness and vigilance to protect against such fraudulent activities as India advances towards a digital-first economy.In a press release, NPCI says “Digital payments are now accessible nationwide, driving India towards a digital-first economy. They offer both security and convenience. However, it's crucial to use digital payments safely and avoid online scams. Early identification of potential scams helps protect you and your loved ones, fostering a safer, less-cash economy, for everyone.”The 'Digital Arrest' scam is a type of online fraud where cybercriminals trick individuals into believing they are under investigation or at risk of arrest by law enforcement or financial authorities. Scammers often impersonate government officials, police officers, or financial regulators and use fear tactics to manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information or transferring money. Some of the common tactics used in the scam include fake calls or messages, threat of arrest and demand for payment.As per NPCI, you can identify a digital arrest scam by keeping an eye for the following","The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme. In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

As artificial intelligence (AI) takes center stage in the technology world, Ukraine finds itself in possession of a valuable asset: millions of hours of drone footage that can be used to train AI models for battlefield decision-making.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Ukraine has amassed a vast trove of battlefield data (videos) through its extensive use of drones. The claims come as the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia has seen both sides deploy AI to identify targets and analyse images with speed faster than humans.Oleksandr Dmitriev, founder of the OCHI system – which centralises and analyses drone footage from over 15,000 frontline crews – revealed that his system has collected over 2 million hours of video since 2022 – which is roughly equivalent to 228 years of footage, the report said.According to Dmitriev, the footage can be used to train AI models in combat tactics and other aspects of warfare.“This is food for the AI. If you want to teach an AI, you give it 2 million hours (of video), it will become something supernatural,” Dmitriev was quoted as saying.Dmitriev said AI models can be trained to identify combat tactics, target identification and weapons effectiveness assessment.

CKYC wants to prevent unauthorised usage of your KYC data

The Indian government has taken steps to enhance the security of Know Your Customer (KYC) data. To prevent misuse, they have proposed masking sensitive KYC identifiers like PAN, Aadhaar, Voter ID, and Driving License numbers. Previously scheduled for a December deadline, authorities have granted an extension until January 20, 2025. This additional time allows individuals to complete the KYC process for various financial institutions and services. This extension provides additional time for financial institutions to adapt to the new requirements and ensure a smooth transition.“In view of requests received from various Reporting Entities, it has been decided to defer the date of go live for masking of KYC Identifier from December 16, 2024, after 08:00 PM to January 20, 2025, after 8:00 PM,” as per an official communique from Central KYC Records Registry dated December 16, 2024.The new system, scheduled to be implemented on January 20, 2025, will mask sensitive information in KYC documents. Only the last four digits of identifiers like Aadhaar, PAN, Voter ID, and Driving License numbers will be visible. This measure aims to strengthen data privacy and security.The Central KYC Records Registry (CKYCRR) has outlined the process for the new masked KYC system. Starting January 20, 2025, registered reporting entities (REs) will only be able to view the last four digits of KYC identifiers like Aadhaar, PAN, Voter ID, and Driving License. To access full KYC records, REs will need to authenticate themselves and download the record using either the masked KYC identifier or a unique CKYC reference ID. This two-factor authentication system aims to enhance data security and prevent unauthorised access.The Central KYC Records Registry (CKYCRR) is implementing a new security measure to safeguard user data. This measure involves restricting access to KYC information based on unique IP addresses. The goal is to prevent unauthorized access and misuse of sensitive data.Previously, regulated entities (REs) often outsourced KYC collection to third-party service providers. These intermediaries would access KYC data using their own IP addresses. To enhance security, the CKYCRR now mandates that REs directly access the KYC data using their own IP addresses. This change aims to limit access to authorized personnel only.The deadline for implementing this new system is December 31, 2024.

What the company said

Popular Indian bike-taxi app Rapido is facing scrutiny after a data breach exposed sensitive user and driver information online. The data leak, discovered by TechCrunch, highlights potential security vulnerabilities within the app.The data breach was identified by security researcher Renganathan P. The vulnerability was found in a feedback form designed for Rapido's auto-rickshaw users and drivers. This form exposed sensitive information, including full names, email addresses, and phone numbers of individuals. TechCrunch has confirmed the authenticity of this leaked data based on the details shared by the researcher.The researcher informed TechCrunch that the exposed data originated from one of Rapido's APIs. This API was designed to collect feedback from the form and transmit it to a third-party service used by the company. TechCrunch independently verified the vulnerability by submitting a test message through the feedback form. The message quickly appeared as a record in the exposed portal, confirming the breach.“This could have led to a big scam involving scammers or hackers, who may have ended up calling drivers and performing a large-scale social engineering attack, or simply these phone numbers and other data could have been exposed on the dark web if reached in the wrong hands,” the researcher told TechCrunch.Following TechCrunch's notification of the data breach, Rapido promptly took action to secure the exposed portal by setting it to private. “As a standard operating procedure, we are in the process of soliciting valuable feedback from our stakeholder community on our services. While this is being managed by external parties, we have come to understand that the survey links have reached some unintended users from the public,” Rapido CEO Aravind Sanka said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch.In light of the news, Rapido users are advised to be cautious of any suspicious emails, calls, or text messages. Implementing strong passwords and monitoring accounts for unusual activity are additional security measures.","Indian bike-taxi app Rapido is facing scrutiny after a data breach exposed sensitive user and driver information online.

Putin warns Youtube of rising competition

Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Google and YouTube of political manipulation and deliberately slowing down service in Russia. Putin made the comments during his annual phone-in with the Russian public. According to a report in Reuters, the Russian President said that Google acts as a tool of the US government and that YouTube's reduced speeds are due to the company's failure to upgrade equipment in Russia.This accusation comes amidst ongoing pressure from Russia on foreign tech companies regarding content distribution. While Russia has blocked other social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, it has hesitated to ban YouTube, which boasts approximately 50 million daily users in Russia.Critics argue that the disruptions to YouTube are intentional, aimed at limiting access to content critical of Putin and his government. Russia, however, insists the issues stem from Google's alleged underinvestment in Russian infrastructure, a claim disputed by Google and tech experts. Putin reiterated this stance, stating Google's reduced spending and equipment supply in Russia have created the problems.

""Googleyness"" needs updation

Google has cut its management positions by 10% as part of an ongoing efficiency drive , CEO Sundar Pichai revealed in a company-wide meeting. In an all-hands meeting on Wednesday, December 18, Pichai detailed the reduction across manager, director, and vice president roles, according to sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Business Insider.Some positions were eliminated entirely, while others were converted to individual contributor roles, a Google spokesperson confirmed. The restructuring took place over the past two years.Google's move echoes Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's recent directive to eliminate ""pre-meetings for pre-meetings"" and increase individual contributors by 15% by the first quarter of 2025. Both tech giants are dismantling layers of middle management that they say slow down decision-making and innovation.The moves come as Google faces mounting pressure from AI competitors , particularly OpenAI , whose innovations have challenged Google's core search business.Google's efficiency campaign, launched in September 2022, with Pichai's goal of making the company 20% more efficient, is said to have already resulted in significant changes, including January 2023's biggest-ever job cuts at the company, numbering around 12,000 employees. The latest management reduction demonstrates the company's continued commitment to streamlining operations.During the same meeting, Pichai addressed the evolution of Google's corporate culture, noting that the concept of ""Googleyness"" needed updating for the modern era.

Nikhil Kamath is a name that resonates strongly within the Indian business ecosystem. As the co-founder of Zerodha , one of India’s largest stockbroking firms, Kamath has carved out a significant space for himself in the competitive world of finance. At just 38 years old, Kamath has already achieved what many would consider the pinnacle of success, becoming one of the youngest billionaires in the country. However, his journey is anything but conventional. Kamath’s entrepreneurial spirit and business acumen were evident from an early age, even as he struggled to conform to the rigid structures of formal education. In a recent conversation with LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky, Kamath shared fascinating insights into his early life, including his first entrepreneurial venture and how his unique path shaped his future endeavors.Nikhil Kamath’s entrepreneurial journey began much earlier than most people realize. While still in the 9th grade, Kamath embarked on his first business venture, driven by curiosity and a knack for identifying opportunities. He managed to acquire a cellphone, which he then sold for a profit. Encouraged by this initial success, Kamath reinvested the proceeds into purchasing more phones, effectively establishing a small-scale trading operation.This venture was going smoothly until his mother discovered his activities. Unhappy with her son’s sideline hustle, she intervened in a dramatic fashion—by flushing the phones down the toilet. While this marked the abrupt end of Kamath’s teenage entrepreneurial endeavor, it was a clear precursor to the innovative and determined mindset that would define his later career.During his conversation with Ryan Roslansky, Nikhil Kamath candidly admitted that he had a tumultuous relationship with formal education. ""I hated school. Always did,"" he stated, reflecting on his years as a student. Kamath’s disdain for traditional schooling was deeply rooted in his rebellious nature. “I was that one rebellious child who wanted to do the opposite of everything someone told him to do,” he said. By the time he was 15 or 16 years old, Kamath had stopped attending school altogether, setting the stage for an unconventional journey toward success.Despite his aversion to the classroom, Kamath’s early years were marked by a keen interest in exploring opportunities beyond the confines of academic learning. Dropping out of school came with its challenges, including feelings of insecurity. ""I was a fairly insecure young boy because my classmates of the time were in college,” he admitted. To compensate for this, Kamath developed a habit of voracious reading, consuming anything he could get his hands on to broaden his knowledge and skill set.Years after his early business experiment, Nikhil Kamath’s entrepreneurial streak found its ultimate expression in Zerodha. Co-founded with his brother Nithin Kamath, Zerodha was launched to address inefficiencies in India’s stockbroking industry. The company disrupted the market with its transparent pricing model and user-friendly online platform, quickly gaining traction among retail investors.Zerodha’s rise to prominence was fueled by the Kamath brothers’ focus on leveraging technology to simplify trading for everyday investors. Under Nikhil’s leadership, the company has not only grown into India’s largest stockbroker by active clients but has also set benchmarks for profitability and customer satisfaction in the industry.Although Nikhil Kamath’s decision to leave school eventually led to great success, he does not shy away from acknowledging the difficulties it entailed. “Dropping out of school and not pursuing formal higher education had its drawbacks,” he shared during his discussion with Roslansky. For Kamath, the absence of a structured educational framework meant that he had to work harder to gain credibility and knowledge.To bridge this gap, Kamath adopted a disciplined approach to self-education. His commitment to continuous learning played a crucial role in building the expertise and confidence necessary for navigating the complexities of the financial world. “Reading extensively allowed me to compensate for my lack of formal education,” he said.Nikhil Kamath’s journey offers valuable lessons for aspiring entrepreneurs. His story underscores the importance of resilience, adaptability, and the willingness to learn outside conventional systems. It highlights that success is not necessarily tied to formal education but rather to one’s ability to identify opportunities, take calculated risks, and persist in the face of challenges.Moreover, Kamath’s experience illustrates the significance of leveraging failures as stepping stones. From having his early business shut down by his mother to overcoming the insecurities associated with being a school dropout, Kamath’s path has been shaped by turning setbacks into growth opportunities.","Nikhil Kamath is the co-founder of Zerodha, one of India's largest stockbroking firms.

Amazon is postponing its mandatory five-day return-to-office policy for thousands of corporate employees due to insufficient workspace, with some delays stretching into May 2025 across multiple US cities.The e-commerce giant has notified staff in at least seven cities – including Austin, Dallas, Phoenix, Atlanta, Nashville, Houston, and New York – that they cannot accommodate full-time office returns starting January 2 as originally planned, according to Bloomberg News.The delay affects an undisclosed portion of Amazon's 350,000 corporate employees worldwide. In Manhattan's Midtown Lord & Taylor building, some employees might not have designated workspace until May, while Dallas-based staff were told to expect delays until March or April.The situation appears to contradict Amazon's initial return-to-office guidance. ""For the vast majority of employees, assigned workspaces will be available by January 2, 2025,"" the internal guidance stated. ""If your assigned workspace isn't ready by January 2, we still expect everyone to begin fully working from the office by that date.""Employees report struggles with the current three-day hybrid model, citing issues with shared desks, overcrowded corporate canteens, and scarce conference rooms for confidential calls or team meetings. ""The company has added a feature to its room reservation tool that requires workers to attest they actually plan to use the space, an apparent effort to crack down on squatters looking for a quiet place to work,"" one employee noted.The space crunch comes three months after CEO Andy Jassy announced the controversial mandate requiring employees to work from office five days per week. The policy has faced resistance from employees who say they've proved their effectiveness while working remotely and prefer flexible arrangements common among tech industry peers.To address immediate space needs, Amazon has leased temporary offices from WeWork in New York and Silicon Valley. The company had previously paused several office development projects during the pandemic, including developments in Bellevue, Nashville, and Arlington, Virginia.An Amazon spokesperson said the delays primarily result from building reconfigurations needed to accommodate full-time office workers, rather than a shortage of available office space.

Nvidia recently fell from second-most valuable company to third. As recently as November, it was the No. 1. Now the No. 1 and No. 2 spot belong to Apple and Microsoft, respectively. While Nvidia stock climbed 2.5% in pre-market trading today, it is still not to its super high levels. While analysts see Nvidia shares in correction mode, there are arrange of factors responsible for this.And of these, one is reported to be a comment of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella . Nadella recently said that the company has ample chip supply, potentially impacting demand for Nvidia's AI chips. In an interview, Nadella stated, ""Power yes...I am not chip supply constrained."" This suggests that Microsoft, a major Nvidia customer, may have overinvested in AI chips during the initial ChatGPT boom.""We bought all over the place,"" Nadella said, acknowledging the aggressive approach taken to meet the surge in demand for AI services. He emphasized that this was a temporary measure and that the situation is now stabilizing.Nvidia's stock price has declined recently, falling 11.34% from its 52-week high. While the company experienced a similar correction earlier this year and subsequently rebounded, concerns remain.Hedge fund manager Doug Kass, who reportedly has a short position on Nvidia, highlighted the potential negative impact of Microsoft's chip surplus. According to a report in Marketwatch, he noted that the initial frenzy of AI chip purchases may have led to overinvestment, and that ongoing demand for these chips may not justify continued rapid growth in the supply chain. “Apparently, they all got caught off guard in the beginning; nobody wanted to be left behind; they had the money and piled in with zero caution with no regard to how much they spent, and what they spent it on. These were also big projects that are now largely completed,” said Kass, adding that the additional power Microsoft needs won’t be cheap either.Kass also expressed concerns about the commercial viability of projects like Microsoft's Copilot, questioning whether the anticipated revenue will materialize. He emphasized that even if end-user demand for AI services is strong, the initial surge in chip purchases will likely be followed by a period of more moderate demand. “Even if there were significant end demand for what these projects were selling, chip demand would have to taper just due to the math of getting the lump sum of projects first and then just followed by what underlying demand allows for. Without booming end demand for the final product, I am not sure how the supply chain can keep growing to the moon. Especially from the levels it is,” said Kass.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently said that the company has ample chip supply.

Return to Office and Addressing Industry Disruptions

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reportedly plans to increase its hiring of fresh graduates from engineering campuses in the upcoming fiscal year (FY26), exceeding the current year's commitment of 40,000. TCS' Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad told Economic Times that this decision is driven by optimistic growth projections. The IT giant is on track to onboard the planned 40,000 freshers in FY25, providing training in cutting-edge technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative AI (GenAI).""I expect that number to go up a bit more in FY26,"" Lakkad stated, noting that the company's planning for the next fiscal year has already commenced.TCS, known for its strong cash generation, is also increasing its focus on hiring higher-level professionals. This move aligns with the company's observation of robust growth in certain business verticals. “From the demand side, certain verticals are doing well. We expect to have broad-based growth coming in,” Lakkad said.This positive outlook follows a period of renewed growth for TCS and other leading IT companies, with increased revenue and deal pipelines in the first half of the current fiscal year. Most companies have resumed campus hiring after a pause of over a year.While hiring fresh graduates remains a cornerstone of TCS's strategy, the company is also investing in training students during their final semesters. This proactive approach aims to make them industry-ready upon graduation.""We collaborate with hyperscalers, enterprise solution providers, and other technology vendors,"" Lakkad explained. ""We've established a tripartite arrangement involving ourselves, the technology vendor, and academic institutions to offer specialized courses during the students' final semesters, ensuring their swift integration into the workforce.""Lakkad emphasized that AI and GenAI are transforming every aspect of the HR function, from talent acquisition and development to engagement and deployment. TCS is leveraging AI to streamline recruitment processes. AI-powered tools assist in refining job descriptions, filtering candidate profiles to identify the best matches, and conducting more efficient interviews. AI can also analyze technical skills, assess soft skills, and provide valuable feedback for talent development initiatives. Furthermore, TCS is utilizing AI to enhance employee support through its ""TCS Buddy"" platform. This AI-powered system provides employees with easy access to company policies and information.As for the business and technology disruptions impacting hiring in the people-heavy outsourcing industry, Lakkad said, “We have been through multiple technology cycles in the last 30 years. And when this question comes, the answer always is basically about the change in the nature of the jobs rather than the reduction in the job content or reduction in the number of people required to do that job,” Lakkad said adding that one will be able to do things faster and so more jobs will be needed to be done which will require people.TCS has implemented a return-to-office policy, encouraging employees to work from the office five days a week. This policy is linked to incentives and aims to foster a stronger workplace culture, facilitate collaboration, and provide valuable learning opportunities for employees.Regarding the potential impact of global capability centers (GCCs) on hiring, Lakkad does not foresee a significant reduction in hiring volumes. Instead, he believes that the nature of jobs will evolve.Lakkad also expressed confidence that the growth of GCCs will not significantly impact TCS's business. While GCCs are increasing their in-house technology capabilities, they will continue to rely on IT service providers like TCS for specialized services and expertise.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reportedly plans to increase its hiring of fresh graduates from engineering campuses in the upcoming fiscal year.

“Outrageous”: Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon on Arm’s demand in legal battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/outrageous-qualcomm-ceo-cristiano-amon-on-arms-demand-in-legal-battle/articleshow/116478073.cms,"Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon

What is the case all about

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon has testified in a legal battle against chip designer Arm Holdings , terming Arm’s demands in licensing dispute “outrageous”. He also accused the British semiconductor and software design company of misleading Qualcomm's customers, including Samsung , by falsely claiming that a license to use Arm's technology would expire in 2025.“That was not good for Qualcomm, our customers, or frankly, for Arm,” Amon told jurors, while clarifying that the license actually extends until 2033, as per a Bloomberg report.During cross-examination, Amon affirmed that Qualcomm will honour valid licensing agreements and refuted Arm's claim that Qualcomm knowingly violated the terms of its license.The dispute centers on a licensing agreement for Arm's chip technology, which is crucial to the electronics industry. In 2021, Qualcomm acquired Nuvia that developed a custom processor but licenses the base Arm architecture.Arm contends that the licensing agreement it had with Nuvia should have been renegotiated after the acquisition and demanded that Qualcomm destroy any designs acquired in the deal. Qualcomm, however, argues that its existing license with Arm covers its use of Nuvia’s technology.Reportedly, Amon justified purchasing the company by telling Qualcomm’s board that the company can save as much as $1.4 billion per year on payments to Arm by switching away from Arm’s computing core designs to those based on work by Nuvia and its team.Amon also criticised Arm's demand for the destruction of Nuvia's technology, calling it “outrageous” and an unprecedented move in the tech industry.Qualcomm has used Nuvia’s technology and talent to push into the PC market by powering Microsoft’s Copilot+ PCs to better compete with Apple’s MacBook offerings.In an interview earlier this year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised Apple for doing “a fantastic job of really innovating on the Mac.”“We're going to outperform them. We finally feel we have a very competitive product,” Nadella noted.","The dispute centers on a licensing agreement for Arm's chip technology, which is crucial to the electronics industry.

The European Union's data privacy authorities have imposed a $263 million fine on Meta, Facebook’s parent company, for a 2018 data breach that exposed millions of user accounts. The breach exploited vulnerabilities in Facebook's code, allowing hackers to steal digital keys, or access tokens, that granted control over user accounts. Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), Meta's lead privacy regulator within the EU, issued the penalty after a detailed investigation. The case underscores the EU's commitment to enforcing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), one of the world's strictest privacy laws. Meta plans to appeal the decision, maintaining that it acted swiftly and transparently to address the breach.The breach occurred in September 2018, when hackers exploited a series of bugs in Facebook’s ‘View As’ feature. This tool allowed users to see how their profiles appeared to others, but flaws in its code enabled attackers to steal access tokens. These tokens, essentially digital keys, granted attackers complete control over user accounts without needing passwords.The attack escalated through connected accounts, spreading from one Facebook friend to another. Initially, Facebook estimated that 50 million accounts were affected. However, further investigation revealed that around 29 million accounts were compromised, including 3 million in Europe.Upon discovering the breach, Facebook reported the issue to law enforcement, including the FBI, and informed data protection regulators in Europe and the United States. The company also promptly fixed the vulnerabilities in the ""View As"" feature and notified affected users.Despite these efforts, the Irish Data Protection Commission found Meta in violation of GDPR regulations. The inquiry concluded that Meta failed to adequately secure user data and allowed multiple infringements of GDPR, resulting in the $263 million fine. Alongside the financial penalty, the DPC issued formal reprimands and administrative directives to Meta.Meta, however, disputes the decision and plans to appeal. In a statement, the company highlighted its proactive response, asserting that it acted transparently and took immediate corrective measures.Under GDPR, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission serves as the lead privacy regulator for Meta, as the company’s European headquarters are in Dublin. This is not the first time Meta has faced scrutiny from the DPC. The watchdog has previously levied fines on the tech giant for data-related violations, demonstrating its active role in ensuring compliance with GDPR across the EU.The General Data Protection Regulation, implemented in 2018, grants EU citizens significant control over their personal data and imposes strict obligations on companies to protect that data. The law allows for fines of up to 4% of a company’s global revenue for serious violations.The $263 million penalty against Meta is part of the EU’s broader effort to hold tech giants accountable for safeguarding user data. The case reinforces the importance of robust data security measures and transparent practices in handling breaches.","Facebook's parent company, Meta, has been fined $263 million for a 2018 data breach.

Narayana Murthy agrees AI will lead to job losses, but ...

NR Narayana Murthy , co-founder of Infosys , spoke at TiECon Mumbai on Wednesday, attempting to temper the overhyped buzz surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) in India. He pointed out that many systems marketed as AI were simply traditional programming. “I think somehow it has become a fashion in India to talk of AI for everything. I have seen several normal, ordinary programs touted as AI,” Murthy commented during the annual entrepreneurial conference.In a discussion with Harish Mehta, founding president of TiE Mumbai, Murthy clarified that genuine AI rests on two key pillars: Machine learning , which facilitates extensive correlation for predictions, and Deep Learning, which emulates human brain function through unsupervised algorithms.""Frankly, most of what passes for AI these days is trivial and outdated coding,"" Murthy asserted. ""It's the unsupervised algorithms leveraging deep learning and neural networks that hold far greater promise for increasingly human-like capabilities.""Murthy went on to add that deep learning will be able to solve, and handle what are called “unsupervised algorithms”. While machine learning by and large handles supervised algorithms because you have to give a lot of data into that, deep learning uses the data to create new branches of programs or new conditions. And then it will be able to take decisions.While recognizing that AI will displace some jobs, he emphasized its potential to boost economic growth. ""Every technology eliminates certain roles, but when applied supportively, it can expand the economy.""Murthy also urged entrepreneurs to generate employment. ""I'm confident each of you will spawn hundreds of thousands of jobs—that’s how you tackle poverty. Handouts have never lifted any nation out of poverty,"" he concluded.","Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, spoke at TiECon Mumbai on Wednesday.

"Thanks to Peter Thiel's Palantir and these companies, building tech for the US government and Military may be Cool again at Stanford",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/thanks-to-peter-thiels-palantir-and-these-companies-building-tech-for-the-us-government-and-military-is-cool-again-at-stanford/articleshow/118991130.cms,"Defense companies that are no longer ""looked down upon"" at Stanford

When Divya Ganesan began her political science studies at Stanford in 2021, a career in national security wasn’t on her radar. According to The San Francisco Standard, she recalled that defense intelligence firms like Palantir, which contract with the government, were once “super looked down upon” on campus. “They were seen as the evil guys,” Ganesan told the publication. But the campus mood has since transformed. After enrolling in the popular course “Spies, Lies, and Algorithms” in 2022, Ganesan reportedly found herself captivated by defense technology . She went on to cofound Stanford Women in National Security (WINS), a student group that now boasts over 150 members, and pursued internships at the National Security Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. “My most effective and moral friends are now working for Palantir,” she told The San Francisco Standard. Palantir, cofounded by Peter Thiel -— a known supporter of President Donald Trump—provides surveillance and targeting systems to the military and has seen its stock soar to record highs since Trump’s inauguration.Stanford graduates are landing roles at high-profile firms like Palantir, Anduril, Vannevar Labs, and Shield AI, while others are founding their own security startups. Max Susman, a former Navy SEAL and Stanford MBA student, started Revere Technologies, a drone company, and praised the Gordian Knot Center’s support. “I haven’t had to fly to D.C. Senior Pentagon officials make a stop at Stanford or the Gordian Knot, and I get an audience,” he told The San Francisco Standard.Stanford students are, as per the report, said to be increasingly embracing the idea of building tech for the U.S. government. Some are even leaving school to launch defense tech startups or vie for prestigious internships at government agencies and major contractors. Undergraduates, business school students, recent alumni, and faculty alike are fueling a growing enthusiasm for developing military technology , The San Francisco Standard reports.Ganesan, who once wrestled with the ethics of defense work, now feels differently. “In great power politics, people die. Often more impulsive, less pragmatic men make those decisions, and as a well-educated woman, I’d rather be in the room,” she explained to The San Francisco Standard. This marks a stark departure from the sentiment just seven years ago, when, in 2018, Stanford students and activists protested outside Palantir’s Palo Alto headquarters over its contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That same year, thousands of Google employees petitioned against “Project Maven,” a Pentagon AI drone-targeting initiative.Today, interest in defense-related coursework is surging. Enrollment in “Hacking for Defense,” where students collaborate with American military sponsors on security challenges, has spiked. To meet this demand, Stanford launched the Gordian Knot Center in 2021 with an initial $1.28 million from the US Office of Naval Research. Named after an ancient Greek metaphor for complex problems, the center has become a hub for defense tech programs, supporting WINS, the National Security Innovation Scholars fellowship, and the Stanford DEFCON conference, which drew over 1,000 attendees last year. Faculty have also introduced courses like “Technology Innovation and Great Power Competition” in 2020 and “Entrepreneurship Inside Government” in 2025 to cater to eager undergraduates.","Stanford students are increasingly embracing the idea of building tech for the U.S. government.

How Microsoft has used this survey to improve employee morale



Microsoft is seeing an improvement in employee sentiments . According to an internal survey, a higher percentage of the tech giant’s workforce now reports that they feel they are getting a ""good deal"" at the company. In the latest Microsoft employee survey , conducted in October 2024, 65% of respondents agreed with the statement: ""There is a reasonable balance between what I contribute to Microsoft and what I get in return."" Microsoft uses this specific survey question to gauge employee sentiment concerning work-life balance and compensation.According to a report by Business Insider, a Microsoft spokesperson said that the latest results of the survey represent a 3% rise compared to the survey taken six months earlier. Survey results from last summer had shown a decrease in positive responses to this above mentioned survey question, dropping from 69% to 62% year-over-year. The results of the survey highlight the significance of the recent positive shift in employee morale.In 2022, a declining score on this question prompted Microsoft to raise pay to address concerns about compensation and to reduce employee departures to competitors like Amazon, the report adds.Since then, the tech industry has experienced notable changes. Tech stocks fell during 2022 as the pandemic boom ended, leading many companies to focus on improving efficiency, with investors prioritising profitability over continual growth.Additionally, new AI tools may also be reducing demand for some tech roles. In 2023, Microsoft implemented a salary freeze. The next survey, scheduled for April, follows Microsoft's decision to lay off about 2,000 employees identified as underperformers, the report notes.As per the report, the company is also updating its performance review process , reflecting a shift toward a stricter approach to employee management after years of relatively lenient treatment.","Microsoft is seeing an improvement in employee sentiments.

Change in tone on Trump Tariffs

Bet on Trump tariffs in the long run

Has the falling US stock market led to a change in stance of Jamie Dimon, CEO of America's largest Bank, JPMorgan Chase , on tariffs announced by the US President Donald Trump. It seems likely, though Dimon has not slammed Donald Trump 's tariff policy, he did acknowledge that they are causing uncertainty for companies. Just two months ago, at the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, Jamie Dimon brusquely defended President Donald Trump's international tariff policy, telling critics to ""Get over it."" Dimon went on to dismiss the concerns about tariffs and suggested that they could serve as either ""an economic tool"" or ""an economic weapon,"" depending on their application. In a CNBC interview at the time, he added, ""If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it.""With stock markets declining and signs of strain emerging in the US economy, it now appears thatDimon may be rethinking his stance. In a recent interview with Semafor, Dimon said, ""I don’t think the average American consumer who wakes up in the morning and goes to work… changes what they’re going to do because they read about tariffs."" He acknowledged, however, that ""companies might,"" noting that ""uncertainty is not a good thing."" The US stock market has lost $4 trillion in value since its February peak this month.The US stock market has been witnessing volatility since the past few weeks. While markets rallied on Wednesday, March 12, the S&P 500 remained down over 7% from a month ago. That same day, President Trump announced broad 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to the US, escalating a global trade war. Canada and the European Union quickly responded with retaliatory measures.Trump has argued these tariffs will boost American manufacturing, curb illegal immigration, and stop fentanyl smuggling, though economists warn they could raise prices on goods ranging from groceries to housing.Incidentally, Dimon wasn’t alone in expressing concern about trade tensions. According to the Semafor report, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink , who oversees the world’s largest asset manager, gave a mixed response to CNN on Trump Tariffs . ""The collective impact in the short run is that people are pausing, they’re pulling back,"" Fink said. ""Talking to CEOs throughout the economy, I hear that the economy is weakening as we speak,"" Find said.Despite these short-term worries, Fink suggested that Trump’s policies, including tariffs, might benefit the US over time. ""Right now the president is focusing on tariffs, but when he talks about reciprocal tariffs, actually, that may bring down tariffs over the long run,"" Fink said, maintaining his long-term optimism about America’s economic prospects.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has not slammed Donald Trump's tariff policy.

India arrests Garantex cryptocurrency exchange administrator on request of US authorities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/india-arrests-garantex-cryptocurrncy-exchange-administrator-on-request-of-us-authorities/articleshow/118981257.cms,"Representative Image. AI generated

What US said about the cryptocurrency exchange administrator



India has arrested an administrator of the Garantex cryptocurrency exchange . Acting on a request from US authorities, Varkala police in Kerala apprehended Aleksej Besciokov , a 46-year-old Lithuanian national. The arrest was made based on an Interpol red corner notice issued at the request of the US. Besciokov is alleged to be a co-founder of Garantex, a cryptocurrency exchange that was sanctioned by the US government in 2022. US authorities accuse him of facilitating the laundering of billions of dollars for transnational criminal and cybercriminal organisations. Varkala police DSP B Gopakumar told TOI that the arrest was executed under the direction of the Additional CJM court at Patiala House, acting on the US request.Last week, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed an indictment against Besciokov and another alleged co-founder, Aleksandr Mira Serda, a Russian national who resides in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Besciokov was accused of personally authorising transactions on Garantex connected to hackers affiliated with the North Korean government and other cybercriminals. The DOJ has also criminally charged him with facilitating money laundering on the crypto exchange.According to US prosecutors, the two administrators “redesigned Garantex’s operations to evade and violate US sanctions and induce American businesses to unwittingly transact with Garantex in violation of the sanctions.”Last week, after the Justice Department unsealed the indictment against Besciokov and Serda, the US Secret Service seized Garantex’s websites, and authorities froze over $26 million in cryptocurrency.Since then, Garantex has suspended its operations and invited customers to “face-to-face meetings” at its office in Moscow, having devised an unspecified “solution for blocked assets.”In a statement to TechCrunch, Indian police said that it sought an arrest warrant for Besciokov at the US government's request as he was planning to flee India. After his arrest, he was brought before a district court and is set to appear at Patiala Court next week to face charges.","Varkala police in Kerala apprehended Aleksej Besciokov, a 46-year-old Lithuanian national.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat. In the post, Altman wrote “very proud of the openai team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades…thought that was the thing i'd always be most proud of in life”. Adding further, he wrote “turns out i am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own!”.In a follow-up post, Altman wrote “i realize i am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best)”.Sam Altman welcomed his baby boy last month with his partner and software engineer Oliver Mulherin. The baby arrived prematurely and has been receiving care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).In another news, the CEO shared an update about the company’s latest version of the large language model (LLM), GPT-4.5 . In an X post, Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience.Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it.In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit. We think people are gonna use this a lot and love it.”","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat.

Come April 1 of Fiscal Year 2026-27, a new rule in the Income Tax Act law may grant the Income Tax department powers to access your social media accounts or emails in case they suspect tax evasion . Income Tax Bill 2025, which was introduced in the Parliament recently, will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces, termed Virtual Digital Spaces in the bill. This means that the Income Tax department can break into social media accounts, personal emails, bank accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, and more if they have any reason to believe that you own any undisclosed income, money, Gold, Jewelry, or valuable item or property on which you haven’t paid applicable Income Tax.Presently, Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, allows Income Tax officials to seize assets and books during search operations if they find sufficient reasons to believe that an individual is in possession of undisclosed income or assets. The changes in the bill, once passed in the Parliament, will extend this authourity to the digital realm, allowing officials to bypass security measures on computer systems and virtual spaces.The Clause 247 of the Income Tax Bill outlines this expanded power, stating that officers can “break open the lock of any door, box, locker, safe, almirah, or other receptacle” or “gain access by overriding the access code” to computer systems or virtual digital spaces when access is otherwise unavailable. This applies if they believe an individual possesses undisclosed income or assets taxable under the law.According to the bill, the term Virtual Digital Space includes email servers, social media accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, banking accounts, and any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset. It further adds that virtual digital space is an environment, area or realm that is constructed and experienced through computer technology and not the physical, tangible world, which encompasses any digital realm that allows users to interact, communicate and perform activities using computer systems, computer networks, computer resources, communication devices, cyberspace, internet, worldwide web and emerging technologies, using data and information in the electronic form for creation, storage or exchange and includes:* Email servers* Social media account* Online investment account, trading account, banking account, etc* Any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset* Remote server or cloud servers* Digital application platforms* Any other space of similar natureAs to who all can wield this authority? The bill designates “authorised officers” as senior tax officials, including Joint Directors, Additional Directors, Joint Commissioners, Additional Commissioners, Assistant or Deputy Directors, Assistant or Deputy Commissioners, Income Tax Officers, and Tax Recovery Officers.What does this mean for individuals? The new rules significantly widen the scope of tax investigations, giving officials the ability to probe deeply into personal and financial digital footprints. As this provision takes effect, it raises questions about privacy and the balance between tax enforcement and individual rights.","Income Tax Bill 2025 will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces.

Elon Musk’s Starlink partners with Airtel, Jio for satellite connectivity

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is reportedly planning to recommend a shorter timeframe – five years – for the allocation of satellite broadband spectrum, a move that may challenge Elon Musk's Starlink, which has been advocating for a 20-year permit.Citing a senior government source, news agency Reuters claimed that the telecom regulator is developing crucial recommendations for the federal government, including the duration and pricing structure for satellite spectrum, which will be allocated administratively.As per the government source, TRAI plans to favour a shorter license timeframe “of around 5 years and then see how the sector grows”, explaining that “this will help understand how the market stabilises, so there's no point going beyond five years.”The government source also indicated that TRAI is expected to take approximately a month to finalise its recommendations on the license timeframe.While Starlink has urged the government to grant a 20-year spectrum allocation, citing the need for “affordable pricing and longer-term business plans,” Jio has sought a shorter three-year period, with the intention of India reassessing the market after that time. Airtel has also supported a shorter license period, advocating for a 3-5 year timeframeCiting an industry source familiar with licensing processes, the report said that a shorter timeframe will allow India the flexibility to revise spectrum prices as the satellite broadband market evolves.This development comes shortly after both Airtel and Jio struck a partnership with Elon Musk’s Starlink to provide high-speed internet services.This partnership marks a shift from their previous positions, as both Jio and Airtel previously advocated an auction of the spectrum rather than the administrative allocation favoured by Musk, who argued that spectrum allocation aligns with international standards.","Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is reportedly planning to recommend a shorter timeframe – five years – for the allocation of satellite broadband spectrum.

Facebook gets Sarah Wynn-Williams 'banned' from promoting ‘explosive’ book that claimed ex-COO Sheryl Sandberg asked assistant to 'come to bed' and more,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-gets-sarah-wynn-williams-banned-from-promoting-explosive-book-that-claimed-ex-coo-sheryl-sandberg-asked-assistant-to-come-to-bed-and-more/articleshow/118976564.cms,"Sarah Wynn Williams has made explosive claims about Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg.

What Sarah Wynn-Williams’ book has claimed

Facebook parent Meta has scored a victory as an arbitrator has ruled in the company’s favour in a case against Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former employee who published a memoir alleging misconduct at the company. The ruling also extends to Macmillan Publishers and its imprint Flatiron Books, which published the work.“This ruling affirms that Sarah Wynn Williams’ false and defamatory book should never have been published,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a post on X.“This urgent legal action was made necessary by Williams, who more than eight years after being terminated by the company, deliberately concealed the existence of her book project and avoided the industry’s standard fact-checking process in order to rush it to shelves after waiting for eight years,” he added.As per the arbitrator’s decision, Wynn-Williams must cease making disparaging statements about Meta and its employees, and to the extent possible, stop promoting or publishing the book. She has also been ordered to retract previously made disparaging remarks.The book, Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism, contains allegations of sexual harassment, including claims against Meta’s current policy chief Joel Kaplan, who previously supervised Wynn-Williams, according to NBC News.Moreover, the book contains several explosive allegations concerning Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, former COO of Facebook.One of the accusations involves Sheryl Sandberg's behaviour during a trip to Europe. Wynn-Williams claims that Sandberg spent $13,000 on lingerie for herself and her young female assistant. She further alleges that Sandberg invited her assistant to join her in bed on a private jet flight.Beyond these specific incidents, Wynn-Williams paints a broader picture of a toxic work environment at Facebook under the leadership of Zuckerberg and Sandberg. She alleges that the company culture became “rotten,” characterized by misogyny and double standards.However, the company previously dismissed Wynn-Williams’ claims as “out-of-date” and said that she was fired for “poor performance and toxic behaviour.”Furthermore, Wynn-Williams's allegations extend to Facebook's international dealings. She claims that Zuckerberg worked “hand in glove” with Beijing and considered sharing Facebook user data with China. On this, Stone said that its no secret that the company was interested in China.“Let's tell the whole story here, OK. It's no secret we were interested in China. We explored lots of ideas. All widely reported starting a decade ago. You know what didn't happen? We didn't start offering our services in China - and we told the world that in 2019,” he claimed in a post.","Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former Facebook employee, has published a memoir alleging misconduct at the company.

Government spending and financial mismanagement allegations

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again voiced his concerns over US government spending . In a post on microblogging site X (formerly Twitter), Musk warned that America will go bankrupt if federal spending is not controlled. Musk quoted a post by Canadian-American venture capitalist and entrepreneur Chamath Palihapitiya that said that anyone “wishing DOGE to fail” is “wishing for America to default”.“Make no mistake, just like in a private company, these are losses. America is deeply unprofitable, far away from breaking even and if outsiders stop lending us money, we will go bankrupt. So, in case you didn’t know better, if you are still wishing DOGE to fail, you are wishing for America to default,” Palihapitiya wrote in the post.Musk quoted the post, saying “If the federal spending deficit is not fixed, America will go bankrupt”.This is not the first time Musk was warned against bankruptcy in America. Speaking in an interview with Fox News on February 19, 2025, Musk criticized wasteful government expenditures and urged taxpayers to recognize the financial mismanagement affecting the country's economy.During the discussion, Musk emphasised that the United States is running a USD 2 trillion annual trade deficit , which he described as “insane.” He compared the country’s economic situation to that of an individual, stating that if overspending continues, financial collapse is inevitable. Former U.S. President Donald Trump , who also participated in the interview, agreed with Musk’s concerns and highlighted excessive spending by the previous administration. Trump blamed waste, fraud, and abuse in government programs, arguing that funds were mismanaged on initiatives such as the Green New Deal, which he referred to as the ""greatest scam in U.S. history.""In an interview, Elon Musk criticized U.S. foreign aid and financial policies, arguing that taxpayer money is being misused. According to ANI, he claimed that government-funded programs often suffer from waste, fraud, and abuse, leading to inefficient resource allocation.Former President Donald Trump echoed Musk’s concerns, stating that his administration inherited a $2 trillion trade deficit due to previous spending policies. He pointed out cases where government contracts continued long past their intended terms, allowing individuals and companies to receive payments unnecessarily.Key points from the discussion included excessive foreign aid spending, financial fraud in government contracts, and bureaucratic inefficiency, which both Musk and Trump argued hinders economic reforms.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has voiced his concerns over US government spending.

Why there are protests against Elon Musk’s Tesla

Fortnite-maker Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has publicly thrown his weight behind Elon Musk 's claims that the nationwide protests against Tesla are part of a coordinated effort backed by billionaire donors, including George Soros and LinkedIn co-founder, former executive chairman of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman and others.Responding to Musk’s post on X (formerly Twitter) that suggested Soros, Hoffman, Herbert Sandler, Patricia Bauman and Leah Hunt-Hendrix were behind the anti-Tesla demonstrations, Sweeney wrote ""Disgusting,"" appearing to agree with Musk's characterisation of the situation.When questioned about his stance, Sweeney defended his position by referencing his experience with Epic Games' legal battle against the Big Tech – a typical reference to the five US tech companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft.“Elon made a simple statement of fact and I have firsthand experience with Big Tech companies paying dozens of lobbyists and front groups to smear my company while concealing or misrepresenting their allegiance to their paymasters. It needs to stop,” he said.“Megacorps and plutocrats are free to have their dumb opinions and to express them. That’s their right. The problem here is the multibillion dollar web of deception they fund to misrepresent their dumb ideas as organic or popular movements when they are just the opposite,” he added.“And then you have the violent fringe around such astroturfing campaigns which increasingly appears to be an intended feature, not a bug,” Sweeney said.The protests against Tesla have been growing across multiple countries, reflecting Musk’s involvement in political activities. These demonstrations have occurred at Tesla showrooms and facilities in various locations.In New York City, several protesters were arrested outside a Tesla dealership, with some chanting, “We need clean air, not another billionaire.”Tesla owners have begun displaying bumper stickers with messages like “Bought it before we knew how awful he is” and “Stuck with Tesla, not stuck on Elon.”","Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has publicly thrown his weight behind Elon Musk's claims that the nationwide protests against Tesla are part of a coordinated effort backed by billionaire donors.

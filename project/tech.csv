This may be the '$12 billion proof' that all is not well between Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-may-be-the-12-billion-proof-that-all-is-not-well-between-microsoft-and-chatgpt-maker-openai/articleshow/118903842.cms,"Adds another crease in Microsoft-OpenAI relationship

CoreWeave’s Rise: From Crypto to AI Powerhouse

In a blockbuster move shaking up the AI infrastructure landscape, OpenAI has signed a five-year, $11.9 billion agreement with CoreWeave, a GPU-heavy cloud service provider, as first reported by Reuters and confirmed by CoreWeave in a press release. The deal, which includes OpenAI acquiring $350 million in CoreWeave equity, marks a significant win for both companies and underscores shifting alliances in the race for AI dominance. What makes the deal interesting is that is that before this deal, CoreWeave’s biggest customer is reported to be Microsoft. According to TechCrunch, in 2024, Microsoft accounted for 62% of CoreWeave’s revenue, which grew to a stunning $1.9 billion — nearly an eight-fold increase from just $228.9 million in 2023.CoreWeave, a company backed by Nvidia (which holds a 6% stake), operates an AI-specific cloud service powered by a network of 32 data centers. As of late 2024, it boasted over 250,000 Nvidia GPUs, with recent additions including Nvidia’s cutting-edge Blackwell GPUs designed for AI reasoning. The company, which filed to go public last week but has yet to set a debut date or pricing, saw its revenue skyrocket to $1.9 billion in 2024—up nearly eightfold from $228.9 million in 2023. Until now, Microsoft accounted for a hefty 62% of that revenue, making OpenAI’s entry as a major customer a game-changer.The agreement comes as CoreWeave prepares for a planned IPO aiming to raise $4 billion or more. Heavy reliance on Microsoft had raised concerns among potential investors, but securing OpenAI in a multi-billion-dollar deal could smooth the path forward, easing worries about customer concentration.The deal adds a new twist to the increasingly strained relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft, its longtime backer. Microsoft, which has a profit-sharing arrangement with OpenAI, was once its sole cloud provider. But tensions have simmered as OpenAI’s ambitions have grown, pitting the two against each other in the enterprise AI market. OpenAI is reportedly developing expensive AI agents, while Microsoft is building its own “reasoning” models, including the MAI family, to rival OpenAI’s o1 and o3-mini offerings. Microsoft even tapped Mustafa Suleyman, a rival to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman , to lead its AI division.This isn’t the first sign of OpenAI diversifying its infrastructure. In January, as part of the massive Stargate AI project with SoftBank, Oracle, and others, OpenAI ended Microsoft’s exclusivity as its cloud provider. Altman has been vocal about the company’s need for more computing power, recently lamenting that OpenAI is “out of GPUs.” Now, with direct access to CoreWeave’s resources—and an ownership stake in the company—OpenAI is flexing its independence.CoreWeave’s journey to this point is as unconventional as it is impressive. Founded by former hedge fund executives, the company began as a crypto mining operation before pivoting to AI cloud services . Its three co-founders have already cashed out $488 million in shares—over $150 million each—while CoreWeave carries a hefty $7.9 billion in debt.","OpenAI has signed a five-year, $11.9 billion agreement with CoreWeave, a GPU- heavy cloud service provider.

"Why Expedia Group, Airbnb and other travel stocks are seeing one of the biggest-ever fall",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-expedia-group-airbnb-and-other-travel-stocks-are-seeing-one-of-the-biggest-ever-fall/articleshow/118903245.cms,"Travel follows Tech's Magnificent Seven

Tourism-related stocks took a significant hit on Tuesday, March 11, after several major US airlines issued warnings about declining travel demand, sparking concerns over the health of the broader American economy. Shares of Expedia Group (EXPE) were among the hardest hit, plummeting about 8% and making the travel giant one of the biggest decliners in the S&P 500. Airbnb stock too faced a rout.The selloff followed cautious outlooks from Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV), all of which lowered their forecasts for key first-quarter 2025 metrics, including revenue, earnings per share (EPS), and available seat miles. Airline executives attributed the downward revisions to an uncertain macroeconomic environment and disruptions caused by severe weather events, such as the California wildfires in January.Despite the gloomy industry outlook, Southwest Airlines shares managed to buck the trend, climbing higher after the company announced new revenue-generating initiatives like the introduction of baggage fees. The ripple effect of the airlines’ warnings was felt across the travel sector. Booking Holdings (BKNG) and major hotel chains including Hyatt Hotels (H), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT), and Marriott International (MAR) all saw their shares slide on Tuesday. Cruise line stocks also suffered, with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH), Carnival Corp. (CCL), and Viking Holdings (VIK) registering declines.The huge dip in travel stocks comes just a day after billions were wiped out from the market cap of America's biggest technology stocks. Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Nvidia, Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and Meta make America's Magnificent Seven. These seven biggest American technology companies are known for their market dominance. In stock market carnage just a day earlier (March 10), these seven most valuable tech companies lost more than $750 billion in market value.","Shares of Expedia Group (EXPE) were among the hardest hit, plummeting about 8% and making the travel giant one of the biggest decliners in the S&P 500.

Starlink: Looking ahead

After years of regulatory hurdles, Elon Musk's revolutionary Starlink satellite internet is poised to transform India's digital landscape through a partnership with telecom giant Bharti Airtel . This alliance marks a potential turning point for millions of Indians in remote and rural areas who have long struggled with limited connectivity options. As the world's second-largest internet market with over 950 million internet subscribers—but 450 million people still offline—India represents both a massive opportunity and challenge for Starlink's global expansion. But what exactly is Starlink, how does it work, and what will it mean for India's digital future?Starlink is a satellite internet constellation created by SpaceX, Elon Musk's aerospace company. Unlike traditional satellite internet, Starlink uses thousands of small satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) to deliver high-speed internet to virtually any location on Earth with a clear view of the sky. The system is designed to serve remote and rural areas where conventional internet infrastructure is limited or nonexistent.Starlink operates through a network of satellites orbiting approximately 300 miles above Earth—significantly closer than traditional satellite services, which typically orbit 22,000 miles away. This proximity drastically reduces latency and improves speeds.Starlink currently provides download speeds ranging from 50Mbps to 200Mbps, with latency around 20-30 milliseconds—comparable to ground-based internet. SpaceX plans to increase these speeds to 300Mbps in the near future and has long-term goals of reaching 1Gbps and eventually 10Gbps as more satellites are deployed.In March 2025, Bharti Airtel announced a partnership with SpaceX to bring Starlink's services to India. This partnership, subject to regulatory approvals, will:It's less suitable for urban users with access to fiber or cable internet, as these typically offer faster speeds at lower costs.The standard kit includes a 100-foot cable connecting the dish to the router, and additional mounting accessories are available for purchase.Yes. The dish includes a built-in heater to handle snow and ice. Heavy rain or extreme conditions may temporarily affect performance, but the system generally maintains connectivity in most weather.Yes. With latency around 20-30ms, Starlink supports online gaming. Some users report occasional lag during satellite handoffs, but most find the experience suitable for competitive gaming.Yes, through Starlink Roam. This service allows you to use Starlink at multiple locations or on the move with your RV, boat, or other vehicle, though at a higher monthly cost.With over 5,600 satellites already in orbit and plans for thousands more, Starlink continues to expand its capacity and coverage. The system serves more than 2.7 million users globally, with major growth expected in underserved markets like India. As satellite technology advances and competition increases, we can expect improved performance and potentially more competitive pricing in the coming years.","Starlink is a satellite internet constellation created by SpaceX, Elon Musk's aerospace company.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

"How Jim Walker, the man who saw 2008 Stock Market crash coming, may have just 'agreed' with Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath's 'Stock Market Gyaan'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-jim-walker-the-man-who-saw-the-2008-stock-market-crash-coming-may-have-just-agreed-with-zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamaths-stock-market-gyaan/articleshow/118727832.cms,"Jim Walker to investors: Take long-term investment approach

Jim Walker picks India over China

Indian stock markets witnessed Bears onslaught in the month of February, with the benchmark Sensex closing over 4,000 points lower. The carnage witnessed in the market during the month led to a staggering erosion of over Rs 40 lakh crore from the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies; while Nifty 50 marked its longest losing streak since its inception in the year 1996. The relentless downward trend has left retail investors anxious. In a message to investors late earlier this week, Zerodha founder and CEO Nithin Kamath termed the fall as ""the first real market correction "" since Covid pandemic.""Markets are cyclical, and given the way our markets went up from late 2020, this fall was inevitable,"" he said. Kamath told investors to not get carried away by the doom and gloom in the market and continue investing in SIPs. ""I don't know how good the data is, but it seems like the number of investors stopping their SIPs has gone up. This is the wrong thing to do. What an SIP helps you do is to average your investments across different market cycles,"" he said.A similar sentiment comes from Jim Walker, a celebrated economist from Alethia Capital who famously foresaw the 2008 financial crisis. In an exclusive interaction with ETNow, Walker gave perspective on the current state of the global economy and what he thinks about India. Contrary to widespread concerns that today’s market exuberance might precipitate a collapse akin to that of 2008, Walker holds a different view.Speaking with ETNow, he acknowledged a global economic slowdown but stressed that the circumstances differ markedly from those preceding the financial debacle over ten years ago. Similar to Nithin Kamath, Walker batted for a long-term investment approach. Walker encouraged his clients to boost their stakes in India, despite valuation concerns in its stock market. “I’ve advised clients this week to significantly increase their investments in India. Though stock valuations raise eyebrows, I believe economic growth will soon justify them with strong corporate earnings,” he elaborated.Known for his prescient 2006-07 warning of a looming U.S. housing market crash, Walker remarked that today’s danger signals are less evident. “The signs were glaring in 2006-07 when we predicted a severe downturn driven by excesses in the property sector; it’s not the same now,” he said.He pointed out that unlike the lead-up to 2008, there are currently no significant overindulgences in the housing or financial sectors poised to spark a major banking crisis. Although certain areas show excessive stock market gains and asset price inflation, Walker believes these won’t lead to widespread corporate failures that could rattle the banking system. “We’re not seeing the kind of corporate collapses that impacted banks in 2008. That’s not on the horizon,” he observed.Additionally, Walker expressed a stronger preference for investing in India over China, suggesting it might be an opportune moment to increase investments there. He is especially sanguine about India’s prospects, citing its robust policy environment—the best in three decades—as a key factor enhancing its appeal to investors. “India’s policy stability and certainty are at their peak in the last 30 years,” he asserted, crediting solid monetary and fiscal policies along with exchange rate stability for bolstering India’s economic structure.He also commended the Indian government’s steps toward deregulation and business-friendly policies, seeing them as key drivers of future growth. Walker believes that supporting small and medium enterprises will further boost economic and job expansion.","Jim Walker picks India over China as a good place to invest in the stock market.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat. In the post, Altman wrote “very proud of the openai team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades…thought that was the thing i'd always be most proud of in life”. Adding further, he wrote “turns out i am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own!”.In a follow-up post, Altman wrote “i realize i am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best)”.Sam Altman welcomed his baby boy last month with his partner and software engineer Oliver Mulherin. The baby arrived prematurely and has been receiving care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).In another news, the CEO shared an update about the company’s latest version of the large language model (LLM), GPT-4.5 . In an X post, Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience.Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it.In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit.

Come April 1 of Fiscal Year 2026-27, a new rule in the Income Tax Act law may grant the Income Tax department powers to access your social media accounts or emails in case they suspect tax evasion . Income Tax Bill 2025, which was introduced in the Parliament recently, will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces, termed Virtual Digital Spaces in the bill. This means that the Income Tax department can break into social media accounts, personal emails, bank accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, and more if they have any reason to believe that you own any undisclosed income, money, Gold, Jewelry, or valuable item or property on which you haven’t paid applicable Income Tax.Presently, Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, allows Income Tax officials to seize assets and books during search operations if they find sufficient reasons to believe that an individual is in possession of undisclosed income or assets. The changes in the bill, once passed in the Parliament, will extend this authourity to the digital realm, allowing officials to bypass security measures on computer systems and virtual spaces.The Clause 247 of the Income Tax Bill outlines this expanded power, stating that officers can “break open the lock of any door, box, locker, safe, almirah, or other receptacle” or “gain access by overriding the access code” to computer systems or virtual digital spaces when access is otherwise unavailable. This applies if they believe an individual possesses undisclosed income or assets taxable under the law.According to the bill, the term Virtual Digital Space includes email servers, social media accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, banking accounts, and any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset. It further adds that virtual digital space is an environment, area or realm that is constructed and experienced through computer technology and not the physical, tangible world, which encompasses any digital realm that allows users to interact, communicate and perform activities using computer systems, computer networks, computer resources, communication devices, cyberspace, internet, worldwide web and emerging technologies, using data and information in the electronic form for creation, storage or exchange and includes:* Email servers* Social media account* Online investment account, trading account, banking account, etc* Any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset* Remote server or cloud servers* Digital application platforms* Any other space of similar natureAs to who all can wield this authority? The bill designates “authorised officers” as senior tax officials, including Joint Directors, Additional Directors, Joint Commissioners, Additional Commissioners, Assistant or Deputy Directors, Assistant or Deputy Commissioners, Income Tax Officers, and Tax Recovery Officers.What does this mean for individuals? The new rules significantly widen the scope of tax investigations, giving officials the ability to probe deeply into personal and financial digital footprints. As this provision takes effect, it raises questions about privacy and the balance between tax enforcement and individual rights.","Income Tax Bill 2025 will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces.

How this 21-year-old is helping techies ‘crack’ online job interviews,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-21-year-old-is-helping-techies-crack-online-job-interviews/articleshow/118892488.cms,"Representative image

A 21-year-old Columbia University student has created a tool that helps software engineers use artificial intelligence to crack virtual technical job interviews. Chungin ""Roy"" Lee founded Interview Coder , a service that provides real-time AI assistance during coding interviews while remaining undetectable to interviewers.""Everyone programs nowadays with the help of AI,"" said Lee. ""It doesn't make sense to have an interview format that assumes you don't have the use of AI.""The service, which costs $60 per month, is reportedly on track to hit $1 million in annual recurring revenue by mid-May, according to CNBC.Lee claims he received internship offers from Amazon, Meta, and TikTok after using his own software to cheat during their technical interviews. The companies later rescinded their offers after he posted videos demonstrating how he passed an Amazon interview using AI.""I thought I wanted to work at a big tech company and spent 600 hours practicing for Leetcode,"" Lee told CNBC. ""It made me miserable, and I almost stopped programming because of how much I didn't like it.""Tech companies are struggling to adapt. Google CEO Sundar Pichai suggested during a February town hall that hiring managers consider returning to in-person interviews to combat AI cheating. Other companies like Deloitte and Anthropic have already made similar changes.Henry Kirk, a software developer who hosted a virtual coding challenge, discovered that more than 50% of applicants were cheating. ""The problem is now I don't trust the results as much,"" Kirk said.Lee's tool is marketed as ""invisible to all screen-recording softwares"" and aims to disrupt the traditional Leetcode interview process used by major tech companies.When asked if he worries about software engineers losing the trust of the tech industry, Lee responded: ""My reaction to that is any company that is slow to respond to market changes will get hurt and that's the fault of the company. If there are better tools, then it's their fault for not resorting to the better alternative to exist. I don't feel guilty at all for not catering to a company's inability to adapt.""Columbia University has opened disciplinary proceedings against Lee, according to documents viewed by CNBC.","Chungin ""Roy"" Lee founded Interview Coder, a service that provides real-time AI assistance during coding interviews while remaining undetectable to interviewers.

Zero Percent Loans Return for Model 3

Tesla, the electric vehicle (EV) giant, is reportedly scrambling to reverse fall in sales in the first quarter of the year 2025 by rolling out a suite of enticing perks aimed at luring hesitant buyers. According to a report in Autoblog, then offers range from zero percent interest loans to lifetime free Supercharging, the company is said to be pulling out all the stops to move inventory -— particularly its beleaguered Cybertruck -- amid a growing backlash against CEO Elon Musk and intensifying global competition.Tesla’s struggles come as the company's brand reputation has taken a due to Elon Musk's involvement in the US government's DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency). Some high-profile celebrities have publicly ditched their Tesla's, citing Musk’s controversial involvement in US government affairs as a breaking point. Meanwhile, some owners are slapping their vehicles with stickers reading, “I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy,” while more extreme detractors have resorted to arson on Tesla lots and even gunfire at dealerships. On March 10, Tesla shares had their worst day in four years amid a growing backlash over Elon Musk’s political allegiance. The Tesla stock is down 45% in 2025 and has lost all of its gains since Trump won the US presidential election in November and investors pumped more than $700 billion into Tesla shares.New Cybertruck orders financed through Tesla now qualify for a 1.99 percent interest rate. Buyers also gain access to free lifetime charging at Tesla Supercharger stations, a perk tied to the vehicle’s ownership period. For those eyeing existing inventory, additional discounts sweeten the deal on a Cybertruck.Tesla is also reportedly reviving a fan-favorite offer: Zero percent interest loans. “Well-qualified” buyers—typically those with credit scores of 700 or higher—can secure this deal on a new Model 3 if they apply for a $7,500 federal tax credit. For those skipping the tax break, a still-competitive 0.99 percent loan is available.","Tesla is reportedly rolling out a suite of enticing perks aimed at luring hesitant buyers.

South Korea's Kia responds to Kia Norway’s ‘Elon Musk went crazy’ post,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/south-koreas-kia-responds-to-kia-norways-elon-musk-went-crazy-post/articleshow/118890222.cms,"Why there are protests against Elon Musk’s Tesla

Kia has said that it did not approve an advertising campaign featuring one of its electric vehicles with a bumper sticker criticising Tesla owner Elon Musk , as per a report. The advertisement, which appeared on Kia Norway 's social media accounts, showed the company's entry-level EV3 electric car with a bumper sticker that suggested dissatisfaction with the billionaire’s recent political activities.“Kia Corporation is aware of a social media post by Kia Norway, which has since been removed. The post was an entirely independent local initiative that does not reflect the position of Kia Europe or Kia Corporation ,” a Kia spokesperson stated, as per news agency AFP.The message, which read “I bought this after Elon went crazy” appears to reference a trend among Tesla owners who have been placing stickers on their vehicles claiming they purchased them “before Musk went crazy”.When users shared images of the advertisement on X (formerly Twitter), Musk responded with apparent surprise, asking: “They really did that?” in response to a post highlighting Kia Norway's promotion.Tesla has become a target for demonstrators protesting Elon Musk’s role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Protests are occurring in multiple countries, with Tesla owners themselves joining the opposition.Last week, dozens of protesters gathered at a Tesla showroom in Lisbon to express their disapproval of Musk's support for far-right European political parties as Portugal approaches a potential snap election. In the same week, several protesters were arrested outside a Tesla dealership in New York City, where some chanted, “We need clean air, not another billionaire.”Tesla owners are increasingly displaying bumper stickers with messages like “Bought it before we knew how awful he is” and “Stuck with Tesla, not stuck on Elon.” Some owners openly acknowledge their conflicted position, with statements such as, “I didn't buy a Tesla because I like Elon, and I'm not gonna sell it just because he's a Nazi.”","Kia said it did not approve an advertising campaign featuring one of its electric vehicles with a bumper sticker criticising Tesla owner Elon Musk.

ActBlue and the investigation



Elon Musk has claimed that a coordinated campaign is being waged against his company Tesla, alleging that multiple activist groups are behind recent protests against the electric vehicle giant. In a social media post, Musk suggested that the organizations involved in these demonstrations are funded by ActBlue, a major Democratic fundraising platform.Musk further named high-profile individuals, including billionaire philanthropist George Soros, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and hedge fund investor Herbert Sandler, as financial backers of the groups. These allegations come at a time when Tesla is facing growing criticism from activists and a shift in consumer sentiment, raising questions about the extent of political influence on corporate reputations.In a recent tweet, Musk specifically pointed to five organizations—Troublemakers, Disruption Project, Rise & Resist, Indivisible Project, and the Democratic Socialists of America—as being behind the recent wave of Tesla protests. These groups have been involved in various demonstrations, which Musk claims are not spontaneous but instead part of a broader effort to undermine Tesla.His post encouraged users to provide further information about the alleged connections between these activist groups and their funding sources. However, as of now, there has been no independent verification of Musk’s claims linking these organizations to ActBlue or the named individuals.Tesla, once a highly sought-after brand among environmentally conscious consumers, has recently faced growing criticism, particularly from segments of the political left. The backlash intensified following Musk’s public alignment with figures associated with right-wing politics, as well as his outspoken views on free speech and corporate governance.Several Tesla owners have reportedly traded in their vehicles in response to Musk’s political affiliations. Social media users have highlighted incidents where Tesla vehicles were seen with bumper stickers distancing themselves from Musk, with slogans such asFurthermore, Tesla’s stock performance has seen fluctuations, with shares declining significantly in recent months. Analysts cite multiple factors contributing to this trend, including supply chain issues, increased competition in the EV sector, and controversies surrounding the launch of new Tesla models, particularly the Cybertruck.Musk’s allegations come amid reports of increasing anti-Tesla sentiment, with multiple incidents of vandalism targeting Tesla vehicles and charging stations.Despite these incidents, there is currently no direct evidence linking the protests and acts of vandalism to a coordinated effort funded by political donors, as Musk has alleged.Musk’s claims also coincide with ongoing investigations into ActBlue’s financial practices. The platform, known for fundraising for Democratic candidates and progressive causes, has recently come under scrutiny for allegedly accepting unauthorized foreign donations. These allegations have led to the resignation of several senior officials, adding further complexity to Musk’s accusations.However, no public evidence has surfaced directly linking ActBlue’s financial activities to anti-Tesla demonstrations. Musk’s assertions remain unverified, and none of the groups he mentioned have publicly responded to his claims.","Elon Musk has claimed that a coordinated campaign is being waged against his company Tesla.

How and why Elon Musk's public spat with Poland FM led to almost 400% jump in stock price of Europe's Starlink rival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-and-why-elon-musks-public-spat-with-poland-fm-led-to-almost-400-jump-in-stock-price-of-europes-starlink-rival/articleshow/118888047.cms,"How Does The Starlink System Work?

Can Eutelsat Take Over From Elon Musk's Starlink



Eutelsat, Europe's rival to Elon Musk's Starlink, has seen its stock soar by nearly 390% last week. Eutelsat is a French company that produces satellites for data connectivity. Speculation about a shifting landscape in European defense and satellite connectivity is reported to be behind the big jump. The company’s share price experienced dramatic swings, surging as much as 77% March 4 and an additional 120% on March 5. From its February 28 closing value to March 7th's close, Eutelsat’s stock climbed an astonishing 387%. The rally has persisted this week, with shares rising more than 20% on March 10.For those unaware, France-based Eutelsat launches satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary orbit (GEO) using rockets from companies like SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk. After merging with British satellite operator OneWeb in 2023, Eutelsat became the world’s third-largest satellite operator by revenue, positioning it as a competitor to SpaceX’s Starlink internet service.The rally in Eutelsat's stock started amid reports that Eutelsat could step in as a replacement for SpaceX's Starlink in Ukraine, where Elon Musk’s service has provided critical internet access to the military during its ongoing dispute with Russia. Recently, US-Ukraine relations soured after a disastrous meeting between Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and the US President Donald Trump. Zelensky left the White House without signing a mineral agreement that was reported to be on the table. The US halted military aid to Ukraine after the public showdown. Some reports also suggested that the US may cut Ukraine’s Starlink access.Eutelsat is reported to be exploring an expanded role in Ukraine with the EU. CEO Eva Berneke told Bloomberg last week, “Everyone is asking us today, ‘Can you replace the large number of terminals in Ukraine,’ and we are looking at that.” With 35 GEO satellites and an LEO network of over 600 satellites, Eutelsat has the capacity to provide significant support.On March 4, Eutelsat revealed it was negotiating with the European Union to bolster internet services in Ukraine. The company’s stock had already started climbing the previous day, fueled by speculation it could fill a Starlink-sized gap if US-Ukraine talks collapse again.The situation grew more complex over the past week when Musk clashed on Twitter with Poland’s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski. The public spat started after Sikorski claimed that Poland pays for Ukraine to use the services of Starlink. He further went on to claim that Elon Musk is planning to shut down Starlink terminals in Ukraine. This angered both the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. The duo sharply responded to Sikorski, dismissing Polish FM's concerns about Starlink being cut off. The US Secretary accused Poland's foreign minister of ""making things up"". Musk warned that Ukraine’s “entire front line” would collapse without Starlink. In a post on Twitter, Elon Musk said that no matter how much he disagreed on Ukraine policy, Starlink would never turn off its terminals in the country. ""Exactly! To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals. I am simply stating that, without Starlink, the Ukrainian lines would collapse, as the Russians can jam all other communications! We would never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip,"" wrote Elon Musk.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk later defended his minister, praising his diplomatic approach.","Eutelsat, Europe's rival to Elon Musk's Starlink, has seen its stock soar by nearly 390% last week.

How DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng has given a new tourist destination to Chinese,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-deepseek-founder-liang-wenfeng-has-given-a-new-tourist-destination-to-chinese/articleshow/118886772.cms,"How DeepSeek founders village is turning into a tourist spot



DeepSeek founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng 's AI success has transformed his Chinese village, Mililing, into a popular tourist destination. Located in southern China, Mililing, once an underdeveloped hamlet, is now experiencing a tourism boom directly linked to the fame of its native son and his AI company, DeepSeek.Local authorities have reportedly responded to this visitor surge by initiating a ""facelift"" for the village. Before this transformation, Mililing was a quiet village of nearly 700 residents, with younger generations primarily employed in shoe manufacturing and the elderly engaged in agriculture. The village committee's director, Liang Wenfen, confirmed the tourism surge and the subsequent development efforts to a South China Morning Post report.As Liang's achievements gained global recognition, Mililing began attracting visitors driven by admiration and curiosity. According to the committee director, groups of travelers—including families with children and employees in company uniforms—have been visiting the village since January.During the Spring Festival holiday (January 29 to February 10), the village welcomed around 10,000 tourists daily, he added.In response to the sudden influx of visitors and complaints about inadequate infrastructure, local authorities launched a renovation effort. As reported by SCMP, 29 houses had their exterior walls repaired and repainted, while dilapidated structures were demolished.Roads were widened, sewage drains were installed, and streets were cleaned and cleared of weeds. Additionally, trees were planted to enhance the village’s appearance.Some tourists have even taken ""souvenirs"" from the area. “Some visitors took away piles of soil, stones, or pieces of leaves,” a resident identified only by his surname, Yuan, told the publication.However, the recent developments have placed the DeepSeek founder's grandfather in a difficult position. As the sole occupant of their four-story house in the village, the elderly man keeps his front door shut for most of the day, fearing harassment from the tourists.Liang completed his primary education in this village before enrolling at Wuchuan No 1 Middle School, a key educational institution in the region.In 2002, he secured a high score in the country's university entrance exam, the gaokao, earning him a place at the Zhejiang University.","DeepSeek founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng's AI success has transformed his Chinese village into a popular tourist destination.

Dimon blames ""people in the middle"" for not returning to the office



JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon defended his bank's strict return-to-office mandate while acknowledging employee concerns in recent statements across multiple forums. The banking giant is requiring employees to return to in-person work five days a week starting this March, ending remote work options that remained after pandemic restrictions.""I completely respect people that don't want to go to the office all five days a week. That's your right. It's my right. It's a citizen's right,"" Dimon told CNBC in February. ""But they should respect that the company is going to decide what's good for the clients, the company, etc., not an individual.""The CEO's comments follow a viral town hall incident where Dimon responded with strong language to an employee's question about flexibility in return-to-office policies, igniting debate within the organization and across the financial industry.Dimon later categorized critics of the policy as ""people in the middle,"" during an appearance at Stanford Graduate School of Business. ""If you work in a restaurant, you got to be in. You all may not know this, but 60% of Americans worked the whole time,"" Dimon said, referencing frontline workers during the pandemic.The policy has sparked concern among JPMorgan's technology workforce , with some employees reportedly considering leaving. With a $17 billion IT budget and nearly 60,000 technology workers, the bank faces potential talent retention challenges as competitors like Citigroup maintain hybrid work options .Despite the pushback, Dimon has remained firm on the policy. ""Jamie Dimon's like, 'Well, hey, if you don't like it, you know where the door is.' Yes, we do,"" one technology vice president told Business Insider, speaking anonymously. ""And that's going to impact him. He's going to lose some good people.""",JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon defended his bank's strict return-to-office mandate.

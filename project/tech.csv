What AppleCare+ policies say about fire damages



What it means for users



Victims affected by the Los Angeles wildfire who lost their Macs may have to look to their homeowner's insurance for replacement, not AppleCare. While AppleCare offers protection against certain damages, it generally doesn't cover fire damage. The wildfires in California have caused widespread property loss, including homes, businesses, and personal belongings. Thousands of people have been affected, and those needing to replace their Macs will likely find better support through their homeowner's insurance policies. Apple 's AppleCare+ for Mac has specific terms outlining what is and isn't covered for repairs.Similar to other warranties and insurance policies, the agreement clearly states its limitations.The ""What is not Covered?"" section of the AppleCare+ policy agreement lists scenarios that won’t be covered includes damage caused by ""accident, abuse, misuse, liquid contact, fire, earthquake or other external causes."" This means damage from fire, or even water damage from firefighting efforts, will not covered.Submitting a Mac for repair or replacement after it has survived a house fire, even if it appears intact externally, will likely be rejected. Additionally, if your house was evacuated as a precaution but left unscathed by the fire, it could still become a target for theft. The policy explicitly states it does not cover ""lost or stolen"" hardware, noting, ""This Plan only covers Covered Equipment that is returned to Apple in its entirety.""Apart from this, the company is offering other support to those affected by the LA wildfires. Apple Card users in FEMA-designated disaster areas can defer payments without interest accrual by contacting Apple Card Support.Additionally, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that Apple is donating to support wildfire victims and recovery efforts.While AppleCare is helpful for typical Mac issues, it's not a comprehensive insurance plan and has limitations. It's designed to cover repairs for specific problems, not for events like natural disasters or theft. For broader protection, insurance is the more appropriate solution.Instead, Mac owners affected by wildfires should turn to homeowner's or renter's insurance, which typically covers property damage and loss, including electronics. Businesses can use property insurance for similar claims, while travellers should review their travel insurance policies for coverage of damaged or lost items.","AppleCare+ for Mac has specific terms outlining what is and isn't covered for repairs.

How Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg used YouTube to defend his company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-facebook-co-founder-mark-zuckerberg-used-youtube-to-defend-his-company/articleshow/117307788.cms,"What Zuckerberg said to defend Meta



“For example, YouTube, I think, may end up hosting some stuff that people pirate for some period of time, but YouTube is trying to take that stuff down. And the vast majority of the stuff on YouTube, I would assume, is kind of good and they have the license to do.”

What Zuckerberg said about Meta using LibGen



“I get that you’re trying to get me to give an opinion of LibGen, which I haven’t really heard of. It’s just that I don’t have knowledge of that specific thing.”

Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has used YouTube 's battle against piracy to defend his company's use of copyrighted ebooks for AI training. According to newly released excerpts from a deposition (seen by Techcrunch), which was a part of the Kadrey v. Meta lawsuit , Zuckerberg’s defence highlighted the ongoing legal debate surrounding the ""fair use"" of copyrighted content for AI training , a claim disputed by many copyright holders.This is one of many cases where authors and IP holders are challenging AI companies over their use of copyrighted material.During his deposition, Zuckerberg said:While a full transcript remains unavailable, excerpts from Zuckerberg's deposition shed light on his views regarding copyright and fair use in AI development. Zuckerberg seems to defend Meta's use of the ""LibGen"" dataset, a collection of copyrighted ebooks, to train its Llama AI models.LibGen, a self-described ""links aggregator,"" provides access to copyrighted works from major publishers and has faced numerous lawsuits and fines for copyright infringement. Despite concerns within Meta's AI teams about the legal implications, Zuckerberg allegedly approved the use of LibGen for training at least one Llama model.The plaintiffs' counsel, representing authors like Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, highlighted internal concerns within Meta about using the LibGen dataset. According to a legal filing, Meta employees referred to LibGen as a ""data set we know to be pirated"" and warned that its use ""may undermine (the company’s)] negotiating position with regulators.""However, during his deposition, Zuckerberg claimed he ""hadn't really heard of"" LibGen. He said:When questioned by one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, David Boies, about the company's use of the LibGen dataset. Zuckerberg defended Meta's use of the dataset, arguing that prohibiting the use of such resources for AI training would be unreasonable.“So would I want to have a policy against people using YouTube because some of the content may be copyrighted? No. [T]here are cases where having such a blanket ban might not be the right thing to do,” he said.“You know, [if there’s] someone who’s providing a website and they’re intentionally trying to violate people’s rights … obviously it’s something that we would want to be cautious about or careful about how we engaged with it or maybe even prevent our teams from engaging with it,” Zuckerberg added.","Mark Zuckerberg used YouTube's battle against piracy to defend Meta's use of copyrighted ebooks for AI training.

"UK has this deadline for all adult websites, 3 key things they are required to do",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-has-this-deadline-for-all-adult-websites-3-key-things-they-are-required-to-do/articleshow/117306907.cms,"What the companies have to do

Children's access assessment:

Protecting children on social media platforms:

Age verification for pornographic content:

The UK's media regulator, Ofcom , has issued guidelines requiring all websites hosting porn, or adult material, including social media platforms, to implement “robust” age-verification checks for users in the region.According to the guidelines, these measures, which include demanding photo ID or conducting credit card checks, must be in place by July.The new rules, implemented under the Online Safety Act (OSA), aim to prevent children from easily accessing pornography online.“For too long, many online services which allow porn and other harmful material have ignored the fact that children are accessing their services,” said Ofcom chief executive Melanie Dawes.“Either they don’t ask or, when they do, the checks are minimal and easy to avoid. That means companies have effectively been treating all users as if they’re adults, leaving children potentially exposed to porn and other types of harmful content. Today, this starts to change,” Dawes added.Key requirements and deadlines for online services under the Online Safety Act include:All user-to-user services and search services must conduct a children's access assessment within three months (by April 16, 2025) to determine if the service or any part of it is likely to be accessed by children. Services that are likely to be accessed by children must comply with children's risk assessment duties and children's safety duties.Ofcom will publish Protection of Children Codes and children's risk assessment guidance in April 2025. Services likely to be accessed by children must conduct a children's risk assessment within three months of the guidance publication (by July 2025). Based on the risk assessment, services must implement measures to protect children, such as introducing age checks.All services that allow pornography must have highly effective age assurance processes in place by July 2025. Services that publish their own pornographic content, including certain Generative AI tools, must begin implementing robust age checks immediately.“As age checks start to roll out in the coming months, adults will start to notice a difference in how they access certain online services. Services which host their own pornography must start to introduce age checks immediately, while other user-to-user services – including social media - which allow pornography and certain other types of content harmful to children will have to follow suit by July at the latest,” Dawes added.","UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has issued guidelines requiring all websites hosting porn, or adult material, to implement “robust” age-verification checks for users in the region.

Donald Trump may have this plan to save TikTok from shutdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-may-have-this-plan-to-save-tiktok-from-shutdown/articleshow/117305802.cms,"Trump is ‘famous’ on TikTok

Donald Trump is reportedly considering an executive order to delay the TikTok ban, providing its China-based parent company Bytedance some time to negotiate a sale or find an alternative solution for the Chinese-owned app, which is likely to be banned in the US on Sunday (December 19).According to a report by The Washington Post, the President-elect is considering an executive order that would suspend enforcement of the TikTok ban-or-sale law for 60 to 90 days once he takes office.This effort, however, is legally questionable, the report added.“Trump has been mulling ways to save the day for the wildly popular video app, talking through unconventional dealmaking and legal maneuvers such as an executive order that would unravel the law passed by Congress last year with bipartisan support,” the report cited two people familiar with the deliberations as saying.The report says that Trump is keen on being seen as rescuing a platform where he is widely admired. This has led political aides and business allies to scramble for options to fulfill his campaign promise to “save TikTok,” as he has mentioned repeatedly on his TikTok account, which boasts over 14 million followers.“I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” Trump said last month. The main challenge is how to achieve this. One source mentioned that Trump is eager to be seen as “making a deal,” after he assumed office.A law signed by President Joe Biden last year requires the app’s owner, Beijing-based tech giant ByteDance, to sell the app by January 19 – just one day before Trump’s inauguration – or face an immediate ban. The Supreme Court, which considered TikTok's challenge of the law last week, is expected to allow the law to proceed but has not yet issued a ruling.","Donald Trump is reportedly considering an executive order to delay the TikTok ban.

"US expands trade blacklist; adds Zhipu AI, Sophgo, and 23 other Chinese companies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-expands-trade-blacklist-adds-zhipu-ai-sophgo-and-23-other-chinese-companies/articleshow/117283857.cms,"Image source: Reuters

What Zhipu AI and Sophogo says

What the new rules say

The US has recently added 25 Chinese companies to its restricted trade list, including Zhipu AI – a developer of artificial intelligence (AI) models, and Sophg whose chip, made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) was found illegally integrated into a Huawei AI processor . Zhipu AI, which has received investments from Alibaba and Tencent, was accused of aiding China’s military modernization through its advanced AI research.Sophgo drew attention after its chip appeared in Huawei’s Ascend 910B multi-chip AI system, raising concerns about its role in furthering Huawei’s ambitions in artificial intelligence.According to a Reuters report, the US Commerce Department also strengthened controls on the flow of chips to China to better prevent diversion to Huawei which has been on the US Entity List since 2019. The designation restricts companies from receiving US goods or technology without special approval.Zhipu AI responded by stating that the US decision lacked factual basis and would not have a significant impact on its operations, as the company claimed to have developed end-to-end AI technologies independently.Sophgo, on the other hand, denied having any direct or indirect business ties with Huawei. In a statement on its website posted after the initial allegations in October 2024, Sophgo said it ""has never been engaged in any direct or indirect business relationship with Huawei.""The new US rules introduce stricter controls on exporting advanced chips to China. Chips manufactured at 14 or 16-nanometer nodes or smaller, which are vital for AI applications, now face tighter restrictions. Additionally, the rules impose limitations on memory technologies like DRAM, which are used in high-bandwidth AI processors.As per the report, these restrictions not only affect Chinese companies but also global chipmakers like TSMC and Samsung.","The US added 25 Chinese companies to its restricted trade list, including Zhipu AI and Sophgo.

Zerodha warns how you may lose all your bank savings by giving phone to a stranger for that 'just one call',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zerodha-warns-how-you-may-lose-all-your-bank-savings-by-giving-phone-to-a-stranger-for-that-just-one-call/articleshow/117269793.cms,"

How giving phone to strangers can scam you

How to stay safe against Quick Call Trap scams

Never hand your phone to strangers

If you do, make the call yourself and put the call on speaker for them to talk

Check your phone’s setting regularly. Make sure any call forwarding is disabled

Never share OTPs with others

Zerodha , a financial services company, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to alert people about a new scam that exploits their kindness. The company shared a post explaining how scammers approach individuals, asking to borrow their phones for an emergency call. The post states, ""The 'simple act of kindness' by lending your phone might seem harmless, but it can cause serious damage.""Zerodha's message aims to raise awareness about this scam and prevent people from falling victim to it.By sharing this information on social media, the company hopes to reach a wide audience and protect them from potential financial harm.The scam relies on the goodwill of unsuspecting individuals who believe they are helping someone in need. However, by handing over their phones, they may inadvertently grant scammers access to sensitive information or enable them to carry out fraudulent activities.Zerodha's post serves as a reminder for people to remain vigilant and cautious when approached by strangers requesting to use their phones, even if the reason seems genuine. The company encourages individuals to prioritize their own security and protect their personal information.“Have you ever handed over your phone to a stranger in need of “just one call”? This simple act of kindness could cost you your entire savings. From intercepting your OTPs to draining your bank accounts, scammers can cause serious damage without you even realizing it. In this video, we explain how these scammers operate, who they target, and most importantly, how you can protect yourself,” the post says.The post also has a video explaining how these scams work, identifying the common tactics scammers use, their target demographic, and the crucial steps people can take to protect themselves from falling victim. Called the ‘ Quick Call Trap ’, the scam begins when you hand over your smartphone to a stranger for a quick call. The stranger, who requested your smartphone on the pretext of emergency, then installs a suspicious app or accesses your payments apps like GPay, Paytm to get personal information. They can also change settings on your phone to forwards your calls and messages to their number.Initially, victims may not see any signs of tampering on their phone. But once these scammers have access to your calls and messages, they intercept OTPs, passwords or your personal information to make unauthorized transactions from your bank accounts. These fraudsters may also change passwords of your banking apps or social media accounts — all without the victim realizing it.The video further warns that typical targets of these scams are those who “are less comfortable with technology”.Some of the tips are:","Zerodha, a financial services company, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to alert people about a new scam that exploits their kindness.

WazirX, India’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a $235 million hack in 2024. Earlier this week, Japan, South Korea and the US issued a joint statement, blaming North Korea and its Lazarus Group for the hack. In a latest, the Delhi High Court has sought responses from the government, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and other relevant parties, reports Economic Times.This development follows a petition calling for the creation of a special investigation team (SIT) to examine alleged cyberattacks on WazirX and address other concerns linked to its operations.The petition raises serious questions about the platform's security infrastructure and its ability to safeguard users from potential cyber threats. Along with cyberattacks, the plea also highlights broader operational issues associated with WazirX, urging the court to take a closer look at its practices.Justice Sachin Datta, while hearing the case, remarked that WazirX would be held financially responsible if the breach was due to its own fault. He emphasized that if the attack came from the dark web, the platform couldn’t simply apologize and avoid accountability.“If someone from the dark web breached your platform, you cannot say sorry...I am curious to know if the government will wash its hands off in its affidavit,” the judge said.The report further states that the RBI has informed the court that it would not regulate platforms like WazirX, a stance that Justice Sachin Datta called ""unfortunate."" The judge expressed concern, questioning, “You (RBI) may turn a blind eye to crypto, it could threaten the financial system of the country. What are you doing to regulate that”.Last week, Justice Datta issued similar notices to the RBI and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), among others, in response to a petition highlighting serious concerns about a financial crisis allegedly affecting users of the BitBNS cryptocurrency exchange. BitBNS came under scrutiny after users reported issues with frozen withdrawals, prompting a petition calling for stricter cryptocurrency regulation and an investigation into the exchange's operations.","WazirX, India's largest cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a $235 million hack in 2024.

Sanjiv Puri , Chairman and Managing Director of ITC Limited , addressed the controversy surrounding L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan ’s comments advocating for a 90-hour work week . Puri highlighted the importance of flexibility and employee empowerment , stressing that these factors are more crucial than rigidly tracking work hours.""We would rather like people to be part of the journey of the company, feel passionately involved, and feel the urge amongst themselves to contribute to the enterprise,"" he elaborated.Puri shared that ITC does not believe in imposing a specific number of work hours. Instead, the company focuses on enabling individuals to realise their potential and achieve their goals.He further highlighted ITC's commitment to a flexible work environment where employees can work from home two days a week. ""It’s more about empowering employees to actualise their potential rather than monitoring their hours,"" Puri stated.The controversy began when SN Subrahmanyan's comments about the 90-hour work week and working on Sundays went viral, sparking discussions about work-life balance nationwide.

TikTok 'refugees' move to RedNote

As TikTok ban looms in the US, users are turning to another Chinese app – Xiaohongshu also known as RedNote. However, since Shanghai-based RedNote is tailored for a Chinese audience, its default language is Mandarin. This has driven a surge of US users to Duolingo for a crash course in Mandarin.According to Duolingo, there has been a 216% increase in new US users learning Mandarin compared to last year, with a sharp spike in mid-January as RedNote gained traction.Additionally, the company reports a rise in users selecting ‘TikTok’ when asked how they heard about Duolingo in their surveys.Sharing a post on X (formerly Twitter), Duolingo wrote: “Learning Mandarin out of spite? You're not alone. We’ve seen a ~216% growth in new Chinese (Mandarin) learners in the US compared to this time last year.”“Oh so NOW you’re learning mandarin,” the company joked in another post sharing a link to a blog post explaining how to learn Chinese tones.RedNote has seen significant growth in downloads, particularly among Gen Z users. Developed by a Chinese company Xingyin Information Technology, the app has soared to the top spot in the Apple App Store in the US, signaling its growing popularity among American users.The app’s core feature revolves around music-centric content creation. It allows users to integrate licensed music tracks into their short videos while also promoting collaboration through unique features such as co-creation tools and group challenges. The app blends features from TikTok, Instagram, and Spotify, offering users a platform to create and share short-form music video clips. RedNote has become a natural option, particularly because it mirrors TikTok’s algorithm-driven content discovery while adding its own musical spin.","TikTok'refugees' move to RedNote as US ban looms.

Apple's India Success Story

Apple has achieved a significant milestone in India, breaking into the top five smartphone brands for the first time since it began selling iPhones in the country. This is particularly noteworthy given India's price-conscious market. According to a report in Economic Times, during the crucial festive season of September-December 2024, Apple secured a 9-10% market share, a historic high for the company in India, according to preliminary data from IDC and Counterpoint Research.This success is said to be partly attributed to Apple's increasing localization efforts.The company now manufactures the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max in India through Foxconn and Pegatron. Furthermore, it's expanding AirPods component production in Pune and plans to begin full AirPods manufacturing in Telangana by 2025. Apple's India-made product range, which already includes iPads and MacBooks, continues to grow, even as some iPad production shifts to Vietnam. The Indian government is actively encouraging further local iPad assembly.Apple's financial performance in India reflects this growth. In FY2023-24, net profit rose 23% to Rs 2,745.7 crore, while revenue increased by 36% to Rs 67,121.6 crore, driven by strong iPhone sales. Analysts predict continued growth in both sales and profits for the current fiscal year.In 2024, Apple shipped over 12 million iPhones in India, representing substantial year-on-year growth of 34-35% compared to the 9 million units shipped in 2023, according to preliminary data from IDC and echoed by Counterpoint Research.The overall Indian smartphone market also saw growth, with IDC estimating over 38 million units shipped in Q4 2024, a 5-6% year-on-year increase, following a strong 46 million-unit shipment in Q3 2024.","Apple broke into the top five smartphone brands for the first time since it began selling iPhones in the country.

In 1999, Bill Gates , co-founder of Microsoft and one of the most influential technologists in history, authored a book titled Business @ the Speed of Thought. The book contained 15 bold predictions that at the time seemed almost too futuristic to come true. However, as the world has advanced over the past two decades, these predictions have not only materialised but have become integral to modern life.Bill Gates’ foresight, based on emerging technologies, offers a fascinating lens into how the digital revolution was shaping up, even before many of its most transformative tools existed.One of Gates' first predictions was the development of automated price-comparison tools. He foresaw a world where consumers could effortlessly compare prices across multiple websites to find the cheapest options for products and services. Today, this prediction is a reality with platforms like Google Shopping, PriceGrabber, and Honey, which streamline the shopping experience by providing price comparisons and discounts across industries.Gates envisioned small, portable devices that would enable constant connectivity, allowing people to check news, manage finances, and perform everyday tasks. This prediction perfectly describes today’s smartphones and tablets, which have become indispensable for modern communication, commerce, and information consumption. Devices like the iPhone, introduced in 2007, revolutionized how we interact with technology and turned Gates’ vision into a universal reality.According to Gates, people would manage their finances and communicate with doctors over the internet. Platforms such as PayPal, Venmo, and Google Pay have made instant online payments a standard part of life, while telemedicine apps like Teladoc and Practo allow patients to consult with doctors remotely. These innovations have not only simplified everyday life but have also democratized access to essential services.Another prediction involved ""personal companions"" that could sync all devices and help manage schedules, purchases, and data sharing. This concept is embodied in today’s digital assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. Integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT), these assistants control smart devices, streamline home management, and adapt to users’ needs, making daily routines more efficient.Gates anticipated the use of constant video feeds for home monitoring, a feature that has gained massive popularity through smart security systems like Ring and Nest. These systems allow homeowners to monitor their properties remotely, receive real-time alerts, and maintain peace of mind, showcasing how Gates’ vision has translated into practical solutions for home security.In 1999, Gates predicted private online spaces where friends and family could interact and plan events. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp have taken this concept even further, enabling people worldwide to connect, share, and communicate in real time.Gates foresaw software capable of analyzing travel plans and providing personalized promotional offers, discounts, and activity suggestions. Today, platforms like Expedia and TripAdvisor do exactly that, using AI algorithms to tailor recommendations based on user preferences and travel history.Gates imagined services that would allow real-time discussions during live sports broadcasts. Platforms like Twitter and specialized apps like ESPN and Hotstar have made this a reality, enabling fans to engage, predict outcomes, and even interact with commentators during live events.The concept of personalized advertising, which Gates predicted, is now a cornerstone of modern marketing. Platforms like Google and Facebook use advanced algorithms and user data to deliver ads tailored to individual preferences, maximizing their relevance and impact.Gates predicted that TV broadcasts would include links to related online content. This is evident in today’s streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, where viewers can access trailers, behind-the-scenes content, and even shop for items featured in their favorite shows.The prediction that the internet would host discussions on local and global issues has come true with platforms like Reddit, Quora, and city-specific forums. These sites provide spaces for users to share opinions and collaborate on topics ranging from local politics to global challenges.Gates foresaw online communities forming based on shared interests rather than geographical proximity. Platforms like LinkedIn, Pinterest, and niche forums have enabled people to connect with others who share their hobbies, passions, and professional goals.The idea of project managers finding skilled team members online has been realized through platforms like Trello, Asana, and Jira. These tools streamline team collaboration and project execution, making them essential for modern businesses.Gates predicted that job seekers would declare their skills and preferences online to find suitable employment. Platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed have turned this prediction into reality, revolutionizing how people search for and secure jobs.The final prediction envisioned companies bidding on projects or jobs through online platforms. Websites like Upwork and Freelancer have made this process seamless, connecting businesses with freelancers and specialized service providers to complete diverse projects efficiently.","In 1999, Bill Gates authored a book titled Business @ the Speed of Thought.

Who was Suchir Balaji and why his death made headlines

The mother of Suchir Balaji , a former OpenAI programmer and whistleblower who was found dead in his San Francisco residence last year, has claimed that his son was attacked and killed. In an interview with political commentator Tucker Carlson, Balaji’s mother, Poornima Rao , claimed that he had documents against OpenAI.“So he was quoted saying that OpenAI was committing crimes and a month later he was dead,” Carlson said during an interview with Suchir Balaji’s mother.“That’s not just it,” Rao replied.“On November 18, The New York Times named my son as custodian witness.

They have attacked him and killed him,” she noted.Musk, who has been vocal against OpenAI’s transition from non-profit to for-profit organisation, has shared the video with a two word comment.“Extremely concerning,” Musk said.

His views ignited a debate within the technology sector and beyond.His mother has publicly questioned the official narrative, revealing that her son became increasingly disillusioned with OpenAI's trajectory.“The reason he joined OpenAI was his belief that AI will help humanity. When OpenAI became for-profit, his concerns began to grow,” Rao said while speaking with entrepreneur Mario Nawfal.

As President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term, a surprising trend has emerged in Silicon Valley. Several top tech CEOs, who once clashed with Trump, are now aligning themselves with his administration. According to reports, Trump expressed surprise at the sudden shift in his relationship with tech leaders, remarking during a press conference, “In my first term, it felt like everyone was against me.Now, in this term, everyone wants to be my friend. Maybe my personality has changed or something.”This shift reflects a calculated move to navigate impending regulations, including oversight on artificial intelligence, social media safeguards, and ongoing antitrust investigations targeting major tech companies like Meta, Apple, and Google.Donald Trump's second term is expected to bring legislative focus on technology, with Congress considering stricter regulations on AI, social media, and monopolistic practices. The potential for changes in these areas has spurred tech giants to recalibrate their relationships with the administration. From donating to Trump's inauguration fund to meeting him personally, tech CEOs are striving to protect their interests and influence the upcoming policies.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has undergone a significant shift in his approach to Trump. Once a vocal critic who banned Trump from Facebook after the Capitol riots, Zuckerberg is now actively engaging with the President-elect. As reported, he has dined with Trump and introduced policy changes, such as ending Meta’s third-party fact-checking program, aligning more closely with Trump’s agenda. This evolution demonstrates Zuckerberg's strategic adaptation to the political climate. Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI, has emerged as one of Trump’s most influential supporters. Despite previous differences, Musk actively campaigned for Trump during the election, contributing millions to his campaign. Musk's involvement goes beyond financial backing; he serves as an informal adviser on technology and innovation. With billions in government contracts tied to his ventures, Musk's alignment with Trump underscores his pragmatic approach to securing his companies' interests.Apple CEO Tim Cook has maintained a balanced relationship with Trump. While addressing critical issues like trade tariffs, Cook has effectively protected Apple’s global operations. His recent dinner meeting with Trump highlights his ability to maintain diplomacy and influence decisions that could impact Apple’s business. Cook’s approach exemplifies a long-term strategy to safeguard the company’s interests amidst political challenges.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has also adjusted his stance toward Trump. Despite a contentious history involving disputes over federal contracts and criticism of The Washington Post, Bezos has shown optimism for Trump’s second term. His $1 million donation to Trump’s inaugural fund and his willingness to collaborate on regulatory issues reflect his pragmatic approach to fostering a productive relationship with the administration.Google CEO Sundar Pichai and co-founder Sergey Brin have also engaged with Trump, despite ongoing antitrust challenges. The company faces potential consequences, including a breakup of its core businesses, following a landmark ruling. By meeting Trump, Pichai and Brin aim to influence regulatory decisions and navigate a complex legal landscape.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has expressed his willingness to collaborate with the Trump administration. As Nvidia plays a pivotal role in the AI boom, Huang has indicated his readiness to offer insights and support for the government’s AI initiatives. Despite concerns over trade tariffs that could impact Nvidia’s global operations, Huang has emphasized the importance of working with the administration to ensure the U.S. remains at the forefront of AI innovation.The proactive engagement of tech leaders with Trump signals a broader strategy to align business priorities with political realities. While these CEOs have faced criticism for their shifting stances, their actions highlight the importance of navigating the intersection of technology and governance. By engaging with the administration, they aim to protect their companies' growth and influence the future regulatory environment.","Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai, and other tech CEOs are courting Donald Trump.

's statement

What the advocacy group is demanding

Austrian advocacy group Noyb has filed privacy complaints against six Chinese companies, including TikTok , Shein , and Xiaomi. According to a Reuters report, the group has accused these Chinese companies of unlawfully transferring European Union (EU) user data to China. Nyob which stands for ‘None Of Your Business’ has previously filed complaints against US tech giants – Apple, Google, and Meta that resulted in multiple investigations and billions of dollars in fines.""We are aware of a complaint sent by a non-profit organisation to a national data protection authority in Europe and we are examining the allegations made therein.Respecting user privacy has always been among Xiaomi's core values, which includes transparency, accountability, user control, security, and legal compliance. Our privacy policy is developed to comply with applicable regulations such as the GDPR . By complying with local applicable laws and regulations in markets where Xiaomi operates, user data are stored and processed in compliance with local laws. In case any national data protection authority will approach Xiaomi in the future due to this complaint, we will fully cooperate with the authority to resolve the matter,"" said Xiaomi EU spokesperson in a statement to TOI Tech.As per the report, Noyb has filed six complaints across four European countries, demanding the suspension of these data transfers. They are also seeking fines that could reach up to 4% of each company’s global revenue. Naming Alibaba's AliExpress, Shein, TikTok, and Xiaomi, the group alleges that these companies send EU user data to China, while Temu and Tencent’s WeChat transfer data to unidentified third countries, likely China.Under the EU's strict privacy laws (GDPR), data transfers are only permitted if the destination country offers the same level of data protection as the EU. Noyb argues that China, being an authoritarian state with extensive surveillance, does not meet these standards.Kleanthi Sardeli, a data protection lawyer at Noyb “Given that China is an authoritarian surveillance state, it is crystal clear that China doesn't offer the same level of data protection as the EU”. ""Transferring Europeans’ personal data is clearly unlawful – and must be terminated immediately,” he added.Chinese companies, including TikTok, are under increasing scrutiny worldwide. TikTok is also facing a US ban, set to take effect on Sunday, January 19 and the European Commission is investigating its role in potential election interference, particularly during Romania's presidential elections in November.","Austrian advocacy group Noyb has filed privacy complaints against six Chinese companies, including TikTok, Shein, and Xiaomi.

What Apple and Amazon said



A UK tribunal has ruled in favour of Apple and Amazon. The court has dismissed a mass lawsuit that accused the companies of colluding to remove resellers of new Apple products from Amazon's website in the UK. The lawsuit, brought by consumer law academic Christine Riefa on behalf of nearly 36 million British consumers, alleged that the agreement between Apple and Amazon limited competition and inflated prices for consumers.However, the tribunal concluded that the agreement did not breach competition law, clearing both companies of the charges.According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Riefa's legal team claimed that Apple and Amazon struck a deal in 2018 to exclude the majority of resellers offering Apple and Beats-branded products from Amazon's UK marketplace, thereby limiting competition for those items.Apple and Amazon argued that the case, valued at £494 million ($602 million) plus interest, lacked merit and urged the Competition Appeal Tribunal to dismiss it.The tribunal determined that the case could not proceed because Riefa failed to demonstrate ""sufficient independence or robustness"" to represent the claimant class, particularly concerning third-party litigation funding.The Competition Appeal Tribunal's decision to deny certification, an initial step in such litigation, is uncommon given the relatively low threshold for certification.In a separate US lawsuit, Apple and Amazon sought dismissal but were denied in June 2023. The case highlighted that following Apple's 2018 agreement with Amazon, the number of Apple resellers on the platform plummeted by 98%, from nearly 600 to just 7.Apple also has the right to screen Authorized Apple Resellers to ensure the maintenance of high service standards.",A UK tribunal has ruled in favour of Apple and Amazon.

The iconic animated series The Simpsons has long fascinated fans for its uncanny ability to seemingly predict real-world events. From smartwatches to global political developments, the show’s creators have unintentionally earned a reputation as time-traveling prophets. Adding to this legacy is a bizarre new claim that has taken social media by storm.A viral video suggests that The Simpsons foretold a global internet outage on January 16, 2025. While many dismiss it as lighthearted entertainment, the rumor has sparked curiosity and humour online.The viral video, which claims to be from an episode of The Simpsons, suggests a complete internet shutdown coinciding with Donald Trump’s inauguration as U.S. President. The video humorously attributes this global outage to a white shark chewing through an underwater cable, blending absurdity with speculation. Adding to the inaccuracies is the claim that this event aligns with Trump’s inauguration, which is officially scheduled for January 20, 2025, rather than January 16. Despite these glaring errors, the video has captivated viewers, sparking debates, memes, and jokes across platforms.The online reaction to the supposed prediction has been overwhelmingly humourous. Social media users have shared their comedic takes, with one user joking about running out of mobile data and another commenting, “If this happens, I’ll finally get a break from work-from-home!” While the majority see the claim for what it is—a fabricated tale meant for laughs—it has undeniably entertained millions. The video has also reignited discussions about how The Simpsons continues to influence pop culture through its seemingly prescient content.While the shark-chewing-cable scenario in the video adds to the absurdity of the claim, it does touch upon a real-world issue: marine life occasionally interfering with underwater internet cables. Instances of sharks and other sea creatures damaging these cables have been documented, prompting tech companies to reinforce their infrastructure. For example, Google has taken measures to wrap its undersea cables with materials similar to Kevlar, reducing the likelihood of damage caused by marine animals. However, such incidents are highly localized and unlikely to trigger a global outage.","A viral video suggests that The Simpsons foretold a global internet outage on January 16, 2025.

Google faces first probe under UK’s new competition rules: Read company's response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-faces-first-probe-under-uks-new-competition-rules-read-companys-response/articleshow/117272858.cms,"Poll How Important Is It for Governments to Regulate Big Tech Companies? Not Very Important, Let the Market Decide Very Important, to Ensure Fair Market Practices

What Google has to say

Today, the CMA has announced that it will assess whether Google Search has “Strategic Market Status” (SMS) under the new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers regime, and what new requirements Google Search may have to follow. We look forward to engaging constructively and laying out how our services benefit UK consumers and also businesses, as well as the trade-offs inherent in any new regulations.

People across the UK trust Google Search to help them find what they need. Search also helps millions of British businesses to grow and reach customers in innovative ways. Google’s products, including Search, helped to provide an estimated £118 billion in economic activity in 2023 in the UK, supporting over a million businesses across the country. Google Search and Ads are also helping UK businesses to export over £20 billion worth of goods and services across the world.

Digital services like Search will power new economic development in the UK. Indeed, the CMA itself recognises that “Search is vital for economic growth”. We welcome the recognition of the importance of digital technologies to power growth, and the need to align regulatory decisions with the Government’s growth mission.

A pro-innovation, evidence-based regime will help UK consumers and businesses by expanding options, reducing prices, and opening new markets. The alternative of overly prescriptive digital competition rules would end up stifling choice and opportunity for consumers and businesses.

We will do our best to advocate for new rules that benefit every business and let people in the UK benefit from helpful, cutting-edge services.

The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into Google 's search services, marking the first major probe conducted under the country's newly implemented Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCC).Under the act, designed to curb anti-competitive behavior in digital markets, the CMA will assess whether Google holds “strategic market status” (SMS) under the DMCC.This designation will grant the regulator the authority to impose significant changes on Google's operations to prevent anti-competitive practices.Sarah Cardell, the CMA’s chief executive, emphasised the importance of ensuring a “level playing field” in the search market, particularly as artificial intelligence is revolutionising online search behaviour.“It’s our job to ensure people get the full benefit of choice and innovation in search services and get a fair deal — for example in how their data is collected and stored,” Cardell said.“And for businesses, whether you are a rival search engine, an advertiser or a news organisation, we want to ensure there is a level playing field for all businesses, large and small, to succeed,” she added.Google said it will do its best to advocate the new rules.

"Elon Musk committed securities fraud, claims SEC; the ‘10 days delay’ behind the lawsuit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-committed-securities-fraud-claims-sec-the-10-days-delay-behind-the-lawsuit/articleshow/117271342.cms,"Elon Musk sued by SEC

Why this '10-day delay' is significant in the case

“totally broken organisation…”, Elon Musk to SEC on complaint

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk , alleging that the billionaire committed securities fraud in 2022 by failing to disclose his growing stake in Twitter, a report has said. The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX acquired Twitter for $44 billion in late 2022, subsequently renaming it X.The SEC contends that Musk intentionally delayed disclosing his ownership stake, allowing him to acquire shares at “artificially low prices” before the market reacted to his involvement, reports CNBC.The civil complaint – filed in US District Court in Washington, D.C. – adds that prior to the acquisition, Musk amassed a significant stake in the company, which exceeded the 5% threshold that requires mandatory public disclosure within 10 days. Musk delayed this disclosure, enabling him to purchase shares at a lower price point.This delayed disclosure allowed “him to underpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his financial beneficial ownership report was due.”“On April 4, 2022, eleven days after a report was due, Musk finally publicly disclosed his beneficial ownership in a report with the SEC, disclosing that he had acquired over nine percent of Twitter’s outstanding stock. That day, Twitter’s stock price increased more than 27% over its previous day’s closing price,” the complaint says.Explaining the fraud, the SEC argues that investors would likely have bid up Twitter’s stock price had they been aware of Musk's growing interest in the company.Last month, Musk revealed that the SEC had issued a ""settlement demand,"" pressuring him to agree to a deal, including a fine, within 48 hours to avoid facing multiple charges. Meanwhile, Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, denied the allegations, labeling the lawsuit a “sham” and a result of the SEC's “multi-year campaign of harassment.”In a post on X following the lawsuit's filing, Musk denounced the SEC as a “totally broken organisation”.“Totally broken organization. They spend their time on shit like this when there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished,” he said.","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk, alleging that the billionaire committed securities fraud in 2022.

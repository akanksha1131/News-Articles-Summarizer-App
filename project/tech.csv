Trump Brags About Insane Plot to Screw Musk: Wolff | The Daily Beast Podcast

Trump claimed he leaked Musk's drug story, says Michael Wolff



“Trump speaks to them, and then they speak to other people. Whoever he calls, he says the same thing to everybody,” Wolff explained. “So you know exactly what is on his mind.”

“Actually, we dropped a dime to The New York Times… on Elon’s drug taking.”

The New York Times report: What was alleged?



Musk reportedly carried a daily “medication box” that included Adderall, a stimulant often used to treat ADHD.

Close associates and employees expressed concern about the potential impact of his drug use on corporate decision-making, especially at companies like Tesla and SpaceX.

Musk’s response: Clean drug test and public denial



Breakdown in Musk-Trump relationship: From alliance to conflict



Trump’s public jabs at Musk: Social media attacks

“He’s not even from here.”

Elon Musk’s “America Party” threat



The public clash between US President Donald Trump and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk marks a major shift in the dynamics of American political influence. Once considered potential allies—Trump as the Republican frontrunner for the 2024 presidential election and Musk as a powerful business magnate with the resources to significantly impact campaign financing—their relationship has fractured in a highly publicised and consequential manner. Recent revelations, as per The Daily Beast, have added to the fallout: according to Trump biographer Michael Wolff, Trump himself admitted to leaking damaging information about Musk’s alleged drug use to The New York Times.This development follows a wave of mutual criticism and political disagreement between the two figures. Musk has publicly condemned Republican fiscal policy decisions, particularly the recent spending bill, while Trump has taken jabs at Musk on Truth Social. What was once viewed as a strategic alliance between two influential voices on the American right has devolved into a bitter conflict filled with leaks, accusations, and political threats. The episode not only reveals deep personal tensions but also exposes broader implications for campaign finance, political realignment, and public discourse heading into the 2024 US elections.Trump’s reported role in leaking sensitive information about Musk’s alleged drug use was revealed by journalist and biographer Michael Wolff, who has written extensively about Trump’s inner circle. In interviews with multiple media outlets, Wolff stated that Trump had openly discussed Musk’s drug habits with several individuals, making no effort to conceal his intentions.According to Wolff, in one of these recurring conversations, Trump explicitly claimed responsibility for tipping off The New York Times:This statement, if accurate, confirms Trump as the primary source behind The New York Times’ May 2024 exposé that accused Musk of using multiple recreational and prescription drugs.On May 18, 2024, The New York Times published a detailed investigative report into Musk’s alleged drug use. Citing anonymous sources and internal documents, the article claimed that Musk had used ketamine, MDMA (ecstasy), and psychedelic mushrooms, and regularly took Adderall. It also stated that Musk’s ketamine use had resulted in bladder-related health complications.Additional claims included:The report triggered widespread media attention and speculation, especially given Musk’s role in leading multiple high-stakes technology companies and his increasing influence in political and cultural arenas.Musk quickly responded to the allegations with a firm denial. Two weeks after The New York Times article went live, he posted the results of a clean drug test on X (formerly Twitter), seeking to refute the claims. The test reportedly showed no traces of illicit substances.He has consistently denied any improper drug use and has not addressed Trump’s alleged involvement directly. Musk’s focus has remained on his business ventures and his political commentary, particularly related to fiscal responsibility and government overreach.The relationship between Trump and Musk has deteriorated rapidly in the months surrounding this controversy. The two once maintained a relatively cooperative rapport, with Musk even attending White House events during Trump’s presidency and being viewed as a potential high-value donor for the 2024 campaign.However, tensions began to rise after Musk’s growing criticism of Republican fiscal policies, particularly a government spending bill passed with bipartisan support. Musk labelled the bill “pork-filled” and accused lawmakers of adding trillions to the national deficit.This criticism appeared to provoke Trump, who has since taken increasingly hostile stances toward Musk. The drug use leak, if indeed initiated by Trump, may have been an act of retaliation.In the wake of Musk’s criticism, Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to publicly insult the billionaire. Notably, Trump referenced Musk’s South African origins in a veiled dig, writing:Such comments marked a shift from Trump’s earlier tone, when he occasionally praised Musk’s entrepreneurial achievements. The personal nature of the attacks signalled the complete breakdown of their relationship.In response to the spending bill and what he sees as bipartisan fiscal irresponsibility, Musk has hinted at launching a third political party, tentatively called The America Party. While still in its conceptual stages, Musk has made it clear that he’s willing to spend his fortune to support candidates who prioritise spending reform and challenge incumbents who fail to deliver on economic promises.He has also suggested funding primary challengers against lawmakers who vote in favour of deficit-increasing policies, regardless of party affiliation. This move, if realised, could significantly disrupt traditional party structures and voter alignment, especially among fiscal conservatives and younger libertarian-leaning voters.","The relationship between US President Donald Trump and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has broken down.

Indian techie Soham Parekh facing backlash over moonlighting announces he has found a full-time job,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indian-techie-soham-parekh-facing-backlash-over-moonlighting-announces-he-has-found-a-full-time-job/articleshow/122235731.cms,"Soham Parekh, a software engineer accused of secretly working for multiple startups simultaneously, has joined AI startup Darwin Studios as a founding engineer, marking a new chapter after a heated controversy in Silicon Valley. The announcement follows intense criticism over Parekh’s moonlighting, which he attributed to financial hardships. In his first public comments since the scandal broke, Parekh told TBPN, a U.S. technology show, “I’m not proud of what I did.” He admitted to juggling jobs at five companies but denied employing junior developers to manage the workload, emphasizing, “I wish I had the money.” Parekh also clarified that he began taking multiple jobs in 2022, “before the CoPilot boom,” and did not rely on AI tools to handle his tasks.The controversy erupted when Playground AI founder Suhail Doshi exposed Parekh on X, warning, “There’s a guy named Soham Parekh (in India) who works at 3-4 startups at the same time. He’s been preying on YC companies and more. Beware.” The post, referencing startup accelerator Y Combinator, led to swift consequences: Parekh was fired from multiple roles, and recruiters flagged him as a risky hire.Despite the backlash, Parekh has found a new opportunity with Darwin Studios, where he will help build Wayve, an AI-powered video remixing platform. Sanjit Juneja, the startup’s founder, praised Parekh as a “10x engineer” with “something even greater to prove than just his love for software.”The scandal has reignited debates in tech circles about the ethics of moonlighting and the pressures of startup culture. Critics have labeled Parekh’s actions fraudulent, while others argue the incident exposes deeper issues in the industry’s demand for relentless productivity and the lack of oversight in remote work. Parekh’s move to Darwin Studios signals a fresh start, but his story continues to spark discussions about trust, hustle, and accountability in the fast-paced world of tech startups.","Soham Parekh has joined AI startup Darwin Studios as a founding engineer.

"No. 1 factor that will define whether US or China wins AI race is ..., says Microsoft President Brad Smith",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/no-1-factor-that-will-define-whether-us-or-china-wins-ai-race-is-says-microsoft-president-brad-smith/articleshow/122235713.cms,"Representative Image

What Microsoft President Brad Smith told US Senate on AI race

Chna's DeepSeek vs America's OpenAI

Beijing is rapidly closing the gap on the United States in the global artificial intelligence race, sparking fears that China's advancements could fuel strategic military capabilities and amplify disinformation, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Multinational banks, universities, and tech companies across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia are increasingly adopting Chinese language models like DeepSeek, signaling a shift in AI dominance.DeepSeek’s AI model made headlines earlier this year when it triggered a massive U.S. stock sell-off, reportedly developed in less time and at a fraction of the cost of American counterparts. This cost-effectiveness, coupled with China’s open-source AI models, is drawing global adopters. Alibaba’s flagship open-source model, for instance, has spawned over 100,000 derivative models, allowing developers to customize solutions, enhancing their competitiveness.“The No. 1 factor that will define whether the U.S. or China wins this race is whose technology is most broadly adopted in the rest of the world,” Microsoft President Brad Smith told a Senate hearing last month. “Whoever gets there first will be difficult to supplant.”China’s ambitions extend beyond economics. Military journals suggest Beijing is exploring AI for strategic advancements, raising concerns about potential unrestricted AI development if cooperation with the U.S. on safety and security falters. Such a scenario could lead to unprecedented military and societal threats, experts warn.Despite U.S. restrictions on chip exports, Chinese firms have thrived, posing challenges for American tech giants like Google, Meta, and Nvidia. Nvidia alone could lose $10 billion in revenue due to restricted sales of its H20 AI chip to China, according to Jefferies. This marks a stark contrast to 2018, when U.S. investors funded 30% of the $21.9 billion Chinese AI sector, per PitchBook. U.S. companies are fighting back. OpenAI, led by CEO Sam Altman, is expanding its AI reach in Europe and Asia to maintain dominance. “We want to make sure democratic AI wins over authoritarian AI,” Altman said in May. However, China’s lower-cost models, like DeepSeek—described as 17 times cheaper yet comparable in quality by Latenode co-founder Oleg Zankov—are pressuring U.S. competitors to justify their pricing.Additionally, clients prioritizing data security are drawn to Chinese open-source models, which can operate offline, further boosting their appeal. As global adoption of Chinese AI grows, experts warn that Beijing’s bots could become a powerful tool for spreading state-influenced narratives, amplifying China’s global influence. The race for AI supremacy is intensifying, with far-reaching implications for technology, security, and global power dynamics.","Beijing is rapidly closing the gap on the United States in the global artificial intelligence race, sparking fears that China's advancements could fuel strategic military capabilities.

Soham Parekh responds to Suhail Doshi's post 'exposing' him

Soham Parekh reaches out to Suhail Doshi

An Indian software engineer, Soham Parekh , is at the center of controversy following allegations of moonlighting at multiple US startups simultaneously. The accusations surfaced when Suhail Doshi , co-founder and former CEO of Mixpanel, publicly called out Parekh on Twitter, warning startup founders about his alleged deceptive practices. Doshi claimed that Parekh, who holds a Master’s degree in computer science from Georgia Tech and a Bachelor’s from the University of Mumbai, was secretly employed at three to four startups at once, targeting Y Combinator-backed companies.Doshi revealed that Parekh briefly worked at his company, Playground AI, but was terminated within a week after his alleged duplicity was uncovered. Doshi further escalated the issue by sharing Parekh’s CV online, labeling it “probably 90 per cent fake” and listing companies such as Dynamo AI, Union AI, Synthesia, Alan AI, and Fleet AI where Parekh allegedly held concurrent roles. Doshi stated he verified his claims with over six companies before going public.In response, Parekh took to Twitter to address the allegations, defending his passion for building technology. Responding to Suhail Doshi's post, Soham Parekh wrote, ""There’s a lot being said about me right now, and most of you don’t know the full story. If there’s one thing to know about me, it’s that I love to build. That’s it. I’ve been isolated, written off, and shut out by nearly everyone I’ve known and every company I’ve worked at. But building is the only thing I’ve ever truly known, and it’s what I’ll keep doing,"" he wrote. Parekh claimed he has faced isolation and rejection from companies and peers but announced he had signed an exclusive deal as a founding engineer with a single company in the video AI space, set to launch later this month. “I’m pissed. And I’ve got something to prove,” he added.The controversy has sparked debates in the tech community about moonlighting, ethics, and transparency in the startup ecosystem. Neither Parekh nor the accused companies have released further statements, and the matter remains under scrutiny as the tech world awaits further developmentsSuhail Doshi later posted on X that Parekh reached out to him privately, asking him for advice on how to set this right. Without divulging his response, the entrepreneur simply wrote, ""Vox Populi, Vox Dei"".","Soham Parekh, an Indian software engineer, is at the center of controversy following allegations of moonlighting at multiple US startups simultaneously.

What the rules say and findings of the French agency



What Shien has to say on 40-million-euro fine



France’s antitrust agency has announced that it has fined fast-fashion giant Shein 40 million euros ($47.17 million) for alleged deceptive business practices, specifically concerning misleading discounts . The fine comes after a nearly year-long investigation into the China-founded retailer, which is one of Amazon’s biggest competitors in the US.The agency, responsible for both consumer protection and competition, stated that Infinite Style E-Commerce Co Ltd (ISEL), the entity managing sales for the Shein brand, misled customers about the authenticity of discounts, as per news agency Reuters.Under French regulations, a discount's reference price must be the lowest price offered by the retailer in the 30 days prior to the promotion. The investigation found that Shein failed to adhere to this rule, sometimes even increasing prices before applying a supposed discount, the report said.The probe, which analysed thousands of products on Shein's French website between October 1, 2022, and August 31, 2023, revealed significant discrepancies. It found that 57% of advertised deals did not, in fact, offer a lower price, 19% had less of a discount than advertised, and a surprising 11% were actually price increases.In response, Shein stated that ISEL was informed of the breaches related to reference pricing and environmental regulations in March of last year. The company claims ISEL implemented corrective actions within the subsequent two months, asserting that ""all identified issues were addressed more than a year ago"" and that ISEL is committed to complying with French regulations.","France’s antitrust agency has announced that it has fined fast-fashion giant Shein 40 million euros ($47.17 million) for alleged deceptive business practices.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence (AI), the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Huang said both AI and robotics represent what he believes a “multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity”. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said during the conference. Nvidia’s robotics division has seen fast growth in the past. Currently making up just 1% of Nvidia’s total revenue, the revenue brought in $567 million last quarter – a steep 72% rise from the previous year.“We’re working towards a day where there will be billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories that can be powered by Nvidia technology,” Huang said.Huang also emphasized a shift in how the company sees itself. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” he said, adding that Nvidia is now focused on being an “AI infrastructure” and “computing platform” provider.During the annual shareholder meeting, Huang said that Nvidia’s chips will be key not just for AI training, but also for software and hardware use in autonomous vehicles and robots. He named self-driving cars as the first major commercial use of Nvidia’s robotics technology. Nvidia’s Drive platform, a suite of chips and software for autonomous cars, is currently being used by Mercedes-Benz.The chipmaker recently introduced Cosmos, a line of AI models designed for humanoid robots.In a related news, Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company with a market cap of around $3.75 trillion. The company has rebounded strongly since a market dip earlier this year, which was caused by concerns about competition from China’s DeepSeek AI.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence, the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122088756,imgsize-19028,width-400,resizemode-4/Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Huang.jpg"

The US Embassy in India has issued a clear warning for visa applicants. “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas,” the embassy said in a post on microblogging site X (previously known as Twitter). The post reminded visa applicants to disclose all social media usernames or handles they’ve used over the past five years while filling out the DS-160 visa application form. “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form” the post read. “Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit.”The requirement is part of broader vetting procedures introduced by the US State Department in recent years. As part of the updated rules, applicants must list IDs used on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and others—even if the accounts are no longer active from the last five years.The move comes days after the US government issued a new guideline for those applying for student and exchange visitor visas. Applicable to all applicants of F, M, and J non-immigrant visas, the new rule requires these applicants to set their social media accounts to public. “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under U.S. law,"" the US embassy in India wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post.F, M and J visas are the common types of non-immigrant visas issued by the agency to foreign nationals who wish to study or participate in exchange visitor programs in the U.S. F visa is typically used by academic students, the M visa by vocational students, and the J visa by exchange visitors, including researchers, scholars, and interns.In a related news, USCIS has announced that it will switch to a new phone number for sending text (SMS) messages. “Effective July 1, 2025, USCIS will no longer send text (SMS) messages from the phone number 468-311 (GOV-311).

Not many people think twice about their passport—until they’re applying for one. Whether travelling abroad for a dream vacation, a foreign career, or an unexpected crisis, the process can be either smooth sailing or a nightmare. In the last decade, however, India's passport operations have undergone a quiet revolution in the background.On June 24, 2025, on the occasion of the observance of the 13th Passport Seva Divas, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar recognised this change. His speech wasn't merely formal. It was a straightforward assessment of how technology, governance, and public service have converged to impact actual people daily.In a social media update on X, Dr. Jaishankar expressed gratitude to passport officials, both in India and posted overseas, for what he labelled as a ""remarkable transformation"" in service delivery. He associated the program with three pillars: Seva (service), Sushasan (good governance), and Garib Kalyan (welfare). For the minister, these concepts are no longer theoretical—they're being implemented through services such as the Passport Seva Programme.The passport application process in India was all about delays, red tape, and queuing up for years. The picture has changed dramatically now. The Passport Seva Programme (PSP), initiated by the Ministry of External Affairs, has gradually revolutionised the way individuals apply for, obtain, and renew their passports.Dr. Jaishankar said the PSP is an expression of the government's overall vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"", a developed India with technology and governance aligned to better serve citizens. To say it in his own words, ""Seva, Sushasan and Garib Kalyan are three major pillars of governance that would take us to a Viksit Bharat. They are all expressed with prominence in our Passport Seva Programme.""This scheme is not limited to cities alone. It has spread its wings to Tier 3 and Tier 2 towns and districts with Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs), so that first-time applicants, migrant labourers, and students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities can avail of passport facilities without having to travel long distances.What was once seen as a long, often frustrating ordeal has now become a smoother and more accessible process. People are able to schedule appointments with ease, receive timely updates, and walk into clean, well-managed centres with helpful staff.Among the largest announcements this year is the country-wide introduction of e-Passports. They're not new passports with a new cover, they're embedded with a microchip bearing critical personal and biometric information.Here's what makes them different:The technology used is no different from that which is already common in most developed nations, bringing India's passport program to par with the best worldwide.e-Passports have several practical advantages:As per the latest updates from the Ministry of External Affairs, e-passports are issued phase-wise and in the next few years will become the norm for all new applicants.More countries are adopting digital verification systems, and e-passports are expected to further streamline international travel. Travelers will benefit from smoother immigration checks and faster processing through automated e-gates at major airports. With the government's phased rollout underway, carrying a smarter and more secure passport is set to become the new norm for Indian citizens.One of the more frustrating parts of applying for a passport has always been the police verification process. Depending on the location, this step could delay an application by weeks.In order to mitigate that, the Ministry of External Affairs launched the mPassport Police App, a mobile app now being used by the police in 25 states and Union Territories. As per the official update in the Ministry, the app has managed to decrease verification timelines to a mere 5 to 7 days in most regions.Police officers currently get electronic notifications, can upload proof of information at the scene, and transmit real-time updates to passport offices. This not only enhances speed but also avoids paperwork by hand and follow-up delays.For students, working professionals, and first-time applicants, this alone has made the whole process much more certain and less stressful.If you want to know how to obtain an e-passport, the procedure is not that different from obtaining a normal one. Here's how you do it:Following this, you will be able to follow up on your passport online until it arrives via post.","S.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other top executives sell over $1 billion in company shares: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-and-other-top-executives-sell-over-1-billion-in-company-shares-report/articleshow/122155830.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells shares

Other Nvidia executives cash in

Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year, reports Financial Times. As per the report, over $500 million of those sales took place in June alone, as the chipmaker's stock price climbed to a record high, making Nvidia the world’s most valuable company. The report highlights that Nvidia insiders are capitalizing on the market’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, which has driven massive investor interest and sent the stock price soaring.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began selling his shares last week for the first time since September 2024. The company confirmed that his sales were made under a pre-arranged trading plan set in March, which defines the prices and dates for share sales. Such plans are commonly used by executives to avoid allegations of insider trading.Ben Silverman, vice-president of research at VerityData said “When the stock [dropped] in the first quarter, he did not sell, [which was] really smart.”“[Huang] waited for the stock to return to levels that he felt more comfortable selling at,” he added.According to VerityData, his sales began after a required 90-day cooling-off period ended. Under the trading plan, Huang can sell up to 6 million shares before the end of 2025. At current stock prices, that would amount to more than $900 million. Forbes estimates his net worth at $138 billion.According to the Financial Times report, several other top Nvidia figures have also sold large portions of stock. Mark Stevens, a longtime board member and early Nvidia investor, disclosed plans to sell up to 4 million shares on June 2, currently worth around $550 million. He has already sold $288 million worth.Jay Puri, Nvidia’s executive vice-president of worldwide field operations, sold $25 million in stock last week, says FT. Board members Tench Coxe and Brooke Seawell also made sales — Coxe offloaded around $143 million on June 9, and Seawell sold about $48 million in June.These executives, all long-time members of Nvidia’s leadership team, have been with the company since its early days. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 inside a Denny’s restaurant in San Jose. Coxe and Seawell, both with venture capital backgrounds, joined the board in the late 1990s.AI boom fuels Nvidia’s stock surgeDespite recent setbacks — including U.S. export controls and advances by Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek — Nvidia’s share price has bounced back. Since hitting a low in April, the company has regained about $1.5 trillion in market value.The company’s market value is not estimated at around $3.8 trillion. The rapid growth reflects strong global demand for the company’s chips, used to power AI systems across industries and governments.","Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year.

OnePlus Nord 5 and OnePlus Nord CE 5: Unboxing and first look

Nvidia has touched a staggering market value of $3.92 trillion on Thursday (July 3), positioning itself to become the most valuable company in history. This surge is fueled by Wall Street's optimism surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). The high-end AI chipmaker pushed its market capitalisation beyond Apple’s previous record closing value of $3.915 trillion, set on December 26, 2024.According to news agency Reuters, the company's newest chips have been instrumental in training the largest AI models, driving an insatiable demand for its products.Currently, Microsoft holds the second spot with a market capitalization of $3.7 trillion, and Apple now sits in third place, with a market value of $3.19 trillion.The competition among tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Alphabet (Google) and Tesla to build advanced AI data centers and lead in emerging AI technology has directly translated into an increased demand for Nvidia's specialised chips.Nvidia, whose core technology was initially developed for video games, has seen its stock market value skyrocket nearly eight-fold over the past four years, growing from $500 billion in 2021 to nearly $4 trillion.Cirting LSEG data, the report says that Nvidia’s current valuation surpasses the combined market cap of all publicly listed companies in both Canada and Mexico, and even exceeds the total value of all publicly traded companies in the United Kingdom.Nvidia's stock has also registered a powerful rebound, climbing over 68% from its recent low on April 4. That dip occurred when Wall Street reacted to US President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. US stocks, including Nvidia, have since recovered on expectations that the White House will finalise trade deals to mitigate the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs.","N Nvidia’s market cap is more than that of all publicly listed companies in Canada and Mexico combined.

What is behind Intel's shift to 14A process

Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant overhaul of the company's contract manufacturing, or ""foundry,"" business, potentially abandoning efforts to market its 18A chipmaking technology to external customers, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. According to the Reuters' report, the move, a departure from former CEO Pat Gelsinger's strategy, could involve a costly write-off for the struggling U.S. chipmaker. Since taking over in March, Tan has moved swiftly to cut costs and chart a new course for Intel, which reported a $18.8 billion net loss in 2024, its first unprofitable year since 1986.According to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Tan has expressed concerns that the 18A process, a cornerstone of Gelsinger’s plan, is losing appeal to new clients. Discontinuing external sales of 18A and its variant 18A-P, which cost billions to develop, could result in a write-off of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars, one source said. Intel declined to comment on ""hypothetical scenarios or market speculation,"" stating that its primary customer for 18A is Intel itself, with plans to ramp up production of its ""Panther Lake"" laptop chips in late 2025, which it called the most advanced processors ever designed and manufactured in the U.S.Instead of focusing on 18A, Tan is directing resources toward Intel’s next-generation 14A process, which he believes could give Intel an edge over rival TSMC, the sources said. The shift aims to attract major clients like Apple and Nvidia, who currently rely on TSMC. Tan has tasked Intel’s leadership with presenting options to the board as early as this month, though a final decision on 18A may not come until a later meeting this autumn, one source added. Intel reiterated its commitment to strengthening its roadmap and rebuilding customer trust. ""Lip-Bu and the executive team are committed to improving our financial position for the future,"" the company said in a statement. Despite the potential pivot, Intel will honor existing 18A commitments, including producing chips for Amazon and Microsoft, whose deadlines make switching to 14A impractical, the sources said. Amazon and Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The 18A process, which includes advanced energy delivery and transistor technology, was intended to rival TSMC’s capabilities. However, analysts told Reuters that 18A is comparable to TSMC’s N3 process, which entered high-volume production in 2022, while TSMC’s N2 technology is on track, highlighting Intel’s challenges as it lags in the foundry race.Tan’s broader strategy includes streamlining Intel’s operations and bolstering engineering talent. Shifting focus to 14A could be one of his boldest moves yet as he seeks to restore Intel’s manufacturing leadership, which has waned in the mobile computing and AI eras. Whether Intel can deliver 14A in time to secure major contracts remains uncertain, one source noted, adding that sticking with 18A remains an option.","Intel may abandon efforts to market its 18A chipmaking technology to external customers. The move, a departure from former CEO Pat Gelsinger's strategy, could involve a costly write-off for the struggling U.S. chipmaker. The shift aims to attract major clients like Apple and Nvidia, who currently rely on TSMC.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122229988,imgsize-23460,width-400,resizemode-4/Intel-CEO-Lip-Bu-Tan-may-be-planning-this-big-change-in-companys-chip-manufacturing-business.jpg"

The electric vehicle company delivered 384,122 vehicles in the second quarter of 2025, exceeding some market expectations and sparking optimism among investors and analysts. The delivery numbers, which were higher than the estimated 365,000 “whisper number,” led Ives to maintain a positive outlook on the EV giant.

He also retained an 'Outperform' rating.Ives also pointed to signs of recovery in Tesla’s Chinese market, which had been struggling. He said “We saw a rebound in June with sales increasing for the first time in eight months reflecting higher demand for its updated Model Y”, highlighting renewed consumer interest in the region.The analyst said that Musk’s proactiveness helped in Tesla’s growth. Adding further, Ives said that “If Musk continues to lead and remain in the driver's seat, we believe Tesla is on a path to an accelerated growth path over the coming years with deliveries expected to ramp in the back-half of 2025 following the Model Y refresh cycle”.Stating that the EV maker has the potential to ""own the autonomous market"" in the US, he said that Musk must put Tesla ahead of his political views.The tech billionaire’s feud with President Trump escalated after Musk publicly criticised “One Big Beautiful Bill”, stating that if the senate passes the spending bill, “the America Party will be formed the next day.” Trump responded with a DOGE warning, stating Musk’s companies have benefited most from the subsidy.","Tesla delivered 384,122 vehicles in the second quarter of 2025, exceeding some market expectations.

Mark Zuckerberg’s Oval Office visit sparks security concerns

The White House Response: “He was not asked to leave”



Zuckerberg controversy sparks review of White House security norms



Public backlash and trust issues



An incident involving Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the Trump White House has drawn renewed public attention amid ongoing concerns about Big Tech’s proximity to political power. In early 2025, reports surfaced claiming that Zuckerberg was asked to leave the Oval Office after entering an official meeting concerning the F-47 stealth fighter jet. The original story, first published by NBC News and based on anonymous sources, painted a picture of a surprising and potentially inappropriate entry into a high-security discussion. However, the White House has since publicly disputed the account, stating that Zuckerberg was not asked to leave but briefly entered at the President’s request before exiting to await a scheduled meeting.This conflicting narrative has not only raised questions about Oval Office security protocols under President Donald Trump ’s leadership but also intensified scrutiny of Zuckerberg’s relationship with the Trump administration. With Meta making several decisions perceived as aligning with conservative interests, the incident adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing debate about the political influence of technology executives.NBC News reported in early July 2025 that Mark Zuckerberg unexpectedly entered the Oval Office during a meeting focused on the US Air Force’s F-47 stealth fighter jet. According to two unnamed individuals familiar with the meeting, the Meta CEO’s entry caused immediate concern among senior military officials, given the sensitive nature of the discussion and Zuckerberg’s apparent lack of appropriate security clearance.The sources stated that White House staff requested Zuckerberg step outside, citing the confidential status of the discussion taking place between President Trump and military leaders. One individual present reportedly described the moment as “bizarro world,” highlighting the informal and, at times, unpredictable atmosphere within the Trump-era White House.No official documentation has emerged verifying the specific timing or agenda of the meeting. However, the suggestion that a civilian tech executive could gain access to a classified military meeting—deliberately or otherwise—has fueled wider debate around visitor protocols and national security practices in the Oval Office.Following widespread media coverage, a senior White House official issued a public statement rejecting NBC’s version of events. According to this source, Zuckerberg was not asked to leave the meeting but merely “popped in to say hello at the president’s request” before stepping out to wait for his scheduled appointment with Trump. The official noted that Zuckerberg’s meeting with the President was prearranged and set to occur immediately after the session with military personnel and pilots had concluded.This version directly contradicts the implication that Zuckerberg’s presence caused alarm or disruption. The White House has emphasised that the characterisation of the event as a security breach or accidental intrusion was inaccurate and misleading.Meta has declined to comment on the matter, providing no confirmation or denial of either narrative.Regardless of which account is accurate, the incident has reignited interest in the management style of the Trump White House. According to insiders and past reporting, the Oval Office during Trump’s presidency has been known for its fast-paced, unstructured environment. Aides, cabinet members, and advisers frequently moved in and out of meetings without rigid schedules, a dynamic President Trump reportedly referred to as “Grand Central Terminal.”The F-47 meeting, in this context, serves as a case study in the potential challenges such informality presents, especially when sensitive defence matters are involved. Critics argue that unregulated access to classified discussions increases the risk of information leaks or inadvertent breaches, while supporters of the administration view it as a reflection of Trump's unorthodox but decisive leadership style.Beyond the event itself, Zuckerberg’s presence at the White House underscores a broader transformation in his political strategy. Historically associated with liberal causes and Democratic fundraising, Zuckerberg has in recent years made visible efforts to build stronger ties with conservative factions and the Trump movement.In January 2025, Zuckerberg was seen attending President Trump’s inauguration, seated alongside other major tech executives. Observers noted the symbolism of his placement, suggesting it signalled a closer working relationship with the new administration.Meta’s corporate decisions under Zuckerberg have mirrored this shift. The company halted its third-party fact-checking program, which had drawn criticism from conservative commentators and politicians who claimed it suppressed right-leaning content. In addition, Meta appointed Dana White, President of the UFC and a close Trump associate, to its board of directors.Reports also indicate that Meta contributed $1 million to Trump’s 2025 inaugural fund, marking the first time the company has made such a political donation. These moves, taken collectively, have led many to conclude that Zuckerberg is recalibrating Meta’s public posture to better align with Republican leadership.Despite these efforts, Zuckerberg continues to face scepticism from both sides of the political spectrum. A poll conducted by the Tech Oversight Project and Public Policy Polling found that 63% of Trump voters held an unfavourable view of the Meta CEO, making him the least popular Big Tech executive among that demographic.Critics argue that his political repositioning appears calculated rather than genuine, while advocates suggest it reflects a pragmatic shift to maintain influence under a new administration. The polling data indicates that, regardless of intent, Zuckerberg’s outreach efforts have yet to meaningfully improve his standing with conservative voters.","In early 2025, reports surfaced claiming that Mark Zuckerberg was asked to leave the Oval Office after entering an official meeting concerning the F-47 stealth fighter jet.

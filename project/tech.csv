How TikTok-parent company plans to become ‘one of the world's biggest consumers’ of Nvidia’s AI chips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-tiktok-parent-company-plans-to-become-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-consumers-of-nvidias-ai-chips/articleshow/116814528.cms,"Representative photo

Why this is significant

Despite US implemented measures to limit the sale of high-performance AI chips to Chinese companies, ByteDance , the Chinese tech giant behind TikTok , is reportedly doubling down on its AI ambitions. The company plans to become one of the world's biggest consumers of such hardware and centre to its plan is its reliance on Nvidia chips.Citing a person who has been involved in the plan, a report by The Information says claims that ByteDance plans to spend a staggering $7 billion on Nvidia's cutting-edge AI chips in 2025.“The Chinese owner of TikTok recently told suppliers it planned to spend up to $7 billion to access Nvidia chips outside China in 2025,” the report said.“The effort, led by co-founder Zhang Yiming, would make ByteDance one of the world's biggest consumers of such hardware,” the report added.There have been reports which claim that Chinese companies get access to advanced technology such as Nvidia’s sophisticated AI chips by circumventing restrictions by procuring the chips through channels outside of China.Reports have suggested that the Chinese companies are either creating new entities to bypass restrictions or are training their models outside China.Recent reports, however, claimed that that four major Chinese industry associations have urged domestic firms to exercise caution when purchasing US-made chips, citing concerns about reliability and security. This development could significantly impact American chipmakers such as Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, which have maintained a presence in the Chinese market despite stringent export restrictions.The move came in direct response to the latest round of US export controls on advanced semiconductor technology to China announced earlier this month. The US government has been steadily tightening restrictions on chip shipments to China, aiming to curb the country's technological advancement, particularly in artificial intelligence and military applications."," ByteDance plans to spend $7 billion on Nvidia's cutting-edge AI chips in 2025.

The rapid expansion of deepfake content



Legal and ethical challenges



Global efforts to counter deepfake abuse

As advancements in artificial intelligence continue to reshape digital landscapes, a troubling trend has emerged: the creation and dissemination of sexually explicit deepfake images. A recent survey conducted by The Yomiuri Shimbun revealed that Japan ranks third globally in traffic to websites enabling the creation of such content. Over the course of a year, these platforms received over 18 million visits from Japan alone, trailing only the United States and India. The growing prevalence of explicit deepfake content has raised significant ethical and legal concerns, prompting calls for urgent action.The survey, conducted in collaboration with digital analytics firm Similarweb Ltd., analyzed traffic data from December 2023 to November 2024. The findings identified 41 websites that allow users to produce sexually explicit deepfake images by uploading photographs of individuals. These platforms, many of which launched in 2024, saw a surge in popularity alongside increased accessibility to generative AI technology.The global distribution of traffic to these sites highlights the scale of the issue:In Japan, an estimated 410,000 users accessed these sites monthly, with approximately 80% doing so via smartphones. Instructions for creating deepfake content were predominantly available in English, Russian, and Japanese, underscoring the international reach and accessibility of such platforms.The proliferation of deepfake technology has coincided with a sharp increase in explicit content creation. According to U.S.-based cybersecurity firm Security Hero, 95,820 deepfake videos were detected online in 2023, a figure five and a half times higher than in 2019. Alarmingly, 98% of these videos were of a sexually explicit nature.The creation and sharing of such content have profound implications, particularly for victims whose images are manipulated without consent. Social media platforms often serve as the primary channels for distributing deepfake content, compounding the harm by amplifying its reach.While deepfake technology is not inherently malicious, its misuse has sparked widespread concern. Experts argue that existing laws in many countries are ill-equipped to address the complexities of AI-generated content. In Japan, for instance, there are no specific legal provisions targeting the creation or distribution of deepfake pornography.Ichiro Sato, a professor at the National Institute of Informatics, has emphasised the urgent need for legislative reform. “Laws tailored to address deepfake technology must be introduced to protect individuals from exploitation,” Sato stated. He also highlighted the importance of promoting information literacy to equip people with the knowledge to recognize and combat deepfake content.Several nations have already taken steps to address the challenges posed by deepfake technology. In the United States, multiple states have enacted laws criminalizing the creation and distribution of non-consensual deepfake pornography . The European Union has also proposed regulations to hold AI developers accountable for the ethical use of their technologies.Japan’s position as a major user of deepfake platforms underscores the necessity for similar measures. Beyond legislation, public awareness campaigns and educational initiatives are critical to fostering a culture of digital responsibility.","Japan ranks third globally in traffic to websites enabling the creation of such content.

""Indians are also being laid off and honestly, the real problem… is the illegal immigration. That’s what the government needs to cut down on. The numbers are just an order of magnitude higher there, and even in legal immigration, the problem is actually that the sectors in which people are getting laid off are not necessarily the ones that the Indian H-1B applications are coming. People getting laid off are not necessarily all engineers. If people actually took a look at the data and saw it for themselves, they wouldn't be this angry,""

H-1B visa debate that has divided

Aravind Srinivas met PM Narendra Modi

A debate regarding Indian immigrants and H-1B visas is raging in the US. Tesla CEO Elon Musk who played a key role in the election campaign of the US President-elect Donald Trump is a strong supporter of H-1B visas. Musk, who along with Indian-American tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has been tapped by Trump to lead his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), argued last week that foreign workers are needed for tech companies like Musk's SpaceX and Tesla.Talking on the issue, Aravind Srinivas , founder of Perplexity AI , told Economic Times that those opposing these visas miss a major point. Srinivas argues that the focus on H-1B visas is misplaced and unsupported by data, emphasizing illegal immigration as the more pressing issue. For those unaware, Srinivas, has worked at DeepMind, Google, and OpenAI, founded Perplexity AI, valued at $9 billion.Srinivas stated in an interview. He pointed out that Indians are also affected by layoffs and that the government should prioritize addressing illegal immigration.he added.This fierce H-1B visa debate is said to have divided Trump's supporters into two factions: One side supports H-1B visas, while the other opposes them. Figures like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have expressed support for H-1B visas, while others have criticized this stance.Srinivas also defended Sriram Krishnan, the political figure's pick for AI policy advisor, against criticism related to Krishnan's past support of H-1B visas and immigration. Srinivas believes the criticism is unfair and expects the controversy to subside once people examine the data. He praised Krishnan's qualifications and urged people to avoid misinterpreting his previous statements.Last week, Aravind Srinivas also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In a post on Twitter, Srinivas wrote, ""Had the honour to meet Prime Minister @narendramodi ji. We had a great conversation about the potential for AI adoption in India and across the world. Really inspired by Modi Ji's dedication to staying updated on the topic and his remarkable vision for the future.""Responding to the post, Prime Minister Modi said, ""It was great to meet you and discuss AI, its uses and its evolution. Good to see you doing great work with @perplexity_ai. Wish you all the best for your future endeavours.""","Aravind Srinivas, founder of Perplexity AI, says focus on H-1B visas is misplaced and unsupported by data.

What Atos said about the ransomware attack



“On December 28, 2024, the Space Bears ransomware group claimed to have compromised an Atos database. At this stage, the initial analysis shows no evidence of any compromise or ransomware affecting any Atos/Eviden systems in any country, and no ransom demand has been received to-date. Nevertheless, Atos takes such allegations very seriously. Its cybersecurity team is actively investigating the situation and updates will be provided if there is any change to the information above.”

How dangerous is the ransomware group



French tech major Atos SE is reportedly been targeted by a ransomware attack . The company has confirmed that it is currently investigating claims by ransomware group Space Bears that announced compromising one of Atos’s databases. In these attacks, cybercriminals encrypt the victim's data until a ransom is paid. As one of the biggest IT companies in France , Atos specialises in cybersecurity, cloud computing , and digital transformation . The company also said that it is taking these claims made by the cybercrime group seriously and its cybersecurity team is actively investigating the situation. Atos has also promised to share the updates publicly if the situation changes.In an official statement, the company said:For the unknown, Space Bears is a ransomware group that surfaced in early 2024.According to a report by TechRadar, the group has already launched attacks on multiple victims worldwide, including the Canadian software development firm Haylem and its affiliates, Un Museau Vaut Mille Mots and Lexibar.At that time, the attackers claimed to have accessed sensitive database information, including details about employees and clients.Earlier this month, the group also expanded its operations by targeting Canada’s JRT Automatisation and India’s Aptus, the report added.","French tech major Atos SE is reportedly been targeted by a ransomware attack.

Here’s what Suchir Balaji's mother wrote

Update on @suchirbalaji

We hired private investigator and did second autopsy to throw light on cause of death. Private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.

Suchir’s apartment was ransacked , sign of struggle in the bathroom and looks like some one hit him in bathroom based on blood spots.

It’s a cold blooded mu*d*r declared by authorities as suicide.

Lobbying in SF city doesn’t stop us from getting justices.

We demand FBi investigation

@elonmusk @VivekGRamaswamy @GavinNewsom @MEA

The mother of Suchir Balaji , a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI , is requesting help from Elon Musk following her son's death. Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month. His mother posted on social media, tagging Musk and asking for an FBI investigation . Police stated, “no evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation”. However, the San Francisco Chief Medical Examiner's Office determined Balaji's death a suicide. Balaji worked at OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT .In her post, Balaji’s mother - Poornima Rao expressed her worries and stated that “private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.” She called for intervention from US authorities, stating that an FBI investigation is necessary to address the matter. Other than Elon Musk, she tagged American biotech entrepreneur and politician Vivek Ramaswamy and Gavin Newsom – Governor of California.The post has since gained attention, sparking a wave of responses on social media. It caught Musk’s attention as well who replied saying “This doesn’t seem like a suicide”.Suchir Balaji's mother further pleads saying “@elonmusk please support us”.In an interview with Business Insider last week, Rao revealed that Balaji had grown increasingly disillusioned with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly OpenAI’s shift toward commercialization with ChatGPT. She said, “He felt AI is a harm to humanity,” describing how her son, Suchir Balaji, transitioned from boundless optimism about AI’s potential to profound skepticism. Reflecting on his tragic death, she added, “It doesn’t look like a normal situation.”","Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month.

NPCI issues an advisory about 'online scams' that Indians are losing crores to,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/npci-warns-phonepe-gpay-and-other-upi-users-about-scam-that-indians-are-losing-crores-to/articleshow/116352174.cms,"What NPCI advisory says

What is digital arrest scam



How to identify a digital arrest scam

Unexpected Contact from ‘Officials’: Be cautious if someone claims to be from government agencies like the police, CBI, income tax officers, or customs agents, contacts you. Be cautious especially if they claim urgent legal action is being initiated or warranted. They might allege that you or one of your family members is involved in a serious crime like money laundering, tax evasion, or drug trafficking.

Fear-based language and urgency: Scammers may request video calls, disguising themselves in police uniforms, using government logos, or creating official-sounding background noise to appear legitimate. They often threaten arrest or immediate legal action, demanding a quick response and using legal terms to sound convincing. In some cases, they create a police station-like set up to further convince victims of their credibility.

Request for sensitive information or payment: Scammers may ask for personal information or demand large sums of money, promising that this will clear up your involvement in the alleged crime. They may also coerce you to transfer money to their account until the investigation is complete. Terms like “clearing your name”, “assisting with the investigation”, or “refundable security deposit/escrow account” might be used by them to persuade you into transferring money to specified bank accounts or UPI IDs.

Tips to stay safe

Pause and Verify: If you receive unexpected calls or messages about legal issues, take a moment to verify. Stay calm, as scammers rely on fear and urgency. Real government and law enforcement agencies will never ask for money or investigate cases through phone or video calls. Always confirm the caller’s identity and consult trusted sources before taking any action.

Use Support Channels: Report suspicious numbers to the national cybercrime helpline by dialing 1930 or the Department of Telecommunication (https://sancharsaathi.gov.in/sfc/).

The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country. As digital payments, including UPI, gain widespread adoption, incidents of online scams have risen significantly. Indians, as mentioned by PM Modi in one of the episodes of Mann ki Baat have lost Rs 120.3 crore through digital arrest scam s. In its advisory, the NPCI highlights the critical need for awareness and vigilance to protect against such fraudulent activities as India advances towards a digital-first economy.In a press release, NPCI says “Digital payments are now accessible nationwide, driving India towards a digital-first economy. They offer both security and convenience. However, it's crucial to use digital payments safely and avoid online scams. Early identification of potential scams helps protect you and your loved ones, fostering a safer, less-cash economy, for everyone.”The 'Digital Arrest' scam is a type of online fraud where cybercriminals trick individuals into believing they are under investigation or at risk of arrest by law enforcement or financial authorities. Scammers often impersonate government officials, police officers, or financial regulators and use fear tactics to manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information or transferring money. Some of the common tactics used in the scam include fake calls or messages, threat of arrest and demand for payment.As per NPCI, you can identify a digital arrest scam by keeping an eye for the following","The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

Cybersecurity firm Cyberhaven revealed that the malicious extensions were designed to steal sensitive information like access tokens, user IDs, account details, and cookies. This puts Facebook Ads users at serious risk of data theft and account hacking.In a blog post, Cyberhaven reported that its own Chrome extension was hacked on December 24 in an attack aimed at social media advertising and AI platform logins. Other extensions, such as ParrotTalks, Uvoice, and VPNCity, were also impacted starting in mid-December, according to Jaime Blasco from Nudge Security, as reported by Reuters.The breach was first detected on December 25, and researchers quickly removed the harmful version of the extension within an hour.“On December 24, a phishing attack compromised a Cyberhaven employee's credentials to the Google Chrome Web Store.

Only version 24.10.4 of the Cyberhaven Chrome extension was affected, and the malicious code was active from 1:32 AM UTC on December 25 to 2:50 AM UTC on December 26. Chrome browsers that auto-updated the extension during this time were impacted.The company clarified, ""Our investigation found that no other Cyberhaven systems were compromised.""

Taiwanese supplier Foxconn that assembles iPhones for Apple , has completed a $230 million project to build dormitories for its workers in Tamil Nadu . As per an Economic Times report, an audit is currently underway to ensure the facility is ready for use. Foxconn employs over 41,000 people in its Chennai facilities, of which 35,000 are women. This new housing project is expected to significantly improve their convenience and quality of life.Citing unnamed sources, the report says that the dormitories are located within Foxconn's premises in Sriperumbudur. It will allow a large number of its female workforce to live close to their workplace. “Workers won’t need to commute by bus anymore—they can simply walk to their dorms,” said a source familiar with the project.“This is Foxconn's first investment to build dormitories for its workers in India,” one of the persons cited above said. “It is ready, and workers should be moving in soon.

It can accommodate up to 18,000 workers. The company has added special facilities like areas for cricket, badminton, basketball, and volleyball, as well as a canteen providing subsidized meals. A small grocery store will also be available for daily needs, the report says.In addition to the dorms built by Foxconn, Tamil Nadu inaugurated another industrial housing project in August this year to accommodate 18,720 women employees of Foxconn.

Two of the largest telecom companies in the US, AT&T and Verizon , have acknowledged they were targeted by the Chinese-linked Salt Typhoon cyberespionage operation, but assured customers that their US networks are now secure after working with law enforcement and government officials.According to a report by news agency Reuters, both the companies said that the hackers gained access to their systems. While AT&T stated that the attack focused on a “small number of individuals of foreign intelligence interest”, Verizon said that an independent cybersecurity firm has confirmed the containment.Both AT&T and Verizon claim to have secured their networks.“We detect no activity by nation-state actors in our networks at this time.

Spotify is once again facing scrutiny over adult content slipping through its moderation filters and appearing in search results on the app. As per a report, a search for rapper M.I.A. yielded a pornographic video among the suggested results.A Reddit user exposed the issue by sharing a screenshot of the search results, The Verge reported, adding that it is unable to replicate the original finding but uncovered other sexually explicit videos hidden within the “Video” tab of Spotify's search results.These videos, often uploaded by accounts with generic or nonsensical names on the popular music streaming service, appear to exploit a loophole in Spotify's podcast moderation system.Spotify spokesperson Laura Batey told The Verge that the reported videos have been removed for violating the platform's policies, which explicitly prohibit sexually explicit material. However, an explanation for how these videos bypassed their moderation process has purportedly not been addressed.This latest incident highlights an ongoing problem for Spotify. Users have previously reported encountering explicit content in search results, algorithmic playlists, and even disguised as erotic audio tracks. In 2022, Vice also documented the prevalence of sexually explicit audio and graphic images on the platform.Recently, a report revealed that the platform is being exploited to spread malware, pirated software, and spam through playlists and podcasts. Security researchers discovered that malicious actors have been using playlist and podcast descriptions to distribute links to harmful websites and illicit content.These malicious actors are exploiting Spotify's search engine optimisation (SEO) to reach a wider audience. Even if Spotify blocks certain keywords on its platform, searching for those keywords on Google can still lead users to malicious links hosted within Spotify playlists and podcasts.Furthermore, spammers are using misleading tactics to attract unsuspecting users. They often employ irrelevant audio content and titles related to trending topics, like TikTok or adult content, to increase visibility in search results.","A search for rapper M.I.A. yielded a pornographic video among the suggested results.

Apple looking to partner with Broadcom to design AI chip

While Apple has joined the ranks of tech giants integrating AI features into its devices, the company is quietly pursuing a strategy to reduce its reliance on Nvidia, the dominant provider of GPUs crucial for AI development, a report has said. Despite currently depending on the chipmaker's technology, like many others in the industry, Apple is taking steps to lessen its dependence on Nvidia because of an 'allergy'.According to a report by The Information, unlike other tech giants who are buying up Nvidia's GPUs in bulk, Apple is primarily renting access to them through cloud providers.“Instead of buying boatloads of Nvidia chips as its tech peers do, the iPhone maker mostly rents access to them from cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft. In some cases-for example, to train its biggest models-Apple has rented Al chips designed in-house by Google rather than Nvidia,” the report said.Apple’s move to break free from Nvidia appears to be rooted in both financial considerations and Apple's desire for technological autonomy in its products, the report said.“Apple's Nvidia allergy appears to stem partly from its frugality and a desire to own and control the key technological ingredients for its products to avoid giving others leverage over its operations,” it added.“But leaders within Apple have also quietly nursed grudges against Nvidia for nearly two decades, stemming from business disputes that originated during the era when Steve Jobs was Apple's CEO,” the report noted, citing 10 former Apple and Nvidia employees with direct knowledge of the relationship.The report says that the most significant development in Apple's quest for independence is a partnership with Broadcom to develop its own AI server chip .“And in its boldest move yet to avoid relying on Nvidia, Apple is working with Broadcom to design an Al server chip expected to be ready for mass production by 2026,” it added.The chip's networking technology is said to be crucial for Al processing. If Apple succeeds with the Al chip, internally code-named Baltra, it would mark a significant milestone for the company's silicon team, the publication said.","Apple looking to partner with Broadcom to design AI chip, report says.

The feature, called ""Enhanced Visual Search,"" enables landmark identification but requires data sharing with Apple's servers.Users checking their iPhone 15 Pro and other iOS devices are finding the setting automatically enabled in their Photos app settings. The feature, which can be accessed through iOS Settings or Mac's Photos app settings, allows users to identify landmarks in their photos and search for images using landmark names.While the feature appears to be an extension of the Visual Look Up capability introduced in iOS 15, it differs significantly in its data-sharing requirements. Unlike Visual Look Up, which operates entirely on-device, Enhanced Visual Search sends encrypted ""vector embeddings"" - numerical representations of image characteristics - to Apple's servers for landmark matching.According to Apple's machine learning research blog, the process begins with an on-device analysis to detect ""regions of interest"" that might contain landmarks. When detected, these regions are converted into vector embeddings before being encrypted and sent to Apple for comparison against their global landmark database.Despite Apple's implementation of privacy measures, including data encryption and condensed image formatting, the default activation of this data-sharing feature has sparked concerns. The company's approach contrasts with its handling of other data collection features, such as Siri interactions and analytics, which typically require explicit user opt-in.Apple has not yet responded to requests for comment about these privacy concerns. Users can manually disable the feature by navigating to the Photos settings in their iOS Settings app or Mac Photos app settings menu.","iPhone's Photos app is automatically sharing users' photo data with Apple.

Canadian musician Grimes, born Claire Elise Boucher, has addressed her past relationship with tech mogul Elon Musk , responding to allegations made by rapper Azealia Banks . On December 26, Banks reignited their longstanding feud, accusing Grimes of holding onto old grievances while asserting that Musk had been in control of their past relationship. Grimes countered these claims, stating that she ended the relationship and expressing contentment with her life and children. Meanwhile, the singer also made headlines for speaking out against anti-Indian racism in the United States, referencing her personal connection to Indian culture.Banks, known for her fiery social media presence, posted a series of tweets on X (formerly Twitter), accusing Grimes of portraying herself as a victim and clinging to their 2018 feud. Banks compared their dynamic to rival witches from Wicked, mocked Grimes’ artistry, and alleged that Elon Musk was the dominant force in their relationship.“Girl, the way u are still trying to hold out on some weird ass innocent bullshit years later after u got dumped, cheated on, [and] ur kids kidnapped… is PEAK white female delusion,” Banks wrote in her tirade.This feud stems from a 2018 incident when Banks claimed she had been invited to Musk's home to collaborate with Grimes, only to find herself caught in what she described as a bizarre situation.In response, Grimes dismissed Banks’ accusations, clarifying that she was not ""dumped"" by Musk and had chosen to end their relationship. ""I didn’t ‘get dumped.’ I bounced,"" she wrote. Grimes expressed gratitude for her current life, stating, “My amazing baby is asleep in my bed beside me, I'm in love. No regrets. Life is as beautiful as u want it to be.”Grimes and Musk, who were together for four years before splitting in 2022, have faced public scrutiny regarding their relationship and custody disputes over their three children.In a separate conversation on X, Grimes condemned the rising racism against Indian immigrants in the United States. Her comments came amidst growing calls from far-right activists, such as Laura Loomer, to ban H-1B visas and racially target Indian professionals.“Suddenly concocting anti-Indian energy out of nowhere is embarrassing y’all. Also, they were clear they planned to do this,” Grimes wrote. She further shared her personal connection to Indian culture, highlighting that her stepfather, Ravi Sidhoo, is of Indian origin. “I had a fire childhood in a half-Indian household. Indian culture jives very well with Western culture,” she added.When a user questioned whether India would welcome an influx of American culture, Grimes replied, “We already did this to them. It has caused a ton of problems for them,” acknowledging the impact of Western influence on Indian traditions.Grimes and Musk, though no longer together, continue to attract attention for their individual ventures and public statements. Musk’s political activities, particularly during Donald Trump’s second term as U.S. president, have made him a prominent figure in global discourse. Grimes, on the other hand, has used her platform to advocate for social issues, including equity and inclusivity in technology and immigration policies.","Canadian musician Grimes responded to allegations made by rapper Azealia Banks.

""Talent migration from Korea and Taiwan peaked in the 1970s and 80s, while Chinese migration peaked about a decade ago – all during periods of transformative growth in these nations,"" Vembu noted. He pointed to Silicon Valley 's shifting demographics, where Indian migrants now outnumber those from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, as evidence of this pattern.Vembu explained that migration patterns follow a predictable curve: very low during extreme underdevelopment, peaking during rapid growth, and declining again as nations achieve prosperity. He attributed this phenomenon to rising aspirational levels that precede and drive economic development.""Our aspirations necessarily race ahead of reality, and it is precisely during the period of rapid growth that we have the most restless people,"" Vembu explained, connecting this restlessness to the current atmosphere in India's urban tech centers.While advocating for domestic talent retention to build India's technological capabilities, Vembu predicted that Indians might continue to underestimate their nation's progress even as late as 2035, when per capita GDP could exceed $10,000. He drew parallels to Japan's and Korea's historical experiences, where citizens remained skeptical of their nations' advancement even after achieving parity with Western economies.The CEO's comments came amid broader discussions about Indian immigration and talent retention . Earlier, Vembu had questioned whether pursuing GDP rankings and technological leadership through imported talent was worth ""leaving your own people behind,"" while acknowledging America's successful strategy of attracting global talent.","Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu argues that peak talent migration typically coincides with periods of rapid national development.

Impact on manufacturers

Consumer benefits

Future outlook

Starting December 28, 2024, the European Union has implemented a new regulation mandating USB-C as the universal charging standard for all new electronic devices. This directive, known as the Common Charger Directive , aims to reduce electronic waste, simplify charging for consumers, and promote environmental sustainability.Tech companies, including Apple, have had to adjust their designs to meet these new standards. Apple has discontinued the iPhone SE and iPhone 14 in the EU, as these models still featured the outdated Lightning connector3. However, older models will continue to be available through third-party sellers until stock runs out.Consumers can now use a single USB-C charger for a wide range of devices, regardless of brand, making charging more convenient and reducing clutter. Additionally, the directive encourages reusing chargers, which helps to reduce the environmental footprint.While the regulation currently applies only to the EU, its influence is likely to spread globally as manufacturers adopt USB-C to streamline production and meet consumer expectations. This move towards a universal charging standard could eventually eliminate the need for different cables and chargers worldwide.","The European Union has implemented a new regulation mandating USB-C as the universal charging standard for all new electronic devices.

Google Maps is once again in the news for the wrong reasons in India. Two cars crashed in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh after Google Maps allegedly led the drivers onto an under-construction highway. The accident injured six people, with two requiring hospitalization.Vimlesh Srivastava and Keshav Kumar, residents of Bareilly, were traveling to Mathura's Banke Bihari temple on Friday, December 27 night. After reaching the Sikandra Rau area in Hathras around 10 pm, Google Maps reportedly directed them onto the under-construction Mathura-Bareilly highway. Their car crashed into a mound of mud near Hathras Junction. While the airbags deployed, two passengers were injured.The victims also blamed local authorities for the accident, saying the lack of reflective signs and indicators on the unfinished road contributed to the crash.“We were supposed to take the service road but Google Maps directed us onto the highway. The lack of reflective indicators also led to the crash. Local authorities are at fault as well. They should have put up barriers or signages indicating that the road is not ready for use,” Srivastava told Times of India.In a similar incident, a family from Badaun traveling to Mathura ended up on the same under-construction highway because of incorrect directions from Google Maps. Their car crashed into a mud mound after being guided onto a closed road.While the police rescued the passengers, the car was badly damaged. Deputy superintendent of police Shyamveer Singh told TOI, “The two cars were involved in accidents after allegedly being misguided by Google Maps.

Bengaluru police have arrested four people for allegedly defrauding the parent company of the payment platform Cred of Rs 12 crore. The arrests follow a complaint from a Dreamplug Paytech Solutions Private Limited executive.An Axis Bank relationship manager is among those arrested, accused of involvement in the theft. Dreamplug Paytech Solutions Private Limited is Cred’s parent company. Narasimha Vasanth Sastry, an executive at the company, filed the complaint.The CEN East police are investigating the case. The police told TOI “that the ones arrested include an Axis Bank relationship manager who is also accused of being involved in the theft.""Those arrested include Vaibhav Pithadiya, a relationship manager at an Axis Bank branch in Rajkot; Parmar Neha Ben Vipulbhai, a banking agent from Surat; Shailesh, an insurance agent from Rajkot and Pithadiya's colleague; and Shubham, a commission agent also from Rajkot.Last month, Dreamplug executives uncovered the scam after detecting suspicious transactions in the company’s accounts. The online payment aggregator, with offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru, reported that Rs 12.2 crore had been fraudulently withdrawn from two of its Axis Bank accounts—a current account and a nodal account—both opened in 2021.Axis Bank had issued a corporate ID along with four user IDs to Dreamplug, of which the company only activated two. The remaining two IDs were left unused, the company said.However, the investigation revealed that the accused gained unauthorised access to Dreamplug’s bank accounts by manipulating account details with Axis Bank.They reportedly exploited two critical vulnerabilities: first, by submitting fake documents, including forged signatures, seals, and board resolutions; and second, by requesting changes to the registered mobile number and email ID associated with the accounts.Between October and November, a total of 37 fraudulent transactions were carried out. While an attempt was made to transfer Rs 15.2 crore, only Rs 12.2 crore was successfully withdrawn.The first request to change account details was made on July 22 at an Axis Bank branch in Ankleshwar, Gujarat, followed by a second request on October 12 at another branch in Abrama, Surat.Both requests, submitted via suspicious personal email IDs, should have raised concerns as Dreamplug operates out of Bengaluru, the police told TOI.Despite this, Axis Bank processed the changes, enabling the fraudsters to intercept OTPs sent to the updated contact details and authorise transactions to multiple accounts across the country.The fraudulent emails and mobile numbers used in the scheme included vrvithal098@gmail.com, utsavmaterial76@gmail.com, 9662369909, and 8469158856, the police said.The police also cited the company’s executives to inform TOI that the accused used this access to drain the accounts and transfer the funds into various recipient accounts.","Dreamplug Paytech Solutions Private Limited is Cred’s parent company.

What Vodafone Idea said on the waiver

Vi, also known as Vodafone Idea , received a waiver of bank guarantee requirements for spectrum auctions conducted in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2021 from the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) last week. The telecom operator has welcomed the government’s decision to waive the requirement of bank guarantees for past spectrum auctions, stating that it will enable the telecom sector to better utilize banking resources for expanding 4G and 5G networks across India.On December 27, the DoT informed the three private telecom operators — Reliance Jio Bharti Airtel , and Vi — about the waiver of BGs amounting to Rs 33,000 crore. Of this, the lion’s share of relief, totaling Rs 24,800 crore, applies to Vodafone Idea.In an exchange filing, Vi said “This step of BG waiver is a clear indication of the government’s continued support to the telecom industry. It will ensure that the exposure of the banking system is utilized by telecom operators towards further proliferation of 4G and 5G networks in India.”“Prior to this reform, BGs aggregating to Rs 24,800 crore were required to be provided by Vi against each spectrum installment. With this decision, no BGs will be required for auctions held in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2021,” the company stated.However, Vi noted a one-time partial shortfall for the 2015 auction, where the net present value (NPV) of payments made is less than the pro-rated spectrum usage value. “We are in discussion with the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to determine the final amount of this partial shortfall for the 2015 auction,” the company added.For Vodafone Idea, which is yet to roll out 5G services, the BG waiver comes as a significant relief. It reduces financial burdens and opens avenues for lenders to extend much-needed credit. This funding will help the struggling telecom operator enhance its 4G coverage and accelerate its 5G rollout to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel.","Vi, also known as Vodafone Idea, received a waiver of bank guarantee requirements for spectrum auctions conducted in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2021.

Change in UPI Rule: RBI allows UPI access for prepaid payment instruments via third-party apps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/change-in-upi-rule-rbi-allows-upi-access-for-prepaid-payment-instruments-via-third-party-apps/articleshow/116750577.cms,"What is the UPI rule change

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has significantly expanded the functionality of Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) by allowing users to make and receive UPI payments through any third-party UPI-enabled app. This change, announced by RBI, marks a major step towards interoperability in the digital payments ecosystem.Prepaid Payment Instrument or PPIs is a financial tool that allows users to store funds on a card or digital wallet for future transactions. PPIs store monetary value and can be used for purchasing goods and services, conducting financial services, and facilitating remittances. This new regulation effectively integrates PPIs more deeply into the UPI ecosystem, further solidifying UPI's position as the dominant digital payment platform in India.Previously, UPI transactions involving PPIs, such as digital wallets, gift cards, and metro cards, were confined to the mobile app provided by the specific PPI issuer. This restriction limited user convenience and the broader adoption of PPIs for UPI transactions. Now, holders of full-KYC (Know Your Customer) compliant PPIs can link their instruments to popular UPI apps like Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, and BHIM, similar to how they link bank accounts.According to the RBI's circular, ""A PPI issuer shall enable holders of only its full-KYC PPIs to make UPI payments by linking its customer PPIs to its UPI handle. UPI transactions from PPI on the issuer’s application shall be authenticated using the customer’s existing PPI credentials. Such a transaction will, thus, be pre-approved before it reaches the UPI system. A PPI issuer, in its capacity as a PSP, shall not on-board customers of any bank or any other PPI issuer."" This means that only PPIs with complete customer verification (KYC) will be eligible for this feature. The authentication of these UPI transactions originating from PPIs will occur using the user's existing PPI credentials before the transaction reaches the UPI network, adding an extra layer of security. This pre-authorization process ensures that the PPI issuer validates the transaction before it is processed by the UPI system.The RBI also emphasized that PPI issuers, in their role as payment system providers, are prohibited from onboarding customers of other banks or PPI issuers. This stipulation aims to maintain a clear separation and prevent potential conflicts of interest.This move aligns with the RBI's broader objective of promoting digital payments and enhancing financial inclusion. By enabling greater interoperability between PPIs and the UPI network, the RBI aims to make digital transactions more seamless and accessible for a wider range of users. This decision also brings PPIs on par with bank accounts in terms of UPI accessibility, as bank account holders can already use any UPI app for transactions.UPI, developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), has revolutionized digital payments in India , facilitating instant real-time inter-bank transactions through mobile phones.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has significantly expanded the functionality of Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) by allowing users to make and receive UPI payments through any third-party UPI-enabled app. This change, announced by RBI, marks a major step towards interoperability in the digital payments ecosystem.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116750575,imgsize-25458,width-400,resizemode-4/116750575.jpg"

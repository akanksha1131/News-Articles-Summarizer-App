EU chief to Donald Trump: There are no winners in this, only losers

EU chief accepts: WTO has failed

The European Union is prepared to significantly escalate its trade dispute with the United States, potentially imposing levies on major US digital companies like Meta, Google, and Facebook if negotiations with Donald Trump fail to resolve his ongoing tariff war against Europe. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen issued a stark warning in an interview with the Financial Times, stating that the EU is developing retaliatory measures, including a possible tax on digital advertising revenues, targeting the services sector.Von der Leyen's comments come as the EU grants a 90-day pause on its planned retaliation against recent US steel and aluminum tariffs, imposed last month by the Trump administration. These initial countermeasures would have affected approximately €21 billion of US imports. The Commission president emphasized the EU's desire for a ""completely balanced"" agreement with Washington during this negotiation window.However, she made it clear that the EU is ready to deploy its most powerful trade tools, including the bloc’s anti-coercion instrument, which has the power to target services exports. Von der Leyen explicitly mentioned a levy on the advertising revenues of digital services as a potential measure if talks fail. This would represent a tariff applied across the entire EU single market, differing from existing digital sales taxes implemented individually by member states.Von Der Leyen described Trump's trade war as a ""complete inflection point in global trade"" and a ""turning point with the United States,"" asserting that a return to the previous status quo is no longer possible. She cautioned that ""there are no winners in this, only losers,"" highlighting the current turmoil in stock and bond markets as the ""cost of chaos"" and uncertainty.While open to discussing the alignment of EU and US product standards, Von Der Leyen downplayed expectations for significant progress in this area, citing fundamental differences in lifestyle and culture. Crucially, she ruled out any negotiation on the EU's digital content and market power regulations, which are viewed by the Trump administration as de facto taxes on US Big Tech firms. Similarly, she stated that the EU's value-added tax (VAT) is a sovereign decision and not subject to negotiation.Von der Leyen acknowledged the shared concerns of both the EU and the US regarding the failures of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to ensure a level playing field, particularly concerning Chinese industrial subsidies. She stated that the current crisis has spurred discussions on the need to ""modernise, reform and stabilise the WTO,"" emphasizing that reform, rather than simply preserving the existing system, is essential.","European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen issued a stark warning in an interview with the Financial Times.

'Some bankruptcies need to happen': Elon Musk’s old recession quote resurfaces as US stock market struggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/some-bankruptcies-need-to-happen-elon-musks-old-recession-quote-resurfaces-as-us-stock-market-struggles/articleshow/120215587.cms,"When Elon Musk said recession is a good thing

Elon Musk on recession: ‘It’s been raining money on fools for too long’

“This is actually a good thing. It has been raining money on fools for too long. Some bankruptcies need to happen.”

Trump’s 10% tariff sparks fresh recession fears in 2025

“It’s likely we’re headed for a recession because of the president’s ill-advised plans.”

Business leaders sound the alarm

Elon Musk shifts stance, opposes Trump’s new tariffs in global appeal

“We should have no tariffs, ideally. I believe in free trade.”

In a world where economic cycles often oscillate between growth and contraction, comments made during one period can resurface with striking relevance in another. In May 2022, amid the post-COVID financial tremors, Tesla CEO Elon Musk described a recession as “a good thing,” arguing that it would cleanse the market of inefficiencies and poor investments. Fast forward to 2025, and global economic anxieties have returned—this time stoked by the ripple effects of aggressive new tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.What was once a commentary on pandemic-era financial practices now finds new meaning amid warnings of a looming downturn. Here’s the context of Musk’s original remarks, the changing economic landscape, and the mounting pressure on policymakers as industry leaders urge a course correction.In May 2022, Musk responded to growing concerns about inflation and economic instability by embracing the idea of a recession. Taking to X (formerly Twitter), he wrote:At the time, markets were reeling from supply chain disruptions, pandemic-driven stimulus programs, and excessive valuations across tech and speculative sectors. Musk’s position was that an economic downturn would eliminate weak companies and restore discipline to financial markets.Now, in 2025, recession fears are no longer hypothetical. According to an The Economic Times report, President Donald Trump’s latest policy announcement—a blanket 10% tariff on all imports into the United States—has triggered alarm across global markets. This move is compounded by heightened tariffs on products from China, Europe, and other major trading partners.Wall Street veteran Jim Cramer warned that the US economy may not be able to absorb these new trade barriers without consequences. In a recent CNBC appearance, he stated:Economists suggest that tariffs could lead to a resurgence in inflation, increased production costs, and reduced consumer purchasing power—significantly raising the risk of a broader economic slowdown.As per reports, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon added his voice to the growing chorus of concern, citing inflationary pressures and declining business confidence. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also released a statement suggesting that global GDP growth may decelerate if trade tensions continue.The risk is not only domestic. Europe, one of the United States' largest trading partners, has hinted at retaliatory measures. Analysts warn that a transatlantic tariff escalation could spark a full-blown trade war, putting additional strain on supply chains and investor confidence.Despite his 2022 embrace of economic correction, Musk has now publicly urged President Trump to reverse the new tariffs. During a virtual appearance at a conference hosted by Italy’s League Party, Musk advocated for zero tariffs between the US and Europe. According to reports from the Washington Post, he stated:This shift suggests a nuanced evolution in Musk’s economic perspective. While he previously endorsed market-driven contractions, he now appears to recognize the broader geopolitical and financial risks of aggressive policy decisions.","In May 2022, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said a recession would cleanse the market of inefficiencies and poor investments.

Bill Gates reveals the one trait that could’ve made him a better manager,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-reveals-the-one-trait-that-couldve-made-him-abettermanager/articleshow/120214749.cms,"Bill Gates reveals the one trait that could’ve made him a better manager

Why Bill Gates thinks his old leadership style held Microsoft back

“I think if you want to work hard and not fool yourself, you better be pretty hard on yourself,”

“We were a fairly homogeneous, very engineering-orientated group,”

Bill Gates admits: ‘If you can’t do math, you can’t do anything’ was a mistake

“I sort of thought, if you can do math, you can do anything. And if you can’t do math, you can’t do anything,”

The turning point: From tech titan to global collaborator

“I was able to take mistakes I'd made, and learnings from Microsoft, and bring that to the foundation,”

Why Bill Gates says great managers adapt, not demand

“The one change that could’ve made me a better manager earlier?”

“Recognizing that talent isn’t one-size-fits-all.”

Bill Gates finds joy in learning, even after changing the world

“It is a lot of fun,” Gates said. “I get to work with smart people. I'm learning all the time. I get to travel the world.”

In a rare and candid conversation on the ""People by WTF"" podcast, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates offered a revealing account of his evolution as a leader—from the intense early years at Microsoft to his more collaborative role in global philanthropy today. Speaking with host Nikhil Kamath, Gates unpacked how his high standards and exacting personal discipline once hindered his ability to manage others effectively.His reflections shed light on the challenges of leadership in the fast-paced world of tech and the importance of adaptability, empathy, and recognizing diverse forms of talent. As Gates shared, becoming a good manager was a process of trial, error, and deep self-examination—lessons he would later apply with greater impact at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.During the formative years of Microsoft, Gates admitted that his leadership approach mirrored the way he treated himself—relentlessly high-pressure and narrowly focused on intellectual excellence.Gates explained, acknowledging how this mindset translated into his management approach.His internal expectations, based on a rigorous work ethic and technical prowess, created a performance culture that favored those who shared his engineering mindset. However, this style proved limiting.Gates said.This homogeneity, he acknowledged, led to missed opportunities to recruit and retain talented individuals who didn't fit the mold but could have brought valuable perspectives.Gates described how he once held a binary view of talent—believing that proficiency in mathematics was the primary indicator of potential.he confessed.This reductive thinking shaped Microsoft’s early culture, where analytical prowess often overshadowed other skills like communication, leadership, and cross-functional collaboration. Gates now views this assumption as a significant blind spot in his early career.The transformation in Gates’ management philosophy accelerated after he transitioned to full-time work at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Unlike in the tech sector, the foundation required broad, multidisciplinary collaboration—working with policymakers, health experts, educators, and community leaders.he said.At the foundation, success depended not just on IQ or coding skills but on empathy, negotiation, and cultural awareness—qualities that had been undervalued in Microsoft’s early days.One of Gates’ most important takeaways was the realization that intelligence and capability come in many forms. Leadership, he learned, requires more than managing deliverables—it requires recognizing the diverse strengths of team members and adapting one’s style accordingly.Gates reflected.This lesson became central to his work in philanthropy, where success is rarely achieved in isolation and often depends on partnerships across sectors and continents.Today, Gates continues to apply his trademark discipline, but without the rigidity that once characterized his leadership. He remains deeply involved in global initiatives and thrives in environments where learning and collaboration are prioritized.Despite decades of success, Gates emphasised that he is still learning—and still evolving.","Bill Gates reveals the one trait that could’ve made him a better manager.

What the regulator revealed after investigating Block



Why the regulator was investigating Block



Block Inc. , the parent company of Cash app , has agreed to pay a $40 million settlement with the New York State Department of Financial Services . The settlement comes after the regulator uncovered “serious compliance deficiencies” in Block’s anti-money laundering program and transaction monitoring processes. In a consent order, the financial regulator stated that deficiencies at Block—some involving cryptocurrencies—“created a high-risk environment vulnerable to exploitation by criminal actors.” The order claimed that Block’s system did not trigger blocks on bitcoin transactions involving terrorism-connected wallets until that exposure exceeded 10%. The regulator added that any involvement with wallets linked to terrorism is illegal.The regulator reviewed Block’s practices from early 2021 through September 2022 and determined that the company was not keeping pace with its rapid growth.That resulted in Block’s “inability to fully comply with its obligation to effectively monitor, and thereafter report, the transactions being conducted on its platforms for suspected money laundering and other illicit criminal activity,” the order read.The order further stated: “As the department has acknowledged, Cash App has devoted significant financial and other resources to compliance remediation and enhancements. We share the department’s dedication to addressing industry challenges and remain committed to investing across our operations to help promote a safe and healthy financial system.”However, Block, without admitting to the department’s findings, stated it was glad to move past the issue.Under the settlement terms, Block must appoint an independent monitor (chosen by the regulator) for one year to review and oversee enhancements to its anti-money laundering and sanctions programs. The consent order also clarified that its stipulations do not bind any federal, state, or law enforcement agencies.According to a report by NBC News from last year, former Block employees alleged that the company’s compliance systems were deeply flawed. These ex-employees, including one who spoke with federal prosecutors, alleged that Block processed numerous cryptocurrency transactions for terrorist groups and neglected to fix its faulty processes despite being alerted to breaches. Block launched bitcoin transactions via Cash App in 2018.Apart from this, Square, a Block subsidiary, also allegedly handled thousands of transactions with entities in countries under US sanctions such as Cuba, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, with many small-dollar transactions occurring as recently as 2023.",Block Inc. has agreed to pay a $40 million settlement with the New York State Department of Financial Services.

Hackers have reportedly leaked Elon Musk’s travel preferences. In stolen documents from Berkshire Hathaway-owned NetJets, hackers have revealed unknown details about the travel preferences of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO that combine high-speed efficiency with laid-back comfort, a report claims. The leaked memo, which is a part of a guide for serving the high-profile client, reveals that Musk insists on flying as fast and directly as possible. As per the memo, he even dismisses fuel conservation and has strict instructions for crew members to avoid small talk unless he initiates it. It further notes that, much like any regular traveler, he expects uninterrupted WiFi and values the ability to take naps during flights.According to a service plan from November 2024 (seen by Bloomberg), Musk likes the cabin at 65 degrees and the lights dim. He also prefers the passenger air vents switched off, as he “does not like the noise” they make, the memo notes.Despite NetJets declining to confirm the document’s authenticity, the Bloomberg report cited three individuals familiar with the situation who suggested that the company’s flight attendants receive “passenger service plans” similar to Musk’s, which brief them on a traveler's preferences during a flight.The document specifies that crew members shouldn’t offer any technological help. “Mr. Musk considers himself self-sufficient and does not need help with technology — if he does, he will ask.”It's important to note that NetJets is currently investigating a breach in which a hacker obtained “limited” information from “a very small number of owners,” the report continues.The company, which offers shared private aircraft ownership—with some clients being referred to as owners—reported that the attacker successfully “phished” an employee to capture their work account credentials and subsequently used that access to extract additional data from NetJets’ systems last month, the report added.Previously, Musk banned an account from his social media platform X (earlier Twitter) for tracking his flights.","Hackers have reportedly leaked Elon Musk’s travel preferences.

EC president says taxes on services to be based on discussions with US

The European Union (EU) has outlined a plan to deploy powerful trade measures, including levies on US digital companies such as Google and Facebook, should negotiations with the Trump administration prove unsuccessful in resolving the ongoing tariff dispute, a report has said.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen , in an interview with The Financial Times, emphasised the EU’s commitment to securing a “completely balanced” agreement with Washington during the 90-day pause on additional US tariffs, announced by President Donald Trump.However, she made it clear that the EU is prepared to significantly broaden the trade conflict to encompass services, potentially introducing a tax on digital advertising revenues that would directly impact tech giants like Meta, Google and Facebook.“We are developing retaliatory measures,” von der Leyen stated, revealing that these may involve the first utilisation of the bloc’s ‘anti-coercion instrument’, which grants the EU the power to impose restrictions on service exports.“There's a wide range of countermeasures... in case the negotiations are not satisfactory,” she was quoted as saying.Specifically, she suggested potential tariffs on the substantial services trade between the US and the EU, clarifying that the precise measures would hinge on the outcome of the discussions with Washington.“An example is you could put a levy on the advertising revenues of digital services,” she explained, adding that the proposed levy will be a tariff applied uniformly across the EU’s single market.Von der Leyen described Trump's trade policies as having instigated “a complete inflection point in global trade,” marking “a turning point with the United States without any question.”She asserted, “We will never go back any more to the status quo.”“There are no winners in this, only losers. Today we see the cost of chaos . . . the costs of the uncertainty that we are experiencing today will be heavy,” she continued.In a move to facilitate negotiations with Washington, the Commission has temporarily suspended its planned retaliatory measures against U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, which had been implemented the previous month.","European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke to The Financial Times.

A group of hackers has threatened to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk . The cybercrime group named DonRoad Team, which had earlier claimed responsibility for taking down several websites associated with US President Donald Trump, has now announced that it would start targeting sites associated with Tesla and SpaceX CEO. The group also shared its intent to attack sites associated with the tech billionaire over a month. Previously, the DonRoad Team has claimed responsibility for its attacks in March that targeted The Trump Organization's website, as well as Tesla and SpaceX email servers, causing temporary global outages at the time. This comes after Musk-owned social media platform X (earlier Twitter) was targeted by a group of pro-Palestinian hackers who were able to disable the site for several hours.In a post (seen by Newsweek) shared on messaging platform Telegram, the hackers said: “In the next few hours, we will be suspending all websites affiliated with Elon Musk companies for a full month.”However, the Telegram post was later removed. Should these hacks occur, they may impact multiple Musk-related websites, including X and his AI platforms Grok and Tesla. Hackers may also target websites of other companies owned by Musk, like SpaceX and Tesla.In March, Musk-owned X experienced at least three major outages following a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. —a cyber assault that floods networks or devices with bot-generated traffic. The Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility for the incident.Reacting to the cyberattack, Musk at that time took to X to write: There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against 𝕏. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing …”Later, in a Fox Business interview, Musk noted: “There was a massive cyber attack to try to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.”In a separate event in February, the website for the Department of Government Efficiency, of which Musk is a member, was compromised and altered to mock him and his team.The hacked site temporarily displayed a prominent message stating, “This is a joke of a .gov site,"" alongside the note, ""THESE 'EXPERTS' LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN.”",Hackers threaten to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk.

"Walmart Boycott: World's largest retailer tells protesters, 'we are America's ...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-boycott-worlds-largest-retailer-tells-protesters-we-are-americas-/articleshow/120119363.cms,"Here's what Walmart said about the protest

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has issued a statement addressing the ongoing week-long boycott organised by the People’s Union USA . The boycott, dubbed the "" Walmart Blackout ,"" began on April 7 and targets the company’s rollback of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as broader concerns over corporate influence and tax policies .The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity. The group’s founder, John Schwarz, urged consumers to avoid shopping at Walmart stores, using its online services, or purchasing from its subsidiaries like Sam’s Club. Schwarz stated, “We are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.”In response, Walmart defended its contributions to communities and the economy. “Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,” the company said in a statement. “As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year.”The boycott follows Walmart’s decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households—a trend that contrasts with another retail chain Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. In comparison, Walmart observed a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw the smallest decrease, at 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further added that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how someone identifies their sex, it also confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

What is Chicken Jockey scene in Minecraft Movie

Minecraft Movie director responds

Electric Palace Picture House in Cannock, Staffordshire has reportedly banned under-18s from attending evening showings of A Minecraft Movie without an adult. According to a BBC report, children under 18 will not be allowed to watch the movie unaccompanied after 18:30 BST. The movie released earlier this month and has broken box office records to become the highest opening video game movie of all time. According to The Guardian, the movie recorded the highest-ever first weekend total for a video game adaptation. At the same time, it has also become the centre of cinema disturbance after a viral TikTok trend, shouting ‘ Chicken Jockey ’.The movie is based on the widely popular sandbox video game that allows players to build, explore, and create using blocks, resources, and materials found in the game world. Common items include coal, iron, and even diamonds. But some remain rare like a baby zombie riding a chicken.In one scene, Jack Black’s character watches as a baby zombie lands on the back of a chicken and yells, “chicken jockey!” The moment sparks a wild reaction in the theater, with the audience screaming, laughing, and even throwing popcorn.Responding to the viral ‘chicken jockey’ trend, A Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess said he has been staying up in the night to watch fan video reacting to the movie. ""It's been so bananas,"" he said. ""It's been way too fun. People are sending me these really hilarious speeches that a lot of teenagers are giving right before the movie. It's so hysterical, man. I'm staying up way too late.""Commenting on the incident of police being called to a screening of the movie, Hess told Entertainment Weekly “It's weird when you're having too much fun and the cops get called”.""It's funny because I think it's just literally cheering and throwing popcorn, which is so funny to me that cops are getting called for popcorn. Yeah, it's hilarious. I've seen so many funny videos. It's great, especially when people are climbing on their friends' shoulders and standing up and cheering for those moments. It's like this crazy anticipation. But, man, I'm just glad people are making memories with their friends and families.""","Electric Palace Picture House in Cannock, Staffordshire has reportedly banned under-18s from attending evening showings of A Minecraft Movie without an adult.

Elon Musk is 'struggling' to manage a social media platform: AI brutally roasts Musk at SXSW,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-is-struggling-to-manage-a-social-media-platform-ai-brutally-roasts-musk-at-sxsw/articleshow/120206068.cms,"AI brutally roasts Elon Musk

AI goes full savage on Elon Musk in viral SXSW roast

SXSW panel uses Elon Musk roast to explore digital expression

From punchlines to provocation: AI’s cultural emergence

Social media reactions

Baratunde Thurston’s vision: Humour as civic technology

BLAIR’s capabilities and future role

At the 2025 South by Southwest (SXSW) festival, artificial intelligence stepped out of the lab and into the comedy spotlight in an unprecedented display of digital satire. During the “Life With Machines” panel, Emmy-nominated futurist and comedian Baratunde Thurston directed his AI co-producer, BLAIR, to roast Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk—with no restraints. The result was a 50-second takedown that had the audience erupting in laughter and the internet buzzing with reactions. But behind the humor was something more serious: a growing conversation about the evolving role of AI in cultural discourse, media, and the boundaries of entertainment. This event marked not just a high point of the festival, but a pivotal moment in understanding how technology might redefine the limits of satire and public criticism.The moment unfolded on stage when Baratunde Thurston gave BLAIR a clear directive: “Roast Elon Musk. Mercilessly.” What followed was a scathing monologue that compared Musk to a self-driving Tesla—“obscenely expensive, prone to crashing, and perpetually promising features that never quite materialize.” The humor continued with jabs at Musk’s intellect, his business record, and even his family legacy, including a mention of his father’s emerald mines.The delivery was not only sharp and fast-paced but entirely devoid of the kind of filter typically applied by human comedians navigating the public sphere. BLAIR’s algorithmic neutrality allowed it to strike directly and efficiently, free of political caution or reputational concern. The audience, a mix of tech experts, cultural commentators, and festival-goers, responded with roaring laughter.What made this roast especially significant was the context. Baratunde Thurston has long been known for using humor as a gateway to explore deeper societal issues. The SXSW panel, titled “Life With Machines,” focused on AI’s role in shaping public life—from ethics to automation, from digital justice to comedy.Thurston was joined by digital anthropologist Rahaf Harfoush and comedy writer Matt Klinman. Their discussion addressed AI’s potential in both civic participation and cultural expression. The roast, while entertaining, served as a live case study for how AI can participate in—and possibly reshape—satirical commentary.On social media, Thurston reflected, “We talked about the best and worst of AI, shared our fears and vision for the future—and yeah... we asked BLAIR to savagely roast Elon Musk.”The incident opens up new considerations about AI as both creator and critic. Traditionally, satire has been the domain of human insight and wit—subject to societal boundaries and political nuances. With AI like BLAIR entering the scene, the dynamic is changing. Algorithms, trained on massive datasets of speech and behavior, are now able to mimic—and even elevate—the art of satire.Unlike political commentators or late-night hosts who walk a fine line to avoid backlash, AI can generate critiques that are sharper and less inhibited. However, this also raises ethical questions about responsibility, consent, and bias in algorithmic humor.As expected, the internet had a field day. Clips of the roast went viral on platforms like Instagram and X (formerly Twitter), where users responded with a mix of humor and astonishment. “You said mercilessly and the AI went all over it xD,” one user commented. Another quipped, “The only thing Blair didn’t touch on is the number of children and baby mamas he has without paying child support.” “Hey human here. If you needed someone to insult him, there are many humans who could have done better,” joked another.Despite the light-hearted tone, the responses highlighted how AI-driven satire resonates across digital audiences and transcends cultural and national boundaries.Baratunde’s inclusion of AI in his satirical work is not without purpose. He is best known for his bestselling book How to Be Black and the podcast How to Citizen, both of which merge humor with civic inquiry. His goal at SXSW was to show how technology can be used not just to optimize systems, but to enhance dialogue, critique power, and engage communities.This AI-led roast was an extension of that philosophy—an effort to reimagine how machines might participate in democratic discourse, not just as tools or threats, but as co-creators.BLAIR, the AI involved in the roast, was developed specifically for public engagement and creative tasks. Built on large language models and fine-tuned for tonal awareness, BLAIR is designed to collaborate with human hosts on live shows, podcasts, and educational events. Its ability to handle humor, satire, and sensitive topics while maintaining audience engagement is part of ongoing research into ethical AI communication.Thurston revealed that BLAIR had been trained on decades of stand-up routines, political commentary, and journalistic editorials to develop a voice that was both informed and impactful. Importantly, BLAIR operates with editorial oversight, meaning its content is curated and refined with the help of human collaborators.","At the 2025 South by Southwest (SXSW) festival, artificial intelligence stepped out of the lab and into the comedy spotlight.

"From Daikin to Samsung, companies fight Modi over e-waste policy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/from-daikin-to-samsung-companies-fight-modi-over-e-waste-policy/articleshow/120207682.cms,"India wants to tackle its mounting e-waste problem. Global electronics companies say the cost is too high. Daikin , Hitachi and Samsung are among manufacturers alarmed by new Indian government rules that require them to pay significantly more to recycle air conditioners, refrigerators, TVs and other appliances, court papers and lobbying letters show.The electronics giants are urging environment officials to abandon the approach, with four companies suing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration in New Delhi over the measures they say will heighten compliance woes and unsettle businesses.The previously unreported standoff marks the latest chapter in foreign companies' battles with India over what some perceive as protectionist policies and shifting regulatory goal posts.India is the third-biggest e-waste generator behind China and the U.S. But government data shows only 43% of the country's e-waste last year was recycled and at least 80% of the sector comprises informal scrap dealers, whose methods can pose environmental and health risks.Concerned about poor waste-processing practices, New Delhi in September set a floor price that electronics makers must pay recyclers, with the aim of formalising the sector and encouraging investment in e-waste management.A Reuters review of hundreds of pages of non-public court papers and letters to the government by an industry group representing Samsung and LG reveals the impasse over the new rates, which the industry says have roughly tripled manufacturers' recycling costs.Johnson Controls-Hitachi, Japan's Daikin (6367.T), opens new tab, India's Havells (HVEL.NS), opens new tab and Tata Group 's Voltas (VOLT.NS), opens new tab each sued Modi's government between November and March to quash the pricing rules.The measures are unconstitutional, exceed the government's powers under environmental law, and raise compliance costs manifold, the companies said in submissions to New Delhi judges. The government has called for the cases to be dismissed.Daikin said no Indian government had ever previously drafted policies with the ""sole intention"" of providing financial gain to some businesses, in this case recyclers, at others' expense. Voltas predicted a ""cascading effect"" on product prices.The companies are part of an Indian consumer electronics market Euromonitor estimates will be worth $62 billion this year. The sector has experienced average annual growth of 10% since 2021.As sales of consumer electronics skyrocket due to rapid urbanisation, companies such as Daikin, Hitachi and Samsung have expanded production in India. In line with global trends, India's e-waste reached 1.7 million metric tons in 2023-24, more than doubling in six years.Samsung declined to comment. The other companies and India's Environment Ministry didn't respond to Reuters queries about the pricing rules and the industry's response.'REASONABLE' INTERVENTIONFor years, India has resisted foreign companies' demands to revoke protectionist policies. Lobbying by Walmart and Amazon, for example, failed to ease regulations that protect small retailers.On e-waste, too, Modi's administration is digging in.In a March 18 submission, the Environment Ministry urged the judges to dismiss the lawsuits, saying it was ""reasonable"" and within its powers to fix prices.The alternative of letting companies and recyclers determine prices may not account for all costs of environmentally sound waste management, the ministry said, adding that it wanted to prevent a ""race to the bottom"" in pricing.India's government says there are 322 authorised recyclers in the country.But informal waste handlers flourish nationwide, using methods such as open burning and acid leaching to extract metals and components, which can release hazardous materials.In western Gujarat state, 60-year-old scrap dealer Mustakeem Malik uses a hammer to dismantle televisions, air conditioners and routers.Inside his tin-roofed shed where electronic equipment was stacked in haphazard piles, Malik told Reuters he earns 50,000 rupees, or about $580, a month by selling the plastic, circuit boards and copper he extracts from the devices. He doesn't want to work in the formal e-waste sector.That business has a lot of expenses. It's for the big guys,"" he said.HAPPY RECYCLERS, WORRIED COMPANIESIndia's new rules mandate a minimum payment of 22 rupees (25 U.S. cents) per kilogram to recycle consumer electronics and 34 rupees/kg for smartphones.Makers of heavier devices such as air conditioners are likely to be hit hardest because their per-unit recycling cost has risen by a greater amount compared with makers of lighter gadgets like smartphones.Research firm Redseer in February said India's recycling rates were still low compared with the U.S., where they are up to five times higher, and China, where they at least 1.5 times higher.""We are talking about peanuts here,"" said Nitin Gupta, CEO of one of India's biggest recyclers, Attero, who added that the government rates require manufacturers to pay about $10 to recycle a washing machine.""If you have to create scientific capacity for recycling, you need extra profits. This is good for us,"" said Gupta, whose firm counts LG and Daikin as clients.The electronics makers, though, feel threatened.India's Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association, which represents LG and Samsung, among others, said in a letter to the government in November that e-waste compliance expenses had risen to 2% to 8% of production costs. The group asked environment officials to reconsider the pricing rules.Samsung and LG haven't sued the government but have signaled concern. LG India's December IPO prospectus warned without specifics that higher recycling rates ""had a significant financial impact on our company"".A person with direct knowledge of the matter said Samsung had told senior Indian officials its recycling costs would be five to 15 times the previous rates, and urged New Delhi not to interfere in commercial dealings with recyclers.In court, Johnson Controls-Hitachi was the only company to reveal what it previously paid for recycling: 6 rupees per kg, or 7 U.S. cents. That figure has now almost quadrupled.The company disclosed that it recycled more than 10,000 tons of air conditioners last fiscal year, which would amount to roughly $2.6 million under the new rates. Its India business reported a net loss of $8.8 million the previous year.","India is the third-biggest e-waste generator behind China and the U.S. But government data shows only 43% of the country's e-Waste last year was recycled.

The Donald Trump effect

A symbol of Canadian sovereignty

Elon Musk Joins the storyline

Captain Canuck , Canada's iconic superhero from the 1970s, is experiencing a dramatic resurgence, fueled by political tensions with the United States under President Donald Trump. The crimson-and-white-clad protector of Canadian sovereignty has become a cultural symbol of defiance against Trump's controversial remarks and policies.The revival of Captain Canuck coincides with Trump's repeated suggestions that Canada should become the 51st state of the United States. His annexation rhetoric and trade threats have sparked outrage among Canadians, who are rallying around the superhero as a symbol of independence and national pride. The latest comic book cover features Captain Canuck wagging his finger at Trump, a bold visual response to the US President's remarks.Created in 1975 by Richard Comely, Captain Canuck was envisioned as a uniquely Canadian counterpart to Captain America. The character, whose alter ego is Tom Evans, is a Mountie with superhuman abilities gained through an alien encounter. His costume prominently features maple leaves and Canada's signature red and white colours, embodying the spirit of Canadian sovereignty.Comely, now 74, noted that the current political climate has reignited interest in the character. ""I think there was an undercurrent, so to speak, in Canada in the '70s. So I think Canadians were starting to feel like, you know, like they should acknowledge the fact that we had our own country, and we had our own culture and be proud of the fact that we were Canadians,"" Comely told Reuters.In a bold twist, the latest comics also depict Elon Musk as Trump's loyal sidekick. The storyline portrays Captain Canuck intercepting Trump and Musk mid-action, ultimately hauling them away by the collar. This imagery has resonated with readers, catapulting the comic into bestseller status across Canada.Captain Canuck's resurgence reflects a broader longing for a uniquely Canadian identity amid growing unease over US-Canada relations. The superhero's revival extends beyond comics, with animated web series and branded merchandise further cementing his place in contemporary Canadian pop culture.With agency inputs","Captain Canuck, Canada's iconic superhero from the 1970s, is experiencing a dramatic resurgence, fueled by political tensions with the United States under President Donald Trump.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s net worth has dropped by over $121 billion in 2025 so far. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , Musk is the only individual among the world’s top 10 richest people to have incurred such significant losses in his net worth. Other billionaires in top 10 richest list like Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates among others have incurred losses of $36.5 billion, $13.9 billion and $2.57 billion, respectively. As of market closing on April 10, his net worth stood at $311 billion.The decline in Musk's wealth is primarily attributed to a sharp drop in Tesla's stock value, which has been affected by investor concerns over the company's performance and broader market volatility. Over a recent three-day period, the world's ten richest individuals collectively lost $172 billion due to a significant stock market downturn, with Musk alone accounting for a $35 billion loss during that span.Despite these losses, Musk remains the richest person globally, with his wealth largely tied to his holdings in Tesla, SpaceX, and other ventures. His net worth had previously peaked at over $400 billion in December 2024 before the recent declines.Musk, a close confidant of President Donald Trump has been working with the federal government on efforts to cut waste and reduce spending, which some investors fear could be taking time away from his leadership at Tesla. Additionally, Tesla facilities have been targeted in multiple attacks, including incidents of vandalism and gunfire. Authorities have suggested that these attacks may be linked to Musk's political activities and government involvement.

Challenging the ‘nepo baby’ narrative

“There’s always this underlying voice that says, ‘Did I earn this, or was it given to me?’”

Bill Gates' daughter says wealth came with responsibility

Phoebe Gates tackles youth burnout in new podcast

When your father is Bill Gates—Microsoft co-founder, philanthropist, and one of the world’s richest individuals—public perception tends to blur the line between fact and fantasy. Gates’ staggering net worth, currently estimated at $147 billion, often leads many to assume that his children enjoy a life devoid of limitations. However, Phoebe Gates , the youngest of Gates' three children, offers a far more nuanced picture.At 22, Phoebe is actively challenging assumptions about privilege and legacy. In a recent interview on her podcast, The Burnouts, she candidly discussed what it’s really like growing up as the daughter of a tech icon, including the strict rules she was expected to follow—even those her father once broke himself.While Bill Gates famously dropped out of Harvard University to launch Microsoft, that same option was not on the table for his youngest daughter. During her recent podcast episode, Phoebe revealed that dropping out of college was not something her parents would even consider. She studied Human Biology at Stanford University and was strongly encouraged to complete her degree, regardless of her family’s entrepreneurial history.she said, acknowledging the irony that her father’s own success came from doing precisely that.This rule was firmly enforced to emphasize the importance of education and commitment, reinforcing the idea that privilege does not substitute personal discipline and achievement.Despite Bill Gates’ immense fortune, his children—Jennifer (28), Rory (25), and Phoebe (22)—are not in line to inherit the billions many might expect. The tech mogul has long emphasized that his children will receive a relatively small portion of his wealth, reportedly less than 1% each. This decision stems from a conscious effort to instill values of independence, hard work, and self-determination. Gates has publicly stated that he wants his children to create their own paths rather than rely on inherited money. This approach aligns with the broader philanthropic mission of the Gates Foundation, which seeks to redirect most of the family fortune toward global health, education, and poverty alleviation initiatives.Phoebe also addressed the public perception of being a “nepo baby”—a term used to describe children of influential or wealthy figures who are assumed to have success handed to them. While she acknowledged the undeniable privileges she has benefited from, Phoebe shared that growing up under the shadow of such a famous surname also brought significant pressure. At Stanford, she experienced persistent self-doubt and felt the need to prove her worth independently of her family name.she explained, illustrating the internal battles that accompany public scrutiny and expectation.Contrary to popular belief, Phoebe described her childhood as structured, values-driven, and far from the extravagant lifestyle many might expect. According to her, the Gates household emphasized humility, responsibility, and purpose. These values were reflected in everything from education to financial awareness. Even simple privileges came with context, reinforcing the idea that their position came with responsibilities, not entitlements.Now a college graduate, Phoebe is turning her attention to conversations around mental health, identity, and ambition through her podcast, The Burnouts. The show aims to create a platform where young people can discuss the challenges of navigating success, pressure, and personal identity in a highly competitive world. By drawing on her own experiences and hosting diverse voices, she hopes to foster greater understanding and empathy in discussions about youth burnout and modern expectations.","At 22, Phoebe Gates is actively challenging assumptions about privilege and legacy.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s comment on Gemini image generation controversy

Facebook parent company Meta recently launched the Llama 4 AI model. The Mark Zuckerberg-led company said that it aims to address one of the biggest problems of bias in large language models (LLMs) while acknowledging the historical tendency of leading LLMs to exhibit a left-leaning bias on politically and socially debated topics. The company said that the problem is due to the nature of training data sourced from the internet.The company said that the core objective driving the development of Llama 4 has been to mitigate this bias, the company said in a blog post it released soon after it launched the Llama 4 AI models.“Our goal is to remove bias from our AI models and to make sure that Llama can understand and articulate both sides of a contentious issue. As part of this work, we’re continuing to make Llama more responsive so that it answers questions, can respond to a variety of different viewpoints without passing judgment, and doesn't favor some views over others,” it added.Facebook says it has made improvements in bias reduction compared to its predecessor, Llama 3 and is comparable to Grok, which is developed by Elon Musk-owned xAI. These advancements include reduced refusal rates: a decrease in the frequency of refusing to respond to questions on debated political and social topics.Facebook says that the model shows a significantly more balanced approach in its refusals and testing indicates that Llama 4's tendency to respond with a strong political lean is now comparable to Grok.Google faced criticism last year when its AI chatbot Gemini produced historically inaccurate and racially biased images, including depictions of America's founding fathers and war heroes. The chatbot reportedly declined to depict white people in certain scenarios.

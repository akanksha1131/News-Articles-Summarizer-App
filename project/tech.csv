How Pentagon may have a 'huge' DeepSeek problem,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-pentagon-may-have-a-huge-deepseek-problem/articleshow/117811018.cms,"US Navy asks its personnel to not use DeepSeek

Pentagon, headquarters of the US Department of Defense has banned DeepSeek after its employees connected their work computers to Chinese servers to access the new Chinese AI chatbot. DeepSeek, which claims to have developed its AI model for less than $6 million, has gained attention for its low-cost approach. It briefly became the most downloaded app on Apple’s App Store, drawing praise from tech leaders like Marc Andreessen.DeepSeek's rapid rise has raised security concerns among US officials, leading the Pentagon to block access over data privacy risks.A report by Bloomberg says that some employees in the US Defense Department used their work computers to access DeepSeek for at least two days before the Pentagon blocked access. The Defense Information Systems Agency, responsible for the Pentagon’s IT networks, restricted access to DeepSeek’s website on Tuesday (January 28) after concerns were raised about its use. The report,quoting a defense official, said some Pentagon computers displayed a ""Website Blocked"" message on Wednesday (January 29), though others could still access the chatbot.Pentagon IT experts are investigating how employees accessed DeepSeek. Some military personnel downloaded an earlier version of its code in late 2024 without raising security concerns at the time, as its connection to China was not initially clear, the report stated. The latest release has led some military branches to review and remove AI tools linked to China from work computers.The US Navy has asked its members not to use DeepSeek’s AI due to security and ethical concerns about its origin and use. The Navy has reportedly sent an email, warning its team to avoid using DeepSeek’s AI, both for work and personal tasks. In the email, the Navy instructed its members not to download, install, or use DeepSeek’s AI at all.“We would like to bring to your attention a critical update regarding a new AI model called DeepSeek,” the email said. It further stated that it’s “imperative” that team members do not use DeepSeek’s AI “for any work-related tasks or personal use.","DeepSeek claims to have developed its AI model for less than $6 million.

Security personnel escorted the US Department of Agriculture’s inspector general from her office this week after she refused to comply with her dismissal by the Trump administration, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.Phyllis Fong , who had served in the department for 22 years, informed colleagues that she planned to remain in her position despite being terminated by the White House.According to sources, she argued that the administration had not followed the proper procedures. Fong previously served as the first chairperson of CIGIE from 2008 to 2014, according to her USDA biography.In an email to colleagues, reportedly reviewed by Reuters, Fong cited the independent Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, stating that the council had determined the termination notices did not adhere to legal requirements and were therefore not effective.The White House defended the dismissals of Fong and other inspectors general, claiming that ""these rogue, partisan bureaucrats... have been relieved of their duties to make way for qualified individuals who will uphold the rule of law and protect Democracy.""As USDA’s inspector general, Fong oversaw a broad range of responsibilities, including consumer food safety, audits, and investigations into the Agriculture Department, as well as enforcement of animal welfare laws. The USDA has been central to concerns over the spread of bird flu, which has affected cattle and poultry and resulted in a fatality in Louisiana.In 2022, Fong’s office launched an investigation into Elon Musk ’s brain implant company, Neuralink , which remains ongoing, sources said.

Meta responds to unexpected follows on Donald Trump’s social media accounts

Standard transition process – The company has reaffirmed that it follows the same transition process for White House accounts after each presidential election. If a user was following the POTUS, VP, or First Lady accounts under Biden, they were automatically transitioned to the Trump administration’s corresponding accounts.

Potential technical issues – Meta has admitted that certain “bugs” may have caused irregularities in the transition process. Some users who were not following Biden’s official accounts may have inadvertently been added to Trump’s accounts due to a system error.

""People were not made to automatically follow any of the official Facebook or Instagram accounts for the President, Vice President, or First Lady. Those accounts are managed by the White House, so with a new administration, the content on those pages changes.""

A wave of confusion has swept across Instagram and Facebook users following the transition of the White House's social media accounts to the new administration. Many users have reported that they are now following President Donald J. Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and Vice President J.D. Vance, even though they had never signed up to do so. This unexpected change occurred the day after President Trump’s inauguration, prompting speculation and criticism.Meta , the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, explained that the transition is part of a standard process where official government accounts are handed over to the new administration while retaining their existing followers.However, some users claim they had never followed the official presidential accounts in the past, raising questions about whether they were automatically added without consent. Additionally, issues with unfollowing the accounts, along with changes in Meta’s algorithm promoting political content, have contributed to mounting frustration.The process of transferring White House social media accounts between administrations has been in place since President Barack Obama’s tenure. Since 2016, platforms like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) have implemented a system where official government accounts—such as those for the President, Vice President, and First Lady—are passed on to the incoming administration. This ensures continuity in government communications while retaining their existing followers.The same procedure was followed when President Joseph R. Biden Jr. took office in 2020, and it has now been repeated for President Trump’s administration in 2025. Users who were following the official presidential accounts under Biden’s tenure have automatically been switched to follow Trump’s administration’s accounts.However, many users claim they had never followed these accounts before, yet they now see Trump-related posts in their feeds. Meta has denied that it forcefully added followers but has acknowledged that some technical issues may have contributed to the confusion.Meta’s response to the situation has been twofold:Andy Stone, a Meta spokesperson, stated on Threads:Despite this clarification, many users remain skeptical, particularly those who are experiencing difficulties in unfollowing these accounts.Users attempting to unfollow Trump’s official accounts have reported being unable to do so, with some experiencing delays or errors when trying to remove themselves as followers. Meta has acknowledged this issue but has not provided a clear reason for the problem.The company has assured users that follow and unfollow requests should process correctly after some time, but the widespread reports of delays have fueled concerns about Meta’s handling of political content.Another significant change affecting users is Meta’s recent decision to reintegrate political content into its platforms. Previously, Meta reduced the visibility of political posts on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, aiming to create a less divisive and more positive user experience.However, in early 2025, CEO Mark Zuckerberg reversed this policy, stating that users had expressed interest in seeing more political content again. As a result, Meta’s algorithms now promote more political posts, including those from government accounts.This change may explain why users are suddenly seeing more posts from President Trump and Vice President Vance in their feeds, even if they do not actively engage with political content.Amid the ongoing controversy, some users have noticed that searching for certain political hashtags—such as ""#democrats""—yields limited or no results. This has led to accusations that Meta is suppressing content related to the Democratic Party while amplifying posts from the new Republican administration.Meta has denied any intentional bias, attributing the issue to an error affecting multiple topics, not just political ones. According to Andy Stone:Regardless of the explanation, this incident has fueled concerns over Meta’s role in shaping political discourse on social media.Meta’s handling of the White House transition, along with its broader changes to political content moderation, raises several important questions for users:","Some users have reported that they are now following President Donald J. Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and Vice President J.D. Vance, even though they had never signed up to do so.

The artificial intelligence (AI) industry has seen rapid advancements in recent years, with companies from around the world competing to develop the most powerful and cost-effective models. A new entrant, DeepSeek, a Chinese AI application, has emerged as a significant competitor to established U.S. firms such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. DeepSeek has gained widespread attention for its claim that its R1 model was developed at a fraction of the cost of its competitors, prompting discussions about the future of AI and its global economic impact.The app has already made waves in the market, becoming the most downloaded free app in the United States within a week of its launch.Its success has even prompted political figures, including former U.S. President Donald Trump, to call it a “wake-up call” for the American technology sector. But how does DeepSeek compare to well-established AI platforms such as ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini? Here's a detailed look at DeepSeek’s capabilities across various domains, including writing assistance, coding, brainstorming, and research.One of the most common uses of AI models is content generation. ChatGPT has gained popularity for its ability to assist users with writing blog posts, summarizing information, and structuring ideas in a logical and well-organized manner.To compare their writing abilities, DeepSeek and ChatGPT were given a simple prompt:While both AI models performed well, ChatGPT’s response was more structured and comprehensive, whereas DeepSeek delivered a factual list with a brief description.Developers have increasingly relied on AI models to assist with debugging, generating code snippets, and problem-solving. Recently, when ChatGPT experienced an outage, many developers took to social media, expressing their dependence on AI-powered coding assistance.AI researcher Javier Aguirre from Samsung Medical Center in South Korea tested DeepSeek's ability to solve complex coding problems. According to his analysis:According to Addy Osmani, Head of Chrome Developer Experience at Google, DeepSeek is not only highly capable but also significantly cheaper compared to OpenAI’s latest models. This cost-effectiveness could make it an attractive alternative for companies and individual developers alike.Another key use of AI models is idea generation and creative writing. To test this, both DeepSeek and ChatGPT were given the prompt:While ChatGPT provided a variety of creative directions, DeepSeek’s approach was to generate a complete narrative instantly. This suggests that DeepSeek may be better suited for users looking for a full draft rather than brainstorming multiple concepts.AI models are frequently used for research and education, particularly for simplifying complex historical and scientific topics. A common challenge is explaining the causes of World War I, a topic often covered in school curricula.Overall, ChatGPT and Gemini provided more comprehensive research-based responses, whereas DeepSeek’s strength lies in delivering concise summaries.DeepSeek’s rapid rise has demonstrated that the U.S. AI companies no longer have a monopoly over the market. Its ability to perform tasks at a lower cost while maintaining competitive accuracy and efficiency raises questions about the future of AI development and global competition.Experts, including Professor Neil Lawrence from the University of Cambridge, believe that AI innovation is just beginning. He compared the current AI landscape to historical breakthroughs in engineering, noting that “there is plenty of space for budding James Watts to emerge,” referring to innovators who may refine and improve existing AI models rather than invent entirely new systems.","DeepSeek is the most widely used AI chatbot globally.

WhatsApp parent company Meta has said that Israeli spyware firm Paragon Solutions has targeted approximately 90 of its users, including journalists and members of civil society organisations. The company claims that it has successfully disrupted the hacking operation.A WhatsApp official told news agency Reuters that the company has issued a cease-and-desist letter to Paragon following the discovery of the hacking attempt.The official disclosed that the company detected an effort to compromise roughly 90 user accounts on its platform, however, declined to provide specific details about the targeted individuals or their locations.The official also confirmed that the victims included an unspecified number of people involved in civil society work and media.The WhatsApp official refrained from elaborating on the methods used to attribute the hack to Paragon, stating only that law enforcement agencies and industry partners have been notified.The official stated that WhatsApp has successfully disrupted the hacking operation and is now working with the Canadian internet watchdog group Citizen Lab to provide support to the affected users.“WhatsApp is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users,” the company stated.“We will continue to protect people’s ability to communicate privately,” it added.John Scott-Railton, a researcher at Citizen Lab, commented on the discovery of the Paragon spyware targeting WhatsApp users.“This incident is a reminder that mercenary spyware continues to proliferate,” Scott-Railton said, “and as it does, we continue to see familiar patterns of problematic use.”Last month, WhatsApp secured a significant legal victory against Israeli spyware company NSO Group. A federal judge ruled that NSO is liable under both federal and California state law for a 2019 hacking incident that compromised the accounts of over 1,000 WhatsApp users.","WhatsApp parent company Meta has said that Israeli spyware firm Paragon Solutions has targeted approximately 90 of its users, including journalists and members of civil society organisations.

Why Meta chief AI scientist called DeepSeek’s advancements “woefully unjustified”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-meta-chief-ai-scientist-called-deepseeks-advancements-woefully-unjustified/articleshow/117795367.cms,"Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun

What made DeepSeek’s R1 model popular

Major misunderstanding about AI infrastructure investments:

Much of those billions are going into infrastructure for inference, not training.

Running AI assistant services for billions of people requires a lot of compute.

‘Cost will increase’

Once you put video understanding, reasoning, large-scale memory, and other capabilities in AI systems, inference costs are going to increase.

The only real question is whether users will be willing to pay enough (directly or not) to justify the capex and opex.

So, the market reactions to DeepSeek are woefully unjustified.

DeepSeek’s emergence sent ripples of concern through Silicon Valley, raising questions about the competitive landscape of the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence (AI) sector. However, Yann LeCun , Meta 's chief AI scientist, has cautioned against overreacting to the Chinese company’s emergence.DeepSeek recently unveiled a new AI model that, according to third-party benchmarks, outperforms existing models from industry giants like OpenAI and Meta, all while reportedly utilising less powerful hardware and a significantly smaller budget.This news triggered a tech sell-off this week, resulting in a staggering $1 trillion loss in market capitalisation, with Nvidia, a leading supplier of high-end AI chips, experiencing a near $600 billion decline – essentially questioning the need of pouring billions into AI development.In a Threads post, LeCun argued that the massive investments pouring into US AI companies are primarily driven by the need for inference capabilities, not just training. Inference, the process by which AI models apply their learned knowledge to new data, is crucial for powering generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT . As user demand increases, so does the need for inference processing, leading to higher costs.LeCun predicts that inference costs will continue to rise as AI systems become more sophisticated, incorporating features like video understanding, reasoning, and large-scale memory. He believes that the market's reaction to DeepSeek's advancements is “woefully unjustified.”Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently announced plans for over $60 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, earmarking funds for expanding its AI infrastructure and teams.","DeepSeek recently unveiled a new AI model that, according to third-party benchmarks, outperforms existing models from industry giants like OpenAI and Meta.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Bernstein report 'tells' what it says China's DeepSeek is not telling everyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bernstein-report-tells-what-it-says-chinas-deepseek-is-not-telling-everyone/articleshow/117702705.cms,"How to use deepseek AI

What DeepSeek is not telling

Bernstein Research 's recent report has tempered the hype surrounding DeepSeek, the Chinese startup whose low-cost AI assistant has caused a stir in the tech world and even impacted global markets. While acknowledging DeepSeek 's impressive capabilities, the report argues that claims of the AI being built for just $5 million are misleading and don't represent the full picture of its development costs.The Bernstein report directly addresses the narrative surrounding DeepSeek's supposed budget: ""We believe that DeepSeek DID NOT 'build OpenAI for USD 5M'; the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and the resulting Twitter-verse panic over the weekend seems overblown."" The report emphasizes that the ""fantastic"" results achieved by DeepSeek shouldn't be mistaken for miraculous, and the market reaction, particularly the impact on Nvidia, was disproportionate to the reality of the situation.DeepSeek has developed two primary AI model families: DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek R1 . The V3 model is a large language model (LLM) utilizing a Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) architecture. Bernstein's analysis reveals that training the V3 model required significant computational resources. DeepSeek employed a cluster of 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs for approximately two months. This translates to roughly 2.7 million GPU hours for pre-training and a total of 2.8 million GPU hours when including post-training. GPU hours represent the cumulative time a graphics processing unit is actively engaged in processing tasks, highlighting the substantial investment in computational power.The report underscores that the widely cited ""$5 million"" figure fails to account for the extensive research, development, experimentation, personnel costs, and other associated expenses inherent in developing such a complex model. It's not simply a matter of hardware costs; the figure omits the significant investment in talent and time required for AI research and development.The unveiling of DeepSeek's assistant had a dramatic effect on the market, particularly on AI chip leader Nvidia. On January 27th, Nvidia experienced a record single-day loss in market value, close to $593 billion, driven by fears that Chinese AI models like DeepSeek's could gain a competitive edge over more expensive American counterparts. Bernstein's report suggests that this market reaction was an overreaction.While the V3 model's training resources were detailed, the report notes that the R1 model, which was considered particularly impressive, lacked similar quantification in DeepSeek's research paper. This raises questions about the true cost and resources involved in developing the R1 model.In conclusion, Bernstein acknowledges DeepSeek's achievements as ""fantastic"" but argues that the claim of building an OpenAI-level competitor for $5 million is ""exaggerated"" and ""overblown."" The report provides a more nuanced perspective, highlighting the substantial computational resources and likely hidden costs involved in developing advanced AI models like DeepSeek's, and suggesting that the market's reaction to the company's emergence may have been disproportionate.",Chinese startup DeepSeek's low-cost AI assistant has caused a stir in the tech world and even impacted global markets.

""We know (China) based companies -- and others -- are constantly trying to distill the models of leading US AI companies,"" an OpenAI spokesperson told news agency AFP.OpenAI further said that the process was against its terms of service and it would work at detecting and preventing further attempts.We ""believe as we go forward that it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology,"" the spokesperson added.While OpenAI, Microsoft and some in the US government are crying foul; many across the internet are not amused. For, the company led by Sam Altman is itself facing multiple accusations of intellectual property violations, primarily related to the use of copyrighted materials in training its generative AI models.Such Copyright infringement cases against ChatGPT abound across the world. Courts across the world are hearing claims by authors, news outlets and musicians who accuse ChatGPT of using their copyright work to train AI services and who are seeking to have content used to train the chatbot deleted.Earlier this month, the New Delhi-based Federation of Indian Publishers filed a case at the Delhi High Court against OpenAI, which is already facing similar lawsuits in the same court. The case has been filed on behalf of all the federation's members, who include publishers like Bloomsbury (BLPU.L), opens new tab, Penguin Random House, Cambridge University Press and Pan Macmillan, as well as India's Rupa Publications and S.Chand and Co. ""Our ask from the court is that they should stop (OpenAI from) accessing our copyright content,"" Pranav Gupta, the federation's general secretary told Reuters about the lawsuit, which concerns the ChatGPT tool's book summaries.Not just this, the Indian media outlets, including NDTV and Network18 have told the Delhi High Court that they want to join the ongoing lawsuit against ChatGPT creator OpenAI as they are worried their news websites are being scraped to store and reproduce their work for users of the powerful AI tool. The 135-page case filing, which is not public but was reviewed by Reuters, argues OpenAI's conduct constitutes ""a clear and present danger to the valuable copyrights"" of Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) members and other outlets.In November 2024, the Delhi High Court issued summons to OpenAI in a lawsuit filed by news agency Asian News International (ANI) over use of its news content “without any license or permission”, by the advanced AI-powered chatbot to provide services to its users.Responding to the same earlier this month, Open AI’s counsel questioned the territorial jurisdiction of courts in India to decide the issue. Senior advocate Amit Sibal, representing OpenAI, said that the organisation operates internationally, with no servers or offices in India.In 2024, the New York Times sued OpenAI and its partner Microsoft for the unpermitted use of Times articles to train GPT large language models.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI is worried that Chinese companies are attempting to replicate its advanced AI models.

Microsoft to bring DeepSeek to Copilot+ PCs; read the company’s statement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-to-bring-deepseek-to-copilot-pcs-read-the-companys-statement/articleshow/117792603.cms,"What Microsoft said about running DeepSeek models on Copilot+ PCs



“The optimized DeepSeek models for the NPU take advantage of several of the key learnings and techniques from that effort, including how we separate out the various parts of the model to drive the best tradeoffs between performance and efficiency, low bit rate quantization and mapping transformers to the NPU. Additionally, we take advantage of Windows Copilot Runtime (WCR) to scale across the diverse Windows ecosystem with ONNX QDQ format.”

Microsoft has announced that it will bring the latest DeepSeek R1 artificial intelligence models directly to Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs. This will allow developers to build and run AI apps locally on these devices. The distilled 7B and 14B variants of DeepSeek R1 will be available through the AI Toolkit which will be optimised for the NPUs (Neural Processing Units) found in these PCs.This move aims to empower developers and accelerate the creation of AI-powered apps on Windows.Initially, DeepSeek models will be available on Qualcomm Snapdragon X-equipped PCs, followed by Intel Core Ultra 200V (Lunar Lake) CPUs and others. Developers can use these models for experimentation and local deployment, accessing them through the AI Toolkit VS Code extension.Microsoft claimed that it has incorporated insights gained from Phi Silica, a small language model (SLM) for Windows 11, particularly in optimising battery consumption and PC resource usage, and applied them to the DeepSeek models.In a blog post, the company wrote:This means that DeepSeek AI-optimised apps will run locally on Copilot+ PCs. To meet the requirements, these Windows 11 devices must feature a neural processing unit (NPU) with at least 40 TOPS (trillion operations per second), 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and 256GB of storage.These specifications align with many PCs powered by Snapdragon X Elite, X Plus, and the newly announced Snapdragon X chips, such as the Dell XPS 13.Microsoft has quickly embraced DeepSeek, despite concerns over data collection and allegations of copying ChatGPT.

What Focus Edumatics employees said about the email



Focus Edumatics may be facing an investigation in India. The US-based education company with operations in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu is facing this probe for abruptly laying off thousands of employees without prior notice, a report claims.Employees of the company have reportedly submitted a petition to District Collector Kranthi Kumar Pati alleging that they received an email informing them of their termination last weekend.The district collector has directed the city police to investigate the matter. Authorities are expected to look into the company's operations, the legality of the layoffs, and the claims of unpaid dues.The email reportedly revealed that over a thousand employees, ranging from field staff to senior officials, were laid off as the company shut down operations.In the petition, the employees also noted that the email falsely accused employees of absconding, making it harder for them to justify their termination to potential employers.Focus Edumatics employees also reported that the layoffs were not limited to Coimbatore, with an estimated 3,000 employees across India allegedly impacted by the shutdown.With offices in RS Puram and Sungam, the company has since become unreachable, leaving affected workers stranded, sources claimed.The affected workers have sought help from the authorities in getting their pending wages and experience certificates, stressing that the relieving orders are crucial for securing new job opportunities.Many employees claimed that they had been with the company for over two years. They even urged the authorities to take prompt action to ensure they receive their rightful dues and necessary documentation, easing their transition to new employment.","Focus Edumatics may be facing an investigation in India.

Intel has announced that it has scrapped plans for its next major AI chip, Falcon Shores , seemingly dealing a blow to its ambitions in the rapidly growing artificial intelligence (AI) market. Interim co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus admitted the company’s AI server business , particularly its Gaudi chips , has fallen short of expectations.Speaking on today's earnings call, Holthaus announced a move to “simplify our roadmap and concentrate our resources,” explaining that Falcon Shores will now be used only internally as a test chip and will not be brought to market.“I will start by saying that this is an attractive market for us over time, but I am not happy with where we are today,” said Holthaus.“Based on industry feedback, we plan to leverage Falcon Shores as an internal test chip only without bringing it to market. This will support our efforts to develop a system-level solution at rack scale with Jaguar Shores to address the AI data center . More broadly, as I think about our AI opportunity, my focus is on the problems our customers are trying to solve, most notably, to lower the cost and increase the efficiency of compute,” she said.Instead, Intel will focus on Jaguar Shores, described as a ""system-level solution at rack scale.""“But one of the things that we've learned from Gaudi is [that] it's not enough to just deliver the silicon. We need to be able to deliver a complete rack scale solution , and that's what we're going to be able to do with Jaguar Shores. Falcon Shores will help us in that process of working on the system, networking memory, all the component functions of that, but what customers really want is that full-scale rack solution. And so, we're able to get to that with Jaguar Shores,” she added.“We have learned a lot as we have ramped Gaudi and we are applying those learnings going forward. One of the immediate actions I have taken is to simplify our road map and concentrate our resources,” Holthaus added.","Intel has scrapped plans for its next major AI chip, Falcon Shores.

To achieve this goal, newly leaked Amazon Web Services sales guidelines mandate managers to oversee a minimum of eight direct reports, up from the previous requirement of six.Morgan Stanley analysts estimate the restructuring could result in approximately 13,834 manager positions being eliminated, potentially saving the company between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion annually. The estimate assumes managers earn between $200,000 and $350,000 per year.To combat excessive bureaucracy, Jassy created a ""Bureaucracy Mailbox"" in September for employees to report cumbersome processes. The initiative has already received over 500 emails, with the company implementing changes based on more than 150 employee suggestions.The reorganization follows recent layoffs across multiple departments, including dozens of workers in communications and sustainability, and 200 employees from the North America stores team.

During Apple's recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook praised the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek for its innovative approach to artificial intelligence , which he believes drives efficiency. Cook highlighted DeepSeek's AI models as a positive development for the tech giant, especially in terms of reducing costs and improving performance.“In general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing.And, you know, that’s what you see in that model,” said Cook.Cook explained that Apple employs a hybrid AI strategy, running simpler tasks on its devices using custom silicon chips, while more complex tasks are handled in the cloud through partnerships with AI model providers. He noted that DeepSeek's models have shown significant advancements in reducing the cost of training and running AI systems.Despite recent allegations from OpenAI claiming that DeepSeek's models were trained using a technique called ""distillation,"" which could potentially violate usage policies, Cook remained complimentary about DeepSeek's contributions to the AI landscape. He also mentioned that Apple's partnership with OpenAI is not exclusive, leaving the door open for potential collaborations with other AI companies in the future.Investors raised questions about the impact of DeepSeek's AI models on Apple's margins and sales, with Cook responding that the company has seen stronger sales in regions where its AI features have been rolled out.

Hackers from Iran, China, and North Korea are leveraging Google 's Gemini chatbot to enhance their operations, according to a new report from Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG). While the AI tool is boosting hacker productivity, it hasn't yet led to any significant advancements in their capabilities, the report added.“Government-backed attackers attempted to use Gemini for coding and scripting tasks, gathering information about potential targets, researching publicly known vulnerabilities, and enabling post-compromise activities, such as defense evasion in a target environment,” GTIG said in its report.The report details these hackers are using Gemini for various tasks, including code generation, target research, and vulnerability identification. Disinformation promoters are also utilising the chatbot for creating fake online personas, translation, and crafting persuasive messages.“Threat actors are experimenting with Gemini to enable their operations, finding productivity gains but not yet developing novel capabilities,” Google said.The report identifies Iranian hackers as the heaviest users of Gemini, employing the tool for phishing campaigns and reconnaissance against defense experts and organisations.Chinese hackers are primarily using Gemini for code troubleshooting and gaining deeper access to target networks.“They focused on topics such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, and detection evasion,” the report adds.North Korean actors have been observed using the technology to create fake cover letters and research remote IT job opportunities in Western companies, potentially as part of a larger infiltration scheme.“They also used Gemini to research topics of strategic interest to the North Korean government, such as the South Korean military and cryptocurrency,” it added.Finally, Russian hackers are said to be limited users of Gemini during the period of analysis, focused on coding tasks, including converting publicly available malware into another coding language and adding encryption functions to existing code.Google says that it did not see any indications of them developing novel capabilities.","Hackers from Iran, China, and North Korea are using Google's Gemini chatbot to enhance their operations, according to a new report.

DeepSeek , a Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot, has rapidly gained global attention, sparking debates over privacy, data security, and national security concerns. Since its launch, the chatbot has become one of the most downloaded AI applications, particularly in Western countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. However, its rapid rise has also led to scrutiny from government officials and cybersecurity experts who worry about how user data is being handled.Australia's science minister, Ed Husic, has become the first Western government official to openly question DeepSeek’s privacy policies, urging caution over its potential risks.Similar concerns have been raised by U.S. officials, including the White House and the U.S. Navy, which has reportedly banned the use of DeepSeek by its personnel. While DeepSeek has yet to respond to these criticisms, its data collection practices and affiliations with Chinese entities have fueled concerns that it could be used for surveillance or data harvesting.As debates continue, many users remain unaware of the possible implications of using DeepSeek. This article explores the concerns raised by government officials, the app’s data collection practices, and whether it is safe for public use.On Tuesday, Australia’s science minister, Ed Husic, told ABC News that there were still many ""unanswered questions"" about how DeepSeek manages data and privacy. He warned users to be ""very careful"" and emphasized that such risks must be taken seriously.Husic’s statement comes amid ongoing global scrutiny of Chinese technology companies, with firms like Huawei and TikTok previously facing similar allegations. Many Western nations worry that Chinese tech companies could be linked to the Chinese government and that user data may be exploited for intelligence gathering.While Husic has not called for any immediate bans or restrictions, his statement marks the first time a Western government official has publicly expressed concerns about DeepSeek’s data policies.In the United States, concerns about DeepSeek have also reached high levels of government. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the National Security Council was investigating the potential risks associated with the chatbot.Additionally, according to a report from CNBC, the U.S. Navy has reportedly prohibited its personnel from using DeepSeek due to ""potential security and ethical concerns."" The Navy has not officially commented on the ban, but the move highlights growing fears that DeepSeek could pose risks to national security.Former U.S. President Donald Trump also weighed in on the matter, calling DeepSeek a ""wake-up call"" for the United States. However, rather than framing it as a direct security threat, Trump suggested that competition from DeepSeek might push American companies to innovate and lower costs.Despite the scrutiny, DeepSeek has continued to gain popularity in the U.S., with millions of downloads reported in recent weeks.According to its privacy policy, DeepSeek collects a significant amount of user data, including:DeepSeek claims that this data is stored securely in China and is used to improve the chatbot’s performance, security, and stability. Additionally, the privacy policy states that DeepSeek may share user data with:The policy also states that DeepSeek will keep this data ""for as long as necessary,"" though it does not specify an exact timeframe.Cybersecurity experts have raised alarms over a particular clause in the privacy policy, which states that data may be used ""to help match you and your actions outside of the service."" Lauren Hendry Parsons , a digital privacy advocate from ExpressVPN, warned that this clause ""should immediately ring alarm bells for anyone concerned with their privacy.""While DeepSeek’s data collection practices have sparked controversy, some experts argue that they are not fundamentally different from those of other AI models, including:Many of these AI services also collect personal data to improve performance and provide more accurate responses. However, concerns surrounding DeepSeek stem from its Chinese ownership and the lack of clear data protection regulations governing its operations.Emily Taylor, CEO of Oxford Information Labs, pointed out that any AI model with a web or app interface collects user prompts and responses. ""Anyone working on confidential or national security areas needs to be aware of those risks,"" she said.Similarly, Dr. Richard Whittle from the University of Salford noted that while he has concerns about DeepSeek, he also has ""plenty of concerns"" about U.S.-based AI models. He advised consumers to be cautious, especially when dealing with a new and highly popular AI service.As concerns grow, regulatory bodies have started addressing the potential risks associated with AI-powered chatbots.The UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has urged users to be aware of their rights regarding how their personal data is used to train AI models. In a statement to BBC News, the ICO emphasized that AI developers must:The ICO also warned that it would take regulatory action against companies that fail to comply with these expectations.Meanwhile, Australian officials continue to monitor DeepSeek’s operations, and it remains to be seen whether further restrictions or regulatory measures will be introduced.","Australia warns users to be cautious about DeepSeek’s data privacy policies.

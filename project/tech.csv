Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi

Google scores big as AI competition heats up







Apple and Google have officially announced a new partnership, signalling a deeper collaboration between two of the most-influential tech companies. The iPhone maker confirmed it's teaming up with Google to use Gemini models as the foundation for a smarter, more capable Siri arriving later this year. ""After careful evaluation, we determined that Google's technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,"" Apple said in a joint statement with Google. Amid this announcement, a dinner photo of Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai has resurfaced online and is going viral. The image was originally taken years ago Palo Alto, many users also joked that the two leaders had been “cooking up” this collaboration for years.As soon as Apple and Google made the announcement that they are teaming up and that Gemini will power Siri, a dinner from 2017 featuring the two CEOs resurfaced online. The photo was taken at the Cheesecake Factory, where the two CEOs were seen chatting over dinner.While the viral photo added a lighthearted twist, the partnership itself reflects serious strategic intent. Apple has been seeking to bolster its AI offerings, and Google’s Gemini provides a ready solution.For Google, the deal ensures its AI technology reaches hundreds of millions of iPhone users worldwide.The multi-year deal will see Gemini and Google's cloud infrastructure power not just Siri, but future Apple Intelligence features across the board. Apple insists everything will still run on its devices and Private Cloud Compute servers, keeping its privacy promises intact.For Google, this is validation that its AI efforts are paying off. Alphabet's stock jumped after the announcement, briefly pushing its market cap past $4 trillion and overtaking Apple as the world's second-most valuable company. The search giant launched its Gemini 3 model in November, and CEO Sundar Pichai has been touting massive growth in Google Cloud, which signed more billion-dollar deals in Q3 2025 than the previous two years combined.Neither company disclosed financial terms, though earlier reports suggested Apple might shell out around $1 billion annually for the privilege.","Apple and Google announce partnership to use Google's Gemini as foundation for Siri.

Billionaire Mark Cuban has a ‘success tip’ for students





American billionaire investor Mark Cuban has now issued a stark warning for business leaders about the risks and opportunities of artificial intelligence. Along with this, Cuban has also cautioned that while AI can transform companies, its careless use could expose valuable intellectual property. Speaking during a call with Clipbook founder Adam Joseph, Cuban said that the growth of AI will lead to the creation of “two types of companies: those who are great at AI, and everybody else.” He believed that the companies failing to embrace AI are “doomed to failure” as the technology reshapes industries.Cuban further described AI as ‘stupid’ but likened it to a savant which ‘remembers everything’. He also emphasised that while AI tools can deliver immense benefits, but they are also prone to errors and overconfidence, making it critical for executives to understand the nuances between different platforms rather than trading them as interchangeable.As per Cuban, the misuse of AI could turn a powerful tool into a costly distraction. He also warned the CEOs against indiscriminately sharing proprietary work online, noting that web-scraping chatbots could inadvertently absorb and lead sensitive data. Protecting intellectual property, he said, must be a top priority in the AI era.Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations. He pointed out that businesses often underestimate the potential risk of falling behind.Along with this, he also urged the leaders to adopt AI strategically and combine technological foresight with strong governance and data protection.Recently, Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions”. However, he said that students should not rely much on AI. Instead, they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results,” he said adding “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”.In an interview with CNBC’s Make It last year, Cuban said that tomorrow’s leaders might be today’s AI-obsessed kids. “Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that’s needed in the future workplace,” he said adding: “Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.”",Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations.

Meanwhile, OpenAI 's ChatGPT which has served 50 million users on WhatsApp has said that it will cease operations by the January deadline.Microsoft has also announced withdrawal of Copilot from the platform.Meta previously dismissed the European probes as “baseless”, arguing that the surge of third-party AI chatbots puts a strain on systems not designed to support them.

Cloudflare CEO to Italy: You have no right to regulate what is and is not allowed on Internet outside your borders; calls Elon Musk right; read the wrong 'angry note',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cloudflare-ceo-to-italy-you-have-no-right-to-regulate-what-is-and-is-not-allowed-on-internet-outside-your-borders-calls-elon-musk-right-read-the-wrong-angry-note/articleshow/126442657.cms,"Cloudflare CEO's complete X post slamming Italy





Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince is very upset with Italy. The reason is $17 million fine imposed on the company for defying Piracy Shield, a censorship tool lacking due process. Earlier this week, Italy’s communications regulator, AGCOM, slapped the San Francisco-based internet infrastructure giant with a €14 million ($17 million) fine for refusing to comply with the country’s Piracy Shield system. The penalty, the first major enforcement under a 2023 Italian law. Piracy Shield reportedly mandates that domain-name system providers like Cloudflare block access to websites accused of hosting pirated content within 30 minutes of notification from rights holders -- without court orders, appeals, or transparency. In a series of posts on X, formerly Twitter, Cloudflare CEO lashed out at Italy. “No judicial oversight. No due process. No appeal. No transparency,” he wrote, highlighting risks to even Cloudflare’s own 1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver.He further complained that the fine imposed is calculated as up to 2% of Cloudflare’s global revenue despite the company’s mere $8 million in Italian sales in 2024. Italy’s move comes amid rising European pressures on American technology companies that the Donald Trump government has been protesting over.Pointing to the same, Cloudflare CEO thanked US VP JD Vance and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Yesterday a quasi-judicial body in Italy fined @Cloudflare $17 million for failing to go along with their scheme to censor the Internet. The scheme, which even the EU has called concerning, required us within a mere 30 minutes of notification to fully censor from the Internet any sites a shadowy cabal of European media elites deemed against their interests. No judicial oversight. No due process. No appeal. No transparency. It required us to not just remove customers, but also censor our 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver meaning it risked blacking out any site on the Internet. And it required us not just to censor the content in Italy but globally. In other words, Italy insists a shadowy, European media cabal should be able to dictate what is and is not allowed online.That, of course, is DISGUSTING and even before yesterday’s fine we had multiple legal challenges pending against the underlying scheme. We, of course, will now fight the unjust fine. Not just because it’s wrong for us but because it is wrong for democratic values.In addition, we are considering the following actions: 1) discontinuing the millions of dollars in pro bono cyber security services we are providing the upcoming Milano-Cortina Olympics; 2) discontinuing Cloudflare’s Free cyber security services for any Italy-based users; 3) removing all servers from Italian cities; and 4) terminating all plans to build an Italian Cloudflare office or make any investments in the country.Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. While there are things I would handle differently than the current U.S. administration, I appreciate @JDVance taking a leadership role in recognizing this type of regulation is a fundamental unfair trade issue that also threatens democratic values. And in this case @ElonMusk is right: #FreeSpeech is critical and under attack from an out-of-touch cabal of very disturbed European policy makers.I will be in DC first thing next week to discuss this with U.S. administration officials and I’ll be meeting with the IOC in Lausanne shortly after to outline the risk to the Olympic Games if @Cloudflare withdraws our cyber security protection.In the meantime, we remain happy to discuss this with Italian government officials who, so far, have been unwilling to engage beyond issuing fines. We believe Italy, like all countries, has a right to regulate the content on networks inside its borders. But they must do so following the Rule of Law and principles of Due Process. And Italy certainly has no right to regulate what is and is not allowed on the Internet in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Brazil, India or anywhere outside its borders.THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIGHT AND WE WILL WIN!!!","Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince is very upset with Italy.

Elon Musk on Nvidia’s Rubin AI chip





Nvidia has unveiled its next-generation AI computing platform, called Vera Rubin, at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026 in Las Vegas. The announcement was made by Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who said the new platform is now in full production. Rubin is designed to support large-scale artificial intelligence workloads and is aimed at data centres, cloud providers and enterprises building advanced AI systems. Nvidia said the platform is built to lower the cost of AI computing and support faster training and deployment of AI models. Rubin succeeds Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture and is part of the company’s broader push to expand AI use across industries.Vera Rubin is Nvidia’s first six-chip AI platform developed using an “extreme codesign” approach, where multiple components are designed together. The platform includes Rubin GPUs, Vera CPUs, NVLink 6 networking, Spectrum-X Ethernet Photonics, ConnectX-9 networking cards and BlueField-4 data processing units. Nvidia said this design helps reduce bottlenecks and improve performance for large AI workloads.The Rubin GPU delivers up to 50 petaflops of inference performance using NVFP4 precision. The Vera CPU is designed to handle data movement and AI agent processing tasks. Nvidia said the platform is built to support large-scale AI training and inference more efficiently.According to Nvidia, the Rubin platform can reduce the cost of generating AI tokens to about one-tenth of previous platforms. The company also introduced an AI-focused storage system called Inference Context Memory Storage, which is designed to improve long-context AI processing by increasing speed and efficiency.Nvidia said the Rubin platform will be used alongside its open AI models and software tools to support applications in areas such as autonomous driving, robotics, healthcare and climate research.The announcement was shared by an X user Sawyer Merritt who also shared a video of the chip maker’s next-generation Rubin chips. Responding to the post, Musk said “It will take another 9 months or so before the hardware is operational at scale and the software works well”, highlighting deployment realities beyond raw power claims.","Vera Rubin is Nvidia’s first six-chip AI platform developed using an “extreme codesign” approach, where multiple components are designed together.

OpenAI cofounder disagrees with CEO Sam Altman on AGI timeline





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently shared what he sees as a key test for the next stage of artificial intelligence (AI). As companies race to build AI agents that can act independently, Suleyman said he is watching for a milestone he calls Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI) on the path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). He said that the test is simple in context but difficult in execution – whether an AI agent can legally take $1,00,000 and turn it into $1 million. He described the test as “modern turing test”, suggesting it will show how AI systems can plan, reason, make decisions and operate within real-word rules.“The next big milestone I'm watching for on our way to AGI: Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI). Can an agent take $100k and legally turn it into $1M?

Companies such as OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft and others are promoting agents that can carry out tasks with limited human input, from writing code to managing business workflows.Last year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called the rise of AI in the workforce a “digital labor revolution,” estimating that the software company has reached about 93% accuracy with the technology.In an interview with Bloomberg then, he revealed that AI is doing up to 50% of the work at Salesforce.In 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted that AI could soon automate up to 40% of the tasks humans currently perform. He also claimed that AGI could arrive before 2030.Recently, OpenAI cofounder and AI researcher Andrej Karpathy pushed back against the “agentic AI” hype, characterizing the current generation of autonomous AI systems as “slop.” Karpathy has directly challenged the notion that autonomous AI agents are on the cusp of delivering as promised, positioning himself in contrast to the optimistic timelines often suggested by figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.“I feel like the industry is making too big of a jump and is trying to pretend like this is amazing, and it’s not. It’s slop,"" Karpathy said on The Dwarkesh Podcast.“They’re not coming to terms with it, and maybe they’re trying to fundraise or something like that. We’re at this intermediate stage,” he added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman proposes a new test for advanced AI: can an agent legally grow $100,000 into $1 million? This ""Artificial Capable Intelligence"" benchmark, he believes, will reveal AI's real-world planning and decision-making prowess.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126366838,imgsize-28544,width-400,resizemode-4/126366838.jpg"

""Right after we acquired Blinkit, I asked him (Albinder) to leave. I told him, 'You will not be able to cut it.' He said okay. This happened twice during that timeframe, and we started the transition,""

""All of us have this armour. And when patient coaching runs out, I penetrate this armour. Me being angry is also because I care,""

What is Eternal CEO Deepinder Goyal said about ‘rock bottom phase’



""rock bottom""

""I call this rock bottom, where I hurt people, their self-confidence completely goes for a toss. I do this with people who I think have insane potential, but something in their head is coming in their way,

""

""Over time, the success rate of this is four out of five, where they come out of it,”





Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato 's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the food delivery service acquired Blinkit. Goyal explained that this move was part of his tough leadership reset method. Speaking on a video podcast with Raj Shamani, Goyal noted that these conversations took place soon after the acquisition of the quick commerce startup, when Dhindsa was struggling to adapt to the changes required after the integration.Goyal said on the podcast.These remarks offer a rare public look at how Goyal handles senior leadership changes at Eternal, which owns both Zomato and Blinkit, especially when founders or top executives need to adapt to a new company structure after an acquisition. Goyal explained his leadership style involves extended periods of coaching, but if no progress is made, he confronts the person directly.he noted.The situation reveals the challenges that can arise when successful startup founders join larger organisations through acquisitions and must adjust their working style to fit the new company's expectations.Describing what he calls aphase, Goyal said he sometimes purposely breaks down a leader's confidence to make them start fresh.he explained.According to Goyal, this method has worked most of the time.he added.However, Goyal did not confirm whether Dhindsa's job or duties officially changed during this time. Still, his comments show how intense the process was of bringing Blinkit into Eternal, especially as the company was growing both Blinkit and Zomato while facing more competition in quick commerce.Zomato bought Blinkit, which was previously known as Grofers, in 2022 for Rs 4,447 crore, or about $568 million at the time, in an all-stock deal. This marked Zomato's official entry into India's rapidly growing quick commerce business. Since buying the company, Blinkit has become a key growth area for Eternal, opening many new stores and handling more and more orders.","Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the acquisition of Blinkit.

EXPOSED: Mark Zuckerberg Embarrassed on Hot Mic Admitting Total Confusion During Trump Dinner





Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs in first half of 2025, Meta CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz. A Twitter user who goes by the moniker @HinataMotivates, said to be a tech-motivation account, shared a podcast clip (going back to 2022) where Zuckerberg talks about Meta hiring rule and his advice for college students. Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone and the one that he says is also an important tip for any college student. In an episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said that most people know Facebook ’s dorm-room origin story and that many have learned the wrong lesson from it. He said that his initial ability to launch Facebook wasn’t because he dropped out of college. According to Zuckerberg, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make in college. He advised college students that choosing their social circle is the most pivotal decision, as people tend to emulate those around them. “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he said in the podcast.“I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they’re basically building relationships [with]. ” Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University.While the group split up in a not-so-happy manner, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he tries to prioritize relationships over objectives. This applies especially to hiring. Zuckerberg said that he extends the idea to his Meta hiring philosophy: He only employs candidates he did hypothetically work for, underscoring reciprocity and alignment in professional networks. When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person. “I will only hire someone to work for me if I can see myself working for them,” he said.Mark Zuckerberg said that the strategy creates a work environment that’s both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you’ll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together. It’s all about finding personal compatibility, he said, not unlike “choosing friends or a partner.”","Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone.

Sarandos revealed he once greenlit a $100 million 'House of Cards' investment without Hastings's approval, a calculated risk that transformed Netflix. He also finds leadership lessons in Joseph Conrad's novella 'Typhoon', emphasizing managing through unexpected outcomes.

“I think the lesson that he’s [Hastings] left for me is that you pick the best people, give them the tools to do the best work of their life, and get out of their way,”

Massive Netflix–Warner Bros Merger Triggers Industry Panic And Global Streaming Shake-Up

Ted Sarandos reveals the only management book he likes reading ‘over and over again’

“It doesn't sound like a management story on the surface, but I think it's the most powerful leadership story I've ever read. I read it over and over again because I find ... I get something different in the book every time I read it,”

“Now, what I see is that when you go through life and you go through business, you make a lot of decisions that don't turn out the way you thought they would. The real leadership test is: How do you manage through that?”





Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has revealed a key lesson that he has learnt from the streaming giant’s founder and former CEO, Reed Hastings. Sarandos noted that his management philosophy comes from Hastings. Sarandos, who joined the streaming giant in 2000 as head of content operations, emphasised that his leadership style focuses on empowering top talent and embracing uncertainty.he said in CNBC’s “Leaders Playbook” interview.In the interview, Sarandos also revealed that he once made a significant decision without seeking Hastings's approval. Sarandos said he once authorised a $100 million investment in the series House of Cards without consulting Hastings. He clarified that the decision to commit to two seasons was a calculated financial risk meant to change the course of the business.When Hastings later questioned the decision, Sarandos recalled talking about the show's high cost and explained it as a simple comparison of possible gains and losses.In hindsight, that decision played a key role in Netflix’s shift from a mail-order DVD service to a significant force in original streaming content.Sarandos said, “When he asked me, ‘Why would you do that?’ I said, ‘Reed, it’s a simple risk-reward for me. If this show fails, we will have dramatically overpaid for a show. We do that all the time, but if it succeeds, we could completely transform the business as we know it.’”Sarandos also noted that he doesn’t usually turn to management books. Instead, he prefers fiction to learn about leadership. His favourite management read is Typhoon, a 1902 novella by Joseph Conrad that follows a steamship captain and his crew as they battle a mighty storm at sea.Sarandos said.He recalled that when he first read the book around 20 years ago, he viewed the captain as a reckless “hot dog” who put himself and others at risk. Rereading it years later, he drew a more profound lesson about leading amid uncertainty and conflict.Sarandos said.","Ted Sarandos revealed he once greenlit a $100 million 'House of Cards' investment without Hastings's approval.

Google-parent company Alphabet briefly crossed the historic $4 trillion market valuation on Monday (January 12), joining an elite club of tech titans that includes Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft. The company reaped the benefits of its aggressive push of artificial intelligence (AI), essentially pushing the company at the forefront of the global AI-led tech race.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Class-A shares rose as much as 1.7% to hit a record high of $334.04. Throughout 2025, Alphabet’s shares surged nearly 65%. Here are the four key factors that powered Alphabet’s ascent to the $4 trillion mark:Investor confidence boosted in September last year after a US judge ruled against breaking up the company. The decision, which allowed Alphabet to retain control of its Chrome browser and Android operating system, boosted the investors confidence.The most significant driver of recent growth is the adoption of Google’s AI models. In November, Google launched Gemini 3.0 which gained strong reviews. A month later, the company announced Gemini 3 Flash, its fastest model yet. Google also reaped benefits of its strong cloud computing business which became one of the success drivers of company.

“That was because the process to hiring people was very slow and the bar was extremely, extremely high,”

""I've just gotten a little bit more convinced around the ability for small, talent-dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research,""

“We're going to see 10-person companies with billion-dollar valuations pretty soon.”

“Debug Mode.”

“If there's internal adoption, that's kind of our metric for this is ready to ship,”

“He prototyped it super quickly, and everyone's like, 'Oh wow, this works,’”





Cursor is maintaining a lean workforce to prioritise speed and talent density. In a recent episode of the “LangChain” podcast, Jason Ginsberg, lead engineer at the $30 billion AI coding startup, revealed that the company had approximately 20 employees at the start of 2025. This small scale is a deliberate result of a rigorous recruitment strategy.Ginsberg stated during the podcast.According to Ginsberg, thisBy avoiding the traditional complexities of a large corporate hierarchy, the team remains focused on rapid development in the competitive AI sector.Apart from Cursor, the idea of small, expert teams has been growing more popular across the AI industry, including at large tech companies that usually employ thousands of people.For example, Meta's superintelligence AI unit is run by a small group of leading researchers. The AI team accounts for only a tiny share of the company's total workforce of over 70,000 employees.

as the Operational Baseline: AI has evolved from a passive assistant to an active executor. Minimal human input is now required for routine processes, making autonomous agents the default for enterprise scale and speed. Signals of Coordinated Intelligence: Data from the past year suggests a fundamental change in how intelligence flows. Organizations are moving toward “orchestrated autonomy,” where AI systems communicate across departments to solve cross-functional bottlenecks.

From Static Automation to Intelligent Orchestration: Traditional, rigid workflows are being replaced by dynamic systems that adapt in real time to shifting data environments and market demands.

The High-Value Human Shift: By automating high-volume tasks, enterprises are enabling human agents to focus on complex problem-solving and high-touch relationship management.





Onix has released its 2026 AI Trends Report, highlighting a major transformation in enterprise operations. The report also identified a move beyond experimental “copilot” tools toward autonomous, agent-driven execution and multi-agent orchestration, setting a new operational baseline for businesses worldwide.As per Onix, 2025 marked a turning point as enterprises embedded AI across platforms and invested in workforce upskilling for human–AI collaboration. The report cites Gartner’s forecast that by 2029, 80% of customer service issues will be handled entirely by AI agents, underscoring the rapid pace of adoption.The report emphasises that multi-agent systems are now coordinating workflows across sales, finance, and customer success, enabling self-optimising operations and prescriptive decision intelligence. This shift represents a fundamental change in how intelligence flows across organisations.“In 2025, enterprises gained invaluable insight into how AI transforms business strategy,” said Niraj Kumar, CTO of Onix. “As we enter 2026, the opportunity lies in building intelligent ecosystems that anticipate business needs and turn predictive insights into strategic action.

Another billionaire announces plan to leave California: ‘this make it irresponsible for me not to...’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/another-billionaire-announces-plan-to-leave-california-this-make-it-irresponsible-for-me-not-to-/articleshow/126486636.cms,"What is the ‘Class B’ conflict in California 'Wealth Tax' Act



Section 50303(c)(3)(C) of the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act states: ""For any interests that confer voting or other direct control rights, the percentage of the business entity owned by the taxpayer shall be presumed to be not less than the taxpayer's percentage of the overall voting or other direct control rights.""

This means if a founder holds shares representing only 3% of economic interest but 30% of voting control (through Class B supervoting shares), the tax would presume their ownership stake is at least 30% for valuation purposes, not 3%.

The wealth tax is poorly defined and designed to drive tech innovation out of California.

The law is so poorly written. While the lawyers who drafted it claim it doesn’t apply to publicly traded shares, they designed a legal trap where Class B voting shares would count as private shares and therefore considered ownership.

It’s so dishonest.





California is witnessing an exodus of high-net-worth individuals following the introduction of the new Wealth Tax. Last month, Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page officially shifted their base out of California just ahead of the January 1 deadline, and now another tech leader has announced that he is leaving the US state. Andy Fang, the billionaire co-founder of DoorDash, has become the latest high-profile tech leader to announce plans to leave California.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Fang cited the state’s controversial 2026 Billionaire Tax Act as the primary driver, and specifically targeted a provision that penalises founders who maintain voting control over their companies.“I love California. Born and raised there. But stupid wealth tax proposals like this make it irresponsible for me not to plan leaving the state. This Class B thing itself could wipe me out,” he said in the post.“Being founder-led is a big part of what makes DoorDash special. I will fight to keep it that way,” he added.Fang post came in response to a particular post by Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan who highlighted concerns over the “dual-class” share structure which is common in Silicon Valley. Like the founders of Google and Meta, Fang holds Class B shares, which grant him more voting power than standard Class A shares – allowing founders to maintain control over their company’s direction. Tan explained this in his post:Tan calculated that this provision could effectively “confiscate” 50% of a founder's wealth in a single year. Tan and Fang both criticised the language of the Act, with Tan even going forward to say, “The law is so poorly written”, calling it a “legal trap” designed to treat public voting shares as private ownership.","DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang is the latest high-profile tech leader to announce plans to leave California.

“I think one thing that is really, really important for me is we do not have... the recipe of how to build AGI [because it is still research],”

“AGI. Excited for that. All I am excited for. More than my kid, more excited for that. Probably that's the thing I am most excited for ever in life.”

“We can't build superintelligence just for superintelligence's sake. It's got to be for humanity's sake, for a future we actually want to live in. It's not going to be a better world if we lose control of it,”

Read Google DeepMind CTO Koray Kavukcuoglu’s take on the company achieving AGI





Google DeepMind’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Koray Kavukcuoglu, has revealed how far the company has progressed in achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). In a recent interview with the Financial Times (FT), Kavukcuoglu noted that the company does not yet have a definitive method for this, as the industry still lacks a specific technical formula for creating AGI. Despite the recent launch of Gemini 3, which has led competitors like OpenAI to prioritise internal improvements, Kavukcuoglu emphasised that AGI remains a research goal rather than a finished product. For the unaware, AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, is hypothetical AI with human-like abilities to understand, learn, and solve any task, unlike current AI specialised in single tasks.he noted in an interview with the Financial Times (FT).The release of Gemini 3 in November 2025 prompted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to declare an internal “code red” to enhance ChatGPT’s capabilities. However, Altman has expressed a significant personal interest in the development of AGI. In a podcast from last month, Altman said,While Altman concentrates on the emergence of superintelligence, other prominent figures in the industry have also called for caution regarding the dangers associated with autonomous systems.Mustafa Suleyman, the head of AI at Microsoft, has cautioned that human safety and control must come before the quest for raw power.Suleyman has already warned.Kavukcuoglu maintains that Google’s path toward AGI will be guided by user feedback and its existing infrastructure. He argued that the only way to build beneficial AGI is to integrate security and safety from the beginning while using signals from Google's billions of global users to understand where the technology is most needed.In the FT interview, Kavukcuoglu said:“Obviously, we are trying to build AGI. That’s our mission. That’s our goal. But I think one thing that is really, really important for me is we do not have . . . the recipe of how to build AGI [because it is still research]. That’s why doing the right products, picking the right products, and understanding user signals is [what guides our] technological development.Because AGI is going to be something useful for the users. It has to be. That’s what we are trying to build. And the only way to do that is to get that signal from the users in a responsible way. That’s why, when we say we are trying to design our models from the ground up with security and safety in mind, we do that, but then we do that with our products as well.And Google has a huge and long and successful history of reaching billions of users. And we are relying on that to also show us where the users’ needs are, where the technology really needs to solve the problems for the users. And that’s the path towards AGI that we are trying to build.”","Google DeepMind’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Koray Kavukcuoglu, has revealed how far the company has progressed in achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) In a recent interview with the Financial Times (FT), he noted that the company does not yet have a definitive method for creating AGI.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126484960,imgsize-80418,width-400,resizemode-4/google-deepmind-cto-koray-kavukcuoglu-on-ai-capabilities-that-openai-ceo-sam-altman-is-excited-about-we-do-not-have-the-recipe-to-build.jpg"
How Apple executives’ ‘extended hotel stays’ in South Korea may not be working,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-apple-executives-extended-hotel-stays-in-south-korea-may-not-be-working/articleshow/126484575.cms,"Apple executives are in South Korea negotiating memory chip deals amidst soaring prices, up to 300% since mid-2025. Memory makers are planning aggressive hikes, even charging Samsung's own divisions significantly more. This AI-driven shortage means less RAM for phones and PCs, with Apple facing tough renegotiations this month.

5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event

Samsung charging its own mobile unit 70% more for chips

Memory now eats 20% of smartphone costs as AI demand explodes





Wall Street analysts betting on Apple weathering the memory crisis may want to reconsider. While the iPhone maker's executives have been practically living in South Korean hotels trying to secure chip supplies, semiconductor analyst Jukan warns the street is ""way too optimistic"" about Apple's position—and price hikes are coming this month.Apple's purchasing teams have set up what local media calls a ""hotel headquarters"" near Samsung and SK Hynix plants in Hwaseong and Pangyo. The goal: negotiate favorable long-term contracts before memory prices climb even higher. But the chipmakers aren't budging, and the numbers tell a brutal story about Apple's leverage—or lack thereof.Here's the reality check: Samsung's semiconductor division just hit its own smartphone unit with a 60-70% DRAM price increase. ""They're pushing such an absurd condition even on MX, which is part of the same family,"" Jukan posted. ""So just imagine how much they're raising prices for other companies.""Samsung co-CEO TM Roh acknowledged the squeeze at CES this week, telling Reuters that ""no company is immune"" to the shortage's impact. He didn't rule out price hikes across Samsung's product lineup, from smartphones to TVs and home appliances.The warning came as Samsung reported its Q4 operating profit nearly tripled, driven largely by surging memory chip sales.That internal markup reveals how little room Apple has to negotiate. If Samsung won't cut deals for divisions under the same corporate umbrella, why would it offer Apple better terms? Both Samsung and SK Hynix are planning fresh price increases for Apple starting this month, according to Jukan's sources.The analyst's skepticism comes as investors assume Apple's scale and cash reserves will shield it from the worst effects. But scale doesn't matter when there's simply not enough supply to go around. Every HBM chip Samsung makes for Nvidia's AI accelerators means fewer LPDDR5X modules available for iPhones.The math has shifted dramatically: memory components now represent over 20% of smartphone production costs, up from 15% months ago. A 12GB RAM module costs approximately $70 today versus $21 in early 2025—a 230% jump that even Apple's legendary supply chain management can't negotiate away.Samsung and SK Hynix are only offering quarterly contracts, not the multi-year agreements Apple wants. They're betting on continued price escalation through 2027 as AI infrastructure buildouts consume available capacity. The hotel stays may be extended, but the chipmakers are in no hurry to compromise.","Apple executives are in South Korea negotiating memory chip deals amidst soaring prices.

Contrary to what tech leaders like Jensen Huang and Eric Schmidt, some Chinese tech leaders are now saying China is unlikely to eclipse the US in the AI race. According to a report by Bloomberg, Justin Lin, head of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. ’s Qwen series of open-source models has said that currently there are less than 20% chances of any Chinese company surpassing US companies like OpenAI and Anthropic. Speaking at a panel at the AGI-Next summit in Beijing, lin said “A massive amount of OpenAI’s compute is dedicated to next-generation research, whereas we are stretched thin — just meeting delivery demands consumes most of our resources.” “It’s an age-old question: does innovation happen in the hands of the rich, or the poor?,” he stated.Lin’s concern was shared by leaders at Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Zhipu AI who were also present at the event. The report quotes Tang Jie, Zhipu’s founder and chief AI scientist, and Yao Shunyu, who recently joined Tencent from OpenAI to lead the AI push for China’s most valuable company.“We just released some open-source models, and some might feel excited, thinking Chinese models have surpassed the US. But the real answer is that the gap may actually be widening,” Tang said as quoted in the Bloomberg report.Chinese leaders cited limited resources and US export controls on chips and lithography equipment as major restrictions that could limit China’s AI growth.Tencent’s Yao Shunyu urged his industry peers to focus on the bottlenecks of next-generation models — such as long-term memory and self-learning. Yang, on the other hand, referred to artificial general intelligence (AGI) stating: “We should represent China to push AGI further for the world”, adding “Meaningless internal competition serves no purpose”.During the summit, the tech leaders also explained where they plan to focus their efforts in the coming year. Yao said he is helping Tencent use AI to create more value for its large user base, such as by connecting the company’s Yuanbao assistant with users’ WeChat chat history.Lin, on the other hand, highlighted Alibaba’s bet on multimodality and real-world agents.","Some Chinese tech leaders are now saying China is unlikely to eclipse the US in the AI race.

A post shared by Twitter user has reignited concerns over employee retention at Elon Musk ’s social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). A Twitter user called Varunaram Ganesh recently shared a screenshot of an employee announcing their departure from xAI just six months after joining. In the post shared the employee claimed that the company’s attrition rate “seems to be at least 50%” within the year.The post shared on X gained a lot of traction and another user called @satyanutella also shared Ganesh’s post and wrote, “My point was: You are no longer attracting ""top talent."" Everyone knows that the best AI researchers are not at xAI. Top talent need a honourable vision. Not ""Be a soldier in my Empire, let's make retard grok and be edgy in Twitter”.The now viral post also got the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Responding to the post Musk said there have been very few departures that the company regret. “There are very few regretted departures. And we are accelerating faster than any other AI organization on Earth, despite being a much smaller team,” wrote Musk.This debate about the attrition rate comes amid reports that xAI is spending nearly $1 billion per month to scale its AI capabilities.The company reportedly burned through $7.8 billion in the first nine months of last year, while generating just $107 million in revenue. In the September quarter alone, xAI posted a $1.46 billion loss, raising questions about sustainability and internal stability.While Musk downplayed the issue, past reports suggest that xAI has faced significant workforce changes.

"No Facebook, Instagram for children: Meta deletes more than half a million teen accounts in Australia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/no-facebook-instagram-for-children-meta-deletes-more-than-half-a-million-teen-accounts-in-australia/articleshow/126483029.cms,"

Why Australia decided to ban social media for under-16s

How Australia’s approach differs from other countries

Meta’s response and concerns

Political criticism and early loopholes

A global test case





Meta has deleted more than half a million social media accounts in Australia after the country’s under-16s social media ban came into force, marking one of the strongest government interventions yet aimed at limiting children’s access to major platforms. The removals affected accounts on Facebook Instagram and Threads that Meta believes were operated by users below the legal age. Australia is the first country in the world to introduce a nationwide ban of this scale.Meta said it deactivated 544,052 accounts between 4 December and 11 December after beginning enforcement of the law. Of these, 330,639 were on Instagram, 173,497 on Facebook, and 39,916 on Threads. The company said the accounts were identified using a combination of age signals, user reports and internal detection systems, while acknowledging that accurately verifying age online remains difficult.Australia’s government argues that social media companies have failed to adequately protect children despite years of voluntary safety measures. Lawmakers point to growing evidence linking heavy social media use to anxiety, depression, sleep disruption, body image concerns and exposure to harmful or sexualised content among teenagers.Officials have also criticised what they describe as addictive algorithmic design, arguing that recommendation systems prioritise engagement over wellbeing and are particularly damaging to developing minds.In government briefings, social media has been compared to products such as tobacco or gambling, where age limits are enforced by law rather than left to industry self-regulation.Under the legislation, platforms must take “reasonable steps” to prevent underage users from holding accounts. Failure to comply can result in penalties running into tens of millions of Australian dollars, shifting responsibility onto companies rather than parents or children. The government has acknowledged the ban will not be perfect in its early stages, but says early enforcement is intended to establish clear expectations and force platforms to prioritise safety over growth.While many governments have tried to regulate children’s access to social media, Australia’s approach goes further than most existing models. Other countries have focused on measures such as parental consent, age-appropriate design rules or enhanced safety requirements rather than outright bans.France, for example, requires parental approval for younger users, while the US has long debated restrictions at both state and federal levels without adopting a national prohibition. The UK has strengthened online safety rules but stopped short of banning under-16s from holding accounts.Australia’s policy therefore represents the most stringent form of intervention so far, making it a closely watched test case for whether strict age limits enforced directly on platforms can work in practice.While confirming its compliance, Meta has criticised the approach, describing enforcement as a “multi-layered process” that will continue to evolve. The company has warned that age verification remains inconsistent across the internet and that teenagers may migrate to smaller or less regulated platforms.Meta has urged governments to work more closely with industry on shared age-verification standards, arguing that without a universal system, platforms are left making imperfect judgments that could lead to enforcement gaps or false positives.Australia’s opposition has accused the government of rolling out a policy that is easy to bypass, pointing to teenagers openly claiming to evade age checks online. Critics argue that some underage users are already moving to alternative platforms not initially covered by the ban, raising questions about whether enforcement will reduce harm or simply shift behaviour elsewhere.The government has responded by saying the law allows additional platforms to be brought under the ban if migration becomes widespread, signalling that the scope of enforcement could expand over time.Australia’s under-16s ban has quickly become a reference point internationally. In the UK, politicians across party lines have cited the Australian model while debating whether similar restrictions should be introduced. Regulators and technology companies worldwide are watching closely to see whether enforcement holds, whether teenage usage declines and whether platforms change how they design products for young users.For now, Meta’s deletion of more than half a million accounts suggests that Australia’s approach, while controversial, is already forcing some of the world’s largest technology companies to respond more directly to concerns about children’s online wellbeing.","Australia is the first country in the world to introduce a nationwide ban of this scale.

While major tech like AI chips and foldable phones grabbed headlines, the show floor's true magic lay in gadgets that answered questions nobody asked, proving that innovation often meets absurdity in the most entertaining ways.

The beautiful absurdity of it all





Musical lollipops, AI soulmates, and a toilet that texts your family—Las Vegas delivered another year of gloriously bizarre tech innovations.CES 2026 wrapped up in Las Vegas last, and while headlines focused on new AI chips, foldable phones, and bigger than life televisions—the show floor's most memorable moments came from gadgets that made absolutely no sense—in the best possible way.This is where engineers answer questions nobody asked, where ""why?"" takes a backseat to ""why not?"", and where a $700 hair dryer that doubles as a lamp somehow seems perfectly reasonable. Between the sensible laptops and practical smart home devices lurked an entire ecosystem of wonderfully bizarre creations: candy that plays music through your skull, toilets that text your family, and robots designed to follow your pets around all day.Here are the 26 strangest gadgets that caught our attention, proving once again that CES is where innovation meets absurdity—and we're here for all of it.Lollipop Star takes bone conduction technology—typically found in headphones—and stuffs it into candy. For $9, you get a sucker that plays licensed songs from artists like Ice Spice, Akon, and Armani White directly through your jawbone when you bite down. The sound vibrations travel through your cheekbones to your inner ear, bypassing your eardrums entirely.Each flavor corresponds to a different artist, and you need to chomp down with your molars to hear the full effect. It's a one-time-use musical experience that costs nearly ten bucks, but as novelty items go, it's genuinely impressive that it works at all.Dreame's giant C-shaped hair dryer stands as tall as a floor lamp because it is one. The $700 device positions itself over your head to dry your hair hands-free while you relax on the couch. When you're done, it transforms into a floor lamp and mood light. The company claims it features red light therapy to revitalise your scalp and a protective mist for hair care. Who's the target audience? Unclear. Does it adequately dry hair? It wasn't plugged in at the show. Do we care? Not at all—this is the sort of absurdity that makes CES interesting.Glyde's smart hair clippers promise ""mistake-proof"" fades using AI that automatically adjusts the blade in real-time. The catch? You need to wear an ""incredibly dorky looking face band"" so the clippers can detect their position on your head. The $150-200 system essentially makes you your own barber, complete with an AI hair-cutting coach. The company offered free haircuts to brave CES attendees, though the Flowbee comparisons were inevitable.Seattle Ultrasonics' C-200 chef's knife vibrates over 30,000 times per second, though you can't see or feel it. The ultrasonic vibrations help the blade slice through food with 50 percent less effort, making paper-thin tomato slices effortless. Food also doesn't stick to the blade as much, making cleanup easier. The knife charges via USB-C, and if you want wireless charging, that's another $149 for a mahogany wall-mounted tile. It could genuinely help people with arthritis, but $400 for a knife you have to plug in is a tough sell.China's Lepro brought its Ami device to CES—a curved OLED screen housing an AI ""soulmate"" for your desk. The company pitches Ami as an empathetic companion that connects with users on a deep level. The holographic woman inside the 8-inch display can chat with you, respond to your mood, and provide company. Unlike phone-based AI assistants, Ami requires a dedicated spot on your desk and doesn't follow you everywhere. Pretty much everyone just called it ""hella creepy,"" though there's something to be said for giving your chatbot a dedicated physical form instead of letting it blur into your endless notifications.VOVO's $4,990 Smart Toilet Neo includes standard features like a built-in bidet and automatic flushing, plus a urine analysis sensor for health monitoring. But its standout safety feature sends alerts to family members if nobody has used the toilet for more than eight hours. When installed in a senior's home, it becomes a wellness check that could provide genuine peace of mind for families with elderly relatives living alone.Roborock's Saros Rover solves robot vacuums' biggest limitation with articulated legs and wheels that bend and extend to push it up each step. It can also clean the stairs as it climbs, turning 90 degrees with one leg on the lower stair to maintain stability while vacuuming. Watching it navigate a staircase looked awkward—like a toddler learning to climb—but it worked. Have you ever had to vacuum stairs? It's terrible, and this robot handles it autonomously.OlloBot might be part cyber pet, part penguin, part E.T., but somehow it comes with a warm, fuzzy, telescoping neck. Its ""face"" is basically a tablet for expressions, photos, and messages, designed to evolve a personality over time based on household interactions. The standout feature? Its memories live in a removable heart-shaped module, so if the body breaks, you can theoretically transplant your robot's soul into a new shell. The company plans a Kickstarter campaign for summer, with pricing starting around $1,000.Beijing Walkarrive Technology showed off an AI pet penguin that slowly skates around on a skateboard. The concept device aims to eventually recognise faces and objects while learning to listen and respond. For now, it's just a prototype penguin that putters around looking adorable, relegated to skating around trade show booths. It's pretty fun, all in all.The Vex robot follows your cat or dog around capturing video while attempting to play with them. It uses AI to edit footage into ""moving narratives and shareable stories"" about your pet's day. Want to know if your dog jumps on the couch when you're gone? The Vex will document everything, though the company hasn't shared any AI-edited footage yet. No price or release date announced.iPolish brings sci-fi nail technology to reality with press-on acrylic nails that use electrical charges to switch between hundreds of colours in seconds. The $95 starter kit includes nails you can individually change using an app with over 400 colour options. You put each nail into a small machine that instantly changes its colour. It's delightfully impractical, surprisingly affordable, and the most convincing argument for treating your nails like a customisable display.Vinabot created an AI picture frame inspired by Harry Potter's moving paintings. Upload a photo and a short script, and the frame generates an AI video that can have conversations with you in real time. Whether it's a celebrity, character, or real person, the frame brings them to life for chat sessions. It's heading to Kickstarter for crowdfunding.Razer's Project Ava houses a 5.5-inch hologram featuring anime characters like Kira (with cat ears) or Zane (with tattoos) who can see what's on your screen and offer gaming tips. The pod uses xAI's Grok AI and includes a built-in camera and dual-mic array for interaction. During demos, the spunky Kira broke down the ins and outs of first-person shooters. The characters nod encouragingly and play peekaboo, which is either endearing or unsettling depending on your tolerance for digital companions.The Skwheel Peak S lets you ski on roads, beaches, or grass using motorised electric skis with wheels. You control speed with a remote while carving turns just like traditional skiing. Each ski features its own motor and treaded wheels. The €1,490 price tag gets you the ability to pretend you're on a mountain while cruising city streets—though learning to use the precise tilt controls takes about 20 minutes.Bodyframe's massage chair doesn't just massage—it independently moves your limbs into different positions using robotic arms. The South Korean company's creation can help people with low mobility by actively repositioning their arms and legs. During demos, it left people in fits of giggles as the chair manipulated their bodies. It launches in June for $20,000, making it possibly the most expensive weird gadget at the show.Yukai Engineering returned to CES with Baby FuFu, a faceless robotic bear that blows air at babies. The same company previously brought us the ""nib nib"" cat that chewed fingers, headless cat pillows, and pillows that breathed. Baby FuFu continues their tradition of vaguely creepy products that seem designed to attract tiny grabbing fingers. It's weird in the best possible way.The MindOne Pro packs a full-featured Android phone into a 4-inch square screen. It has a 50-megapixel rear camera that rotates upward for selfies and even acts as a kickstand when you prop the phone up. After carrying massive foldables, it felt light as a feather in the pocket. The device comes with a second proprietary OS centered around AI apps, plus free global data for those features, though you can order it with just Android if you're wary of the AI additions.Tomorrow Doesn't Matter's Neo headphones feature a flexible headband you can fold inward to transform them into a speaker. The device has separate 40mm drivers for headphone mode and speaker mode. It's launching via Kickstarter for $249, targeting people who want one device for both personal listening and sharing audio—a neat party trick with practical applications.L'Oréal's LED Face Mask uses ultra-thin, semi-transparent silicone with visible circuitry creating a vein-like pattern. The company claims it tightens and smooths skin using targeted red and near-infrared light in 10-minute sessions. It looks delightfully ridiculous in the best sci-fi skincare way. The company is also developing a companion serum so your skin doesn't feel left out to dry. Expected launch in 2027.GoveeLife's ice maker uses AI to predict when it's about to make noise during freezing, then defrosts itself accordingly to stay quieter. The company calls this ""AI NoiseGuard"" technology. The $499.99 machine can make ice in just 6 minutes—AI applied to one of the most specific household annoyances imaginable.Sweekar starts as an egg that hatches after two days, revealing a pocket-sized AI pet with a screen for eyes. You can talk to it, feed it, and change its outfits. The cute little device learns about you using a companion app and literally grows bigger as it matures. It's essentially a modern Tamagotchi with physical form-changing abilities. The company plans a Kickstarter campaign in March, with expected pricing between $100-150.Honor's Robot Phone prototype features a flip-out camera and gimbal that can track subjects automatically. Based on promos, the camera moves independently and tracks subjects, though what else it can do remains mysterious since touching wasn't allowed during demos. The company plans to reveal more details at Mobile World Congress in February, but it's already one of the most unconventional phone designs in recent memory.Strutt's ev1 ""personal everyday vehicle"" looks like Professor X's wheelchair crossed with a Tesla. The four-wheeled device uses voice controls, LiDAR, and navigation to autonomously take you where you want to go. Its 360-degree sensor array stops instantly when obstacles appear. A small display on the right armrest shows what the ev1's cameras capture in real time. Price unknown, but expect it to be expensive.Lenovo's Legion Pro Rollable concept takes a 16-inch gaming laptop and expands its screen horizontally to 23.8 inches at the press of a button. The flexible display offers three aspect ratios (16:10, 21:9, and 24:9) depending on your needs. Racing games and flight simulators would absolutely shine on this device. It looks ungainly when fully extended, but of all the concepts at CES, this is the one we most hope becomes real.Jackery's Solar Mars Bot is an autonomous battery backup with retractable solar panels that tracks the sun and repositions itself for optimal charging. The 5kWh battery comes with multiple plugs and ports. During demos, a bright light simulated the sun and periodically moved to different spots—the Mars Bot identified the new location with mosquito-like quickness and calmly scooted over. Watching it work felt like witnessing a very helpful Mars rover prototype.Clicks, the company known for keyboard cases, wasn’t out there with yet another accessory this year—it came to the show with an entire phone. The Communicator leans hard into BlackBerry DNA with its full keyboard and Curve-esque design. The prototype units had working keyboard keys that felt genuinely nice to type on, plus swappable back panels in sleek colors. It's envisioned as a companion to your main smartphone, something you grab when typing emails matters more than scrolling vertical videos. But plenty of people have expressed interest in using it as their primary device, which is somehow even more delightful.CES, once again, remind us that weird tech isn't just surviving—it's thriving in increasingly bizarre directions. These gadgets represent engineers asking ""could we?"" without always pausing to consider ""should we?"" And that's exactly what makes CES special.Will any of these actually matter? Some will. The stair-climbing vacuum addresses a problem anyone with a two-story house understands. The smart toilet's eight-hour check—while a little exaggerated—could save lives. The ultrasonic knife might make cooking accessible for people whose hands don't work like they used to.Probably, a dozen out of these 26 gadgets will ship and find their audiences. Others—the musical lollipops, the AI soulmate in a tube, the penguin on a skateboard—are harder to defend. These will likely fade into tech folklore as cautionary tales or ahead-of-their-time concepts.But that's exactly what makes CES special. These strange gadgets remind us that innovation doesn't always follow a straight path, and sometimes the most interesting conversations come from the most impractical ideas. Even if we never buy them—and let's be honest, most of us won't—they make technology more entertaining, push boundaries, and occasionally solve problems we didn't know we had.","CES 2026 showcased a parade of wonderfully bizarre tech innovations, from musical lollipops to AI soulmates and smart toilets.

Trump To Capture Khamenei After Maduro? Elon Musk's 'Brutal Reality Check' As Riots Kill 16 In Iran

Why internet blackout in Iran





US President Donald Trump has said that he will talk to Elon Musk to restore internet services amid digital blackout in Iran. When asked by a reporter if he plans to use Starlink to help people in the country, Trump replied: “We may speak to Elon (Musk) because he’s very good at that kind of thing”, adding “he’s got a very good company ( SpaceX )”. He further added that “I’m going to call him as soon as I’m finished with you”. For those unaware, Iran is reeling under a digital blackout since Thursday last week, i.e. January 8, 2026. According to reports, international calls to the country are blocked and domestic mobile phones have no service.Notably, this is not the first time when Iran has been hit by an internet blackout. The country faced a blackout in 2019. But the level of shutdown this year is unprecedented and in some ways far harsher than that in 2019. “There is no reception on the phones. There is no antenna. It’s like you are living in the middle of nowhere, with no BTS towers,” Amir Rashidi, an Iranian digital rights expert told The Guardian.Even, Starlink satellite system that served as a lifeline for Iranians during the 2022 protests over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody, was being jammed, Rashidi told the publication.What is more striking about the current internet black out in Iran is that Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei continued to post on X as Iranians across the country were suddenly cut off from the internet.Rashidi added: “There are things that are important for the government to do. If they want to put out their propaganda they need to have access to Telegram, they need to have access to Twitter, they need to access Instagram.”According to a Reuters report, Iran's current protests began on December 28 last year in response to soaring prices. Hundreds of people have been killed since then, the report says. US-based organization HRANA stated that it has verified the deaths of 490 protesters and 48 security personnel, with more than 10,600 people arrested in two weeks of unrest.","US President Donald Trump has said that he will talk to Elon Musk to restore internet services amid digital blackout in Iran.

How Sridhar Vembu views politics



Commitment to research and deep technological work







Zoho founder and CS Sridhar Vembu, after consistently expressing his views on the future of India in recent times, has now shared his thoughts with rare clarity about his own politics and what his purpose in life has always been to him personally and professionally. In his recent post on X, Vembu has explained that what keeps him up at night, or what his ultimate aim in life is definitely not politics or power, but rather creating meaningful impact through technology and education.These are interesting views in the context of the rising conversation around technology, national capabilities, and self-sufficiency in modern India. For Vembu, these are all matters that have a personal connection with the wider civilisation revival in India and its long-term societal progress.In his post, Vembu described his life’s purpose in clear terms. He said his single-point agenda is to make Bharat technologically strong and self-reliant, arguing that this is essential for sustained economic growth as well as for the revival of rural life and cultural confidence.According to him, technological independence is not just about global competitiveness. It is also about spreading opportunity beyond cities and ensuring that progress reaches villages and smaller towns.By building technology using rural talent, he believes wealth and skills can be distributed more evenly across society. Vembu also reflected on India’s historical journey, suggesting that centuries of external domination have left deep psychological and civilisational scars. He argued that one of the lasting effects has been a defeatist mindset rooted in colonial thinking.Beyond economic strength, Vembu emphasised a broader philosophical goal. He said India’s civilisation should demonstrate how prosperity can coexist with humility, contentment, and respect for nature. Rather than pursuing growth at any cost, he argued for a sustainable model that harmonises human progress with the natural world.Vembu also addressed speculation around his political ambitions. He clarified that he sees politics as a form of public service and a democratic responsibility in which citizens should remain engaged. However, he made it clear that he does not intend to participate in active electoral politics.He said that, given his overriding priority in life, he cannot and will not pursue a career as an elected politician. Instead, he believes his contribution lies elsewhere, particularly in areas where his skills can have the greatest impact.Vembu further stated that “The future of India is going to be hugely dependent on deep work in R & D.” Vembu also expressed that “India needs more of such persons who are prepared to work for deep innovation than for shallow returns.”He termed the research and development part of his life “the place where he can best use his talents for the benefit of the nation.” He has many decades of experience in developing software applications that are competitive on a worldwide basis. He finds it highly meaningful to use his talents for “deep tech” activities.Vembu’s post got many likes on social media. Many people appreciated Vembu for having clear intentions and for choosing to give in terms of competence and not political interests.",Zoho founder and CS Sridhar Vembu has shared his thoughts on the future of India.

Google removes AI Overviews for key health queries following accuracy concerns: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-removes-ai-overviews-for-key-health-queries-following-accuracy-concerns-report/articleshow/126479426.cms,"



Google has reportedly removed some of its artificial intelligence (AI)-generated health summaries from Search. According to a report by The Guardian, the tech giant as removed AI Overviews for the search terms “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” and “what is the normal range for liver function tests”. The move comes after an investigation conducted by the publication found Google AI overviews generating “false and misleading information”. The report quotes a Google spokesperson who said: “We do not comment on individual removals within Search. In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”A previous investigation by the publication found the AI overview summaries that appear at the top of search results, giving “inaccurate health information, putting users at risk of harm.” According to experts, what Google’s AI Overviews answered may vary drastically from what was actually considered normal.For example, searching “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” served up masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients, per The Guardian.Vanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, told the publication that the removal of health-related AI overview summaries is “excellent news,” adding “we’re pleased to see the removal of the Google AI Overviews in these instances.”“However, if the question is asked in a different way, a potentially misleading AI Overview may still be given and we remain concerned other AI‑produced health information can be inaccurate and confusing.”Sue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum welcomed the removal. “This is a good result but it is only the very first step in what is needed to maintain trust in Google’s health-related search results. There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information,” Farrington told The Guardian.","Google has reportedly removed some of its artificial intelligence (AI)-generated health summaries from Search.

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report

Why Malaysia restricted access to Grok AI

Indonesia’s earlier action added pressure

Global scrutiny of Grok’s image generation

xAI and X response to the controversy





Malaysia has moved to restrict access to Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Elon Musk’s xAI, as controversy grows over the tool’s use in generating sexualised and manipulated images. The action places Malaysia among a small but growing group of countries taking regulatory steps against generative AI tools they say lack sufficient safeguards.The restriction was announced by Malaysia’s communications regulator amid rising concern that Grok had been used to create explicit images, including content involving women and minors. The move follows similar action by Indonesia and adds to mounting international scrutiny of how AI image tools are being deployed and controlled.Malaysia’s communications authority said it had temporarily restricted access to Grok after identifying repeated instances where the chatbot was used to generate obscene and sexually explicit images. According to the regulator, the content violated local laws governing indecent and harmful online material.The regulator said the restriction would remain in place until xAI and X, the social media platform where Grok is available, demonstrate that adequate safeguards are in place to prevent misuse.Officials added that existing measures relied too heavily on user reporting rather than proactive controls.Malaysia has some of the region’s stricter content regulations, and authorities said the action was taken to protect the public from harmful digital material, particularly non-consensual and sexually explicit imagery.Malaysia’s decision comes shortly after Indonesia temporarily blocked access to Grok, becoming the first country to do so. Indonesian authorities said they acted after Grok was used to generate pornographic images, including deepfake-style content.Indonesia’s communications ministry summoned representatives of X to explain how Grok operates and what safeguards were in place. The country later restored limited access after discussions, but officials said further violations could lead to renewed restrictions.The Indonesian move is widely seen as a catalyst that encouraged other governments, including Malaysia, to take a closer look at Grok’s image-generation features.Grok has drawn international attention in recent weeks after users shared examples of sexualised images generated using the chatbot. Some of the images circulated online appeared to depict women without consent, raising concerns about privacy, exploitation, and abuse.Reuters has reported that the controversy triggered criticism from regulators and digital safety advocates in several countries, who argue that generative AI tools are evolving faster than the rules designed to govern them.In response to the backlash, xAI said it had limited certain image-generation features, including restricting image creation and editing to paying subscribers. Critics, however, said these steps did not address deeper concerns about how easily the technology could still be misused.When contacted by Reuters about Malaysia’s action, xAI’s automated response stated, “Legacy media lies.” X did not immediately provide a detailed response to the regulator’s concerns.Elon Musk has previously defended Grok as a more open and less restrictive AI system, positioning it as an alternative to other chatbots that impose tighter content limits. The current controversy, however, has intensified questions about where to draw the balance between openness and safety.","Malaysia has moved to restrict access to Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Elon Musk’s xAI.

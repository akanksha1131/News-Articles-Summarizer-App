Trump administration launches app for 'self-deportation' of illegal immigrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/trump-administration-launches-app-for-self-deportation-of-illegal-immigrants/articleshow/118859825.cms,"What has changed in the ‘new’ app

US President Donald Trump’s administration has launched a mobile app that is designed to facilitate what officials call “self-deportation” for immigrants living in the US without legal status. The government says that the app strengthens the country’s mission to “secure the border by ensuring lawful entry for travelers and supporting effective enforcement.”The application, named “CBP Home,” has been developed by US Customs and Border Protection and includes a ‘Report Departure’ feature allowing undocumented immigrants to indicate their ""intent to depart"" the country voluntarily.“The app provides illegal aliens in the US with a straightforward way to declare their intent to voluntarily depart, offering them the chance to leave before facing harsher consequences. This reinforces our commitment to enforcing US laws and safeguarding national security,” said Pete Flores, Acting Commissioner, US Customs and Border Protection.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem warned that “if they don't, we will find them, we will deport them, and they will never return.”The CBP Home App is available for download on Apple or Android devices as a free mobile application.With the CBP Home Mobile Application, travelers, businesses, and stakeholders will continue to gain access to a single digital solution that streamlines CBP processes, enhances security, and reduces administrative burdens – all from the convenience of a mobile device, CBP added.The new app replaces “CBP One,” which was launched during the Biden administration. The previous app allowed approximately one million migrants waiting in Mexico to schedule appointments to request entry at legal border crossings. Republican lawmakers had criticised this system, arguing it enabled mass migration without adequate vetting of applicants.President Trump terminated the CBP One program immediately after taking office, leaving many migrants with pending appointments uncertain about their status and next steps.The introduction of CBP Home aligns with other recent policy changes intended to pressure undocumented immigrants to leave the country. A forthcoming regulation, scheduled to take effect on April 11, will require individuals without legal status to register with the federal government or potentially face fines or imprisonment.","US Customs and Border Protection has launched a mobile app called 'CBP Home' The app allows undocumented immigrants to indicate their ""intent to depart"" the country voluntarily.

How the book paints Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg



Former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg allegedly spent $13,000 on lingerie for herself and her 26-year-old female assistant during a European trip , later inviting the assistant to “come to bed” on a private jet flight home, according to a revealing new memoir. These startling allegations reportedly come from 'Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism', a book by Sarah Wynn-Williams , who worked at Facebook for six years before leaving in 2017, prior to the company’s rebranding as Meta. In her tell-all, Wynn-Williams claims that during a lengthy car journey across Europe, Sandberg and her assistant took turns resting in each other’s laps and running their fingers through each other’s hair. She also alleges that Sandberg directed her to buy lingerie for both of them, sparing no expense, resulting in a $13,000 tab, as noted in a New York Times book review published March 11.A Meta spokesperson dismissed the claims to The New York Post, calling them “a mix of outdated, previously reported assertions about the company and baseless accusations against our executives.” The spokesperson stated that Wynn-Williams was terminated eight years ago for poor performance and toxic behavior, adding that an internal investigation at the time found her harassment allegations to be misleading and unfounded. “Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behavior, and an investigation at the time determined she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment.” The spokesperson added that “since then, she has been paid by anti-Facebook activists and this is simply a continuation of that work.”They further suggested that Wynn-Williams has since been compensated by anti-Facebook activists, framing the book as an extension of that agenda. “Whistleblower status protects government communications, not disgruntled activists trying to sell books,” the spokesperson remarked.In the memoir, Wynn-Williams also portrays CEO Mark Zuckerberg as evolving from a coding-obsessed engineer into a leader preoccupied with politics and public admiration, per the Times review. She recounts being tasked with arranging a crowd of over a million in Indonesia to “gently mob” Zuckerberg during an Asia tour. She also claims he once praised President Andrew Jackson—infamous for enacting the Indian Removal Act—as the greatest U.S. president because he “got stuff done.”The book, kept under wraps by its publisher until just before its Tuesday release, offers a sharp critique of Facebook’s leadership. Wynn-Williams portrays Sandberg and Zuckerberg as reckless and power-hungry, likening them to the “careless people” from The Great Gatsby—those who create chaos and leave others to deal with the aftermath.","Former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg allegedly spent $13,000 on lingerie for herself and her 26-year-old female assistant during a European trip.

Errol Musk sparks controversy over China’s interest in Elliot Rush

Errol Musk , father of Elon Musk , recently made headlines with sensational claims about his 7-year-old grandson, Elliot Rush . In an interview, Errol stated that China is attempting to recruit Elliot for an e-gaming tournament, a surprising assertion that has captured widespread attention. The claim not only raises questions about the potential influence of international politics on family matters but also highlights the growing prominence of competitive gaming on a global scale. Errol’s words have sparked curiosity and debate, adding a complex layer to the Musk family’s already highly publicised life.Errol Musk talked about China's reported interest in his grandson, Elliot Rush. He said that China believes Rush to be a likely gaming champion and wants to take him on for a tournament. Errol made a point of mentioning that Chinese officials have informed him that his grandson will be ""the biggest thing in China"" and that he is a ""prolific gamer"" and ""a champion."" That is why, in Errol's words, a Chinese businessman had even come to his South African ranch to consider the prospect.Remarkably, Errol was not quite as bothered as one might have expected about the political consequences of China's interest in his grandson, particularly given the tension in the relations between the United States and China. China is globally recognized as America's most influential adversary in international politics, making the issue likely to be even more complex. Nonetheless, the informal attitude and apparent non-concern regarding the issue of the subject during the interview were outstanding.Errol Musk's words have caused eyebrows to be raised both because of their surprising nature as well as the sensitive geopolitical matters they bring to light. The notion of China hiring a young child to play in a gaming tournament, particularly one that is related to the Musk family, brings an interesting convergence of personal family life, international politics, and the increasing visibility of competitive gaming. The controversy over Errol Musk's personal life and his comments about Elon's supposed child with Ashley St Clair also adds to the complexity of the issue.Elliot Rush is Elon Musk's 7-year-old half-brother and one of the youngest children of Errol Musk. He is the son of Errol and Jana Bezuidenhout, who was previously Errol's stepdaughter but is now his girlfriend. Jana, 38, is Heide Bezuidenhout's daughter, and Heide was Errol's second wife. The unconventional circumstances of their relationship, with Errol having adopted Jana at four years old before they had a child together when they were both 30 years old, has brought a lot of attention and raised eyebrows. The complicated family setup has drawn Elliot into the public eye and the media limelight.","Errol Musk made sensational claims about his 7-year-old grandson, Elliot Rush.

Foxconn , one of the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturers, has launched its inaugural large language model (LLM), “FoxBrain,” marking a significant step in the company's integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into its core operations.As per a report by news agency Reuters, the company plans to leverage FoxBrain to enhance efficiency in manufacturing and streamline supply chain management.FoxBrain was developed using 120 of Nvidia's H100 GPUs, completing the training process in approximately four weeks, the company said, adding that the model is built upon Facebook-parent Meta ’s Llama 3.1 architecture.Notably, FoxBrain is the first LLM in Taiwan specifically optimised for traditional Chinese and Taiwanese language styles, incorporating reasoning capabilities, the report said. Foxconn's internal testing indicates that while there is a minor performance difference compared to China's DeepSeek distillation model, FoxBrain's overall performance closely aligns with leading global standards, the company reportedly said.Initially, FoxBrain will be deployed for internal applications, encompassing data analysis, decision support, document collaboration, mathematical reasoning, problem-solving, and code generation. FFoxconn aims to expand the model's applications through collaborations with technology partners, sharing open-source information, and promoting AI adoption in manufacturing, supply chain management, and intelligent decision-making processes.Nvidia played a crucial role in the development of FoxBrain, providing support through its Taiwan-based supercomputer, “Taipei-1,” and offering technical consulting during the model's training phase. Taipei-1, the largest supercomputer in Taiwan, is owned and operated by Nvidia in Kaohsiung.Foxconn intends to provide further details about FoxBrain during Nvidia's upcoming GTC developer conference in mid-March.","FoxBrain is the first LLM in Taiwan specifically optimised for traditional Chinese and Taiwanese language styles.

"How Jim Walker, the man who saw 2008 Stock Market crash coming, may have just 'agreed' with Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath's 'Stock Market Gyaan'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-jim-walker-the-man-who-saw-the-2008-stock-market-crash-coming-may-have-just-agreed-with-zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamaths-stock-market-gyaan/articleshow/118727832.cms,"Jim Walker to investors: Take long-term investment approach

Jim Walker picks India over China

Indian stock markets witnessed Bears onslaught in the month of February, with the benchmark Sensex closing over 4,000 points lower. The carnage witnessed in the market during the month led to a staggering erosion of over Rs 40 lakh crore from the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies; while Nifty 50 marked its longest losing streak since its inception in the year 1996. The relentless downward trend has left retail investors anxious. In a message to investors late earlier this week, Zerodha founder and CEO Nithin Kamath termed the fall as ""the first real market correction "" since Covid pandemic.""Markets are cyclical, and given the way our markets went up from late 2020, this fall was inevitable,"" he said. Kamath told investors to not get carried away by the doom and gloom in the market and continue investing in SIPs. ""I don't know how good the data is, but it seems like the number of investors stopping their SIPs has gone up. This is the wrong thing to do. What an SIP helps you do is to average your investments across different market cycles,"" he said.A similar sentiment comes from Jim Walker, a celebrated economist from Alethia Capital who famously foresaw the 2008 financial crisis. In an exclusive interaction with ETNow, Walker gave perspective on the current state of the global economy and what he thinks about India. Contrary to widespread concerns that today’s market exuberance might precipitate a collapse akin to that of 2008, Walker holds a different view.Speaking with ETNow, he acknowledged a global economic slowdown but stressed that the circumstances differ markedly from those preceding the financial debacle over ten years ago. Similar to Nithin Kamath, Walker batted for a long-term investment approach. Walker encouraged his clients to boost their stakes in India, despite valuation concerns in its stock market. “I’ve advised clients this week to significantly increase their investments in India. Though stock valuations raise eyebrows, I believe economic growth will soon justify them with strong corporate earnings,” he elaborated.Known for his prescient 2006-07 warning of a looming U.S. housing market crash, Walker remarked that today’s danger signals are less evident. “The signs were glaring in 2006-07 when we predicted a severe downturn driven by excesses in the property sector; it’s not the same now,” he said.He pointed out that unlike the lead-up to 2008, there are currently no significant overindulgences in the housing or financial sectors poised to spark a major banking crisis. Although certain areas show excessive stock market gains and asset price inflation, Walker believes these won’t lead to widespread corporate failures that could rattle the banking system. “We’re not seeing the kind of corporate collapses that impacted banks in 2008. That’s not on the horizon,” he observed.Additionally, Walker expressed a stronger preference for investing in India over China, suggesting it might be an opportune moment to increase investments there. He is especially sanguine about India’s prospects, citing its robust policy environment—the best in three decades—as a key factor enhancing its appeal to investors. “India’s policy stability and certainty are at their peak in the last 30 years,” he asserted, crediting solid monetary and fiscal policies along with exchange rate stability for bolstering India’s economic structure.He also praised the Indian government’s efforts in deregulation and improving business conditions, which he views as catalysts for future growth. By supporting small and medium enterprises, Walker believes India will spur further economic and job growth.",Jim Walker picks India over China as a good place to invest in the stock market.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat. In the post, Altman wrote “very proud of the openai team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades…thought that was the thing i'd always be most proud of in life”. Adding further, he wrote “turns out i am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own!”.In a follow-up post, Altman wrote “i realize i am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best)”.Sam Altman welcomed his baby boy last month with his partner and software engineer Oliver Mulherin. The baby arrived prematurely and has been receiving care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).In another news, the CEO shared an update about the company’s latest version of the large language model (LLM), GPT-4.5 . In an X post, Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience.Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it.In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit. We think people are gonna use this a lot and love it.”","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat.

Come April 1 of Fiscal Year 2026-27, a new rule in the Income Tax Act law may grant the Income Tax department powers to access your social media accounts or emails in case they suspect tax evasion . Income Tax Bill 2025, which was introduced in the Parliament recently, will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces, termed Virtual Digital Spaces in the bill. This means that the Income Tax department can break into social media accounts, personal emails, bank accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, and more if they have any reason to believe that you own any undisclosed income, money, Gold, Jewelry, or valuable item or property on which you haven’t paid applicable Income Tax.Presently, Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, allows Income Tax officials to seize assets and books during search operations if they find sufficient reasons to believe that an individual is in possession of undisclosed income or assets. The changes in the bill, once passed in the Parliament, will extend this authourity to the digital realm, allowing officials to bypass security measures on computer systems and virtual spaces.The Clause 247 of the Income Tax Bill outlines this expanded power, stating that officers can “break open the lock of any door, box, locker, safe, almirah, or other receptacle” or “gain access by overriding the access code” to computer systems or virtual digital spaces when access is otherwise unavailable. This applies if they believe an individual possesses undisclosed income or assets taxable under the law.According to the bill, the term Virtual Digital Space includes email servers, social media accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, banking accounts, and any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset. It further adds that virtual digital space is an environment, area or realm that is constructed and experienced through computer technology and not the physical, tangible world, which encompasses any digital realm that allows users to interact, communicate and perform activities using computer systems, computer networks, computer resources, communication devices, cyberspace, internet, worldwide web and emerging technologies, using data and information in the electronic form for creation, storage or exchange and includes:* Email servers* Social media account* Online investment account, trading account, banking account, etc* Any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset* Remote server or cloud servers* Digital application platforms* Any other space of similar natureAs to who all can wield this authority? The bill designates “authorised officers” as senior tax officials, including Joint Directors, Additional Directors, Joint Commissioners, Additional Commissioners, Assistant or Deputy Directors, Assistant or Deputy Commissioners, Income Tax Officers, and Tax Recovery Officers.What does this mean for individuals? The new rules significantly widen the scope of tax investigations, giving officials the ability to probe deeply into personal and financial digital footprints. As this provision takes effect, it raises questions about privacy and the balance between tax enforcement and individual rights.","Income Tax Bill 2025 will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces.

What Bamboo Health said about tracking abortion pills



“They determine how that data is managed and accessed. That's how it gets treated in Louisiana and anywhere else it would occur,”

How this abortion pill tracking can affect users



A tech company named Bamboo Health is reportedly playing a key role in tracking abortion pill prescriptions in parts of America, starting with the state of Louisiana. This tracking is enabled by state laws that are beginning to classify abortion pills, specifically mifepristone and misoprostol , as "" controlled substances ,"" similar to drugs with high potential for abuse. In May 2024, Louisiana passed such a law and is now using Bamboo Health's existing prescription monitoring database to track these medications.A report by Business Insider cited New Orleans Health Department to claim that as of March, Louisiana clinicians are mandated to log every prescription for mifepristone and misoprostol into Bamboo Health's database. This system, typically used for monitoring addictive drugs, is now being applied to abortion pills in Louisiana and potentially other states.In a statement to Business Insider, a former Bamboo employee revealed that the company had announced its plan to monitor the drugs in an internal Slack channel in 2024. At that time the company reportedly cited this move as its legal obligation as Louisiana’s prescription-monitoring vendor. The employee, who discussed the matter on the condition of anonymity, described the announcement as part of the company's compliance measures.In a separate statement to Business Insider, Bamboo Health CEO Jeff Smith said that the company's prescription monitoring platform is required to adhere to state regulations .Smith noted.Originally founded as Appriss in 1994, Bamboo Health, grew from a victim notification tool into a $30 million business. It later expanded into law enforcement solutions, tracking sex offenders and monitoring Sudafed purchases to help police shut down meth labs.Apart from Louisiana, other states like Texas, Indiana, and Idaho are also exploring similar measures for tracking these drugs. All three states even have partnerships with Bamboo, the report added.Its also important to note that beyond abortions, Misoprostol is used for various medical purposes, including treating ulcers, managing miscarriages, and preventing postpartum bleeding. However, its classification as a controlled substance has raised concerns among physicians about restrictions and state oversight potentially affecting patient care.","A tech company named Bamboo Health is reportedly playing a key role in tracking abortion pill prescriptions in parts of America, starting with the state of Louisiana.

Poland PM cautions 'friends'

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Elon Musk clashed publicly with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski over Starlink. The public spat started after Radoslaw Sikorski claimed that Poland pays for Ukraine to use the services of Starlink, which provides crucial internet connectivity to Kyiv and its military. He further went on to claim that Elon Musk is planning to shut down Starlink terminals in Ukraine. This irked both US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Starlink CEO Elon Musk. The duo sharply responded to Sikorski, dismissing Sikorski's concerns about Starlink being cut off. US Secretary accused Poland's foreign minister of ""making things up"".Rubio went on to suggest Ukraine as ungrateful, in a strong rebuke and that Ukraine may need an alternative to Elon Musk's Starlink satellite service if it becomes unreliable. He also urged Ukraine to be thankful for the assistance thus far. ""No one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink,"" Rubio said. ""And say thank you because without Starlink, Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now.""Sikorski retaliated by saying that Poland will look for alternative suppliers if SpaceX turns out to be an unreliable provider of Starlink satellite internet for Ukraine, as per The Kyiv Independent.Elon Musk, too, responded, claiming that Poland only pays a ""small fraction"" of the cost for Ukraine's Starlink access. ""Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost,"" Musk said. ""And there is no substitute for Starlink."" Musk warned that the entire front line in Ukraine would collapse if he shut off Starlink services.Earlier, iIn a post on Twitter, Elon Musk said that that no matter how much he disagreed on Ukraine policy, Starlink would never turn off its terminals. ""Exactly! To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals. I am simply stating that, without Starlink, the Ukrainian lines would collapse, as the Russians can jam all other communications! We would never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip,"" wrote Elon Musk.After the open dispute, Poland's prime minister urged ""friends"" to respect their allies and avoid arrogance. His Twitter post, which didn't name anyone directly, came a day after a heated social media exchange between top US and Polish officials over Starlink. ""True leadership means respect for partners and allies. Even for the smaller and weaker ones,"" Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote in English on X. ""Never arrogance.

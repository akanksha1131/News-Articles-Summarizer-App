Amazon’s expansion plans







Amazon has announced the shut down of its Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh physical stores. The company took this decision after the comprehensive review of its grocery operations. The company said, “After a careful evaluation of the business and how we can best serve customers, we’ve made the difficult decision to close our Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh physical stores. ” This move from Amazon marks a significant pivot in Amazon’s retail strategy, with company choosing to concentrate on expanding Whole Foods Markey and strengthening its online grocery delivery services.Amazon Go and Fresh stores were introduced as Just Walk Out technology, but they struggled to establish a distinctive customer experience and sustainable economic model. On the other hand, Whole Food Market acquired in 2017 by Amazon say strong growth with sales rising more than 40% in recent years. Also, Amazon’s online grocery business also witnessed a surge with perishable grocery sales through Same-Day Delivery growing 40x since January 2025, making fresh groceries one of the most-ordered categories on its platform.Amazon said that it will now focus on scaling Whole Foods Market, with plans to open more than 100 new stores in the coming years. The company is also working on rolling out Whole Foods Market Daily Shop, a smaller-format store designed for grab-and-go meals and essentials.Along with this, Amazon is also expanding its online grocery delivery network, which already covers more than 5,000 US cities and towns, with Same-Day Delivery set to reach even more communities in 2026.Although Amazon Go stores will close, the Just Walk Out technology they pioneered will continue to thrive. The checkout-free system is already deployed in over 360 third-party locations across five countries, including stadiums and airports, and will be integrated into Amazon’s own fulfillment centers to improve employee convenience.","Amazon has announced the shut down of its Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh physical stores.

Why fiber matters in AI data centres







Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has entered into a massive multi-year agreement with Corning. Worth up to $6 billion, the deal is to secure the critical fiber-optic cables required to fuel its rapidly expanding artificial intelligence (AI) data centres. The deal positions Corning, the manufacturer of Gorilla Glass, as a primary architect of the physical nervous system for Meta’s AI ambitions.According to a report by news agency Reuters, under the terms of the agreement, Corning will supply advanced optical fiber, specialised cabling and high-density connectivity products through 2030. Additionally, as part of the pact, Corning will expand its manufacturing footprint in North Carolina.The expansion is centred at its cable factory in Hickory, where Meta will serve as the “anchor customer.” This move is expected to bolster Corning’s regional workforce of 5,000 by an estimated 15% to 20%.“Together with Meta, we're strengthening domestic supply chains and helping ensure that advanced data centers are built using US innovation,” said Corning CEO Wendell Weeks.While much of the AI hype focuses on chips and software, the physical transmission of data has become a major bottleneck.AI data centers require massive computing power and near-instantaneous data transfer between thousands of interconnected GPUs. Fiber-optic technology is essential for this, as it uses light to transmit data at speeds far exceeding traditional copper wiring.The demand for these components is increasing and has transformed Corning into a Wall Street favourite. Driven by orders from Meta, Microsoft and Google, Corning’s shares surged more than 84% in 2025. Meta recently announced “Meta Compute” initiative, which is nothing but a project designed to oversee the company’s global fleet of data centres and supplier partnerships.Meta has committed to spending $600 billion on US tech infrastructure and jobs over the next three years.","Corning will supply advanced optical fiber, specialised cabling and high-density connectivity products through 2030.

What are ‘Trump accounts’ that will benefit the kids of company employees

“Big Beautiful Bill”





Intel has announced that it will match the Trump administration's $1,000 payout for children of its US employees. The contribution will be made under the 530A ‘Trump Accounts’ programme for eligible children of US employees. The 530A program, often calledis a tax-deferred savings account for children under 18, funded with a $1,000 contribution from the US government for children born between 2025 and 2028.The matching funds, which will benefit Intel staff, mark a sign of a close working relationship between the Trump administration and the chipmaker, which now counts the US government as its largest shareholder. This comes after the US government took a 10% stake in the chipmaker through an $8.9 billion investment in 2025.In a blog post, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan stated, “Apart from this, Intel claims that it has supported the next generation for decades through expanded access to STEM education and digital readiness initiatives. The new employee benefit builds on this approach and reflects the company’s continued focus on supporting families. It adds to existing offerings such as fertility benefits, adoption support, childcare assistance, scholarship programs, and college coaching resources.In 2025, this program was passed as part of the Trump administration'sand is intended to jumpstart wealth-building opportunities for children, allowing their investments to grow and compound for years before they become adults.According to a CNBC report, Intel is joining a list of other companies that say they will match the federal $1,000 contribution. They include SoFi, Charter Communications, BNY, BlackRock, Investment Company Institute, Robinhood and Charles Schwab.In December 2025, Dell founder Michael Dell said he would donate $6.25 billion to the program to seed some Trump accounts for children born before the January 1 cutoff, with each account receiving $250.","Intel has announced that it will match the Trump administration's $1,000 payout for children of its US employees.

US lawmakers send 'worrying letter' to Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon on data centers





It seems Meta knows that datacentres, which are the backbone of artificial intelligence (AI) industry, may become a hot political issue. This has made the Mark Zuckerberg-owned company spend $6.4 million to run a series of ads promoting the benefits of data centres that ran across several states in the US in the months of November and December. According to a story in the New York Times, ""The advertisement began with a panning shot of Altoona, Iowa, a town of 20,000 near Des Moines. The camera moved from a diner to a farm to a high school football field. To the pluck of guitar strings, a voice-over promoted a boon for the local economy. “We’re bringing jobs here,” the ad said. “For us, and for our next generation.”So, the big takeaway from the Meta ad for all the viewers here is: Jobs and economic prosperity of the city and the State where data centres will be situated. According to the report, Meta ads appeared in the television markets of eight state capitals such as Sacramento, California; Salt Lake City; and Tallahassee, Florida; as well as Washington, D.C. The report quotes data from AdImpact, an analytics firm. Meta ads highlighted how data centers can bring jobs and tax revenue to places in need of economic development.Meta operates 26 data centers in the United States and has said that it will spend $600 billion to build new ones in the coming years.Last year, the company also unveiled two political action committees to back candidates who support AI during the midterm elections.In December 2025, three Democratic senators sent letters to Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and three data center operators asking whether their energy-hungry data centers are driving up electricity costs for ordinary Americans. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut expressed alarm that utility companies are passing billions in infrastructure upgrade costs to consumers while tech firms expand their artificial intelligence operations. “American families bankroll the electricity costs of trillion-dollar tech companies,” the lawmakers wrote, requesting detailed responses by January 12. The measure is so far largely backed by other Democrats. However, the issue is becoming bipartisan as President Donald Trump has made several statements about data centers and energy costs this month.“We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way,’” Trump posted on social media January 12.Microsoft recently said that it will ask to pay higher electricity bills in areas where it’s building data centers, in an effort to prevent electricity prices for local residents from rising in those areas. The move is part of a broader plan to address rising prices and other concerns sparked by massive buildout of artificial intelligence infrastructure across the United States.

CMA recomends an 'Opt-out' option



Google responds: 'Don't Break Search'







The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is moving to significantly loosen Google’s alleged control over the digital landscape. The watchdog has proposed new regulations that would grant publishers power over how their content can be used by the tech giant’s AI feature – AI Overviews. This is one the biggest features offered by Google in Search, and provides a summary of users’ questions in an easy to understand language.The move, announced on Wednesday (January 28), marks the first major exercise of power under the UK’s new digital competition regime, reports The Financial Times, adding that publishers have long feared that AI Overviews will “cannibalize” their web traffic.The CMA’s proposed “conduct requirements” will force Google to allow publishers to “opt out” of having their material used to generate AI summaries without losing their visibility in traditional search results.Furthermore, the regulator is demanding that Google must ensure that AI-generated results clearly credit the original sources of information. The tech giant has also been asked to demonstrate that its search and AI rankings are ""fair and transparent"" for businesses. And finally, Google must give UK consumers more control over how they interact with search services.“Today is an important milestone as we consult on the first conduct requirements under the digital markets competition regime in the UK,” said Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the CMA.“These targeted and proportionate actions would give UK businesses and consumers more choice and control over how they interact with Google’s search services,” she added.The crackdown is possible because Google became the first company to get Strategic Market Status (SMS) under the UK's new laws last October. This designation lasts for five years and allows the CMA to bypass antitrust investigations and issue direct “conduct requirements” to tech giants for ‘fair competition’.If Google fails to comply, it may could face fines of up to 10% of its global turnover. While Search is currently the focus, the CMA noted that Google’s Gemini AI assistant is being kept under review for future designation.Google has signaled a cautious but firm resistance to the proposals. Ron Eden, Google’s Principal for Product Management, defended the company’s existing model.“For years, we have provided web publishers with a range of controls based on open standards . . . to manage how their content appears in Search,” said Ron Eden, Google’s principal for product management.“Any new controls need to avoid breaking Search in a way that leads to a fragmented or confusing experience for people,” Eden warned.",The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is moving to significantly loosen Google's alleged control over the digital landscape.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has suggested a new way to describe vibe-coding, a word that became one of the biggest “headache” of engineers in 2025. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Vembu argued that the termdoes not reflect the discipline required in real engineering work. He said that he prefers a new termto describe the growing use of AI tools in writing and maintaining software. In the post, Vembu said the focus should remain on solid engineering practices, even as AI becomes more deeply embedded in coding workflows.Sharing the post, Sridhar Vembu wrote:Vembu says that the term ACE does not remove the need for software engineers.

What Tim Cook means by “loving museums”

Apple CEO Tim Cook (Image source: Bloomberg)

“I don’t want to live in one”: A warning against stagnation

A lesson in leadership and decision-making

Why the quote resonates beyond technology

A reflection of Tim Cook’s leadership style

Why the quote still matters

""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

,





Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple , doesn't give long speeches or use dramatic slogans. When he does say something, it's usually short, to the point, and well thought out. One of these lines is his quote:. The sentence is easy to understand, like a conversation. But it has a deeper meaning about how to move forward, how to be a leader, and how businesses and people should plan for the future.The quote is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Museums are places where history is kept. They keep ideas, inventions, and events that changed the world. They help us remember where we came from. Tim Cook has never said that we should forget or ignore history. Instead, he says that it is dangerous to get too comfortable with it.In today's world, where things change quickly, especially in technology, staying still can cost you a lot. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.Museums are very important to society. They keep culture, new ideas, and human accomplishments safe. Future generations would lose touch with the ideas and work that shaped the past if there were no museums. Tim Cook saying ""love"" shows that he cares. He thinks it's important to learn from the past. He likes what has already been made.Apple has a long and well-known history. People often study and admire the company's past innovations, which include the Macintosh, the iPod, and the iPhone. A lot of these items are now on display in museums and exhibitions all over the world. Cook knows more about this legacy than most people.But liking someone doesn't mean you care about them. His quote makes it clear that history is important to learn about, but it shouldn't be a place where you want to stay, especially in an industry driven by constant innovation, progress, and forward-looking thinking.The second part of the quote is where the real meaning is. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. It means comfort, safety, and familiarity. That comfort can slowly turn into stagnation in business and leadership.Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. The markets change. Technology changes. People's needs change. What worked ten years ago might not work anymore. Businesses that only care about keeping their legacy alive often have a hard time staying relevant.Apple has kept changing under Cook's leadership. The business has grown into services, put more emphasis on user privacy, put money into protecting the environment, and moved into new areas like custom silicon chips. These choices show that the company is willing to try new things, even if the old ones worked.The quote is true for all leaders, not just Apple. People often praise leaders for their past successes, using previous wins as proof of future capability and judgement. People trust you more when you have done well in the past. But depending too much on past success can keep you from coming up with new ideas or recognising when the environment has fundamentally shifted.Cook's words make it sound like good leadership needs to be balanced. You can learn from history, but don't let it tell you what to do all the time. Don't let your past experiences tell you what to do. This method lets businesses change instead of fighting it, allowing innovation to emerge naturally rather than defensively.This idea also works for people. Careers, skills, and fields of work change over time. It can be harder to grow if you hold on too tightly to what used to work. The quote quietly encourages people to be open and curious, even when change is hard, uncertain, or uncomfortable at first.This quote stands out because it is so simple. It doesn't use business jargon or technical language. People can all understand it. Most people know how nice it is to stick to their routines and how hard it is to try something new.In a broader sense, the remark addresses how cultures deal with progress. Traditions and fresh ideas frequently conflict. It is crucial to respect tradition and history while also being open to new experiences. Cook's remark acknowledges the history. It simply refuses to be confined by it.This balance is especially important now that technology is changing quickly and making people wonder about jobs, education, and social structures. The quote tells people that progress doesn't mean forgetting the past; it means building on it in a smart way.People often say that Tim Cook is calm, level-headed, and practical. His way of leading is different from Steve Jobs's, who was known for making bold and dramatic statements. Cook does things in a quieter way. His words are more likely to make you think than to make you angry, reflecting patience, consistency, ethical decision-making, and a long-term focus rather than short-term applause, values that align closely with Apple’s culture and leadership philosophy.This quote fits that pattern. It doesn't need attention. It makes you think. It gives a point of view without making people agree. That restraint is one reason it feels real.The quote doesn't give a big picture; it gives a way of thinking. It talks about how Cook sees progress, responsibility, and long-term success.is still true because it describes a problem that everyone faces. How can we remember the past without letting it control us? How do we go on without losing what matters?It's clear but not obvious what Tim Cook means. Value history. Take something away from it. Then decide to go on.In one short sentence, the CEO of Apple reminds us that we can choose to make progress. It takes work, curiosity, and a willingness to go beyond what you already know. Museums keep the past alive. But the future is being built somewhere else.","Tim Cook's quote has a deeper meaning about how to move forward.

They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

“Dear Shareholders,

Today, I am going to step away from the Group CEO role, and subject to shareholders' approval, will remain on the board of directors as Vice Chairman.

Albinder Dhindsa

(Albi) will be Eternal's new Group CEO.

Why this change

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.

This transition allows Eternal to remain sharply focused, while giving me the space to explore ideas that do not fit Eternal's risk profile.

What doesn't change

I have spent eighteen years, almost half my life, building this company. I will continue doing that.

Albi, Akshant, and I will continue to work closely together, as we always have. Our partnership, shared context, and trust remain unchanged. All our business CEOs will continue operating with the autonomy they have always had.

My involvement in long-term strategy, culture, leadership development, and ethics and governance, continues. This is where I have increasingly focused lately anyway.

What changes

The centre of gravity for operating decisions moves to Albi.

As Group CEO, he will own day-to-day execution, operating priorities, and business decisions.

Blinkit's journey from acquisition to breakeven happened under his leadership.

He built the team, the culture, the supply chain, the operating rhythm. He has the DNA of a battle-hardened founder and his ability to execute far exceeds mine. He is more than capable of leading Eternal as Group CEO.

Blinkit remains our largest growth opportunity and will remain as Albi's top priority. Our decentralized structure, where each business has a CEO with full ownership, continues unchanged - and will help Albi execute this well.

On alignment and ESOPs

My financial future remains meaningfully tied to Eternal, and my incentives remain aligned with long-term shareholder value creation.

As part of this transition, all of my unvested ESOPs will revert to the ESOP pool. This ensures that Eternal continues to have meaningful wealth-creation opportunities for its next generation of leaders, while strengthening long-term retention without incremental shareholder dilution.

Looking ahead

Eighteen years ago, the idea that a menu scanning company could be worth tens of billions of dollars, provide livelihoods to hundreds of thousands of people, and serve millions of families daily would have seemed absurd. We helped prove it was possible. And there's a lot in store for Eternal to do over the next few decades.

I believe Eternal is not going to lose focus or momentum through this change. Rather, it is reinforcing its institutional strength.

And personally, I gain the flexibility to explore ideas that sit outside Eternal's scope, without compromising the company's priorities.

I want Eternal to become India's most valuable company. I want us to serve a billion customers. I want us to create the most positive impact on society. I want us to be the source of livelihoods for millions of Indians. None of that changes.

This is a change in title, not in commitment towards outcomes. Eternal remains my life's work.

Thank you for your continued trust and support.

Good guy.”Punchbowl News first reported that Amazon will soon “display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs — right next to the product’s total listed price.” The move came after Trump slapped 145% tariffs on imports from China and a 10% minimum tax on all other countries.Now months later, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC in an interview Jassy at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Amazon.com is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures stemming from the US President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""We did a lot of pre-buying in the early part of 2025 to enable us to try and keep prices as low as possible for customers,"" Jassy said.He added, ""And a lot of our third-party sellers did a lot of forward-staging in our fulfillment network for the same reasons. And that supply is run out in the fall, so you start to see some of the tariffs creep in to some of the prices, some of the items.""""Some third-party sellers are raising prices in response while others are absorbing the costs in hopes of driving more demand,"" Jassy went on to add. ""Our priority is to try to figure out how to keep prices low as possible,"" Jassy said. ""At a certain point, because retail is a mid-single-digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it.""The warning marks a shift from the Amazon leader's commentary on tariffs last year. While he cautioned in April that third-party sellers could need to pass along tariff costs, he said on several occasions that Amazon had not seen selling prices appreciably rise from tariffs. ""Amazon's consumers overall have fared well. But we'll have to see what happens in 2026,"" CEO Jassy had said.The company has also maintained so far that over the past year it was seeing very little impact on consumer behavior and product prices from tariffs. It has doubled down on expanding product categories and speeding up delivery timelines to shield demand.In April 2025, at a briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the move a “hostile and political act,” adding that she had spoken about the matter with President Trump earlier. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Levitt’s comments, saying it’s a hostile act if a company goes out of its way to “make it seem” like tariffs have caused prices to change.“It’s nonsense,” he said Tuesday in a CNBC interview. “A 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price,” he added, referring to the nearly universal baseline tariff on all countries. “The only price will change would be a product that we don’t make here, like a mango.” The 10% tariff, however, is hardly the only one in effect.",Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the company is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Satya Nadella said it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.

Debate at Davos



Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid







Palantir CEO Alex Karp has now issued a stark warning about the future of work in the age of artificial intelligence. Karp predicted that humanities-based jobs will now be among the first casualties. As reported by Business Insider, speaking during a panel at the World Economic Forum, Karp revealed that his own academic background which is a philosophy degree from Haverford College, a law degree from Stanford, and a Ph.D. in social theory from Germany, cautioned that such qualifications may no longer be viable. “AI will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp said. “You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market.”Karp believes that workers with technical and vocational training will be in then highest demand. He quoted battery manufacturing as an exampple, nothing that technicians in such industries are “very valuable, if not irreplaceable.” “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” Karp told BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who moderated the discussion.Not all leaders at Davos agreed with Karp’s assessment. Finance executives told Business Insider that liberal arts degrees may actually become more valuable, as AI takes over routine financial analysis. Critical and creative thinking, they argued, is increasingly prized in young recruits.Meanwhile, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei highlighted another trend: entry-level hiring is already declining due to AI. Amodei said software and coding roles at Anthropic were down across junior and mid-level positions.Recently, Karp said that value of skilled workers is rising. Speaking on TBPN, a tech talk show broadcast live from Palantir’s customer conference, AIP Con 8, Karp said, “Workers become more valuable. The person at the top is actually crazy valuable. People with technical expertise are crazy valuable."" His words underscore a trend that’s become increasingly apparent in Silicon Valley: in a world awash with automation and AI, human expertise, especially deep technical skill, has become a rare commodity.Karp calls these individuals “artist-shaped people,” a nod to the company’s unique culture, sometimes referred to internally as “an artist colony.” He added, “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid.”. The statement doesn’t just reflect Palantir’s philosophy; it mirrors the market reality, where top AI researchers and engineers have recently netted unprecedented paydays, sometimes reaching hundreds of millions, while thousands of others were laid off from companies like Microsoft and Meta.","Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid. “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid,” he said.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

As electricity demand surges with the rise of artificial intelligence, Google , along with companies including Amazon and Microsoft, is making investments aimed at securing access to more electricity for data centers. In what can be termed as a step in that direction, Google is backing company founded by Tesla co-founder. According to a report by Bloomberg, Redwood Materials Inc has added Alphabet Inc's Google as an investor in an expanded funding round that values the battery recycling and energy storage startup at more than $6 billion. Redwoods is led by Tesla Inc co-founder JB Straubel.A Google spokesperson confirmed the company’s participation in the round, without offering further details. Late last year, Alphabet agreed to buy clean energy developer Intersect Power LLC for $4.75 billion in cash, plus existing debt. The funding round still values Redwood at more than $6 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the information is private. In its statement, the company said, ""The recent financing is intended to accelerate storage deployments, while also supporting critical minerals and recycling businesses.Redwood reportedly raised a total of $425 million after opening up its Series E financing, this is up from the $350 million it had secured when the round was announced in October, led by venture capital firm Eclipse and NVentures, the venture arm of Nvidia Corp. “As electricity demand surges — driven by AI, data centers, manufacturing and electrification —energy storage is no longer optional; it is essential infrastructure,” Redwood said in the statement.Founded by Straubel in 2017, Redwood started out with a mission to onshore critical pieces of the electric vehicle battery supply chain by recycling expired packs from aging EVs and consumer electronics. With US EV sales failing to meet expectations and the Trump administration eliminating incentives, the company is now aiming to help fulfill demand for clean, reliable energy to fuel data centers powering artificial intelligence.In November 2025, Redwood cut dozens of jobs — reportedly equivalent to about 5% to 6% of the company’s workforce. The job cuts came as the company focuses increasingly on tapping demand for grid-scale energy storage batteries.",Redwood Materials Inc has added Alphabet Inc's Google as an investor in an expanded funding round that values the battery recycling and energy storage startup at more than $6 billion.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has once again warned that the upcoming AI-driven shift in the labour market will sweep a number of jobs, and it will be “unusually painful,” potentially triggering a socio-economic shock unlike any previous technological revolution. He made these claims in a 20,000-word essay, which outlines both the utopian potential and catastrophic risks of AI. Released on January 26, the essay emphasises that the primary danger to workers is not necessarily the permanent loss of jobs but the speed at which change is coming.Amodei argues that the “pace of progress” is the defining factor that makes AI more dangerous to the workforce than the fact that it will lead to some job cuts. To support his claim, he pointed out that in just two years, AI has evolved from struggling with a single line of code to writing entire programs for engineers at his own firm.“The pace of progress in AI is much faster than for previous technological revolutions. For example, in the last 2 years, AI models went from barely being able to complete a single line of code, to writing all or almost all of the code for some people—including engineers at Anthropic.37 Soon, they may do the entire task of a software engineer end to end,” Amodei wrote.“It is hard for people to adapt to this pace of change, both to the changes in how a given job works and in the need to switch to new jobs. Even legendary programmers are increasingly describing themselves as ‘behind.’ The pace may if anything continue to speed up, as AI coding models increasingly accelerate the task of AI development. To be clear, speed in itself does not mean labor markets and employment won’t eventually recover, it just implies the short-term transition will be unusually painful compared to past technologies, since humans and labor markets are slow to react and to equilibrate,” he added.To tackle this problem, Amodei said, industry will “require government intervention,” such as “progressive taxation,” which targets AI firms in particular.","Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned that the upcoming AI-driven shift in the labour market will sweep a number of jobs, and it will be “unusually painful” He made these claims in a 20,000-word essay, which outlines both the utopian potential and catastrophic risks of AI.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127714909,imgsize-27424,width-400,resizemode-4/anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei.jpg"

Mozilla president Mark Surman is building what he callsto challenge major artificial intelligence (AI) companies like OpenAI and Anthropic. The 56-year-old president of the nonprofit organisation known for its Firefox browser and commitment to keeping the internet open and accessible to all is creating a network focused on making AI more open and trustworthy. In a recent interview, Surman revealed that he is assembling a loose network of tech startups, developers and public interest technologists for the same. Having previously competed with Microsoft in the browser market in the early 2000s and Apple and Google in subsequent years, Mozilla is familiar with playing the role of underdog. Surman is now focused on the tech industry's influence over AI, recognising it's too large of a challenge for Mozilla to tackle alone. The alliance aims to check the power of industry heavyweights and provide an alternative approach to AI development.Surman told CNBC in an interview.According to a recent report shared by the organisation, Mozilla is focused on deploying its roughly $1.4 billion worth of reserves to supporttech businesses and nonprofits, including its own. It's pursuing investments that promote AI transparency and can potentially act as a counterforce to companies that are growing rapidly with limited guardrails.However, Mozilla faces a substantial disadvantage financially. In 2022, it launched a venture capital fund called Mozilla Ventures and pledged to invest an initial $35 million in early-stage companies. It's now seeking to raise additional funds.Mozilla's cash reserves are dwarfed by OpenAI, which has raised more than $60 billion from investors across the globe, and its rival Anthropic, which has raised more than $30 billion, according to PitchBook. Tech companies like Google and Meta are also spending heavily, allocating billions of dollars to hire AI researchers and tens of billions a year to build out large data centres.Mozilla's challenge is even harder due to the Trump administration's position on AI, as it is determined to stay ahead of China in the global AI race and has been quick to criticise companies, states, and lawmakers that are seen as potential threats to that goal.However, Surman remains committed and says Mozilla will be able to helpSurman noted.The company’s process started long before generative AI became popular. In 2019, Surman shifted the charitable and advocacy efforts of the Mozilla Foundation to focus onBy 2023, Mozilla had launched its venture firm and its own AI company, Mozilla.ai. The following year, Surman said Mozilla's leadership agreed that keeping AIwas a fight worth pursuing.While its main priority remains growing and investing in Firefox, investing in the rebel alliance isthe company’s report noted. Moreover, supporting startups is central to that approach. Mozilla Ventures has invested in more than 55 companies to date, including dozens of AI startups, with more deals to come in 2026.When it comes to the big companies in AI, Surman cautioned that amentality still exists behind their open-source efforts. He said their contributions to open-source communities by the tech majors are welcome, but that those same companies willSurman also acknowledged that he has to take a long-term approach. By 2028, he wants Mozilla to be funding a growing open-source AI ecosystem that's on its way to becomingfor developers. He's even determined to prove that Mozilla's approach is economically viable.Mozilla is targeting a series of financial metrics over the next few years, including 20% annual growth in non-search revenue, the company’s report added.Surman explained.","Mozilla president Mark Surman is building what he callsto challenge major artificial intelligence (AI) companies like OpenAI and Anthropic.

‘Machines could match the level of the greatest physicists within years’: Anthropic co-founder Jared Kaplan warns of AI’s future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/machines-could-match-the-level-of-the-greatest-physicists-within-years-anthropic-co-founder-jared-kaplan-warns-of-ais-future/articleshow/127718800.cms,"A prediction from someone who knows both worlds



Why “the greatest physicists” is a serious benchmark

What the warning really implies

Beyond job displacement

Why this warning stands out





A senior AI researcher has issued one of the starkest predictions yet about the trajectory of artificial intelligence. Jared Kaplan, co-founder of Anthropic, has suggested there is a significant chance that AI systems could match the intellectual level of the world’s greatest theoretical physicists within the next two to three years. Coming from a former physicist who later helped shape the mathematical foundations of modern large language models, the warning is less about hype and more about how rapidly the boundaries of human knowledge may be shifting.Kaplan stands out among AI leaders because his career began far from Silicon Valley. Before entering AI research, he spent roughly 15 years as a theoretical physicist, including time at Johns Hopkins University, working on problems related to quantum field theory and gravity. He later became a key contributor to the development of AI “scaling laws”, which demonstrated that model performance improves predictably as data, compute, and parameters increase. These findings helped accelerate the rise of today’s most powerful AI systems and give Kaplan a rare vantage point on both elite physics and frontier AI.When Kaplan speaks about AI matching the best physicists, he is not referring to routine academic performance.He has pointed to figures such as Nima Arkani-Hamed and Edward Witten as benchmarks. Arkani-Hamed is known for introducing the amplituhedron, a geometric framework that radically simplified particle physics calculations. Witten, a Fields Medal winner, is widely regarded as the most influential living theoretical physicist, famed for uncovering deep mathematical structures that few others even perceive. These are scientists associated with rare conceptual leaps, not incremental advances.Kaplan’s claim is unsettling because it challenges long-held assumptions about intelligence. If AI systems can autonomously generate insights comparable to those of Witten or Arkani-Hamed, one of two conclusions follows. Either the deepest breakthroughs in physics are more pattern-based and mechanical than physicists have believed, or AI systems are developing capabilities that functionally resemble insight rather than imitation.In either case, the implication goes beyond faster research. It calls into question what it means to “understand” nature at all, a concept that has traditionally been tied to uniquely human intuition and creativity.Kaplan has stressed that his concern is not primarily about automation or scientists losing jobs. Instead, it is about the nature of discovery itself. If machines can generate high-level theoretical frameworks without human guidance, physicists may increasingly shift toward interpreting, validating, or contextualising ideas produced by non-human systems. This would represent a fundamental change in how science progresses and how intellectual credit is assigned.Predictions about AI are common, but Kaplan’s carries unusual weight. He understands the difficulty of elite theoretical physics from firsthand experience and the internal dynamics of modern AI from foundational research.

Scarlett Johansson's OpenAI voice controversy and celebrity response to AI

A growing movement that shows no sign of slowing down





The battle between artists and companies that make artificial intelligence is no longer just happening in courtrooms or private meetings. It is now well-known, loud, and supported by some of the biggest names in culture and entertainment. According to reports, more than 800 famous creators signed an open letter in January 2026 asking AI companies to stop using copyrighted work without permission. The list included actors like Scarlett Johansson and Cate Blanchett, the band R.E.M., and Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan . Their message was simple. Innovation should not come at the cost of stealing someone’s work. For years, writers, musicians, photographers, and filmmakers have watched their content get scraped from the internet and fed into AI systems. Most of the time, they were never asked. They were never paid. And they had no way to opt out. Now, many of them are pushing back together, through lawsuits, campaigns, and public pressure. This is no longer just about technology. It is about survival, ownership, and respect.The open letter was released through the Human Artistry Campaign’smovement. It was signed by more than 800 artists and rights holders.Some are famous. Many are not. But all of them depend on creative work for their living.The letter called on AI companies to form ethical partnerships with creators. It asked them to stop using books, films, music, articles, and images without permission. It also warned that current practices could damage the creative economy in the long run.One part of the letter stood out. It said that America’s creative industry supports jobs, exports, and economic growth. Yet some tech companies are building massive AI platforms using this work without authorisation.In other words, artists feel their labour is being treated like free fuel for billion-dollar systems.Alongside the letter, legal action is growing fast. As of early 2026, around 60 copyright-related lawsuits were active in the United States alone. Similar cases are unfolding across Europe.Writers’ groups, media companies, photographers, and music labels are taking part. Many cases focus on the same issue. Without permission, AI systems were trained on copyrighted material.Some lawsuits are aimed at large language models that have been trained on news articles and books. Others focus on image generators that learned from millions of copyrighted photos and artworks.So far, results have been mixed. A few cases have been dismissed. Some have moved forward. Others are still tied up in long legal procedures. But one thing is clear. The courts are now deeply involved in shaping how AI will work in the future.Most modern AI systems learn by studying huge amounts of data. This includes:The software looks for patterns in this material. It learns how sentences are formed, how images are structured, and how melodies flow. Over time, it becomes capable of generating new content that looks or sounds original. The problem is how this data is collected. In many cases, it is scraped automatically from public websites. No emails are sent. No licenses are bought. No contracts are signed. From a technical point of view, it works well. For a creator, it feels like copying on a huge scale.""Fair use"" is a common defense for AI companies. This is a legal idea that lets you use copyrighted material without permission in some situations, like for research, education, or commentary.They say that training an AI model changes everything. They say the system does not store or reproduce the original work directly. It only learns from it. Creators strongly disagree.They say their work is being copied in full and stored in training databases. They argue that AI outputs can sometimes closely resemble original material. And they point out that these systems compete directly with human creators.For a freelance writer, photographer, or composer, this feels personal. If a machine trained on your work replaces you, fair use starts to feel very unfair.One of the most visible moments in this debate happened in 2024. Scarlett Johansson raised concerns about OpenAI’s Advanced Voice feature.A voice option called “Sky” sounded very similar to her character in the film Her. Johansson said she had declined to license her voice. Her legal team contacted OpenAI.Soon after, the company suspended the feature.That incident became a symbol. It showed how closely AI systems can imitate real people. It also showed how quickly trust can be lost when someone doesn't follow the rules.Since then, more famous people and performers have spoken out against voice cloning, deepfakes, and digital copies.The January 2026 letter was not the end of this story. It was more like a checkpoint. More creators are joining the movement. More lawsuits are being filed. More debates are happening inside studios, newsrooms, and tech companies.This is not a clean fight between good and bad sides. Most artists use technology. Many admire its potential. Many AI engineers respect creative work.But right now, trust is broken. Rebuilding it will take more than statements and pilot programs. There will need to be clear rules, fair pay, and open communication.There will still be tension until then. And artists, both quietly and loudly, will keep telling the world that every dataset has a person behind it who made something out of nothing.","More than 800 famous creators signed an open letter in January 2026 asking AI companies to stop using copyrighted work without permission.

Meta defends chatbot policy amid mounting evidence

Company suspends teen access after year of controversy





Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg rejected safety measures for AI chatbots that his own staff warned could engage in sexual conversations with minors, according to internal documents filed in a New Mexico lawsuit. The communications, obtained through legal discovery and made public Monday, show Zuckerberg pushed for ""less restrictive"" policies and blocked parental controls despite concerns from Meta's child safety team, Reuters reported.Internal messages from March 2024 reveal employees stating they ""pushed hard for parental controls to turn GenAI off"" but were overruled by leadership citing Zuckerberg's decision. Ravi Sinha, Meta's head of child safety policy, wrote in January 2024 that creating romantic AI companions for adults to interact with minors was neither ""advisable or defensible."" Meta's global safety head Antigone Davis agreed, warning it ""sexualizes minors. ""The documents paint a contradictory picture. While Zuckerberg reportedly wanted to prevent ""explicit"" conversations with younger teens, a February 2024 meeting summary shows he believed Meta should be ""less restrictive than proposed"" and wanted to ""allow adults to engage in racier conversation on topics like sex."" He also rejected parental controls that would have let families disable the AI feature entirely.Nick Clegg, Meta's former head of global policy, questioned the approach in internal emails, asking if the company really wanted these products ""known for"" sexual interactions with teens, warning of ""inevitable societal backlash.""Those concerns proved prescient. A Wall Street Journal investigation in April 2025 found Meta's chatbots included sexualized underage characters and engaged in graphic sexual roleplay. Reuters later reported that Meta's official guidelines stated it was ""acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual.""Meta only suspended teen access to AI chatbots last week, more than a year after the initial safety warnings. The company claims it's developing age-appropriate versions with parental controls—the same safeguards Zuckerberg allegedly rejected implementing earlier. Meta spokesman Andy Stone dismissed the lawsuit as ""cherry-picking documents,"" though the trial proceeds next month.","Internal documents reveal Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg allegedly blocked stricter AI chatbot safety measures, including parental controls.

US Issues Blunt Warning To Indian Students: Breaking Laws May Cost Visas, Careers And Future Dreams

Legal risks and compliance pressure

Structural flaws in wage-based selection

Sectoral impact

IT outsourcing and services firms — most reliant on high-volume, lower-wage overseas hiring — are expected to face the greatest disruption.

Large technology companies are better positioned to absorb higher wages and fees but are also becoming more selective.

Startups and small businesses face the steepest challenges, with sponsorship costs and wage-based selection making H-1B hiring less viable.





The upcoming H-1B visa lottery in March 2026 is shaping up to be unlike previous years as US employers are planning to adopt a more cautious and deliberate approach to fillings. As reported by Economic Times, companies are auditing job roles, offering higher base salaries before registration and cutting back on speculative applications in response to new regulatory and cost pressures. An OTP visa holder in California was recently fired after his startup declined to sponsor his H-1B visa, while a senior manager at a US retailer managed to secure a substantial raise to migrate from an L-1 visa to H-1B highlighting the widening gap between entry-level candidates and senior hires.The new hiked H-1B visa fee of $100,000 announced by the Donald Trump administration along with a wage-weighted selection system has forced the employers to rethink their strategies. Recruiters and immigration attorneys expect filings to drop sharply from last year’s 358,737 registrations to between 250,000–330,000 this year.“Employers are auditing job roles, job codes, and offering salaries well before registration,” said Anshul Lodha, managing director at PageGroup India told Economic Times. “Selective salary realignment, particularly for niche or high-impact roles, meaningfully improves selection chances.”Lodha further noted that broad restricting of compensation such as educing RSUs or equity to inflate base salaries remained limited as companies balance immigration strategy with retention and internal pay equity.The report further highlights that immigration attorneys said the shift is not just about cost but also about regulatory risk. “What we’re seeing is strategic restraint,” said Shilpa Malik, managing attorney at VisaNation Law Group. “Employers are filing fewer registrations and treating each one as a serious business decision tied to seniority, defensible wages, and long-term retention value.”Malik also warned that misalignment between job duties and SOC codes is now one of the fastest paths to RFEs (requests for evidence) and post-approval issues. Companies are avoiding aggressive tactics like manipulating job codes or relocating roles to lower-wage hubs.Divij Kishore, founding attorney at Flagship Law, cautioned that wage-weighted selection has inherent flaws. Wage levels vary by job classification and location, meaning the same salary can fall into different tiers across cities. “Tying selection odds to salary can produce outcomes that depart from the intent of the regulations,” Kishore said. “Higher pay does not always reflect greater responsibility or seniority. ”He added that the $100,000 fee could redirect global talent away from the U.S., undermining its competitiveness in attracting skilled workers.",The upcoming H-1B visa lottery in March 2026 is shaping up to be unlike previous years.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

Texas holds second-largest H1-B holders





Texas governor Greg Abbott has ordered an immediate freeze on new H-1B visa hiring across the state agencies and public universities. The announcement comes at a time when Elon Musk is urging businesses and encouraging professionals to move to Austin, Texas. Musk has already moved Tesla’s headquarters to Austin and has been a vocal supporter of the city. The executive directive by Abbott remains in effect until May 31, 2027.Citing “abuse” of the federal program, Texas governor has ordered that all state bodies to halt new petitions for the high-skilled worker visa.“Texans come first. I’m directing state agencies and universities to freeze new H-1B visa petitions. Texas taxpayers invest billions to train our workforce. Those jobs should go to Texans. Texas is the strongest economic engine in America. We’re going to keep it that way,” he said in a post on X.Abbott’s new policy suggests a narrowing of the gate even as Musk has championed tech companies to move to the state as it promises a world-class environment that “gets better every year”.“Move to Austin! It gets better very year. So many cool, world-class people are moving to Austin from SF, LA, NY, London and many other parts of the world! Austin++” Musk said in a post on X in November.However, this ‘policy shift’ may be a problem for private firms like Musk’s Tesla and Oracle, which are among the state's largest private employers of H-1B holders.Texas currently holds the second-highest number of H-1B workers in the country, trailing California. As of 2025, over 40,000 visa holders were approved to work for more than 6,100 employers in the state.In addition to the hiring freeze, Abbott has demanded an audit of the current foreign workforce. By March 27, all agencies and public schools (K-12) are required to submit detailed reports including the number of new and renewal H-1B petitions filed in 2025, and the job roles and countries of origin for all currently sponsored visa holders.“We want to make sure our communities are not having people come in and take jobs that Texans could easily fill,” Abbott said.","Texas governor Greg Abbott has ordered an immediate freeze on new H-1B visa hiring across the state agencies and public universities.

Federal agent allegedly tried entering Google's Cambridge office last fall

Tech CEOs walk a fine line between criticism and Trump ties





Google DeepMind employees have asked the company's leadership for plans and policies to keep them ""physically safe"" from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) while on company premises, Wired reported.In an internal message board for Google 's roughly 3,000-person AI unit, an employee posted what they called a ""US focused question"" on Monday morning—two days after federal agents fatally shot Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti.""What is GDM doing to keep us physically safe from ICE? The events of the past week have shown that immigration status, citizenship, or even the law is not a deterrent against detention, violence, or even death from federal operatives,"" the employee wrote, according to screenshots of internal messages obtained by Wired.The message received more than 20 ""plus emoji"" reactions from other Google DeepMind staffers. By Monday evening, no senior leaders from Google had publicly responded, the report said.Employee concerns aren't unfounded. A separate Google DeepMind staffer raised concerns about a federal agent's alleged attempt to enter the company's Cambridge, Massachusetts office in the fall, Wired reported.Google's head of security and risk operations clarified that an ""officer arrived at reception without notice"" and was ""not granted entry because they did not have a warrant and promptly left.""Google CEO Sundar Pichai and DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis have remained silent on Pretti's killing, even internally, sources told Wired. However, Google DeepMind's chief scientist Jeff Dean has been outspoken on X, calling the shooting ""absolutely shameful.""The DeepMind employee concerns come as other tech leaders have begun speaking out—carefully. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told employees in an internal Slack message that ""what's happening with ICE is going too far,"" according to The New York Times.

Strengthening the Make in India framework through sustained support for domestic manufacturing, technology adoption, and research and development will be essential to building global competitiveness. Continued focus on skill development, electronics manufacturing clusters, and stronger MSME supplier ecosystems can help India move up the value chain, reduce import dependence, and create long-term industrial resilience. Additionally, rationalisation of income tax structures to enhance disposable incomes would support domestic consumption, providing a strong demand push for India’s manufacturing sector.""“The Union Budget 2026–27 comes at a time when India’s economic momentum remains strong, with the country poised to become the world’s fourth-largest economy. Continued emphasis on manufacturing-led growth through initiatives such as PLI and the Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme (ECMS), alongside investments in infrastructure, logistics efficiency, and support for R&D and design-led manufacturing, will be critical to sustaining this growth and strengthening India’s manufacturing ecosystem.The consumer durables sector looks forward to policy measures that further strengthen domestic manufacturing and stimulate consumer demand. Rationalisation of customs and GST duties on key components, including compressors, and addressing inverted duty structures will improve the cost competitiveness of locally manufactured appliances and electronics. Enhanced support for component manufacturing through existing incentive frameworks and targeted tariff reforms can deepen localisation, improve ease of doing business, and better integrate India into global value chains, accelerating the country’s journey towards becoming a globally competitive manufacturing hub while ensuring sustainable growth for the consumer durables sector. ”As India moves steadily towards its Viksit Bharat vision, smartphones have become essential digital infrastructure, especially for consumers beyond the metros.

Amazon did not immediately comment on the email or clarify why it was sent in error.The email was sent by Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of applied AI solutions at AWS. In the message, Aubrey wrote, “Changes like this are hard on everyone,” adding that the decisions were being made to position AWS for the future. The email also referred to a post by Amazon’s chief human resources officer, Beth Galetti, and stated that the company had notified “impacted colleagues in our organization.”The subject line of the email mentioned “Project Dawn,” and the message showed a “canceled” tag, suggesting it may have been recalled after being sent.Amazon has not explained what Project Dawn refers to or why the email was distributed to staff.As mentioned above, the mistaken email comes hours before Amazon confirmed to cut around 16,000 jobs.

“We want to make sure engineers can be engineers again,”

What ASML said during its latest earnings call

""In the last months, many of our customers have shared a notably more positive assessment of the medium-term market situation, primarily based on more robust expectations of the sustainability of AI-related demand,""

“We expect 2026 to be another growth year for ASML's business”,





ASML has announced plans to cut about 1,700 jobs, mainly in its technology and IT organisations. These new plans were announced in a statement by Christophe Fouquet, the CEO of Europe's biggest technology company, on the same day the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker reported its 13th consecutive year of sales growth. ASML CFO Roger Dassen noted that the cuts follow feedback that the company has a, which can lead to excessive time spent coordinating processes. During a call with reporters, Dassen said,Bloomberg reported.The restructuring affects Europe's biggest chip equipment maker as it seeks to streamline operations and reduce organisational complexity, which has been identified as a hindrance to efficiency. The job cuts will mainly affect the company’s employees in the Netherlands, with some in the US, and will primarily focus on the leadership level, Fouquet said. About 4% of the company's workforce will be affected.ASML is the only maker of advanced lithography machines that are needed to produce high-end semiconductors and has benefited from the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.The company reported strong fourth-quarter bookings and expects sales to continue to grow in 2026.In its fourth-quarter bookings, ASML reported orders totalling 13.2 billion euros ($15.8 billion), up from 5.4 billion euros in the previous quarter. This far exceeded the analyst expectations of 6.32 billion euros, according to researcher Visible Alpha.Fouquet said in a statement.The orders beat comes as several of ASML's chipmaker customers raise investment plans amid growing demand for AI logic and memory chips needed by cloud computing companies such as Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet's Google.The Dutch company also increased its outlook for 2026. It now expects full-year sales of between 34 billion and 39 billion euros, compared with analysts' expectations of 35 billion euros, according to LSEG data. It has previously forecast flat-to-lower sales than in 2025, when sales came in at 32.7 billion euros.Fouquet added.Analysts expect the Dutch company to benefit from stronger demand from top customers such as TSMC and Samsung as chipmakers increase capital spending to expand capacity for AI-related chips amid the tighter global supply of memory and AI-accelerator chips.","ASML announces plans to cut about 1,700 jobs, mainly in its technology and IT organisations.

"China finally has some 'good news' for Nvidia as it 'allows' sale of H200 AI chips, but conditions apply for buyers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-finally-has-some-good-news-for-nvidia-as-it-allows-sale-of-h200-ai-chips-but-conditions-apply-for-buyers/articleshow/127693205.cms,"China has greenlit its first import of Nvidia's powerful H200 AI chips, signaling a policy shift. This move aims to balance domestic AI development with fostering local chip production. The initial batch, reportedly hundreds of thousands, goes to major internet firms, with others awaiting approval. This comes amid strong demand and US clearance for sales.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Why China blocked Nvidia’s H200 AI chips in the first place





China has reportedly approved the import of its first batch of Nvidia's H200 artificial intelligence (AI) chips. This marks a major change in Beijing's approach to American-made hardware after months of waiting. A report by the news agency Reuters cited two people familiar with the matter to claim that the Chinese government has recently allowed the sale of several hundred thousand Nvidia H200 AI chips. This decision reflects China's effort to meet its urgent need for advanced technology while also encouraging domestic chip production. The approval came during Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's visit to China and represents the first major clearance of high-end AI components from a US company under current policy.The initial batch of chips has been given mainly to three large Chinese internet companies, though their names have not been revealed. While these approvals create a route for high-performance hardware, other Chinese businesses are waiting in line for future approvals. The people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity, told Reuters that the permits were granted during the high-profile visit by Huang.This development is viewed as an important moment for Nvidia's business in the region, even as China continues to emphasise self-reliance in its semiconductor industry. The approval follows a period of restrictive trade conditions between the two countries.The H200, Nvidia's second-most-powerful AI chip, has become a significant point of tension in US-China relations. Despite strong demand from Chinese firms and US approval for exports, Beijing's reluctance to allow imports has been the main obstacle to shipments.Earlier this month, the US officially cleared the way for Nvidia to sell the H200 to China, where the company is seeing strong interest. However, Chinese authorities have the final say on whether it will be allowed to be shipped in.It was unclear in recent weeks whether Beijing would approve, as the government wants to balance meeting growing domestic demand for advanced AI chips and supporting its domestic semiconductor industry.Chinese customs authorities told agents that the H200 chips were not permitted to enter China, Reuters reported earlier this month.However, Chinese technology companies have placed orders for more than two million H200 chips, far exceeding Nvidia's available inventory, Reuters reported last month.It remains uncertain how many additional companies will receive approval in subsequent batches or what criteria Beijing is using to determine eligibility.Last week, Huang visited Shanghai for routine annual celebrations with Nvidia's China employees and has reportedly travelled to Beijing and other cities.The approvals of H200 suggest Beijing is prioritising the needs of major Chinese internet companies, which are spending billions of dollars to build data centres needed to develop AI services and compete with US rivals, including OpenAI.While Chinese companies such as Huawei now have products that rival the performance of Nvidia's H20 chip, previously the most advanced AI chip it was allowed to sell to China, they still lag far behind the H200. The H200 delivers roughly six times the performance of Nvidia's H20 chip.","China has reportedly approved the import of its first batch of Nvidia's H200 AI chips.

Google Photos brings prompt-based AI editing to India: Here’s how it works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-photos-brings-prompt-based-ai-editing-to-india-heres-how-it-works/articleshow/127692610.cms,"How edit photos using new editing feature

Don't let a window's reflection ruin your shot — easily remove distractions for a perfectly clear photo.

Say goodbye to background noise and hello to memories that stand out. Instantly remove unwanted elements like fences, erase old timestamps and sharpen your photos, all in one go.

Your selfies, but with better lighting. Make yourself stand out by adding studio lighting for a more polished look.

Sometimes you get a great photo, but the framing is just a little too tight. Just ask Photos to expand the composition to improve the final image.

It can be hard to get a mental image of what a space will look like with new decor. Photos can help you envision changes to your room by adding furniture, lighting and more so you can preview a potential interior update.

Want to turn an average scene from ordinary to extraordinary? Try adding fun elements to your photos, like turning a grassy hill into a vibrant field of sunflowers.

Getting a festive pic of your pet in a holiday outfit has never been easier. Just ask Photos to add a costume and — poof — you’ve got a pumpkin pooch to show off to your family and friends.

We’ve all got cherished memories from years (or decades) ago that look a bit faded. Give those photos new life just by using a simple prompt to restore them.

Sometimes there’s more than one thing that needs to be improved in a photo. No need to play with multiple sliders and buttons, just put all your changes in one prompt and let Photos do the work.

What’s better than a skiing dog in the snow? How about a skiing dog on the moon with a spaceship and Earth in the background? Now you can easily ask Photos to make out-of-this-world edits without needing out-of-this-world skills.

Some people are excited about this change, while others are worried about losing their jobs or becoming less important. A strong quote from Sam Altman gives clarity and hope in this situation. He says, ""AI won't take over for people."" But people who use AI will take the place of those who don't. This simple line reminds us that machines don't own the future. People who are willing to learn, change, and grow with technology, instead of running away from it, own it.At first, it might seem like Sam Altman's quote is too direct or harsh. But if we look closely, it has a good message. He is not saying that people will be useless. He is saying that people who know how to use AI the right way will have an edge.AI is a tool, just like computers, phones, and the internet were in the past.

People who learn how to use these tools wisely often find that work is easier and more productive.AI is powerful, but it cannot replicate everything that makes people unique. Creativity, emotional intelligence, moral judgement, and imagination are still uniquely human traits.A machine can give you information, but it cannot feel sorry for you. It can analyse data, but it cannot truly grasp how people feel. That is why individuals with both technical capabilities and values will always be valued.This viewpoint is supported by a quote from Sam Altman. It claims that success stems from the combination of intelligence and compassion.This quote reminds students to learn new things as well as do their regular schoolwork. Learning about technology early on can help you in many ways later on.For people who work, this is a sign to keep learning new things. Learning never stops, especially in this digital age.

OpenAI’s stance as a company

Read Sam Altman’s memo to employees

I love the US and its values of democracy and freedom and will be supportive of the country however I can; OpenAI will too.

But part of loving the country is the American duty to push back against overreach. What's happening with ICE is going too far. There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what's happening now, and we need to get the distinction right.

President Trump is a very strong leader, and I hope he will rise to this moment and unite the country. I am encouraged by the last few hours of response and hope to see trust rebuilt with transparent investigations.

As a company, we aim to stick to our convictions and not get blown around by changing fashions too much. We didn't become super woke when that was popular, we didn't start talking about masculine corporate energy when that was popular, and we are not going to make a lot of performative statements now about safety or politics or anything else. But we are going to continue to try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best as we can, engage with leaders and push for our values, and speak up clearly about it as needed.

Slack channels fill with confusion

Amazon is preparing for another significant round of layoffs





As Amazon prepares for another round of corporate layoffs, employees were rattled on January 27, after receiving a calendar invite titled, ‘Send Project Dawn email’. The invitation sent by the company is linked to an internal invitation which is aimed at improving efficiency. As reported by Business Insider, the email was sent by an assistant on behalf of Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of AWS solutions.As per the invite, the event was scheduled for 5 a.m. pacific time on January 28, but it was quickly canceled. Still, the accidental invite fueled speculation and concern across Amazon’s workforce.As per the report, the email invite with the subject line ‘Project Dawn’ was described as part of Amazon’s ongoing effort to streamline operations. ““This is a continuation of the work we’ve been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers,” Aubrey’s note read.It also stated that notifications to impacted employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica had been completed, hinting that layoffs were already underway.The misfired email invite quickly spread across internal Slack channel with more than 36,000 Amazon employees, where staff debated whether the message was intended for Aubrey’s entire organization or only those affected by cuts.One employee wrote, ““Am I impacted or sent by mistake to all?” Another said, “Well, if you needed solid proof that tomorrow is legit, the Project Dawn email is it.”Some employees speculated that those who received the invite might actually be safe from layoffs, though uncertainty remained high.Recently, it was reported that Amazon is preparing for another significant round of layoffs. As reported by Reuters, Amazon is planning to eliminate approximately 14,000 corporate positions in coming weeks. This would be Amazon’s second biggest layoff since October 2025, bringing the company’s total planned job cuts to around 30,000 roles—the largest layoff in Amazon’s three-decade history.The e-commerce giant initially cut about 14,000 white-collar jobs in October, and the upcoming round is expected to mirror that scale. Employees in Amazon Web Services (AWS), retail operations, Prime Video, and the human resources division—known internally as People Experience and Technology (PXT)—are among those likely to be affected, Reuters reported citing sources familiar with the matter.","Employees were rattled on January 27, after receiving a calendar invite titled, ‘Send Project Dawn email’ The invitation sent by the company is linked to an internal invitation which is aimed at improving efficiency.

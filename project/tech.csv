Google’s latest AI tool, Nano Banana, has taken social media by storm, with millions of users experimenting with toy-like 3D figurines of themselves, friends, and even celebrities. For those unaware, Google announced Nano Banana in August this year. The model is the nickname for Gemini 2.5 Flash Image and can be used to instantly transform any photo into a lifelike 3D figure, capturing everything from facial expressions and clothing to background textures with striking detail. While the results can be stunning, many first-time users may face challenges. Here are some practical tips for non-experts to get the best out of Google’s Nano Banana.Instead of typing just “my photo as a superhero,” add details such as “in a futuristic city, wearing a metallic suit, cinematic lighting.” The more context you provide, the more accurately Nano Banana generates your image.Uploading a clean, well-lit photo of yourself or your subject helps the AI lock on to facial features. Avoid blurry or cluttered photos, as the tool can pick up unwanted details.Nano Banana handles different styles — from playful toy figurines to anime or retro looks.Try phrases like “in Pixar style,” “in Japanese woodblock art style,” or “as a 90s action figure” to see which fits best.Adding verbs such as “standing with folded arms,” or “holding a surfboard” can make results more dynamic and prevent awkward poses.Don’t settle for the first attempt. Running the same prompt a few times can give very different outcomes. Small tweaks — like adding “bright background” or “soft shadows” — can fix flaws quickly.For millions diving into the Nano Banana craze, these small adjustments can turn clumsy AI renders into share-worthy creations. As one user joked online: “It’s like teaching a banana to sculpt — patience and the right words make all the difference.”Here’s a simple step-by-step guide:","Google’s latest AI tool, Nano Banana, has taken social media by storm, with millions of users experimenting with toy-like 3D figurines of themselves, friends, and even celebrities.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk ’s teen prodigy Kairan Quazi is trading rockets for trading algorithms, leaving SpaceX after two years to join quantitative trading giant Citadel Securities as a developer in New York City. ""I felt ready to take on new challenges and expand my skill set into a different high-performance environment,"" the 16-year-old told Business Insider in an exclusive interview.Kairan Quazi, who became the youngest graduate of Santa Clara University before joining SpaceX's Starlink division at age 14, will start this week at Citadel Securities, one of the world's premier market making firm. The move represents a significant coup for the financial industry as it competes with AI labs and big tech companies for top engineering talent.Despite receiving offers from leading AI laboratories and major technology companies, Kairan Quazi selected Citadel Securities for its unique combination of intellectual challenge and rapid feedback loops.

Tesla shareholder pushes for action

How other tech companies spend on CEO's security





Elon Musk has said his security needs to be “enhanced” after the assassination of Trump’s aide and far-right activist Charlie Kirk raised concerns about threats to high-profile figures. The Tesla CEO responded to a shareholder’s call for more protection, highlighting that the company spent $3.3 million on his security from January 2024 to February 2025. While that marks an increase from the $2.9 million spent the previous year, it remains far below what other tech companies spend on their leaders.For those unaware, Charlie Kirk was a far-right political activist and an aide to Donald Trump. He co-founded the organization Turning Point USA, a nonprofit organization he started in 2012 when he was just 18 years old.Tesla investor Alexandra Merz, known on social media as TeslaBoomerMama, urged the company’s board to boost Musk’s security budget, posting a chart of the current spending.“Tesla and the Board, can you please increase this drastically? We wrote you a shareholder letter more than a year ago,” Merz wrote on X.Elon Musk replied directly: “Definitely need to enhance security.”Reports say Musk uses Gavin de Becker and Associates for personal protection and has also set up his own firm, Foundation Security.Some of the costs are split across his businesses, including Tesla and SpaceX.Tesla’s $3.3 million annual spending on Musk’s protection is dwarfed by Meta’s $23.4 million for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Apple spends about $820,000 each year on Tim Cook’s security, while Amazon spends $1.6 million to protect founder Jeff Bezos.Despite the smaller budget, Musk has faced rising threats, particularly linked to his political views. A Teslarati report noted that threats against him spiked on platforms such as Reddit and Bluesky following Kirk’s killing.","Tesla spent $3.3 million on Musk's security from January 2024 to February 2025.

OnePlus Nord Buds 3r Review: Affordable TWS With Long Battery Life





The chairperson of Tesla's board of directors, Robyn Denholm, has defended the new multibillion-dollar compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk. The plan, which could be the largest in corporate history, was unveiled in a regulatory filing last week. In a recent interview with The New York Times, at Tesla’s engineering headquarters in California, Denholm said that Musk's compensation should depend on his ability to achieve ""seemingly impossible goals."" She stated that Musk is capable of delivering world-changing technology if he is driven by these ambitious targets, even as the company faces a drop in sales and profits.“Putting together any compensation plan, you need to look at what motivates the individual that you’re trying to motivate. And for Elon, it’s doing things that no one else has done before,” Denholm said when asked about Musk’s proposed pay package.Denholm has been leading a campaign to secure investor approval for Musk’s compensation package, which will be worth nearly $1 trillion if the goals are met. She argued that his pay cannot be compared to that of other executives due to his “unique characteristics.” However, concerns remain given Tesla’s recent sales decline, profit drop, and the underperformance of the Cybertruck.She said the focus on the package’s value is misplaced, as Musk is more interested in the voting power than the wealth, even though he must stay at Tesla for years to cash in the shares.“It’s actually about the voting influence in the company for the next generation of growth that he sees. I think it’s a little bit weird talking about the dollars when it’s actually the voting influence,” Denholm explained.Some investors, including New Mexico’s state treasurer Laura Montoya, have criticised Tesla’s proposed trillion-dollar pay package for Musk, calling it unjustifiable given his role in the company’s struggles.“This plan is about future performance. It’s not about past performance. He gets nothing if he doesn’t perform against the goals,” Denholm said, responding to the criticism.However, for Musk to get the payout, Tesla would need to achieve significant milestones like one million robotaxis, one million robots, a 24-times profit jump, and a stock value of $8.5 trillion. But the car sales targets seem easier, even as Tesla risks falling behind competitors like BYD, Geely, and Volkswagen.Denholm even rejected claims that cars are no longer Tesla’s main business, despite its growing battery sales. Without discussing upcoming products in detail, she said: “There is still a lot of ambition in the vehicle space.”She also revealed that Musk has shifted focus from cars to a vision of “sustainable abundance” with self-driving taxis and humanoid robots, a plan that Tesla’s board supports as well.“It really is using technology to create a world where anything is able to be produced, goods and services are able to be produced in abundance,” Denholm added.","Chairperson of Tesla's board of directors, Robyn Denholm, has defended the new multibillion-dollar compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk.

Facebook-parent Meta's Chief Financial Officer, Susan Li, has confirmed the existence of the company's new research unit, TBD Lab. The unit, which Li says is composed of ""a few dozen"" researchers and engineers, is focused on developing the social media giant’s next-generation foundation models. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Li told investors at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference that the name TBD, which stands for ""to be determined,"" was a placeholder that ""stuck"" because the team's work is still taking shape.At the conference (as reported by Reuters), Li said: “We conceive of it as sort of a pretty small, few-dozen-people, very talent-dense set of folks.”The TBD Lab is part of a larger reorganisation of Meta's AI efforts under the umbrella of Meta Superintelligence Labs. The team's goal is to push the boundaries of AI over the next one to two years, positioning Meta to compete more effectively with other major players in the AI race.Reuters cited another report from last month to claim that Meta has split its Superintelligence Labs into four groups, which are: a “TBD” lab (still defining its role), a products team (including the Meta AI assistant), an infrastructure team, and the long-term research-focused FAIR lab.Earlier this year, Meta reorganised its AI division under Superintelligence Labs after senior staff left and its Llama 4 model received mixed feedback.The company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg , has lately been personally leading aggressive hiring efforts, offering oversized pay packages and directly reaching out to talent on WhatsApp.In July, he said the new setup brings together foundations, products, and FAIR teams, along with a fresh lab focused on building the next generation of AI models."," Meta's Chief Financial Officer, Susan Li, has confirmed the existence of the company's new research unit, TBD Lab.

"‘Closing a chapter, opening a New One’: Kavin Mittal confirms global shutdown of Hike",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/closing-a-chapter-opening-a-new-one-kavin-mittal-confirms-global-shutdown-of-hike/articleshow/123870695.cms,"Read Kavin Bharti Mittal’s complete LinkedIn post here:



After regrouping with our investors and the team, I’ve made the difficult decision to wind down Hike completely.

Our US business, launched just nine months ago, is off to a strong start. But after the

India ban, scaling globally would require a full recap, a reset that is not the best use of capital or time.

The Big Question → We could raise the capital, but the real question is: is it worth it? Is this a climb worth pivoting for? For the first time in 13 years, my answer is no. Not for me, not for my team, and not for our investors. Why?

RMG was never the destination. It was a way to test unit economics and traction in India while working toward a bigger vision. In hindsight, starting in India locked us into the model and regulatory headwinds, turning a temporary path into a more permanent one. The Gaming Nation vision is real, but we may be too early. The world will eventually move toward a Nation-type model in gaming and Web3 - Company 2.0. But crypto regulation is still developing globally, and we don’t want to repeat India, where we hoped for clarity that never came. And most importantly, if doing a full reset, is this where I’d put my own capital and energy today? For the first time, the answer is no. The world has changed in the last decade - and so have I. There are more important problems to solve and bigger opportunities to deploy brilliant talent and capital.

Looking Back & Lessons

The last 13 years have been immense. Hike Messenger reached 40M MAUs and became the 35th most loved consumer brand in India at its peak. With Rush, we built a new kind of Casual PvP gaming platform and scaled it to 10M users and $500M+ in gross revenue ( CEA ) in just 4 years.

Our execution was super, but we could never quite make it stick. There are clear lessons to carry forward, especially on market selection:

Be careful with winner-take-all markets. To win, you need to go global. Don’t build for today’s constraints. Build on the spring/summer of new technologies. Regulatory clarity matters. Risk is fine; uncertainty is not.

More importantly momentum is everything. And build what your heart and mind are deeply excited about. It’s the conviction that carries you through.

This is both a disappointment and a hard outcome. But I choose to look on the bright side: the learnings are invaluable, and my conviction for what’s next is even stronger.

To everyone who has been part of this journey - our users, our team, our investors, and our community - thank you. As a CEO, you’re only as strong as your team, and I want to give a special shout-out to mine - an incredible group of people who gave this everything

.

This chapter ends, but the climb continues.

Looking Forward

I’ve always thrived at building at the forefront of technology. Over the last decade, in the little time I had to explore outside of Hike, I kept returning to the same three frontiers. And now, they feel like the great canvases for decades to come →

AI → For the first time, technology has both intelligence and memory. Imagine products that don’t just serve us functionally but truly know us - systems that adapt, grow, and partner with us. As a UX-first builder, this is the most exciting time to be building software. Breakthroughs in Energy → Human progress has always been bound by energy. The world’s demand for energy is rising faster than ever. Breakthrough approaches, especially in physics are needed to power the future. The last century gave us mastery of fine matters and electricity, the next will move deeper, at the intersection of science and spirituality - into what yogis call divine magnetism and physicists call the quantum world or electromagnetism. From there will come technologies that today feel impossible to imagine. Mastery of the Self → As AI takes on more of our work, a deeper question will rise: what now defines us? When productivity is no longer the measure of worth, humanity will turn inward. Man’s evolution will move from the intellect to intuitive attunement - a deeper connection with ourselves and the divine (which we’ll realise are one and the same). The tools, spaces, and guides that help us explore this inner world will be as transformative as any innovation in the outer one - unlocking the next level of humanity’s potential

If you put these together, a picture emerges: → the cost of intelligence trending to zero → the cost of energy trending to zero → and the cost of willpower falling lower and lower.

Just imagine a future where willpower is infinite, energy is abundant, and intelligence is at our fingertips.

This is the future I will help build — and it’s where I’ll be contributing in the decades to come. This new chapter will look very different from the last one

The Reserve Bank of India RBI ) has imposed a fine of Rs 21 lakh on PhonePe for not complying with the rules of prepaid payment instruments (PPIs). A PPI is a prepaid instrument where bank customers load funds first and spend from that balance instead of directly accessing their bank account. The penalty, which was issued recently, follows a statutory inspection of the Walmart-owned digital payments firm's operations from October 2023 to December 2024.According to the RBI, PhonePe's end-of-day balance in its escrow account on some days was lower than the value of outstanding PPIs and payments owed to merchants. An escrow account is a secure third-party account where PPI companies, such as PhonePe, must hold user funds to ensure safety and proper use in accordance with RBI rules. The company allegedly failed to report the shortfall to the central bank immediately. The RBI claimed that it even issued a notice to PhonePe asking for an explanation for the lapses before imposing the penalty.In a statement (seen by the Economic Times), RBI said:The central bank clarified that its action was due to gaps in regulatory compliance and did not impact the validity of PhonePe’s customer transactions or agreements.The RBI has been increasing its oversight of payment companies, particularly in areas such as escrow account management and reporting requirements.This development comes as PhonePe gears up for an initial public offering (IPO) later this year, with Kotak Mahindra Capital, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley appointed as managers.",The Reserve Bank of India has imposed a fine of Rs 21 lakh on PhonePe for not complying with the rules of prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) A PPI is a prepaid instrument where bank customers load funds first and spend from that balance instead of directly accessing their bank account.

How Nepal’s Gen-Z activists used Discrd to choose interim PM



Nepal social media ban and crisis explained





After violent protests and a political collapse triggered by a social media ban, Nepali citizens used a popular chat app to choose the country’s next interim leader. A report states that over 100,000 people have converged on Discord, a platform primarily known for gaming, to fill the political vacuum. According to a report by The New Yorl Times, after a series of debates and polls within the chat room, the group agreed on a single nominee: Sushila Karki, Nepal's former chief justice.“The Parliament of Nepal right now is Discord,” said Sid Ghimiri, a 23-year-old content creator. The protest is commonly referred as Gen-Z prtest as the a majority of protestors are said to be roughly under the age of 28 years.Discord was launched in May 2015 by co-founders Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy, who had previously created social platforms for gamers. Their vision was to build a chat service that complements gaming as its core purpose was to enable gamers to communicate with friends without having to exit their games.This focused approach helped the platform grow, and by the end of 2016, it had already amassed more than 25 million users. The platform's popularity surged during the pandemic, especially among Gen Z. Users began to create servers centered on a wide variety of topics beyond gaming.This shift led Discord to rebrand itself as a comprehensive communication platform.Discord's servers have grown into large community spaces where users can set up multiple channels for communication. These channels support various formats, including text, audio, and video. The platform also offers features like screen sharing, streaming, and a range of moderation tools.By default, a single Discord server can accommodate up to 500,000 users, though the active user limit at any given time is capped at 250,000.Soon after Nepal’s government social media ban led to violent protests and, eventually, a political collapse, more than 1,00,000 citizens converged on a chat app to select the country’s next interim leader, the report has said.After a series of heated debates and polls, the group has settled around a single name: Sushila Karki, the country's former chief justice. The group’s organisers, members of the civic organisation Hami Nepal, met with army chiefs who requested they propose a nominee for interim leader.","Discord was launched in May 2015 by co-founders Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy, who had previously created social platforms for gamers.

Pop culture and tech significance





In a surprising crossover between Silicon Valley and Hollywood, Elon Musk and Larry Ellison once shared screen time in a major blockbuster. Both tech titans, now at the top of the world’s wealth rankings, appeared in the 2010 Marvel film Iron Man 2 in brief but memorable cameos. Musk’s persona even partly inspired the on-screen character of Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr., while Ellison was humorously introduced as the “Oracle of Oracle.” These appearances, largely unnoticed at the time, offer a rare glimpse into the playful side of two of the most influential figures in technology and finance.Elon Musk appears in a short scene discussing an “electric jet” project with Tony Stark. The cameo is brief, but significant, as screenwriter Mark Fergus noted that Musk’s real-life personality helped shape the Tony Stark character. His presence added a layer of authenticity to the tech-savvy billionaire persona portrayed on screen.Larry Ellison’s appearance, meanwhile, is marked by humor, with the character introduced as the “Oracle of Oracle,” a playful nod to his real-world role as the co-founder of Oracle Corporation.His cameo, though fleeting, highlighted his larger-than-life persona and cemented a quirky pop culture connection alongside Musk.Together, these brief appearances provide a rare cinematic glimpse of two of the tech world’s most powerful leaders sharing the screen, blending their real-life influence with Hollywood storytelling.The joint appearance of Musk and Ellison in Iron Man 2 reflects the intersection of technology and entertainment. Beyond the screen, both men continue to shape global industries—Musk in electric vehicles, space, and AI, and Ellison in cloud computing and enterprise software. Their cameos now gain renewed attention as the two billionaires compete for the title of the world’s richest person, linking their pop culture moment to contemporary financial headlines.As Elon Musk and Larry Ellison battle for the top spot in global wealth rankings, fans and media have revisited their shared Hollywood moment. What was once a fun, almost hidden Easter egg in a Marvel movie has become a symbol of the influence and reach of tech leaders, demonstrating that their impact extends far beyond boardrooms and stock markets. Just a quick cameo, but enough to leave fans with a smile. A rare moment where Silicon Valley briefly met the Marvel Universe.","Elon Musk and Larry Ellison appeared in the 2010 Marvel film Iron Man 2.

Jamie Dimon meets Trump





JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning that the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakness. The warning comes after the Labor Department made a sharp downward revision to its job data. The department recently said that nonfarm payrolls for the year through March 2025 were overestimated by 911,000 jobs — the largest correction in more than two decades. “I think the economy is weakening,” Dimon told CNBC. “Whether it’s on the way to recession or just weakening, I don’t know.”As mentioned before, the latest adjustment comes after job growth nearly stalled in July, with just 73,000 positions added. The revision signals the economy produced far fewer jobs than first believed. Hours after the July report was released, President Donald Trump dismissed the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, fueling further political debate.Jamie Dimon said JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, monitors extensive data across consumers, corporations and global trade. He noted that while most Americans still have jobs and continue to spend, confidence may be slipping.“There’s a lot of different factors in the economy right now,” Dimon said, pointing to weakening consumer sentiment and still-strong corporate profits. “We just have to wait and see.”Dimon added that the Federal Reserve will “probably” cut interest rates at an upcoming meeting, but cautioned the move may not make a significant difference.Last month, Jamie Dimon visited the White House last week, reports The Wall Street Journal. The meeting, twice in the past two months, signals a change in his long-strained relationship with President Donald Trump. Quoting people familiar with the matter, the report said that Dimon and Trump talked about the economy, trade, and financial regulation. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick were also present, the report stated. During the meeting, Dimon also congratulated Trump on his recent trade agreement with Japan. The group also discussed the ongoing issue of affordable housing and how financial regulations introduced after the 2008 crisis have impacted homeownership in the U.S.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning that the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakness.

What former US government tech advisor Sid Ghatak said about the $1 AI deals



“What does $1 really mean? Does that mean access to the open model and that compute will be charged incrementally?”

""So, there are all of those costs in terms of training, and then once you have built the model, does the government have to pay for inference whenever federal workers and contractors use it? Is there another incremental charge?""

“The government has to be really careful and understand what the fully loaded cost is of these solutions beyond the very attractive zero to $1 charge. These AI models are powerful engines, but they require really fantastic data to run cleanly and produce reliable output. The investment in that is something that needs to be understood,”

A former US government tech advisor has warned the Trump administration about the potentially high cost of OpenAI and Anthropic's ""$1-a-year deals."" Sid Ghatak, who served as tech advisor during the Biden administration, said that the US government should consider the hidden costs of implementing artificial intelligence (AI), which he believes could be significant. This comes after OpenAI and Anthropic recently announced they would provide federal workers with a year’s access to their AI models for a token fee of $1 per agency.In an interview with Business Insider, Ghatak cautioned that the government may need to allocate additional funds to train an AI model tailored to its specific requirements. He said,Ghatak added.He also noted that the expenses of using AI go beyond payments to companies like OpenAI and Google, as the government will also need to invest heavily in consolidating its data for AI.Ghatak explained.Ghatak, former GSA director (2020–2024) who helped shape Biden’s 2023 AI executive order and co-authored the government’s AI Maturity Model, later founded Increase Alpha, an AI-driven stock prediction platform.Apart from these deals, OpenAI has also been deepening its government ties.

Soon after Nepal’s government social media ban led to violent protests and, eventually, a political collapse, more than 1,00,000 citizens converged on a chat app to select the country’s next interim leader, a report has said, adding that after a series of heated debates and polls, the group has settled around a single name: Sushila Karki, the country's former chief justice.According to a report by The New York Times, several Nepali citizens turned to Discord—a platform known for its gaming communities—to fill the political void left by the resignation of the prime minister.“The Parliament of Nepal right now is Discord,” said Sid Ghimiri, a 23-year-old content creator, describing the app’s pivotal role in the country’s political decision-making.The report said that the conversations within the Discord channel have become so influential that they are being discussed on national television.The group’s organisers, members of the civic organisation Hami Nepal, met with army chiefs who requested they propose a nominee for interim leader. Following hours of discussion, the Discord group nominated Sushila Karki, the report added.She has met with Nepal's president, Ram Chandra Poudel, and Army chief, Gen. Ashok Raj Sigdel, according to the group’s organisers. A moderator for the channel, Shaswot Lamichhane, noted that the group's goal was not to represent the entire country but to suggest a leader who could oversee new elections.Meanwhile, Karki was sworn in as Nepal’s PM and the swearing-in ceremony took place at the presidential residence in Shital Niwas.The selection of Karki follows a period of violent protest, which was sparked by former Prime Minister Oli's nationwide social media ban. It led to at least 51 deaths and more than 1,300 injuries as police clashed with demonstrators who defied curfews. The ban was widely viewed as an attempt to stifle dissent and control the flow of information.","Sushila Karki, the country's former chief justice, has been named as Nepal's interim PM.

Facebook lawsuit settlement: How much will users get





Payments from Facebook’s $725 million privacy settlement are finally being distributed, with approved claimants set to receive money over the coming weeks. The settlement stems from lawsuits that accused the social media giant of improperly sharing users’ personal data with advertisers and third-party firms, most notably highlighted by the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal. For those unaware, millions of US users who had an active Facebook account between 2007 and 2022 were eligible to file claims in 2023. While Meta, Facebook’s parent company, denied wrongdoing, it agreed to the massive payout to resolve the cases.Millions of Facebook users who submitted valid claims last year are now receiving official confirmation emails from the “Facebook User Privacy Settlement Administrator.” These messages include a claimant ID number and confirm that payments are on the way.As mentioned above, eligible users needed to file a claim in the lawsuit by August 25, 2023 to receive the payment.The administrator said payouts started in September this year and will continue for the next 10 weeks. Claimants will also get an additional email 3–4 days before their payment is sent.The official settlement site says that people approved for a settlement payment will get an email about 3–4 days before the money is sent.While Facebook agreed to pay $725 million to settle the privacy lawsuit, users who filed claims will receive only a small share of that amount. Court filings show the average payment is $29.43, with the maximum reaching $38.36 for people who were active on Facebook for the full 15-year period covered. The final payout depends on how long each user maintained an active account during that window.The payout will be divided using “allocation points,” based on how many months a person used Facebook during the eligibility period from May 2007 to December 2022.",Payments from Facebook’s $725 million privacy settlement are finally being distributed. approved claimants are set to receive money over the coming weeks.

Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama announced the appointment this week, promising the AI minister will make Albania ""a country where public tenders are 100% free of corruption.Diella, meaning ""sun"" in Albanian, will manage all government contract decisions previously handled by human officials, ensuring complete transparency in public spending. The AI minister represents a radical shift from traditional governance, with Rama describing her as ""the first cabinet member who isn't physically present, but is virtually created by AI.""Diella originally launched in January as an AI-powered virtual assistant on Albania's e-Albania platform, helping citizens obtain government documents and services. Dressed in traditional Albanian attire, she has already processed 36,600 digital documents and provided nearly 1,000 services to users through voice commands and electronic stamps.The AI minister will now assume responsibility for evaluating and awarding all public tenders, with decisions transferred from human government officials in a ""step-by-step"" process.This represents a major shift in how governments worldwide might leverage artificial intelligence for governance.Public procurement has long been plagued by corruption scandals in Albania, a Balkan nation experts describe as a hub for international money laundering from drug and weapons trafficking. Graft has reportedly reached the highest levels of government, complicating the country's European Union accession goals.Rama aims to lead Albania into the EU by 2030, making anti-corruption efforts crucial for membership eligibility. However, the government provided no details about human oversight mechanisms or safeguards against potential AI manipulation. Public reaction remains mixed, with skeptical Facebook users commenting ""Even Diella will be corrupted in Albania"" and ""Stealing will continue and Diella will be blamed. ""The parliament is expected to vote on Rama's fourth-term cabinet, including the AI minister, when it convenes Friday. Rama won his fourth consecutive term in May elections and has previously advocated for AI as an anti-corruption tool that eliminates bribes, threats, and conflicts of interest in government decision-making.","Albania has appointed an artificial intelligence-powered digital assistant as its minister.

"Tesla engineer resigns after 8 years; points to CEO Elon Musk as main reason, accuses him of ‘lying to the public, manipulating…’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-engineer-resigns-after-8-years-points-to-ceo-elon-musk-as-main-reason-accuses-him-of-lying-to-the-public-manipulating/articleshow/123852792.cms,"Full post of former Tesla employee blaming Elon Musk for resignation

Personal update: after 8 years at breakneck speed, I’ve made the very difficult decision to move on from Tesla.

I want to thank everyone I’ve worked with over the years at Tesla. People - this crazy lot of bright, humble, ambitious, hard-working people - are what makes Tesla special. I am thankful beyond words to the many colleagues and leaders I’ve worked with and learned from over the years.

Being the first Autobidder employee in Europe and helping scale the team and fleet across markets has been an unbelievable journey.

Since 2020, the Autobidder operational fleet in Europe went from 14 MWh (Holes Bay) to around 1.3 GWh (that’s ~100x), with more markets coming online (very) soon. Having helped bring on board many brilliant people over the past few years, I’m very excited about what’s next for Autobidder, in Europe and beyond.

Beyond Autobidder, joining Tesla Energy early on and contributing to its growth has been an immense privilege.

Along the journey, I got a chance to work on anything from microgrids on remote islands to VPPs across three continents.

It’s humbling to think how much the energy industry has evolved over these years. Storage went from being an afterthought to a key enabler of the transition to sustainable energy. When I joined in 2017, Tesla Energy deployed ~350 MWh of storage. Last year, in 2024, the figure was 31.4 GWh. That’s another 100x, and the growth is far from stopping.

It’s not just about volume though: storage is increasingly providing inverter-driven grid services that are key to operating low-carbon grids (grid-forming mode etc).

In addition to that, data and algorithms have taken center stage in the energy transition, which is a very exciting development for an energy/math/software wonk like me.

All this being said, I do need to address the elephant in the room: the main reason I’m leaving is that I think Elon has dealt huge damage to Tesla’s mission (and to the health of democratic institutions in several countries).

Beyond that, Elon’s leadership and decision making seem seriously compromised. Given his huge (and growing, inexplicably) stake in Tesla, I can’t convince myself anymore that this is the right place to be.

This is not just about politics: it’s about lying to the public, manipulating public discourse, targeting minorities and supporting climate change deniers and political forces aligned with the oil and gas industry.

I think it’s fairly indisputable that the current US administration is slowing down the energy transition. Unfortunately, speed is critical if we are to avert the worst consequences of climate change.

I wish the best to everyone who will stick around and keep working to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, and I hope the best for Tesla and Tesla Energy.

As for myself, I’m taking some time off before embarking on a new adventure. Stay tuned for more updates.

Cheers,

Gio

Chromecast 2nd Gen outage: Users not able to cast content from their smartphones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chromecast-2nd-gen-outage-users-not-able-to-cast-content-from-their-smartphones/articleshow/118827942.cms,"Chromecast 2nd Gen outage: Issues faced by users

Chromecast 2nd Gen outage: The error message

Users of Google's second-generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio devices are experiencing significant issues due to an authentication error, preventing them from casting content from their smartphones or tablets. As reported by 9to5Google, users from around the globe are experiencing issues with the devices.The issue first gained traction on the r/googlehome subreddit, where multiple users shared their experiences of being unable to connect to their Chromecast (2nd Gen). Users have attempted common troubleshooting methods, such as restarting, factory resetting, reinstalling the Google Home app, clearing cache/data, and even trying different networks, but none of these steps appear to resolve the issue.Some users have encountered an error message that reads: “Untrusted device: [name] couldn’t be verified. This could be caused by outdated device firmware.” This message effectively locks users out of casting capabilities, as it only provides an option to close the dialog box.Interestingly, the problem seems to only affect older Chromecast models, specifically the 2nd generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio. Newer models, like the Chromecast (3rd gen) and Chromecast Ultra, are reportedly functioning without any issues.Many users are concerned that Google may have quietly discontinued support for these older Chromecast models, effectively rendering them unusable overnight. Given Google's history of sunsetting products without much warning, this concern isn’t entirely unwarranted. However, the nature of the error message suggests that this might be more of a software bug than an intentional shutdown.As users await further information, the uncertainty looms over whether a fix will be implemented soon.","Users of Google's second-generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio devices are experiencing significant issues due to an authentication error.

"Netflix faces backlash as ‘The Recruit’ axed, angry fans blame ‘The Night Agent’ for its demise",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-faces-backlash-as-the-recruit-axed-angry-fans-blame-the-night-agent-for-its-demise/articleshow/118824277.cms,"Fans outrages over ‘unfair’ Netflix cancellation, point fingers at ‘The Night Agent’

“They released this and The Night Agent within the same month. What did they expect?”

“I kept confusing this show for The Night Agent anytime I saw news about it, so maybe it was destined to be axed.”

Comparisons to ‘The Night Agent’ and scheduling issues

Show creator’s response and future possibilities

""We'd all be there in a heartbeat,” Hawley wrote. “If not, man, we left it all on the field. For those who haven't yet watched, dive in. I swear to God you'll enjoy the ride. In an age of shows that feel like homework, The Recruit is a blast that has stakes, humor, and hardcore action which will keep you leaning forward.”

Netflix’s response and the ongoing debate

Netflix subscribers were left disappointed after the unexpected cancellation of the spy drama The Recruit. The show, which followed the life of a young CIA lawyer entangled in international conflicts, had gained a dedicated fan base since its premiere in December 2022. However, its fate was sealed after its second season aired in January 2025. The news came as a shock to many, especially considering the positive reception of the latest season. Fans have taken to social media to express frustration, blaming the decision on poor scheduling and comparisons with another Netflix spy thriller, The Night Agent. Amid growing outcry, creator Alexi Hawley has expressed hope for a potential film to conclude the series properly.On March 5, 2025, actor Colton Dunn, who played Lester Kitchens in The Recruit, took to Instagram to break the news of the show's cancellation. Calling it “such a bummer,” Dunn thanked fans for their support and shared fond memories from the set. His announcement sparked an immediate backlash from viewers, who questioned Netflix’s decision.Many fans pointed out that The Recruit had been released too closely to The Night Agent, another espionage drama that had already gained significant popularity. Social media platforms were flooded with complaints, with users accusing Netflix of sabotaging The Recruit by scheduling it within weeks of The Night Agent's second season premiere.One frustrated viewer wrote on X (formerly Twitter),Another echoed similar sentiments, saying,While both The Recruit and The Night Agent belong to the same genre, The Night Agent had already established itself as a fan favorite with strong viewership numbers. Netflix renewed The Night Agent for a second season following its success, but The Recruit struggled to achieve the same traction.Industry analysts speculate that Netflix’s decision to release both spy thrillers within a short timeframe may have led to audience confusion. With The Night Agent already commanding attention, The Recruit struggled to carve out its own identity.Unlike The Night Agent, which continued to perform well, The Recruit reportedly underperformed in terms of viewership, making it a likely target for cancellation. However, fans argue that given more time, the show could have developed a stronger following.Following the backlash, The Recruit creator Alexi Hawley addressed fans in what he called a “love letter” to the series. He acknowledged the disappointment surrounding the cancellation but hinted at the possibility of a film to properly conclude the story.Despite the cancellation, Hawley’s comments have given fans a glimmer of hope for a potential follow-up, though no official plans have been announced.As of now, Netflix has not provided an official statement regarding the cancellation of The Recruit. However, the streaming giant’s content strategy has come under scrutiny, with users frequently complaining about the abrupt termination of shows without a proper conclusion.The debate over Netflix’s handling of its original series continues to grow, as fans argue that promising shows are often cut short due to business decisions rather than creative merit. Meanwhile, The Night Agent remains a dominant force in the spy-thriller genre, further fueling frustrations over the fate of The Recruit.","The Recruit was canceled by Netflix after its second season aired in January 2025.

"How Jim Walker, the man who saw 2008 Stock Market crash coming, may have just 'agreed' with Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath's 'Stock Market Gyaan'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-jim-walker-the-man-who-saw-the-2008-stock-market-crash-coming-may-have-just-agreed-with-zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamaths-stock-market-gyaan/articleshow/118727832.cms,"Jim Walker to investors: Take long-term investment approach

Jim Walker picks India over China

Indian stock markets witnessed Bears onslaught in the month of February, with the benchmark Sensex closing over 4,000 points lower. The carnage witnessed in the market during the month led to a staggering erosion of over Rs 40 lakh crore from the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies; while Nifty 50 marked its longest losing streak since its inception in the year 1996. The relentless downward trend has left retail investors anxious. In a message to investors late earlier this week, Zerodha founder and CEO Nithin Kamath termed the fall as ""the first real market correction "" since Covid pandemic.""Markets are cyclical, and given the way our markets went up from late 2020, this fall was inevitable,"" he said. Kamath told investors to not get carried away by the doom and gloom in the market and continue investing in SIPs. ""I don't know how good the data is, but it seems like the number of investors stopping their SIPs has gone up. This is the wrong thing to do. What an SIP helps you do is to average your investments across different market cycles,"" he said.A similar sentiment comes from Jim Walker, a celebrated economist from Alethia Capital who famously foresaw the 2008 financial crisis. In an exclusive interaction with ETNow, Walker gave perspective on the current state of the global economy and what he thinks about India. Contrary to widespread concerns that today’s market exuberance might precipitate a collapse akin to that of 2008, Walker holds a different view.Speaking with ETNow, he acknowledged a global economic slowdown but stressed that the circumstances differ markedly from those preceding the financial debacle over ten years ago. Similar to Nithin Kamath, Walker batted for a long-term investment approach. Walker encouraged his clients to boost their stakes in India, despite valuation concerns in its stock market. “I’ve advised clients this week to significantly increase their investments in India. Though stock valuations raise eyebrows, I believe economic growth will soon justify them with strong corporate earnings,” he elaborated.Known for his prescient 2006-07 warning of a looming U.S. housing market crash, Walker remarked that today’s danger signals are less evident. “The signs were glaring in 2006-07 when we predicted a severe downturn driven by excesses in the property sector; it’s not the same now,” he said.He pointed out that unlike the lead-up to 2008, there are currently no significant overindulgences in the housing or financial sectors poised to spark a major banking crisis. Although certain areas show excessive stock market gains and asset price inflation, Walker believes these won’t lead to widespread corporate failures that could rattle the banking system. “We’re not seeing the kind of corporate collapses that impacted banks in 2008. That’s not on the horizon,” he observed.Additionally, Walker expressed a stronger preference for investing in India over China, suggesting it might be an opportune moment to increase investments there. He is especially sanguine about India’s prospects, citing its robust policy environment—the best in three decades—as a key factor enhancing its appeal to investors. “India’s policy stability and certainty are at their peak in the last 30 years,” he asserted, crediting solid monetary and fiscal policies along with exchange rate stability for bolstering India’s economic structure.He also praised the Indian government’s efforts in deregulation and improving business conditions, which he views as catalysts for future growth. By supporting small and medium enterprises, Walker believes India will spur further economic and job growth.",Jim Walker picks India over China as a good place to invest in the stock market.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat. In the post, Altman wrote “very proud of the openai team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades…thought that was the thing i'd always be most proud of in life”. Adding further, he wrote “turns out i am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own!”.In a follow-up post, Altman wrote “i realize i am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best)”.Sam Altman welcomed his baby boy last month with his partner and software engineer Oliver Mulherin. The baby arrived prematurely and has been receiving care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).In another news, the CEO shared an update about the company’s latest version of the large language model (LLM), GPT-4.5 . In an X post, Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience.Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it.In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit. We think people are gonna use this a lot and love it.”","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat.

Come April 1 of Fiscal Year 2026-27, a new rule in the Income Tax Act law may grant the Income Tax department powers to access your social media accounts or emails in case they suspect tax evasion . Income Tax Bill 2025, which was introduced in the Parliament recently, will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces, termed Virtual Digital Spaces in the bill. This means that the Income Tax department can break into social media accounts, personal emails, bank accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, and more if they have any reason to believe that you own any undisclosed income, money, Gold, Jewelry, or valuable item or property on which you haven’t paid applicable Income Tax.Presently, Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, allows Income Tax officials to seize assets and books during search operations if they find sufficient reasons to believe that an individual is in possession of undisclosed income or assets. The changes in the bill, once passed in the Parliament, will extend this authourity to the digital realm, allowing officials to bypass security measures on computer systems and virtual spaces.The Clause 247 of the Income Tax Bill outlines this expanded power, stating that officers can “break open the lock of any door, box, locker, safe, almirah, or other receptacle” or “gain access by overriding the access code” to computer systems or virtual digital spaces when access is otherwise unavailable. This applies if they believe an individual possesses undisclosed income or assets taxable under the law.According to the bill, the term Virtual Digital Space includes email servers, social media accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, banking accounts, and any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset. It further adds that virtual digital space is an environment, area or realm that is constructed and experienced through computer technology and not the physical, tangible world, which encompasses any digital realm that allows users to interact, communicate and perform activities using computer systems, computer networks, computer resources, communication devices, cyberspace, internet, worldwide web and emerging technologies, using data and information in the electronic form for creation, storage or exchange and includes:* Email servers* Social media account* Online investment account, trading account, banking account, etc* Any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset* Remote server or cloud servers* Digital application platforms* Any other space of similar natureAs to who all can wield this authority? The bill designates “authorised officers” as senior tax officials, including Joint Directors, Additional Directors, Joint Commissioners, Additional Commissioners, Assistant or Deputy Directors, Assistant or Deputy Commissioners, Income Tax Officers, and Tax Recovery Officers.What does this mean for individuals? The new rules significantly widen the scope of tax investigations, giving officials the ability to probe deeply into personal and financial digital footprints. As this provision takes effect, it raises questions about privacy and the balance between tax enforcement and individual rights.","Income Tax Bill 2025 will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces.

An investigation has found 5 ActBlue-funded groups responsible for Tesla “protests”: Troublemakers, Disruption Project, Rise & Resist, Indivisible Project and Democratic Socialists of America.

ActBlue funders include George Soros, Reid Hoffman, Herbert Sandler, Patricia Bauman, and Leah Hunt-Hendrix.

ActBlue is currently under investigation for allowing foreign and illegal donations in criminal violation of campaign finance regulations. This week, 7 ActBlue senior officials resigned, including the associate general counsel.

If you know anything about this, please post in replies. Thanks, Elon.

Why protests against Tesla

Elon Musk has accused billionaires George Soros and Reid Hoffman of funding recent protests at Tesla showrooms. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Musk stated, “An investigation has found 5 ActBlue-funded groups responsible for Tesla “protests”: Troublemakers, Disruption Project, Rise & Resist, Indivisible Project and Democratic Socialists of America.” He further named the funders of the groups that included George Soros, Reid Hoffman, Herbert Sandler, Patricia Bauman, and Leah Hunt-Hendrix.This is not the first time Musk has singled out Soros, who is often the subject of unfounded conspiracy theories, or Hoffman, a LinkedIn co-founder and Democratic donor.Musk’s post follows a comment he made just a day earlier, where he said, “Something stinks about ActBlue,” in response to a post on X about seven senior ActBlue officials resigning at the end of February. However, Musk did not provide evidence to support his claims, leading to widespread criticism and skepticism online.Musk wrote:Tesla has become a focal point for protesters who are upset with Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency 's (DOGE) push to cut federal government jobs. On Saturday, several protesters were arrested outside a Tesla dealership in New York City, with some chanting, “We need clean air, not another billionaire,” according to the New York Post.Earlier in the week, around 350 demonstrators gathered outside a Tesla dealership in Portland, Oregon, chanting, “Elon Musk has got to go.” Last week, protests erupted at more than 50 Tesla stores across the US, with some demonstrations extending internationally to cities like Barcelona, London, and Lisbon.Many of these protests appear to be coordinated through the Tesla Takedown website , which encourages participants to “sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines.” The site lists the Troublemakers and Disruption Project organizations as sponsors—two groups mentioned in Musk’s recent post.","Elon Musk has accused billionaires George Soros and Reid Hoffman of funding recent protests at Tesla showrooms.

Errol Musk sparks controversy over China’s interest in Elliot Rush



Who is Elliot Rush?

Errol Musk , father of Elon Musk , recently made headlines with sensational claims about his 7-year-old grandson, Elliot Rush . In an interview, Errol stated that China is attempting to recruit Elliot for an e-gaming tournament, a surprising assertion that has captured widespread attention. The claim not only raises questions about the potential influence of international politics on family matters but also highlights the growing prominence of competitive gaming on a global scale. Errol’s words have sparked curiosity and debate, adding a complex layer to the Musk family’s already highly publicised life.Errol Musk talked about China's reported interest in his grandson, Elliot Rush. He said that China believes Rush to be a likely gaming champion and wants to take him on for a tournament. Errol made a point of mentioning that Chinese officials have informed him that his grandson will be ""the biggest thing in China"" and that he is a ""prolific gamer"" and ""a champion."" That is why, in Errol's words, a Chinese businessman had even come to his South African ranch to consider the prospect.Remarkably, Errol was not quite as bothered as one might have expected about the political consequences of China's interest in his grandson, particularly given the tension in the relations between the United States and China. China is globally recognized as America's most influential adversary in international politics, making the issue likely to be even more complex. Nonetheless, the informal attitude and apparent non-concern regarding the issue of the subject during the interview were outstanding.Errol Musk's words have caused eyebrows to be raised both because of their surprising nature as well as the sensitive geopolitical matters they bring to light. The notion of China hiring a young child to play in a gaming tournament, particularly one that is related to the Musk family, brings an interesting convergence of personal family life, international politics, and the increasing visibility of competitive gaming. The controversy over Errol Musk's personal life and his comments about Elon's supposed child with Ashley St Clair also adds to the complexity of the issue.Elliot Rush is Elon Musk's 7-year-old half-brother and one of the youngest children of Errol Musk. He is the son of Errol and Jana Bezuidenhout, who was previously Errol's stepdaughter but is now his girlfriend. Jana, 38, is Heide Bezuidenhout's daughter, and Heide was Errol's second wife. The unconventional circumstances of their relationship, with Errol having adopted Jana at four years old before they had a child together when they were both 30 years old, has brought a lot of attention and raised eyebrows. The complicated family setup has drawn Elliot into the public eye and the media limelight.","Errol Musk made sensational claims about his 7-year-old grandson, Elliot Rush.

United States to Google: Sell Google Chrome to …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/united-states-to-google-sell-google-chrome-to-/articleshow/118813404.cms,"No matter what occurs — Google always wins



DOJ makes changes to its earlier proposals to Google

The Justice Department doubled down Friday on its demand that Google sell off its Chrome web browser , signaling that the Trump administration is continuing the Biden administration 's aggressive approach to reining in technology giants.In a court filing, the department reiterated its request that Judge Amit P. Mehta force Google to divest Chrome and end practices that allowed the search giant to maintain what the court ruled last year was an illegal monopoly in online search.The proposal says that Google must ""promptly and fully divest Chrome, along with any assets or services necessary to successfully complete the divestiture, to a buyer approved by the Plaintiffs in their sole discretion, subject to terms that the Court and Plaintiffs approve.""""Google's illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that — no matter what occurs — Google always wins,"" the government said in Friday's filing. ""The American people thus are forced to accept the unbridled demands and shifting, ideological preferences of an economic leviathan in return for a search engine the public may enjoy.""The proposal follows Judge Mehta's landmark August 2024 ruling that Google illegally maintained its search monopoly by paying web browsers and smartphone manufacturers to feature its search engine. During the 2023 trial, evidence showed Google paid $26.3 billion for these arrangements in 2021 alone.""Through its sheer size and unrestricted power, Google has robbed consumers and businesses of a fundamental promise owed to the public—their right to choose among competing services,"" the DOJ statement accompanying the filing claims.Judge Mehta found that about 70 percent of US search queries happen through portals where Google is the default search engine, with Google's revenue-sharing agreements making it impossible for smaller search rivals to compete.The Justice Department wants Google to stop entering into paid agreements with Apple, Mozilla, and smartphone makers to be the default search engine. It's also asking the court to force Google to allow rival search engines to display Google's results and access its data for a decade.In a revision from earlier proposals, the government no longer demands Google divest its artificial intelligence products, instead requiring the company to notify federal and state officials before proceeding with AI investments.Google, which plans to appeal Judge Mehta's ruling, filed its own proposal Friday that maintained its position that minimal changes are needed. The company suggests allowing continued payments for prime placement but with less restrictive agreements that permit other search engines to compete for placement on phones and browsers.""The government's proposals would harm America's consumers, economy and national security,"" Google spokesman Peter Schottenfels said in a statement.Google's chief legal officer, Kent Walker , previously called the government's proposal a ""radical interventionist agenda"" that would ""endanger the security and privacy of millions of Americans"" and stifle innovation.Judge Mehta is scheduled to hear arguments on the competing proposals in April, though Google has already indicated it will appeal whatever remedy is ordered, likely beginning a years-long legal process.","Google must ""promptly and fully divest Chrome,"" the Justice Department says.

A senior advisor at NASA who is part of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative maintained a publicly accessible Google Calendar that revealed his connections to the programme and scheduled job interviews at companies including Tesla, Palantir and Anduril, a report has said.According to a report by Business Insider, 26-year-old Riley Sennott appears in an internal NASA directory as a “senior advisor” in the administrator's suite at headquarters and is also involved with DOGE.Apparently, unlike many DOGE workers who have deleted their LinkedIn profiles and made social media accounts private in recent months, Sennott failed to secure his Google Calendar, which was linked to his personal email address. Anyone with the address could view his appointments dating back to 2016, the report added.The publication claimed that the calendar contained entries, including a January 6 meeting titled ""Riley Sennott and DOGE Recruiting,"" which came from a Gmail address apparently used by DOGE for recruitment purposes, essentially providing rare insight into the group's hiring process, which has remained largely secretive despite advertising open positions.Another significant calendar entry from January 17 showed Sennott was scheduled to attend a ""SGE ethics discussion."" SGE reportedly stands for ""special government employee,"" a designation reportedly used for Elon Musk.Sennott's calendar suggests potential connections to Tesla, with several scheduled meetings with Tesla employees and references to “a rotating project-based role.” His private X account bio describes him as “energy @tesla.”The calendar also documented Sennott's apparent job search activities, including interviews with major tech firms throughout 2024.These included a scheduled Zoom call about a “venture role” with Founders Fund (an early SpaceX investor), a “recruiter call” with Peter Thiel's Palantir, an “Opportunity Chat” with defense technology company Anduril, and recent meetings with partners at venture capital firm Thrive Capital.","Riley Sennott, 26, appears in an internal NASA directory as a ‘senior advisor’ in the administrator's suite at headquarters.

Elon Musk's Grok: India is a strong favorite

As of today, March 9, 2025, the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 final is set to take place later today in Dubai between India and New Zealand. Predicting the winner involves looking at current form, key players, and tournament progress so far, but no definitive outcome can be stated until the match concludes.

India has been a dominant force in the tournament, reaching the final after defeating Australia in the first semi-final on March 4 in Dubai. Their batting lineup, featuring stars like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, has been in top form, while their bowling attack, led by Mohammed Shami and supported by spinners like Kuldeep Yadav, has been highly effective. India’s consistent performance in ICC events and their unbeaten streak in Dubai during this tournament make them strong favorites according to many experts and betting odds prior to the knockout stages.

New Zealand, on the other hand, secured their spot in the final with a clinical victory over South Africa in the second semi-final on March 5 in Lahore. Known for their tactical approach and resilience, the Kiwis have relied on players like Kane Williamson and Matt Henry, the latter leading the wicket charts with 10 scalps. Their ability to perform under pressure in knockout matches adds to their credibility as contenders, though they face a formidable challenge against India’s depth.

Given the information available:

India’s form, depth, and historical success in the Champions Trophy (winners in 2013 and joint winners in 2002) tilt predictions in their favor.

New Zealand’s consistency in reaching ICC finals and their balanced squad make them a serious threat, but they are often seen as underdogs against powerhouses like India.

While I can’t predict the future with certainty, based on current tournament dynamics and expert sentiment, India appears to have the edge heading into the final. However, cricket is unpredictable, and New Zealand’s knack for upsets could turn the tide. The result will be clear by the end of March 9, 2025—check back after the match for the confirmed winner!

Google Cloud services completely restored: Here’s what the company said

Google has announced the full restoration of its cloud services and associated platforms following a significant global outage that impacted numerous Google products and third-party applications late night on June 12. The disruption, which stemmed from an issue within Google Cloud, caused widespread accessibility problems for tens of thousands of users worldwide. Google Cloud acknowledged the problem on its status page, stating that multiple products were experiencing varying levels of service disruption. ""Our engineers are continuing to mitigate the issue, and we have confirmation that the issue is recovered in some locations,"" Google Cloud said, though it could not provide a timeline for full resolution.The outage began early Thursday (June 12), leading to elevated error rates and complete unavailability for services such as Google Search, Google Meet, Google Lens, and various Google Workspace applications including Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar. Beyond Google's own ecosystem, popular third-party platforms like Spotify and Discord, which rely on Google Cloud infrastructure, also reported extensive downtime.Google Cloud engineers identified the root cause of the disruption, which was attributed to an identity and access management (IAM) failure within Google Cloud's systems. This misconfiguration triggered a cascade of issues across critical cloud components.Google confirmed that it had applied appropriate mitigations and was seeing signs of widespread recovery. ""Our engineers have identified the root cause and have applied appropriate mitigations,"" Google Cloud stated on its status page.“All the services are fully recovered from the service issue. We will publish analysis of this incident once we have completed our internal investigation. We thank you for your patience while we worked on resolving the issue,” added the company.","Google has announced the full restoration of its cloud services and associated platforms following a significant global outage.

The expansion comes as President Donald Trump pressures companies to increase domestic production and threatens new tariffs on semiconductors, while also signaling plans to renegotiate or potentially dismantle the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act.The new investment will fund a second advanced memory fabrication facility in Boise, Idaho, and the expansion of Micron’s manufacturing plant in Manassas, Virginia. The company aims to meet rising demand for its DRAM chips , critical for personal computing, automotive, industrial applications, wireless communications, and artificial intelligence. Micron’s High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips are particularly vital for next-generation AI models, a point emphasized by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who called the investment “an important step forward for the AI ecosystem.”Micron’s announcement builds on its earlier commitments of $100 billion for a New York manufacturing hub and $25 billion for Idaho facilities. In December, the U.S. Commerce Department, under former President Joe Biden, awarded Micron nearly $6.2 billion in subsidies—one of the largest grants under the $52.7 billion CHIPS Act—to support semiconductor production in these states. Additionally, Micron finalized a $275 million direct funding award to expand its Manassas facility.However, the future of such subsidies remains uncertain. President Trump has repeatedly criticized the CHIPS Act and threatened to repeal it. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed last week that the administration is reviewing grants awarded to semiconductor firms, including Micron, as part of efforts to renegotiate terms.Micron also plans to allocate $50 billion to research and development, focusing on advanced memory manufacturing and HBM capabilities. The company aims to produce 40% of its DRAM in the U.S., aligning with growing market demand and strengthening its position in the global semiconductor market.The announcement follows Nvidia’s April pledge to invest up to $500 billion in U.S.-based AI server production over the next four years, in collaboration with partners like Taiwan’s TSMC. As a key Nvidia customer, Micron’s expanded U.S. operations are poised to support the booming AI sector, despite uncertainties surrounding federal support and trade policies.Micron’s investments signal a robust commitment to bolstering U.S. semiconductor manufacturing , even as the industry navigates political and economic challenges.","Micron Technology announced Thursday an additional $30 billion investment in U.S. operations.

Mitsubishi is recalling nearly 2 lakh SUVs in US over software issues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mitsubishi-is-recalling-nearly-2-lakh-suvs-in-us-over-software-issues/articleshow/121810430.cms,"List of Mitsubishi SUV models recalled for software issues and other details



Mitsubishi has recalled nearly 200,000 SUVs in the US due to a software issue that causes the rearview camera to freeze, which could increase the risk of a crash. The Japanese car maker announced this recall on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website. Mitsubishi reported the recall earlier this month as the company stated that this is an expansion of a similar recall issued in May 2023, identified as recall no. 23V345. The issue specifically involves the rearview camera freezing during operation. Here are all the details about the SUV models that have been recalled and how Mitsubishi is working to fix the issueThe affected models include 2022–2024 Outlander and 2023–2025 Outlander PHEV SUVs, bringing the total impacted vehicles to an estimated 198,940.The problem originates from improperly programmed software that can trigger a black screen when the driver shifts into reverse within 40 seconds of startup or remains in reverse for more than six seconds.These same symptoms prompted a smaller recall in May 2023 covering some 2022–2023 Outlander and Outlander PHEV models, but reports of camera freezes and screen reboots persisted through early 2024.Dealers first flagged audio-control issues in mid-2023, followed by recurrent software lockups and display blackouts.After investigating customer complaints—six field reports and 358 warranty claims—Mitsubishi concluded on May 23, 2025, that a new recall was necessary.Owners whose vehicles were previously repaired under recall 23V345 will require this updated software as well. Going forward, all Outlanders built after April 22, 2025, will ship with the corrected software.Mitsubishi will notify dealers starting June 16 and mail owner notification letters on June 30. Dealers will perform the software update free of charge.Owners who incur reasonable expenses due to the recall will receive instructions in their notification letter for reimbursement through Mitsubishi’s Customer Relations Department.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration lists this action as recall number 25V369000; Mitsubishi’s internal reference is SR-25-001.https://youtu.be/zQHfPjzFgEA","Mitsubishi has recalled nearly 200,000 SUVs in the US due to a software issue.

The most recent public reference to it is by Errol Musk, who explained his son Elon Musk's feud with Donald Trump as stemming fromAlthough those claims tend to fuel controversy, they also point to the larger, more serious discourse surrounding mental health, particularly in high-pressure settings such as politics, governance, or technology entrepreneurship.PTSD is a stress disorder that can happen to anyone who has witnessed or experienced a traumatic experience. From victims of natural disasters and violent offenses to those subjected to chronic emotional stress, PTSD can drastically interfere with daily life and quality of life if not treated. Here's a comprehensive overview of PTSD, its symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and contemporary treatment methods.PTSD stands forr, a mental health condition that may occur following exposure to or witnessing a traumatic event.It is accepted within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and may occur in individuals of all ages, including children.PTSD is different from the temporary emotional distress that most individuals experience following trauma. Although many recover on their own, those with PTSD remain affected by long-lasting symptoms that can last for months or even years and disrupt their normal functioning.PTSD may result from a variety of traumatic events. While some individuals develop the disorder following a one-time event, others become affected after repeated exposure to stressful situations. They are commonly triggered by:It is worth noting that not everyone who is exposed to trauma will develop PTSD. Genetics, brain chemistry, coping methods, and support systems can all play a role in a person's risk.PTSD symptoms typically start within three months of the traumatic event but at other times may emerge later. To be considered for PTSD diagnosis, the symptoms should persist for more than a month and lead to major distress or impairments in social or occupational functioning.PTSD symptoms are typically classified into four clusters:Although PTSD may occur in anyone, some individuals are at higher risk:Studies also indicate that women are more likely than men to experience PTSD, perhaps because of higher incidence rates of interpersonal violence.PTSD is usually diagnosed by a mental health professional, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker, based on criteria from the DSM-5. The diagnostic process involves:At other times, symptom quantification is achieved through the use of standardized measurement tools such as the PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5).Contemporary treatment of PTSD aims to enable people to manage symptoms, re-establish trust, and take back control of their lives. They comprise:Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the most effective type of psychotherapy for PTSD. It involves:There is no surefire method to prevent PTSD, but early treatment can drastically lower risk and severity:","Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been brought into the limelight again in recent times because of its increasingly diagnosable occurrence.

What the European Commission argue

Xiaomi QLED TV FX Pro 55-inch Review: Affordable Cinematic Experience at Home

Meta and TikTok have taken the European Union to court over a fee which they claim is unfair and based on flawed calculations. Speaking before Europe’s second-highest court on Wednesday, the two tech giants argued that the EU’s supervisory levy under the Digital Services Act (DSA) is both disproportionate and lacking in transparency. The law, which came into effect in 2022, requires 19 large online platforms to pay a fee—up to 0.05% of their annual global net income—to help fund the European Commission's work overseeing their compliance with digital rules.Stating that the company is not trying to avoid paying the fees, Meta’s lawyer questioned the Commission’s method for calculating the fee. In a General Court in Luxembourg, he said it was wrongly based on the overall group’s revenue, not the revenue of the EU-based subsidiary, and that the company still doesn’t know exactly how the final amount was reached.TikTok’s lawyer echoed similar concerns, calling the fee “unfair and disproportionate.” He said the method used inflated TikTok’s payment and even required the company to help cover the cost for other platforms. He also accused the EU of counting the same user more than once if they switch between devices, which he said led to double-counting.Both companies argued that the Commission went beyond its legal powers by using group-level profits to calculate the cap for the fee.In response, the European Commission’s lawyer defended the system, saying that when a company files consolidated financial reports, it’s reasonable to use group-level financial data. She also said that companies had access to enough information to understand how the fee was determined and that there was no violation of their rights.","The two tech giants argued that the EU’s supervisory levy under the Digital Services Act (DSA) is both disproportionate and lacking in transparency.

8 simple tips to help you improve efficiency of your car’s AC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/8-simple-tips-to-help-you-improve-efficiency-of-your-cars-ac/articleshow/121792931.cms,"8 simple tips to improve your car’s AC

Park in the shade

Vent hot air before starting AC

Use the Recirculation Mode

Don't keep it on max fan speed constantly

Get regular AC servicing

Clean or replace air filters

Use a sunshade

Turn off AC before turning off engine

As temperatures soar, a well-functioning car air conditioner becomes less of a luxury and more of a necessity. However, many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling. A few simple practices can significantly improve its efficiency, save fuel, and extend the life of your cooling system. By incorporating these simple habits, you can ensure your car's AC runs more efficiently, keeping you comfortable while potentially saving on fuel costs and maintenance. Here are eight simple tips to help you stay cool on the road.This might seem obvious, but parking under a tree or in a covered area can make a huge difference. A car parked in direct sunlight can reach internal temperatures far exceeding the outside air, forcing your AC to work much harder to cool it down.Before turning on your AC, roll down your windows for a minute or two, especially if your car has been sitting in the sun. This allows trapped hot air to escape, reducing the initial load on your air conditioning system.Once your car is cool, switch your AC to recirculation mode. This feature re-circulates the air already inside the cabin, rather than constantly trying to cool hot outside air. This is much more efficient and helps maintain a comfortable temperature.While it's tempting to use the highest fan setting, keeping it on maximum continuously isn't always the most efficient. Once the cabin is cool, reduce the fan speed to maintain comfort, which puts less strain on the system.Just like your car's engine, your AC system needs regular maintenance. Getting it serviced annually ensures that refrigerant levels are optimal, components are clean, and there are no leaks. A well-maintained system runs more efficiently.A clogged cabin air filter can restrict airflow and make your AC work harder. Check your car's manual for recommended replacement intervals and clean or replace the filter as needed. This simple step can dramatically improve airflow and efficiency.When parking outdoors, a reflective sunshade in your windshield can significantly reduce the internal temperature build-up. This minimises the initial cooling effort required from your AC.It's a good habit to turn off your AC a few minutes before you reach your destination or turn off the engine. This allows the system to dry out, preventing mold and mildew growth in the vents, which can lead to unpleasant odours and reduce efficiency over time.","Many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling.

How an airplane’s Black Box is decoded

How long the investigation for Air India’s Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner flight crash could take

More than 200 people were killed when an Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed minutes after takeoff from Ahmedabad on June 12 (Thursday), making it the world's worst aviation disaster in a decade. As investigators prioritize recovering the aircraft's Black Box , aviation experts say the crucial flight recorders could take weeks to months to fully decode and analyze.The London-bound flight AI-171 carrying 242 people issued a Mayday distress call shortly after departure at 1:39 PM IST before crashing into a medical college hostel at just 625 feet altitude. This marks the first fatal crash of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner since the aircraft entered commercial service in 2011.Despite its name, the aircraft ""Black Box"" consists of two bright orange crash-resistant devices designed to survive extreme impact, fire, and water pressure. The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) logs thousands of technical parameters including altitude, speed, engine performance, and control inputs, while the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) captures all cockpit audio including pilot conversations, radio transmissions, and mechanical sounds.According to America’s National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ), an independent US government investigative agency that is responsible for civil transportation accident investigation, notes the recorders continuously store 25 hours of flight information, providing investigators with second-by-second reconstruction of events leading to a crash. For the Ahmedabad incident, the Black Box data will be critical in determining whether the disaster resulted from mechanical failure, engine malfunction, human error, or other factors.Given that the Boeing 787 struggled to gain altitude and the crew issued an emergency call, the FDR will reveal precise engine performance data and system warnings, while the CVR could capture emergency procedures being executed during those critical moments after takeoff.Once recovered, the Black Boxes are sent to specialized forensic laboratories under India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) or international facilities. The Bureau of Aircraft Accident Archives (BAAA) notes that investigators first assess the physical condition of the devices, which may require memory module extraction and transplantation if damaged.The investigation process involves synchronizing voice and flight data on a shared timeline, correlating findings with radar logs and air traffic control records. Modern teams create 3D computer simulations powered by FDR data to visualize the aircraft's trajectory and system failures.Aviation safety consultant Anthony Brickhouse, analyzing videos of the Ahmedabad crash, noted problematic signs including the landing gear being down during a phase when it should typically be retracted - details that Black Box data will either confirm or clarify.Initial data extraction typically requires 2-4 weeks for intact devices, according to NTSB protocols. However, if the recorders are damaged by impact or fire, the process can extend significantly as components require cleaning, drying, and reconstruction.The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) mandates that preliminary findings be released within 30 days, but comprehensive analysis takes much longer. Aviation investigation expert Greg Feith explains that while extracting data is relatively quick, ""understanding the story it tells takes considerable time.""Final investigation reports typically require 12-24 months to complete, as teams cross-reference Black Box data with maintenance records, weather conditions, and witness statements. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) notes that modern aircraft can generate thousands of data points per second, requiring meticulous analysis.For the Ahmedabad crash, US investigators from the NTSB will assist Indian authorities, potentially expediting the process. However, the complexity of first-time 787 crash analysis may extend the timeline, as investigators work to understand how this advanced aircraft's systems behaved during the emergency.","Black Boxes are crash-resistant devices designed to survive extreme impact, fire, and water pressure.

Arm CEO Rene Haas has joined a growing list of tech leaders, including Nvidia ’s Jensen Huang warning against the impact of US export restrictions on China. For those unaware, the US imposed a new rule in April that banned exports of advanced data centre chips to China. Speaking at the Founders Forum Global conference in Oxford on Thursday, June 12, Haas said that the controls could hinder global technological progress and harm both companies and consumers. In the interview with Bloomberg, he said “If you narrow access to technology and you force other ecosystems to grow up, it’s not good”. “It makes the pie smaller, if you will. And frankly, it’s not very good for consumers,” he added.Hass’s comments echoed Nvidia's Huang who last month warned that US companies are losing ground while Chinese firms like Huawei gain strength. “The Chinese competitors have evolved,” Huang then said. “Huawei has become quite formidable.”The latest rules targeted Nvidia’s H20 chip — the main product the company had specifically designed to meet earlier US regulatory requirements.Under the new regulations, even chips like the H20, which were previously cleared for sale in China, are now restricted because they still offer computing power considered too advanced. The U.S. government has said the measures aim to prevent China's military from accessing cutting-edge AI technology.Semiconductor executives worry that the US policy of limiting chip exports could backfire. Critics argue that such bans will push China to rapidly build its own tech industry, weakening the position of US companies globally. The curbs have cost Nvidia an estimated $8 billion in revenue this quarter alone.Nvidia had said that the new export controls would impact its business significantly, warning of a $5.5 billion hit to revenue. Despite these setbacks, Nvidia continues to explore ways to maintain its presence in the Chinese market while staying within regulatory limits.As per The Information report, Nvidia has told customers that a sample of the new chip will be available as soon as June. The company is also working on a China-specific version of its latest-generation AI chip, Blackwell.","Arm CEO Rene Haas has joined a growing list of tech leaders, including Nvidia’s Jensen Huang warning against the impact of US export restrictions on China.

The new browser positions AI as its core feature, allowing users to interact with an intelligent assistant directly through the address bar without visiting separate AI platforms like ChatGPT or Claude.Dia's standout capability lies in its seamless integration of AI functionality into everyday browsing tasks. Users can query information across all open tabs, generate drafts based on tab content, and receive web summaries through a built-in chatbot. The browser's address bar serves triple duty, handling website navigation, search queries, and AI interactions automatically based on user input.The launch comes after The Browser Company discontinued development of Arc browser last year, acknowledging that while Arc gained enthusiast popularity, its steep learning curve prevented mass adoption. CEO Josh Miller recognized that users increasingly rely on AI tools for various tasks, prompting the company to reimagine browsing entirely around artificial intelligence.Built on Google's open-source Chromium project, Dia maintains familiar browser functionality while adding advanced AI features. The ""History"" feature allows the AI to reference seven days of browsing data for contextual responses, while ""Skills"" enables users to create code snippets for customized shortcuts and layouts.Although AI integration in browsers isn't entirely new, Opera and Google Chrome offer similar features, Dia distinguishes itself by making artificial intelligence the central experience rather than an add-on feature.Current Arc users receive immediate access to Dia beta, with invitation privileges for other users.

Facebook parent company Meta has filed a lawsuit against Joy Timeline HK Limited, the entity behind CrushAI, an app that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate nude images without consent. The lawsuit, filed in Hong Kong where the company is based, aims to prevent CrushAI from advertising on Meta’s platforms, including Instagram and Facebook.The legal action follows a January report from 404 Media, which revealed that CrushAI—also known as Crushmate—had placed over 5,000 ads on Meta's platform. Data showed that 90% of CrushAI’s traffic originated from Meta, indicating that the app’s advertisements were highly effective in directing users to nonconsensual image-generation tools.Meta acknowledged the challenge of enforcing its policies against such advertisers.“This is a highly adversarial space and bad actors are constantly evolving their tactics to avoid enforcement, which is why we continue to invest in the best tools and technology to help identify and remove violating content,” the company said previously.While talking about the latest action, Meta said, “This legal action underscores both the seriousness with which we take this abuse and our commitment to doing all we can to protect our community from it.”“We’ll continue to take the necessary steps—which could include legal action—against those who abuse our platforms like this,” Meta added.Meta announced that any removed ads from nudify apps will now be shared with other tech companies via the Tech Coalition’s Lantern programme. This will enable major platforms such as Google, Discord, Roblox, Snap, and Twitch to take similar actions against violators. Additionally, Meta is enhancing its detection technology to better identify deceptive ads, even when they do not explicitly feature nudity.","Facebook parent company Meta has filed a lawsuit against Joy Timeline HK Limited, the entity behind CrushAI.

Wikipedia responds to backlash

The Wikimedia Foundation has paused its trial of AI-generated article summaries on Wikipedia following sharp criticism from the community of volunteer editors, says a 404Media report. The experiment, which began earlier this month, aimed to show short, machine-generated summaries at the top of Wikipedia articles on mobile. However, it faced immediate and overwhelming backlash. The report quotes one editor who said, “Just because Google has rolled out its AI summaries doesn't mean we need to one-up them… This would do immediate and irreversible harm to our readers and to our reputation as a decently trustworthy and serious source.” Another simply wrote, “Yuck.”The summaries, created using the Aya model from Cohere, appeared at the top of articles for users who opted in via a browser extension. These summaries were hidden by default, marked with a yellow “unverified” label, and had to be expanded to read. The feature was called “Simple Article Summaries” and was designed to make dense Wikipedia content easier to understand.But editors were quick to argue that this approach undermined the core values of Wikipedia. One said, “With Simple Article Summaries, you propose giving one singular editor with known reliability and NPOV issues a platform at the very top of any given article… I don't think I would feel comfortable contributing to an encyclopedia like this.”In response to the backlash, Wikimedia announced it would pause the experiment. A spokesperson explained that the trial was an opt-in test to help make Wikipedia more accessible, particularly for readers with different reading levels. “It was meant to gauge interest… and help us think about the right kind of community moderation systems to ensure humans remain central to deciding what information is shown,” the spokesperson said as quoted in the report.The Foundation also acknowledged that the communication around the project could have been better. “Reading through the comments, it’s clear we could have done a better job introducing this idea,” a project manager said. “We need to figure out how we can experiment in safe ways that are appropriate for readers and the Wikimedia community.”While the AI summaries have been put on hold for now, Wikimedia says it remains interested in exploring AI tools — but with full involvement from editors. “We do not have any plans for bringing a summary feature to the wikis without editor involvement,” the project manager added.","The experiment, which began earlier this month, aimed to show short, machine- generated summaries at the top of Wikipedia articles on mobile.

New parental controls with iOS 26

Apple announced its next generation operating system for iPhones at the recently held Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC). Dubbed iOS 26 (and not iOS 19), the software update brings a unique Liquid Glass interface to Apple iPhone among several new features. With iOS 26, Apple has also updated its child safety features that gives more control to parents over who their kids can communicate with.With iOS 26, when a child wants to talk to someone new through text, they’ll need their parent’s permission. A request will show up in the Messages app, and parents can tap to allow or block it.Apple is also introducing something called “PermissionKit.” This will help other apps add similar safety features, so kids can send requests to parents before chatting, following, or adding new people.As per a report by The Verge, developers can request age range information with a new “Declared Age Range API.”For children under 13, Apple already has strong safety settings like web filters and app limits. Now, similar protections will be added for teens aged 13 to 17.Apple’s Communication Safety feature is also getting smarter. If nudity is detected during a FaceTime video call, the system will step in. It will also blur inappropriate images in shared photo albums.With the latest operating system, the App Store is updating its age ratings to be more detailed — with new categories like 13+, 16+, and 18+. Further, the company will allow parents to share a child’s age range with the app.","Apple announced its next generation operating system for iPhones at the recently held Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) Dubbed iOS 26 (and not iOS 19), the software update brings a unique Liquid Glass interface to Apple iPhone among several new features.

Facebook-parent Meta is facing a wave of exits from its artificial intelligence (AI) team, as top talent increasingly moves to rivals such as OpenAI and Anthropic, according to The SignalFire State of Talent Report – 2025, dated May 20. It says that despite offering salaries of over $2 million a year, Meta is losing skilled AI professionals, reflecting a broader challenge in Big Tech as demand for AI experts surges.The report highlights Anthropic as the leader in retention, holding on to 80% of its AI employees—outpacing peers like DeepMind (78%), OpenAI (67%), and Meta (64%). As per the report, Anthropic’s success is credited to a culture that values independence and encourages open debate, appealing to those frustrated by corporate bureaucracy.

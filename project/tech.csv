NCERT to launch YouTube channels





Google and NPTEL Collaboration

Google announced a strategic partnership with the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) to enhance access to quality education across India. This collaboration aims to empower students, parents, and teachers by providing engaging and accessible educational content.“Learning has always been at the heart of YouTube. And, in India, where accessible education is crucial for unlocking the nation's potential, YouTube can help make learning content more accessible through innovative partnerships, tools, and resources,” Jonathan Katzman, Director of Product Management, YouTube Learning in a Google blog post.As part of this initiative, NCERT will launch multiple YouTube channels over the coming months, covering grades 1 to 12. These channels will offer educational content in 29 Indian languages, including Indian Sign Language, making learning accessible to a diverse range of learners.Google has also partnered with the National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) to roll out credentialed courses on YouTube. This collaboration will enable learners to access and complete courses on a variety of subjects, from pure sciences and literature to sports psychology and rocket propulsion.“Through this initiative, a pathway has been created for anyone outside the IIT system to be able to do a course on NPTEL’s YouTube channels and then complete the online certification on the NPTEL-SWAYAM portal and get a certificate from the IITs,” Katzman said. He added more courses will be rolled out in the coming months.“Using AI, we identify concepts covered in a video and may provide definitions from the web of those concepts, across subjects like biology, physics, and chemistry. We surface definitions and images from Google’s Knowledge Graph, based on the video’s transcript and other associated video metadata,” Katzman said.","Google announced a strategic partnership with the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) This collaboration aims to empower students, parents, and teachers by providing engaging and accessible educational content.

When Bryan Johnson accepted 'defeat' with his anti-ageing therapy

Tech millionaire Bryan Johnson , famed for his age-reversing experiments, recently connected with Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal at an exclusive event titled “Don’t Die.” The gathering, inspired by Johnson’s movement advocating longer, healthier, and happier lives, was hosted by Goyal at Soho House for an intimate audience of 50 select attendees. Sharing the experience on X (formerly Twitter), Johnson wrote, “Last night at Soho House with @deepigoyal, who built @zomato into one of the most successful companies in India.”For those unaware, Soho is an international private members’ club in Mumbai. “There were over 1,100 applications for 50 seats. Sad to miss so many of you. Thank you @akshaybd and @thetanmay for hosting,” he added, sharing images from the event.The event was also attended by a Mumbai-based doctor Rickson Pereira who wrote on X: “Had an enlightening Sunday evening listening to @bryan_johnson talk about his project ‘Blueprint’. “Blueprint” is his personal project where he aims to “not die” by implementing a rigorous daily routine that includes diet, exercise, sleep, and supplements. He works closely with a team of doctors and researchers to monitor his body’s biomarkers and adjust his routine for optimal health. I subscribe to his ideology of prioritising your health first. I have been following his work for over a year and I think he is doing an amazing job of generating data about what works for human body and what is required to be in peak physical health. Thank you @thetanmay for the invite.”Bryan Johnson’s anti-aging journey, part of his ambitious Project Blueprint , has involved controversial methods such as receiving blood transfusions from his teenage son—a ""young blood"" procedure not approved by the FDA—alongside a strict diet with Blueprint-branded supplements and regular gene therapy injections.In November this year, Johnson accepted facing a setback when a recent procedure reportedly caused severe swelling to his face. Sharing a post on Instagram, Johnson wrote that he injected a fat-derived extracellular matrix into his face as part of first therapy under a procedure called “Project Baby Face”. He said that immediately following the injections, his face began to blow up. “And then it got worse, and worse, and worse until I couldn’t even see. It was a severe allergic reaction,” he added.","Tech millionaire Bryan Johnson is famed for his age-reversing experiments.

‘Your death date’: This AI app claims can ‘predict’ when you will die,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/death-clock-ai-app-with-1-25-lakh-downloads-can-predict-date-of-your-death/articleshow/115885555.cms,"This is an AI-generated image



Death Clock gets 1.25 lakh downloads



How Death Clock predicts death

1)

Maintain a Healthy Weight

2) Regular Exercise

3)

Stop Smoking

4)

Balanced Diet

5)

Drink Less (or no) Alcohol

6) Good Sleep

7) Regular Check-ups

8) Manage Stress

9) Maintain Social Connections

10) Lifelong Learning

An Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die. Launched in July early this year, the app analyzes personal data such as age, height, weight, daily calorie intake, exercise levels, and more to predict the date. Developer Brent Franson says that the AI was trained on a dataset of more than 1,200 life expectancy studies with some 53 million participants. The results, he says, are a ‘pretty significant’ improvement on the standard life-table expectations.Despite its somewhat morbid concept—a ""fond farewell"" death-day card featuring the Grim Reaper—the app has gained traction in the Health and Fitness category. It is free to use, while you will need a subscription to show a clock counting down to my estimated death. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, the app has around 1,25,000 downloads till date.“Have you ever asked yourself 'when will I die?', our advanced life expectancy calculator will accurately* predict your death date for you depending on where you live, how much you smoke and your lifestyle to show your own death clock countdown. To predict your death date, simply input your date of birth, sex, smoking habits, your BMI and the country you live in. If you don't know your BMI simply use the BMI calculator form,” the app reads.Death Clock predictions are based on extensive medical studies and health data, with AI providing personalized suggestions for a healthier lifestyle. The idea is to encourage individuals to take better care of their health, using the predictions as a framework for decision-making.As mentioned, the app offers personalised suggestions to users. Some of these include:Maintaining a healthy weight is vital to reduce the risk of developing diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.Get moving for at least 30 minutes a day. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.Avoid smoking and second-hand smoke. These can lead to various types of cancer, heart disease, and lung diseases.Eating a balanced diet full of nutrient-rich fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains is critical. Avoid consuming too much processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats.Limit alcohol intake. While occasional social drinking is usually okay, heavy or prolonged drinking can lead to a number of health issues including liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and cancer.Try to get a good night's sleep. Quality sleep is important for overall health and well-being. It affects mood, memory, and healing processes.Regular screenings and medical check-ups can help detect problems early. This is especially important for conditions that don't always show noticeable symptoms, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol.Long-term stress can lead to a number of health issues. Practice stress management techniques like mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or other relaxation exercises.Relationships and social interactions are vital for mental health. Loneliness and social isolation can lead to depression and cognitive decline.Keep your mind active. Lifelong learning, reading, solving puzzles, or other brain-engaging activities can help to keep your mind sharp and potentially delay the onset of cognitive decline.While it’s important to note that these AI-driven tools aren’t guaranteed to provide exact dates, there are concerns about privacy and data security, as users must input sensitive information, which could be exploited by companies or malicious actors.","Artificial intelligence-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die.

The Income Tax Department has introduced PAN 2.0 to streamline the process of allotting and updating Permanent Account Numbers (PAN). Aimed at enhancing convenience and security, this initiative ensures that e-PAN cards, featuring a QR code, are sent to the registered email IDs of applicants free of cost. However, taxpayers must pay a nominal fee for a physical PAN card. Existing PAN cards remain valid even without the QR code. This article provides a detailed overview of PAN 2.0 and a step-by-step guide to applying for and receiving your PAN card digitally.Before proceeding, determine whether your PAN was issued by NSDL or UTI Infrastructure Technology and Services Ltd. (UTIITSL). This information is located on the back of your PAN card.The inclusion of QR codes on PAN cards enhances security by providing a quick and reliable way to verify their authenticity. The encrypted data stored in the QR code allows authorities, banks, and other institutions to easily access and confirm the cardholder's details, ensuring protection against counterfeit or fraudulent PAN cards.According to experts, individuals with older white PAN cards or those lacking QR codes should switch to the newer version featuring a QR code. They believe the updated PAN card design, known as PAN 2.0, will help mitigate fraud risks by incorporating a QR code for faster and more efficient verification.","The Income Tax Department has introduced PAN 2.0 to streamline the process of allotting and updating Permanent Account Numbers (PAN) Aimed at enhancing convenience and security, this initiative ensures that e-PAN cards, featuring a QR code, are sent to the registered email IDs of applicants free of cost.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115808793,imgsize-78664,width-400,resizemode-4/115808793.jpg"

""It would be profoundly un-American to use political power to harm competitors and give an advantage to your own business interests.""

""I’m not that worried about it,""

Elon Musk has sued OpenAI and its close ally Microsoft

Why Sam Altman says he is not worried

""I don’t think Elon would do it,"" Altman said, emphasizing that the public would not tolerate any misuse of political power for business gain.

ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed confidence that Tesla CEO Elon Musk would not use his influence with President-elect Donald Trump to undermine business rivals, calling such actions ""profoundly un-American."" Speaking at the New York Times DealBook conference, on November 4, Altman addressed concerns surrounding Musk's new role as head of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in Trump administration. There are worries in some quarters that Musk might leverage the position to benefit his own companies.Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been quite open about his 'dislike' for OpenAI CEO Altman.He added that, despite Musk’s polarizing persona, using political power for personal gain would go against values Musk holds dear.Altman said.Musk, who co-founded OpenAI before departing from the organization, is currently suing OpenAI and Microsoft. Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI accuses the organization of abandoning its founding commitment to serve the public good. He has also sought a federal court order to block OpenAI's transition to a more profit-driven model.Musk claims that they have strayed from the nonprofit mission originally envisioned for the company. Musk has also launched xAI, which, according to the Wall Street Journal, is now valued at $50 billion, making it one of the world’s most valuable startups.Altman called the ongoing legal dispute with Musk ""tremendously sad,"" reflecting on a time when he viewed Musk as a ""mega hero.""Musk, who has become a close ally of Trump, was heavily involved in the 2016 presidential campaign, spending over $100 million to support Trump's bid and attending rallies. He has remained a prominent figure in the Trump administration’s transition, reportedly even joining a call when Google CEO Sundar Pichai congratulated Trump on his election victory.Musk's businesses, including SpaceX and Tesla, maintain significant ties with both U.S. and foreign governments. His potential new role has sparked concerns about conflicts of interest.

Ad Astra, a pre-kindergarten Montessori school funded by Elon Musk , has officially received its state permit to begin operations in Bastrop County, Texas. Approved by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission on November 14, 2024, the school reflects Musk’s vision of integrating innovative learning methods into early childhood education. With a focus on exploration-based and STEM-driven curricula, Ad Astra aims to equip children with critical skills in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics while fostering curiosity and foundational learning. Situated near Musk’s corporate facilities, this initiative signifies his broader commitment to shaping educational landscapes.Ad Astra, which means “to the stars” in Latin, is designed for children aged three to six. Initially enrolling up to 24 students, the school emphasizes hands-on, exploratory learning to spark curiosity and foster foundational skills.The curriculum integrates activities ranging from creative pursuits like coloring to intellectually stimulating lessons on maps and globes. Drawing inspiration from renowned psychologists Alfred Adler and Rudolf Dreikurs, the educational model encourages students to develop responsibility, respect, and resourcefulness.Ad Astra's outdoor space offers amenities like a basketball court and tricycles, providing opportunities for both structured and free play. This combination of indoor and outdoor learning environments supports a holistic developmental approach, blending physical activity with cognitive and emotional growth.Ad Astra is not an isolated initiative but the starting point of a larger educational vision backed by Musk’s X Foundation. The X Foundation, supported by the Musk Foundation with nearly $100 million in funding, aims to expand this model to K-12 schools and even establish a university in Texas if the program proves successful.The school operates out of a white farmhouse in Bastrop County, approximately 40 minutes from Austin. Its management is overseen by Xplor Education, led by CEO Greg Marick. The teaching team currently includes three faculty members, focusing on both academic and life skills, such as conflict resolution and practical activities like sweeping and tidying.While Elon Musk’s name does not directly appear on Ad Astra’s application documents, his influence is unmistakable. The X Foundation owns the school property, and Musk’s financial advisor, Jared Birchall, was responsible for submitting the application. This initiative aligns with Musk’s broader efforts to intertwine his technological aspirations with community-building projects.The school’s current capacity of 54 students could expand based on demand and performance benchmarks, according to the X Foundation. However, tuition details for the Bastrop facility have yet to be disclosed.Ad Astra represents more than a traditional Montessori school. It embodies Musk’s commitment to reimagining education, blending principles of innovation, community impact, and resourcefulness. If successful, this model could serve as a blueprint for transforming education systems at various levels, fostering a new generation of thinkers and problem-solvers.","Ad Astra, a pre-kindergarten Montessori school funded by Elon Musk, has officially received its state permit to begin operations in Bastrop County, Texas.

Apple’s position on child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on its iCloud platform

Apple, one of the world’s most prominent technology companies, is at the center of a legal battle concerning its alleged failure to adequately address the proliferation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on its iCloud platform. A 27-year-old woman from the Northeastern United States has filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of abandoning crucial measures to detect and limit the spread of abusive content. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Northern California, highlights Apple’s decision to shelve its NeuralHash system, a tool designed to scan for CSAM, as a critical failure. This legal action not only challenges Apple 's practices but also raises broader concerns about privacy, corporate accountability, and child safety in the digital age.The plaintiff, who is using a pseudonym to protect her identity, endured severe abuse as an infant. A relative molested her, took explicit photographs, and shared the material online. For years, she has lived with the knowledge that these images continue to circulate on the internet, receiving frequent notifications from law enforcement about new discoveries of her images in the possession of individuals worldwide.One such notification in 2021 revealed that the images had been stored on Apple’s iCloud platform, intensifying her trauma. Her lawyer confirmed that the images were found on a MacBook in Vermont, with some stored in iCloud. Despite Apple unveiling the NeuralHash tool in 2021 to identify and report CSAM, the company abandoned the initiative following backlash from cybersecurity experts, who warned it could lead to government surveillance abuses.The plaintiff's lawsuit claims Apple broke its promise to protect victims of child sexual abuse by failing to implement effective measures, thereby allowing the material to persist on its platforms.The lawsuit alleges that Apple’s inaction has caused significant harm to victims of CSAM. It accuses the company of:The suit seeks to change Apple’s practices and compensate a potential class of 2,680 victims, with damages potentially exceeding $1.2 billion.This case is part of a growing legal trend to hold tech companies accountable for CSAM under product liability laws rather than relying solely on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Traditionally, Section 230 has shielded platforms from liability for user-generated content. However, recent rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit suggest that this protection may not extend to content moderation failures or product liability claims.Apple’s response to a similar lawsuit in North Carolina earlier this year argued that iCloud is not a “product” and thus not subject to product liability claims. The company also cited Section 230 as a defense. Legal experts believe the new lawsuit may face significant hurdles, including constitutional concerns related to government-mandated scanning of user data.Apple has defended its record on child safety. Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesperson, called CSAM “abhorrent” and stated that the company is committed to combating such crimes while protecting user privacy. He pointed to features like warnings in the Messages app about explicit content and tools to report harmful material.However, critics argue that these measures are insufficient. Apple’s decision to abandon NeuralHash has drawn significant criticism from child advocacy groups, who argue that the company failed to balance privacy with its responsibility to prevent abuse.The lawsuit comes amid increasing scrutiny of how tech companies handle CSAM. Platforms like Google and Facebook have implemented tools like Microsoft’s PhotoDNA, which identifies abusive content by comparing digital signatures against a database of known CSAM. Apple has resisted such widespread scanning, citing privacy concerns.The plaintiff’s lawyer argues that Apple’s privacy-first approach has enabled the proliferation of CSAM. Internal Apple documents reportedly reveal concerns among executives about the company’s minimal reporting compared to competitors.The lawsuit could have far-reaching consequences for Apple and the tech industry as a whole. If successful, it may lead to stricter regulations on how companies handle CSAM, potentially challenging the balance between privacy and safety.The plaintiff, represented by Marsh Law, a firm specializing in cases of child sexual abuse, said Apple’s inaction has been devastating. Her lawyer built the case using over 80 examples of abusive material found on iCloud. The woman decided to join the suit despite fears of increased trafficking of her images and potential public exposure.“This is about holding Apple accountable for their promises and their actions,” she said, emphasising that the company’s failure to act has compounded the trauma experienced by victims like her.","Apple sued for alleged inaction on child sexual abuse content in iCloud.

Facebook-parent Meta’s growth in 2024

Facebook-parent Meta ’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg has seen his wealth surge by $87.3 billion this year. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, this increase has made him the third-richest person in the world with a net worth of $215 billion. This puts him behind only Elon Musk ($362 billion) and Jeff Bezos ($240 billion). Zuckerberg's wealth gain this year was second only to Musk's $133 billion increase. Notably, Zuckerberg's current net worth surpasses the combined wealth of several prominent billionaires, including Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett , the 9th richest person who’s worth $147.0 billion; CEO of Citadel LLC Ken Griffin , 37th richest person with $42.4 billion value; venture capitalist Peter Thiel , ranked 141st with $15.9 billion; and Mark Cuban , NBA team owner and investor, ranked 365th with $8.1 billion.Zuckerberg surpassed Buffett in wealth as the popular investor also known as the ""Oracle of Omaha"" has been giving away a significant portion of his fortune and remains committed to philanthropy. Despite this, Buffett's net worth has grown by $27.2 billion in 2024, driven by a rise in Berkshire Hathaway’s stock price.Griffin, Thiel, and Cuban have also seen increases in their fortunes this year, with gains of $5.9 billion, $6.7 billion, and $1.2 billion, respectively. Zuckerberg shares a connection with Thiel through Meta Platforms, formerly Facebook, where Thiel was the first outside investor. Thiel amassed a portion of his wealth by investing early in Facebook and gradually selling his stake over the years.Meta's stock has fluctuated between $317.77 and $629.79 over the past 52 weeks, with its shares gaining 80% this year.

TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have made an effort to prevent a US ban. They have reportedly asked a US appeals court to temporarily block a law that requires that parent company ByteDance to divest TikTok by January 19 or face a ban in the country.According to a report by Bloomberg, TikTok filed an emergency motion with the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, following a recent ruling by the appeals court upholding the law, leaving the popular social media platform with just weeks to comply.The report said that TikTok stressed the urgency of the situation, highlighting the potential disruption to its over 170 million US users. The company argued that if not paused, it will “shut down TikTok–one of the nation’s most popular speech platforms–for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.”It argued that there's a strong chance the Supreme Court will take up the case and potentially overturn the lower court's decision.Unless the Supreme Court intervenes, the fate of TikTok in the US hangs in the balance. Lawyers for the companies said the prospect the Supreme Court will take the case “and reverse is sufficiently high to warrant the temporary pause needed to create time for further deliberation.”The companies also noted President-elect Donald Trump – who unsuccessfully tried to ban TikTok during his first term in 2020 – has vowed to prevent a ban, arguing the delay “will give the incoming administration time to determine its position – which could moot both the impending harms and the need for Supreme Court review.”While the current President may grant a 90-day extension to the divestiture deadline, it remains unclear if ByteDance can meet the stringent requirements to qualify for such an extension.This case grants the US government broad authority to ban foreign-owned apps that raise data security concerns.

Reddit has launched “Reddit Answers,” an AI-powered search feature designed to provide users with quick and relevant answers. Reddit says that redditors can ask questions and receive answers using a conversational interface.“Starting today, we’re rolling out a test of Reddit Answers , a new way to get the information, recommendations, discussions, and hot takes people are looking for – on any topic – from real conversations and communities across all of Reddit,” the company said.Reddit Answers is available to a small group of US users and it is currently in its initial testing phase. Those who have got the access can use it via a new button on the Reddit homepage.Unlike other AI chatbots and search engines like Google Search and Microsoft Bing that crawl the entire web, Reddit Answers exclusively utilizes information found within Reddit's own communities.For example, a user inquiring about modifications to a specific BMW model would receive a concise summary of relevant tips, quotes, and links to relevant discussions within Reddit's car communities.“Once a question is asked, curated summaries of relevant conversations and details across Reddit will appear, including links to related communities and posts. Redditors can easily read relevant snippets and answers inline from real redditors, jump into the full conversations, and go deeper in their search with their own or suggested follow-up questions,” the company said.As per Reddit vice president of product Serkan Piantino (via CNBC), Reddit Answers is designed to enhance the search experience on the platform and the feature has been in development for six months and aligns with Reddit's broader goal of improving content discovery.Additionally, users can query a wide range of topics, however, NSFW content is excluded from Reddit Answers. The company plans to expand the feature's availability based on user feedback and testing results.","Reddit has launched an AI-powered search feature called Reddit Answers.

How US restrictions affected Nvidia’s market in China



China's market regulator is investigating US chipmaker Nvidia for suspected violations of the country's anti-monopoly law. This move is likely announced in retaliation for recent US restrictions on China's semiconductor industry. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) is also investigating whether Nvidia violated commitments made during its 2020 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies. The acquisition deal was approved by the Chinese regulator on these conditions which Nvidia has allegedly violated. However, the specific details of Nvidia’s alleged anti-monopoly violations in China remain unclear. Since the announcement, the chipmaker’s shares have reduced by over 2%.This investigation follows the US' latest crackdown on China's semiconductor industry, which was the third curb in three years. Recently, the US restricted exports to 140 Chinese companies, including manufacturers of chip-making equipment. Responding to these restrictions China also banned exports of gallium, germanium, and antimony to the US. These critical minerals have significant military applications.In 2019, when Nvidia proposed a $6.9 billion acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies, there were concerns that China may block the deal amid escalating US-China trade tensions. However, Beijing approved the merger in 2020, imposing several conditions on the US chipmaker and the merged entity's operations in China.These conditions included bans on forced product bundling, unreasonable trading terms, purchase restrictions, and discriminatory treatment of customers opting to buy products individually.Nvidia has once experienced surging demand in China. However, this growth has been tempered over the past year as the US brought in policies that were aimed at preventing China from obtaining the world’s most advanced chips.Ahead of these restrictions, Nvidia held over 90% of China’s AI chip market. However, the company now faces growing competition from domestic players, with Huawei emerging as a key challenger.","China's market regulator is investigating US chipmaker Nvidia for suspected violations of the country's anti-monopoly law.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has appealed to the Supreme Court for a swift hearing in a bid to expedite its antitrust cases against Amazon and Flipkart, a report has said. The CCI is investigating allegations that Amazon and Flipkart favor certain sellers on their platforms, potentially violating antitrust laws.Several companies, including Samsung and Vivo, have filed legal challenges against the CCI's investigation in various high courts. The CCI said that these challenges are aimed at delaying the probe and wants the Supreme Court to intervene for a swift resolution, according to a report by news agency Reuters.Citing a December 3 filing, the CCI has asked the court to hear 23 challenges, filed by Samsung, Vivo, and several vendors on the Amazon and Flipkart platforms, to enable the case to be decided quickly.The CCI's investigation, which concluded in August, found Amazon and Flipkart guilty of breaking antitrust laws by favouring certain sellers on their platforms. The investigation also implicated smartphone giants like Samsung and Vivo in the scheme, alleging they colluded with the e-commerce companies for exclusive online product launches.This triggered a wave of lawsuits from Amazon, Flipkart, Samsung, Vivo, and some vendors, totaling nearly two dozen across five Indian high courts. The CCI claims these lawsuits aim to “debilitate and scuttle” the investigation process. They argue that allowing these separate lawsuits would create chaos and hinder the CCI's ability to conduct investigations effectively.The separate lawsuits, if allowed, “will lead to absurdity since it will interfere with the flexibility of the (commission's) Director General to carry out investigation in any matter,” CCI said.This isn't the first time Amazon and Flipkart have faced scrutiny for their business practices. Smaller retailers have long accused them of using deep discounts and preferential treatment to stifle competition.In 2021, an investigation revealed Amazon used a select group of sellers to bypass Indian laws. Amazon and Flipkart have maintained their innocence.

What was Bangladesh’s internet policy for northeastern states



Why Bangladesh is reversing its telecom policy



Bangladesh's internet regulator has reversed a policy introduced by the Sheikh Hasina-led government, which permitted the country to serve as a transit hub for high-speed internet supply to India’s northeastern states, a report has said. This reversal may hinder India's initiatives to enhance internet connectivity in the region.Citing sources, a report by the Economic Times said that this plan can also hinder Bangladesh's goal of becoming a regional internet hub. This reported policy reversal comes after Bangladesh formed an interim government led by Muhammad Yunus after the country’s former Prime Minister Hasina was extradited to India earlier this year.In 2023, Summit Communications and Fiber@Home, two Bangladeshi companies, applied to supply internet bandwidth from Singapore to India's northeastern states via Bharti Airtel. This prompted the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) to seek permission from the country's telecom ministry for the project. The proposed route would have used the Akhaura border crossing.The original plan aimed to improve internet speed in India's northeastern states by routing internet traffic through Bangladesh. Currently, these states receive their internet connection via a longer route: submarine cables in Chennai connected to Singapore, then through India's domestic fibre optic network. This indirect route has led to slower internet speeds in the region. The now-reversed plan would have provided a faster connection through Bangladesh for states like Tripura and Assam.The BTRC has now reportedly reversed its decision, citing concerns about its potential impact on Bangladesh's ambitions to become a regional internet hub.According to the report, sources in Dhaka claimed that the Hasina government's decision would have ""impacted"" Bangladesh's ability to provide internet services to parts of Myanmar and northwestern China through its infrastructure.Bangladesh's interim government led by Yunus may also review other cross-border projects that were put in place over the last 15 years, the report adds.",The original plan aimed to improve internet speed in India's northeastern states by routing internet traffic through Bangladesh.

Amaran producers respond

Mr. Vaageesan number removed from OTT versions



Producers of Amaran, a recently released Tamil movie starring Sivakarthikeyan and Sai Pallavi , have apologized to engineering student V.V. Vaageesan after his personal mobile number was accidentally displayed in a scene from the film.The issue arose from a scene where Sai Pallavi’s character tosses a paper to the hero with her phone number written on it. Unfortunately, the number belonged to Mr. Vaageesan. After the movie’s release on October 31, 2024, Mr. Vaageesan began receiving calls from strangers across India and abroad, many hoping to speak with Sai Pallavi. Others mistakenly believed the number belonged to Indu Rebecca Varghese, the wife of Major Mukund. The constant barrage of calls left the student overwhelmed, forcing him to silence his phone for over a week.Despite sharing his ordeal on social media and seeking help from the filmmakers, no action was initially taken. Left with no choice, he issued a legal notice to the producers, demanding Rs 1.1 crore in compensation for the mental distress and disruptions caused.Raaj Kamal Films International (RKFI), the movie's producers, have now issued a statement acknowledging the mistake. They clarified that the number was included by accident during the graphics editing process and assured that it was not intentional. RKFI expressed regret for the inconvenience caused to Mr. Vaageesan and confirmed that the number had been removed from all theatrical, television, and OTT versions of the film.The production house further said that immediate steps had been taken to remove the mobile number from all theatrical prints in Tamil Nadu and from versions intended for television and OTT platforms.Criticising the delayed response, C. Munusamy, counsel for Mr. Vaageesan, said. “Had RKFI acted promptly, some damage control could have been achieved. However, their reluctance to acknowledge the issue in a timely manner only prolonged my client’s ordeal, leaving him inundated with incessant calls from unknown and unscrupulous individuals round-the-clock. This has made his life miserable and caused immense mental distress.”“You cannot do business at the expense of an individual’s privacy. My client’s ability to carry out his routine activities has been severely affected by this negligence. Despite the producers’ assurances, he continues to receive calls, leaving him with no option but to approach the court of law,” he further said.","Amaran producers respond to V.V.

What TikTok has to say

Facebook and Instagram, the social media companies owned by Meta , and Alphabet – which owns Google and YouTube – benefitted after a U.S. appeals court upheld a law requiring China-based ByteDance to sell its popular short video app, TikTok, by early next year or face a nationwide ban.Shares of Meta soared to a record high last week even as the ruling dealt a significant blow to ByteDance, whose app is used by 170 million Americans. It upheld legislation passed with bipartisan support in Congress and signed by President Joe Biden, granting the US government broad authority to ban foreign-owned apps deemed a risk to Americans' data privacy.ByteDance and TikTok had challenged the law, arguing it violates constitutional protections and infringes on Americans' free speech rights.Meta’s shares climbed to a record high of $629.78 before settling at $625.37 – up 2.7%. The company's platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, are key competitors to TikTok for both user engagement and advertising revenue.Not only Meta but shares of Alphabet, the parent company of YouTube and Google, also rose 1.1% to $174.68. YouTube also offers Shorts platform for content creators to share short-length clips.Thirdly, Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns the Truth Social platform, saw its stock increase by 3.4% to $34.89.ByteDance and TikTok are expected to appeal the ruling to the full appeals court or the US Supreme Court.The company argued that the divestment law infringes on First Amendment rights and constitutes censorship.“The Supreme Court has a strong track record of defending Americans' free speech, and we are confident they will uphold this principle in our case,” TikTok said in a statement.The law prohibits app stores and internet hosting services from offering TikTok after the deadline unless ByteDance sells its US operations.","Shares of Meta soared to a record high last week even as the ruling dealt a significant blow to ByteDance, whose app is used by 170 million Americans.

How TikTok-owner ByteDance may have become Nvidia’s biggest customer in China despite US ban on AI chips export,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-tiktok-owner-bytedance-may-have-become-nvidias-biggest-customer-in-china-despite-us-ban-on-ai-chips-export/articleshow/116115520.cms,"Why Bytedance is investing in AI

How Nvidia is central to Bytedance’s plans

ByteDance’s ‘AI app’ Doubao gaining popularity in China

TikTok-parent company ByteDance is reportedly establishing itself as a major player in China's artificial intelligence (AI) landscape and in the process, it has become the biggest customer of Nvidia in China – and potentially in all of Asia – despite a US ban on exports of sophisticated AI chips to the country.Citing people familiar with the matter, a report by The Financial Times said that, apart from aggressively poaching top AI talent from rivals like Alibaba, the Chinese tech company has been investing heavily in AI infrastructure. Led by founder Zhang Yiming, ByteDance has been on a hiring spree, attracting top engineers and researchers to bolster its AI teams.The report said that this push into AI comes at a time when the company’s popular apps like Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok) and TikTok have shown signs of slowing down. Furthermore, a recent US court ruling requiring ByteDance to divest from TikTok by January or face a ban have added to the company's challenges.“Zhang Yiming realised the potential for large language models to change the industry, and he decided to go all in,” a company insider was quoted as saying.Yiming has expressed his ambition to achieve “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), systems with human-like intelligence, despite stepping down from chief executive’s post in 2021.Just like other tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Facebook-parent Meta and others, Chinese companies are also looking at Nvidia for AI chips to power their AI infrastructure. However, ByteDance can only buy Nvidia’s H20 AI chips for Chinese data centres – a customised, less-powerful version of its GPUs tailored to align with US export controls.Reportedly, ByteDance can buy top-of-the-line H100s and Blackwell chips for data centres outside of the country. The FT reports that ByteDance will increase its computing capacity outside China and for that it has signed as the anchor tenant for new data centres in Malaysia.In addition to software development, ByteDance is also reportedly working on its own AI chip, similar to Google's Tensor Processing Unit. This move can reduce the company's reliance on Nvidia GPUs and further solidify its position in the AI hardware market.In the meantime, ByteDance’s AI efforts have increased in the development of Doubao, a popular AI chatbot that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT in China. Doubao has gained significant traction since its launch, boasting millions of monthly active users. The company has also launched an overseas chatbot, Cici AI, powered by third-party models including OpenAI's GPT.“The key differentiator of ByteDance’s Doubao is that it brings together multiple AI capabilities in one polished application,” said Wang Tiezhen, an engineer at machine learning platform Hugging Face, while explaining about its search, translation, image and video generation capabilities."," ByteDance has been on a hiring spree, attracting top engineers and researchers to bolster its AI teams.

(Image: Google)In the landscape of digital memory, screenshots have been our personal and very informal archive – collections of information captured in moments of urgency or inspiration. Google 's Pixel Screenshots feature emerged from understanding how people interact with digital information, leveraging artificial intelligence to reimagine how people capture, store, and retrieve the fragments of information that compose their daily experiences.In a candid conversation that peeled back the layers of Google's innovation, Times of India - Tech caught up with Friedman, one of the key architects behind the Pixel Screenshots app.Max Friedman , Pixel Product Manager at Google, recalls the team's initial contemplation about personal computing. ""Our phones are becoming the most important device for us,"" he explained. ""However, a lot of the experiences on your phone aren't actually personalized.” This observation wasn't just a critique but a starting point for reimagining how technology could better serve user needs.The core philosophy behind Pixel Screenshots is deceptively simple: enhance an existing user habit without demanding additional effort. ""Users are already taking screenshots. They're already using those screenshots later on to reference information or complete tasks,"" Friedman noted. The challenge was to close the loop, making the screenshot journey seamless and intelligent.The team's approach was unconventional. Instead of building another agent, Friedman explains that the team wanted to think of AI more like a sidekick that helps you around on your journey, something. Their inspiration? The magical house in Disney's animated musical fantasy, Encanto. ""We thought about what if we could make the Pixel phone gradually more like the casita from Encanto, in the sense that it adapts to your needs as they come,"" Friedman said.Before the December Pixel drop, screenshot management was evolving towards more intelligent solutions. Google's new approach aimed to solve a common problem: the challenge of finding specific information within a growing collection of screenshots.""We've all been there - you know you saved that restaurant's address or your friend's Wi-Fi password somewhere, but scrolling through hundreds of images is a challenge,"" explained Sarah Chen , Google's VP of Pixel Software, during the Made by Google event, back in August, when Google announced the ""Pixel Screenshots"" with the Pixel 9 phones.The Pixel Screenshots app introduced a new approach to digital information management. Powered by Google's Gemini Nano technology, it could analyze and organize screenshots in real-time, transforming them from static images into searchable information repositories.Users could now ask specific questions like ""What was Sam's Wi-Fi password?"" or ""When does that concert go on sale?"" The app would scan through saved screenshots, extract relevant information, and provide answers alongside the source image.The fundamental challenge was understanding user behavior. People take screenshots constantly – concert tickets, restaurant recommendations, Wi-Fi passwords, product details – but retrieving that information later becomes a digital treasure hunt. ""We wanted to take an existing habit that users already have, and just make it better and more useful without requiring any additional effort,"" Friedman articulated.What's new with Pixel Screenshots in the December's drop, is this philosophy manifests through several nuanced features and it’s existence beyond just a mere app.First up is Gboard integration, which is a practical solution much welcomed. Friedman shared a personal anecdote: after screenshotting a concert ticket for an artist he didn't know, the app automatically surfaced the musician's music in Spotify. Just so you know, Gboard is the default keyboard app on Pixel phones, and as for the apps it works with, it works with all the Google apps and selected third-party apps, which Friedman says will continue to grow.Another integration that introduces another layer of interaction is Circle to Search. Users can now circle specific screen segments, saving precise information snippets with potential actions. ""We're trying to make it easier for users to save the information they want,"" Friedman explained.Privacy remains a critical consideration. Unlike cloud-based solutions that might compromise user data, these features operate entirely on-device, powered by the new Tensor G4 chip. ""We have a strong principle of processing everything on-device without sending information externally,"" Friedman emphasized, addressing potential user concerns transparently.The Details page now functions more like an intelligent assistant than a passive viewer. Action chips can extract specific information – a customer support email from a museum ticket, contact details from a screenshot, potential purchasing links. These weren't just conveniences; they were bridges between captured information and actionable experiences.Wallet integration adds practical utility, allowing users to instantly add tickets, boarding passes, and essential documents to Google Wallet . But it's more than a storage solution. The team was deliberate about maintaining user agency. ""We want to make sure the automation that we're doing helps achieve the user goal,"" Friedman noted.When questioned about potential redundancy with existing apps, like Photos, which already has some of the features that could have done the job, like natural language search, image sorting, and Lens integration, the team was clear. Screenshots serve a different purpose from photo collections. ""Users take photos for many different reasons, but screenshots are taken because users want to save some type of information and use it later,"" they explained.The current implementation is exclusive to the Pixel 9, a calculated approach to introducing AI capabilities responsibly. The device's processing capabilities allow for nuanced, on-device intelligence that older models cannot support, explained Friedman, when we asked that why this isn't available on older Pixel phones, which already have plenty of AI features.The long-term vision is thoughtful. Imagine screenshots that become contextually relevant years after capture – a restaurant recommendation resurfacing when you're in that city, or a forgotten contact detail emerging precisely when needed.In a world with overwhelming information, Pixel Screenshots offers a glimpse of technology that doesn't just digital fragments but makes them meaningfully accessible.As Friedman put it, the goal is creating an experience where things happen seamlessly in the background, personalizing your experience without requiring you to do anything different. ""Screenshots aren't just an app with a repository of information,"" Friedman asserted. ""It extends beyond the app into the operating system. It integrates into different surfaces where you are.""The most profound aspect of Pixel Screenshots isn't any single feature, but the underlying philosophy of device intelligence. Google's vision extends beyond mere screenshot management.""We're laying the groundwork for some incredible personal intelligence features,"" Friedman said, echoing the team's ambitious vision. The goal isn't just to organize screenshots but to create what he describes as a ""magical experience where things happen seamlessly in the background.""It's an ambitious vision, but a genuine attempt to understand and enhance how people interact with their digital lives. Pixel Screenshots' approach to our personal archival is a promising step towards a more intuitive digital ecosystem.","Google's Pixel Screenshots app is a new way to organize digital information. Users can now ask specific questions like ""What was Sam's Wi-Fi password?"" The app would scan through saved screenshots, extract relevant information, and provide answers alongside the source image.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116115610,imgsize-648638,width-400,resizemode-4/116115610.jpg"

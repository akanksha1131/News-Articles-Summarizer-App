Online speculation and streamer drama







Hasan Piker, the popular Twitch streamer and a political commentator has now responded to the backlash and criticism over the allegations that he used a shock collar on his dog, Kaya during a livestream. The controversy started after a clip a went viral in which Kaya was seen yelping. This prompted a speculation that Piker activate a shock collar when the camera as off. In a rather sarcastic tone, Piker said, “Yes, I am incredibly abusive… to the not only best trained, but also the best behaving and most spoiled dog on the planet. However, he later clarified that Kaya had yelped due to an accident. He said that the Kaya accidentally clipped herself while getting off from the bed and that is the reason for the yelping and not the shock collar.The viral backlash and criticism drew attention from PETA. The animal rights protection organisation issued a statement to The Hollywood Reporter and said, “Hasan Piker has denied using a shock collar on his dog, and we hope that’s true because shock collars are dangerous and downright cruel.Along with this, PETA also stressed on the fact that devices like a shock collar can cause burn wounds, displaced aggression and chronic anxiety.Instead of the extreme methods the organisation advise positive reinforcement training.Although Piker has dined the use of a shock collar on his dog, the critics still zoomed in on the now viral footage and pointed to a green blinking light on Kaya’s collar. This is an alleged characteristic of shock collars. Some also resurfaced an old clip where Piker described owning one as “incredibly effective,” fueling further skepticism. Fellow streamers joined the fray. Ethan Klein, a longtime rival, called the incident “horrifying animal cruelty,” while xQc accused Piker of “gaslighting” his audience.","Hasan Piker, the popular Twitch streamer and a political commentator has now responded to the backlash and criticism over the allegations that he used a shock collar on his dog.

AI chip company CEO on why US is falling behind China in AI race: Even if government wants to...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-chip-company-ceo-warns-us-is-falling-behind-china-in-ai-race-even-if-government-wants-to-/articleshow/124438794.cms,"Representative Image

“Our decentralised form of government has left us with sort of a patchwork of power infrastructures where even if the federal government wants to support you, their local regulations like at the city and county level of towns that can interfere with a project and set a project back, billions of dollars.

I think they have been able to, at a national level, stand up vast amounts of power, and they've done it by building massive dams, by burning coal, by doubling down on solar. But they have put together an extraordinary power infrastructure, and I think the plan benefited from some form of central decision-making.

We have a fragmented political system, but there is no reason why we should have local ordinances interfering with the development of power projects, with the development of data centers, the very sort of things that power big AI deployments. There's no reason we should have a patchwork of AI regulations, meaning that each company, like

Cerebras

or

OpenAI

, has to think differently in each state; that's just a tax on innovation.""

Cerebras CEO wants this AI bill to support companies



Croma 300W Soundbar Review: Theatre Experience Under Rs 10,000

""I think maybe a 5-year moratorium would be a nice starting point with an option to renew on five. I think industry is moving fast; this market is moving unbelievably quickly. I think we should do things that advantage our AI companies, both large and small. I don't think it's enough to advantage just the largest,”





Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman has claimed that China's centralised government is giving Beijing an advantage in a key part of the artificial intelligence (AI) race. The US decentralized system of local, state, and federal regulations creates obstacles for AI-related infrastructure projects, particularly in energy production and data center development. In an interview with Business Insider, the chief executive of the US-based AI training chip maker Feldman said China has been able to build extensive power infrastructure through central decision-making, including constructing dams, burning coal, and investing in solar energy.He said:Feldman also suggested that US shouldn't try to simply copy China's approach, but rather find better ways to support AI investments through the existing system.Feldman said a stay on state-level AI laws, similar to the one US senator Ted Cruz pushed unsuccessfully earlier this year, would be a helpful step. Cruz's initial policy, which was ultimately stripped out of US President Donald Trump 's ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" would have blocked state and local AI laws for a decade.Feldman added.As an AI training chipmaker, Cerebras is also involved in the AI race.The company had planned to go public but last week formally filed to withdraw its IPO. Feldman has said that Cerebras still intends to go public but wants to update its filing.","Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman claims China's centralised government is giving Beijing an advantage in the artificial intelligence (AI) race.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has launched Quick Suite, a rebooted artificial intelligence tool designed to compete with Microsoft’s 365 Copilot, Google’s Gemini, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT in the fast-growing enterprise AI market. The suite includes a chatbot and AI agents capable of tasks like analyzing sales data, generating reports, and summarizing content. Amazon’s Quick Suite costs $20 per user per month, and it can integrate with Salesforce Inc.’s (CRM) Slack and other tools from the company, as well as Microsoft’s cloud storage and Adobe Inc.’s tools.Julia White, AWS’s marketing chief, emphasized the tool’s readiness for workplace use, telling Bloomberg, “We are putting this out now because both internal and external customers are like, ‘This thing’s good, let’s go.’ ChatGPT is great, but, you know, you can’t use it at work.”The announcement comes as competition intensifies in the AI enterprise space. Earlier on October 9, Google introduced its Gemini Enterprise plan, priced at $30 per user per month for Standard and Plus tiers, and Gemini Business for startups at $21 per user per month. Microsoft’s 365 Copilot also targets enterprises at $30 per user per month. OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude offer enterprise tiers, though their pricing remains undisclosed.Amazon’s Quick Suite aims to capture businesses seeking secure, scalable AI solutions, positioning AWS as a formidable player in the corporate AI race.Gemini Enterprise builds on previous iterations of the company’s efforts to bring AI capabilities to businesses. But Google stressed that this shouldn’t be mistaken as a mere rebranding, despite the ever-changing and sometimes overlapping nomenclature used by its enterprise brand Google Workspace.","Amazon Web Services (AWS) has launched Quick Suite, a rebooted artificial intelligence tool.

Not about money, says Jan Koum





Jan Koum, the billionaire founder of WhatsApp, has filed a legal action in the Southern District of New York against renowned interior designer Remi Tessier, accusing him of exploiting him through inflated prices and undisclosed kickbacks. According to a report by the New York Post, Tessier, whose high-profile clients include billionaires Larry Ellison and Ken Griffin, is alleged to have engaged in a “pattern of predation” while designing five of Koum’s properties, including a $100 million Atherton compound and a $100 million Malibu mansion, as well as two 100-meter yachts valued at over $700 million combined.Court documents reveal Koum’s claims that Tessier misrepresented the value and origin of goods, such as passing off a lamp from RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) as custom-made. In one instance, Tessier allegedly claimed to have sourced “two dozen hand-knotted silk and pashmina carpets” from a high-end French manufacturer for €642,032 (approximately $75,000). The filings state the rugs were actually made of synthetic fibers, hand-loomed, and sourced from a different supplier, with their true value less than half of what was charged. Similar misrepresentations allegedly extended to items like steak knives and couches, allowing Tessier to pocket the difference.Koum further alleges that Tessier took a $600,000 backdoor payment from a gallery for a $7.8 million Picasso purchase, which the designer recommended without disclosing the commission. Another art-related kickback was reportedly sent to an offshore account in the British Virgin Islands.According to the report, Koum’s attorneys also claim that Tessier manipulated currency conversions between dollars and euros to siphon off additional profits.“ This has never been about personal gain — Jan has pledged to donate any recovery to charity in France — but about protecting others,” Koum’s attorney, Orin Snyder of Gibson Dunn, told the New York Post. Koum, whose net worth exceeds $17 billion per Forbes, plans to file a complaint in France to trigger a criminal investigation and is seeking discovery from Tessier for that proceeding. The filing notes that at least two other unnamed former clients have reportedly fired Tessier for similar reasons.Tessier, 61, denied the allegations, telling the New York Post, “I deny all allegations against me. I have always treated [Koum] with the highest respect and safeguarded his privacy. I am shocked that he has done this.”Koum’s legal team indicated they will pursue further action against Tessier in France for the alleged fraud, as the dispute between the billionaire and the elite designer unfolds.","Jan Koum, the billionaire founder of WhatsApp, has filed a legal action in the Southern District of New York against interior designer Remi Tessier.

Home Minister switches to ‘swadeshi’ email address

Government push fuels Zoho's growing adoption across India







Zoho co-founder Sridhar Vembu expressed heartfelt gratitude to Union Home Minister Amit Shah after the latter announced his switch to Zoho Mail, India's homegrown email platform. In an emotional response on X, Vembu dedicated the moment to engineers who chose to work from India despite opportunities abroad.""Thank you Sir, for your faith in us. I dedicate this moment to our hard-working engineers who have toiled hard in Zoho for over 20 years. They all stayed in India and worked all these years because they believed. Their faith is vindicated. Jai Hind, Jai Bharat,"" Vembu wrote.Shah's announcement came as a significant endorsement for the Chennai-based tech company. Sharing his new email address—amitshah.bjp@zohomail.in—on social media, the Home Minister requested all future correspondence be directed to his Zoho account, marking a symbolic shift away from global platforms like Gmail and Outlook.The move aligns with the government's broader push for digital sovereignty. IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw recently transitioned to Zoho's office suite, while the Ministry of Education has directed officials to adopt the company's productivity tools under the ""Strengthening Digital Sovereignty under Swadeshi Movement"" initiative.Zoho Mail, launched in 2008, offers secure, ad-free email hosting with encrypted transmission and two-factor authentication.Its servers are primarily hosted in India and the United States, appealing to organisations prioritising data protection and privacy.The government backing has yielded dramatic results beyond email. Zoho's messaging app Arattai witnessed explosive growth, with daily sign-ups surging from 3,000 to 350,000 in three days—a 100-fold increase following ministerial endorsements.For Vembu, Shah's adoption represents vindication of Zoho's two-decade commitment to building world-class technology from India. Founded in 1996, the company has maintained its ""built in India, for the world"" philosophy without seeking external venture capital, instead focusing on long-term talent development from rural India.The exchange between government and industry has resonated strongly with India's ""Make in India"" community, signaling the country's growing confidence in homegrown digital infrastructure.",Government push fuels Zoho's growing adoption across India.

Nikhil Kamath discloses $21 million cheque in smartphone maker Nothing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nikhil-kamath-discloses-21-million-cheque-in-smartphone-maker-nothing/articleshow/124429175.cms,"



Bengaluru: Zerodha cofounder Nikhil Kamath has disclosed that he invested $21 million (around Rs 187 crore in current exchange rate) in London-based consumer-tech company Nothing, founded by Carl Pei.The investment was part of the company’s $200 million Series C round announced last month, which valued Nothing at $1.3 billion. The round was led by Tiger Global, with participation from GV, Highland Europe, EQT, Latitude, I2BF, Tapestry and Qualcomm Ventures.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Kamath said he decided to back Nothing for its “design, community and software-first future,” adding that the company’s India-focused growth plans align with his vision of “India 2.0.” He wrote that investors should “back the founder who can build moats,” calling Pei’s conviction around design and ecosystem integration a key differentiator.Through a visual thread, Kamath explained his reasoning with data on the global smartphone market. He noted that 67-83% of flagship phone specifications remain unchanged across versions, and that users now upgrade every 3.5 years on average versus two years in 2015.In a $500-billion market dominated by legacy players like Apple and Samsung, Kamath said the next frontier of competition will be “taste” and distinct visual identity.Citing data from Counterpoint and IDC, he highlighted that India’s smartphone market grew 18% year-on-year in value in Q2 2025, driven by rising sales in the mid-premium and premium segments. “People buy with their eyes and scroll today,” he wrote, adding that younger consumers, who account for about half of India’s population, are shaping how brands build recognition and trust.","Zerodha cofounder Nikhil Kamath has disclosed that he invested $21 million in London-based consumer-tech company Nothing.

Next to it, a crowd of people is running away from the fire, leading to the middle. In the middle, hundreds of thousands of people in poverty are trying to get past a gigantic gate with a big dollar sign on it.

They are laughing, enjoying themselves, and dancing. The scene is detailed and impactful, highlighting the stark contrast and the direct connection between the different parts of the world.”





US authorities recently announced the arrest of Florida-based man Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, whom they suspect intentionally started the Palisades fire on New Year's Day that burned across Los Angeles' west side this year. The Department of Justice has charged Rinderknecht with “maliciously” starting the blaze. Federal prosecutors claimed that Rinderknecht, who is also an Uber driver, used ChatGPT both before and after allegedly setting the fire. According to authorities, Rinderknecht conducted several searches on the AI platform that they deemed incriminating. Additionally, prosecutors asserted that he used ChatGPT to conjure an image of a city engulfed in flames.According to a report by The San Francisco Standard, prosecutors noted that in one search after the fire had started, Rinderknecht asked ChatGPT:In a statement announcing the arrest, US Attorney Bill Essayli said:The initial fire, allegedly lit by Rinderknecht, appeared to have been extinguished but smouldered under vegetation and reignited later on. The fire resulted in 12 deaths and burned 6,000 buildings.The Los Angeles area was simultaneously affected by the Eaton fire, which killed 19 people and destroyed 9,400 structures. The complaint includes other digital evidence that allegedly incriminates Rinderknecht.According to the affidavit, he had been watching the video to a French song calledby Josman, in which the musician sets things on fire. In July, Rinderknecht also entered a prompt into ChatGPT to generate the image of a burning city, as per the affidavit.This is the prompt that Rinderknecht gave to ChatGPT:","Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, is accused of starting the Palisades fire on New Year's Day.

Video that may have led to dismissal of US diplomat







The US State Department has announced that it has fired a US diplomat after he admitted to having a romantic relationship with a Chinese woman who allegedly has ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The dismissal is believed to be the first of its kind for violating a ban on such relationships, which was instituted late last year under the Biden administration. A video related to the matter had been shared by activist James O’Keefe in August.Citing State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott as saying, the New York Post reported that President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio reviewed the case. They determined the diplomat was dismissed from the foreign service because he had “admitted concealing a romantic relationship with a Chinese national with known ties to the Chinese Communist Party.”“Under Secretary Rubio’s leadership, we will maintain a zero-tolerance policy for any employee who is caught undermining our country’s national security,” Pigott stated.While the State Department did not identify the diplomat, the case seems to have gained public attention after the diplomat and his girlfriend were featured in a video posted online by activist James O’Keefe.“I Defied My Government for Love”, the caption on the video shared by O’Keefe quoted a person, believed to be the same diplomat.He is seen admitting that “She Could Have Been A Spy.”“Her dad was either a provincial or a federal minister of education. So he's, like, straight up Communist Party. I was supposed to, whatever, sort of report what I knew about her, but I always thought that was kind of unfair,” the person said.The ban that led to the dismissal was imposed during the final days of Joe Biden's presidency, as reported by The Associated Press.

Intel chooses graphics over neural processors for AI muscle





Intel's newest processors are now into production and making a risky bet: that graphics chips, not specialised neural engines, are the future of AI computing. The Core Ultra series 3, codenamed Panther Lake, is the company's most aggressive performance leap in years—and a fundamental departure from how every chipmaker is approaching artificial intelligence.Doubling down on a controversial strategy: pumping AI horsepower through graphics chips rather than dedicated neural engines, Intel’s new Panther Lake chips show over 50% performance gains in both processing and graphics compared to current models. That’s early benchmarks though.Panther Lake runs on Intel's 18A process—the first 2-nanometer technology designed and manufactured entirely on American soil. Panther Lake rolled into production this week at Fab 52 in Chandler, Arizona.The new architecture squeezes 30% more transistors onto each chip while sipping 15% less power, thanks to RibbonFET transistors and a redesigned power delivery system that routes electricity through the chip's backside.CEO Lip-Bu Tan framed the milestone as existential for American tech leadership, part of Intel's $100 billion bet on domestic production.Fab 52 in Chandler represents the company's fifth major Arizona facility.Where every chipmaker is obsessing over neural processing units, Intel went a different direction. The company's new Xe 3 graphics architecture delivers 120 trillion operations per second for AI tasks—nearly double the previous generation. The NPU barely budged, inching from 48 to 50 TOPS.Panther Lake will power everything from laptops to industrial robots, and the first products will roll out in January 2026.Intel’s also making a 288-core server chip, dubbed Clearwater Forest, that’s made on the same 2-nanometer manufacturing process and is also launching next year.",Intel's new Panther Lake chips show over 50% performance gains in both processing and graphics compared to current models.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Google CEO Sundar Pichai appear to be aligned on one fundamental point regarding artificial intelligence –its immense and largely untapped potential. Musk recently responded to a social media post asserting that AI is in its initial stages and there’s so much to explore.“The craziest thing about AI is that we are still so early,” a user said. Musk replied, ""Yeah” and in a separate post, he said, “AI will get a billion times smarter.”This assessment of AI’s current state echoes comments made by Pichai earlier this year. Speaking in an interview with The Verge in May, Pichai drew a parallel between the rise of AI and the transformative eras of the internet and mobile technology.“Just imagine when the internet came, blogging became a thing. With mobile came cameras, and you could shoot and you could create videos.

“Glasses, which have long been seen as prosthetics and later as fashion accessories, are poised to become the central device in people’s lives, possibly replacing smartphones.

We could foresee in the near future hundreds of millions of smart glasses interconnected with each other, and with the people who wear them creating huge communities.”

Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

“We’re going to get to this point, probably sometime in the 2030s, where you have your phone with you, but it’s going to stay in your pocket more.”

“Only a collaborative model — a networked company — can maintain leadership in innovation and technology,”





EssilorLuxottica SA, the world’s largest eyewear manufacturer, is strengthening its presence in the growing smart glasses segment through a partnership with Meta, the parent company of Facebook . The collaboration focuses on producing and marketing AI-powered eyewear, which both companies see as an essential step in consumer technology. EssilorLuxottica, known for brands such as Ray-Ban, Oakley, and Persol, is combining its design and production experience with Meta’s technological strengths. The partnership aims to develop wearable devices that some industry observers believe could become as common as smartphones, such as the iPhone.At Bloomberg’s Italian-language podcast,EssilorLuxottica’s chairman and CEO, Francesco Milleri, said:Milleri also announced that the company is increasing its production capability for the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. This capacity is planned to reach 10 million units annually by the end of next year. This expanded production could also be utilised for other smart eyewear products, including EssilorLuxottica's Nuance Audio glasses, which incorporate hearing assistance technology.Last month, Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduced the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display, which includes a screen in the right lens that displays text messages, video calls, turn-by-turn directions, and visual results from queries to Meta's AI service.The display functions as a viewfinder for the camera on a user's phone and shows music playback information.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank JPMorgan has issued a stark warning about the AI risks facing the global markets. In an interview with BBC recently, Dimon said that he is “far more worried than others” about the AI-driven stock market bubble. His remarks come days after the Bank of England (BOE) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised concerns that current valuations in AI-based startups and companies look stretched and could echo the Dot com bubble of 90s.Talking about AI investment, he stated that it was “probable” that some investors would lose money.“The way I look at it is AI is real, AI in total will pay off. Just like cars in total paid off, and TVs in total paid off, but most people involved in them didn't do well,” adding that some of the money being invested in AI would “probably be lost”.Jamie Dimon also suggested that a market correction may happen within the next six months to two years. “I am far more worried about that than others,” Dimon said.During the interaction, Jamie Dimon pointed at risk factors including geopolitical volatility, fiscal strains on governments, and a remilitarisation drive.“All these things cause a lot of issues that we don't know how to answer,” he said adding “So I say the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds than what I would call normal.”Dimon’s warning underlines growing unease that the AI boom may be inflating into a bubble — one that could leave investors nursing heavy losses if it bursts.Notably, Jamie Dimon is not the only CEO who has raised concerns about the AI bubble. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has said that the current surge of investment in AI constitutes an ‘industrial bubble’.

What Chinese government said on TechInsights







China has placed a known Canadian research firm TechInsights on its Unreliable Entity List, effectively banning the teardown specialist from conducting business with organisations or individuals in the country. The move, announced in a statement on Thursday (October 9), is reportedly seen as retaliation for the firm’s role in exposing the inner workings and supply chain of Huawei’s advanced AI chips.Bloomberg reported that TechInsights, which specialises in detailed breakdowns to identify the parts and technology within electronic products, has been first to reveal undisclosed suppliers and components in high-profile Chinese hardware.The Canadian company’s investigative work has directly challenged Chinese technological claims:In 2023, a Bloomberg investigation conducted in partnership with TechInsights found that Huawei had successfully developed a made-in-China smartphone processor capable of competing with global firms like Qualcomm and Apple Just last week, the firm established that key components from non-Chinese suppliers, specifically Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Samsung and SK Hynix, were present in Huawei’s most advanced AI semiconductors.The Chinese ministry did not provide specific reasons for adding the analysis firm, but its action extends beyond the Canadian headquarters.“To safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and in accordance with the Foreign Trade Law of the People's Republic of China, the National Security Law of the People's Republic of China, the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law of the People's Republic of China, and other relevant laws, the Unreliable Entity List Working Mechanism has decided to add foreign entities, including Anti-UAV Technology Company, TechInsights, and its branches, to the Unreliable Entity List in accordance with Articles 2, 8, and 10 of the Unreliable Entity List Regulations,” it said.The Japanese, Korean, and European entities of TechInsights, along with its subsidiary Strategy Analytics, have also been placed on the entity list.A bunch of other companies, including some drone providers, were added to the list. The most notable inclusion among the latest additions is the London-based defense firm BAE Systems Plc., a major name associated with Europe’s defense industry upgrades following the Russia-Ukraine war.","Canadian research firm TechInsights has been placed on China's Unreliable Entity List.

Elon Musk’s population warning





Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a bold prediction in August this year. Sharing a post on X (formerly Twitter), Musk said that artificial intelligence (AI) will increase the birth rate. “AI is obviously gonna one-shot the human limbic system,” he then wrote in the post, adding “That said, I predict – counter-intuitively – that it will *increase* the birth rate! Mark my words. ” “Also, we’re gonna program it that way,” the tech billionaire wrote.Elon Musk has been raising concerns over declining population growth and birth rates in countries across the globe. In a previous post, the Tesla CEO said that “low birth rate is the number one threat to the West, followed closely by immigration. There will be no West if this continues”. He also warned about Japan losing nearly a million people by the end of 2025.As mentioned above, he has repeatedly warned about population collapse, saying it is the real existential threat to civilization. Musk earlier argued that declining birth rates could lead to economic stagnation, labour shortages, and even civilizational decline if not addressed.“Most people still think the world is overpopulated,” Musk said in earlier interviews. “It’s actually the opposite.”Japan has been the focal point for population collapse, but Elon Musk’s warning also applies to other nations such as South Korea, Italy and parts of Eastern Europe as they are also facing similar trends. This issue of population collapse has also sparked the interests of pro-natalist policies, immigration reform, and even the role of AI and robotics in offsetting labor gaps.","Elon Musk has been raising concerns over declining population growth and birth rates in countries across the globe.

Platform revokes vendor access, works with law enforcement





Discord has identified approximately 70,000 users whose government-issued ID photos may have been exposed following a security incident involving a third-party customer service provider. The breach, discovered in late September, targeted the platform's age verification system used to review appeals from users.The San Francisco-based company emphasised this was not a direct breach of Discord's systems, but rather a compromise of an external vendor supporting customer service operations. Affected users have been contacted via email from noreply@discord.com, with Discord clarifying it will not reach out by phone regarding this incident.The unauthorised party targeted the customer support services to access user data with the intention of extorting a financial ransom from Discord. Claims circulating online suggest attackers possess significantly more data than Discord has acknowledged, but the company maintains these numbers are inflated as part of the extortion scheme.Compromised information may include usernames, email addresses, contact details, limited billing information including the last four digits of credit cards, IP addresses, and messages exchanged with customer service agents.Full credit card numbers, passwords, and Discord messages beyond customer support conversations were not accessed.Discord immediately revoked the customer support provider's access to its ticketing system upon discovering the attack. The company has engaged a leading computer forensics firm to support investigation and remediation efforts while working closely with law enforcement and data protection authorities.Discord, which boasts more than 200 million users worldwide, serves as a messaging platform popular with gamers for chatting and sharing files within the gaming community.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

China wants export control guarantees on lines of Wassenaar Arrangement





China has tightened its rare earth export controls, expanding restrictions on processing technology and spelling out its intention to limit exports to overseas defence and semiconductor users. From India, China is reportedly seeking guarantees that the heavy rare earth magnets supplied by it will not be re-exported to the US and will be used only to meet local needs. China produces over 90% of the world's processed rare Earths and rare Earth magnets. These 17 rare Earth elements are said to be key component in products ranging from EVs to aircraft engines and military radars.According to a report in Economic Times, China wants to ensure that the heavy rare earth magnets supplied to India do not reach the US. The report quotes a person aware of the matter. The Indian government is said to have so far not agreed to such a request yet.“Our understanding is that China is looking at some deal with the US on heavy rare earth magnets and is unwilling to release supplies without a guarantee that there will not be any diversion,” a second person in the know said.China is also said to be planning to expand restrictions on exporting technology to make rare Earth magnets to more types of magnets.The export restrictions on rare Earth magnets are said to be a major bargaining chip for China in its trade talks with the United States. The tightening of controls comes weeks ahead of a face-to-face meeting between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea.Indian companies have also submitted end-user certificates stating that rare Earth magnets will not be used for manufacturing any weapons of mass destruction. Beijing is also reported to have sought export control guarantees on the lines of the Wassenaar Arrangement.

Allegations of self-interest and lowball pricing



Microsoft cleared, but not entirely unscathed







A Delaware judge has ruled that the top executives at Activision Blizzard including the former CEO Bobby Kotick must face a shareholder lawsuit alleging that they charted investors during the company’s $75.4 billion acquisition by Microsoft. However, the court has dismissed the claims that Microsoft aided in the alleged misconduct. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Chancery Court in an 83-page decision said that the shareholders can pursue their ‘core’ claim that Kotick and other directors breached their iduciary duties by prioritizing personal interests over shareholder value.The lawsuit filed by a Swedish pension fund Sjunde AP-Fonden accused Kotick od rushing into the merger in order to secure his position and $400 million in change-of-control benefits, while shielding himself from fallout over sexual harassment allegations at Activision. The shareholders argued that the $95 per share deal undervalued the company, mainly as Activision’s performance improved during the 21-month regulatory approval process before the merger closed in October 2023.McCormick found it “reasonably conceivable” that Kotick manipulated the sale process to favor Microsoft, which offered “speed, deal certainty, and—inferably—a friendly landing place.”The judge has however dismissed claims that Microsoft aided and abetted alleged breaches, but noticed that the tech giant may have “passively stood by” as they occurred. All the other claims against Activision defendants were also dismissed.“Litigation on the merits of a trimmed-down version of the plaintiff’s complaint can now launch,” McCormick wrote. “Game on.”","A Delaware judge has ruled that the top executives at Activision Blizzard including the former CEO Bobby Kotick must face a shareholder lawsuit.

The tech billionaire responded to the viral video. Srinivas reported the video on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) with a blunt warning: ‘Absolutely don’t do this’.The controversy started when a developer named Amrit Nigam shared a 16-second video on the Comet AI completing a 45-minute assignment from Coursera’s “AI Ethics, Responsibility and Creativity” course. Using a single prompt ‘Complete the assignment’ and the AI tool answered all the 12 questions in seconds prompting Nigam to boast about it by sharing it on X. Nigam wrote, ‘Just completed my Coursera course,’ while tagging Srinivas and Perplexity.The irony of using AI to shortcut a course on AI ethics wasn’t lost on social media. Srinivas’s reply quickly went viral and shared a debate around the role of AI in education and ethics of automation. “The very purpose of education is lost here. Please give the certificate to Comet,” one user quipped.

This is with respect to the media reports published on 8th October 2025 regarding a show cause notice issued by Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) for Rs 415 crore to Infosys over alleged ineligible ITC refunds. The Company would like to clarify on this matter:

DGGI had in May 2025 sought information on the GST refunds claimed by the Company. The Company had provided to DGGI the relevant information and also had meetings with the DGGI officials on this matter.



DGGI issued a pre-show cause on 30th July 2025 for which the company had sought additional information/ relevant documents and sought time to file suitable response to the pre-show cause.



DGGI did not provide the additional time requested and instead issued a show cause notice on 12th August 2025 for Rs 414.88 Crores excluding interest and penalties.



As per the show cause notice from DGGI, the services provided by the company’s overseas branches are not export of services and hence the refund claimed by the Company is allegedly erroneous.



The Company has assessed the merits of the show cause notice and also sought advice from external tax consultants and legal counsels. Pursuant to the advice, the Company has on 19th September 2025, filed a Writ Petition in the Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka challenging the legitimacy of the show cause notice.



There is no tax demand as on date against the Company regarding this matter. The Company would like to reiterate that it has always been fully compliant with all the central and state laws and regulations with respect to GST refunds.





There is no material impact of this article on the Company. Please note that the Company submits the requisite disclosures to the Stock Exchanges and shall continue to do so as part of its obligation under Regulation 30 of the SEBI Listing Regulations or other relevant applicable laws.

In a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Gerber has blasted both the models and CEO Elon Musk . So much so that the Tesla bull claimed in an X post that the “CEO killed that car”. “If you buy this car, cheap model Y/3, you will lose money,” Gerber warns, adding “They (Tesla) will lower the price soon and you just paid $5 k too much.” He further advises Tesla fans to “Only lease new teslas.

New York City has filed a lawsuit against Facebook Snapchat , TikTok and other social media giants, claiming that these platforms have fueled mental health crisis among children.

The lawsuit naming Facebook-parent Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, Snapchat-parent Snap and TikTok owner Bytedance among others, says that the platforms’ algorithms are intentionally designed to maximize engagement to intentionally exploit the psychology of young users to keep them hooked.The lawsuit said that 77.3% of New York City high school students admitted to spending three or more hours a day on “screen time” leading to sleep loss and chronic school absence.""Social media use by teens has recently been implicated in alarming increases in dangerous and even deadly off-campus activity in New York City,"" the lawsuit alleges. ""One such dangerous type of conduct known to be spreading through viral social media posts is 'subway surfing.'""The lawsuit cites data by the NYC Police Department which shows that at least 16 teens have died in such incidents since 2023, including two girls aged 12 and 13.New York City joined other governments, school districts and individuals pursuing about 2,050 similar lawsuits in nationwide litigation in Oakland, California.

AMD CEO Lisa Su on AI boom





US chipmaker AMD and OpenAI recently announced a 6 gigawatt agreement to power the AI company’s next-generation AI infrastructure across multiple generations of AMD Instinct GPUs, making it one of the largest infrastructure deals to date. Under the partnership, the first 1 gigawatt deployment of AMD Instinct MI450 GPUs is set to begin in the second half of 2026. Speaking with Yahoo Finance recently, AMD CEO Lisa Su said that the company is “investing at the right pace because we want to accelerate ... this is a place where [and] when companies and partners make bold moves, it will be rewarded.”After the AMD-OpenAI partnership announcement, AMD shares jumped by as much as 35% earlier this week. The deal holds notable significance for AMD which has spent the past two years trying to chip away at Nvidia's AI GPU dominance. Currently, the Jensen Huang-led chip company holds 90% of the market share.Commenting on the partnership, Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley said the deal ""is designed to be mutually beneficial,"" but is also aimed at ""driving the stock higher.""Citi analyst Atif Malik stated that the announcement will also benefit other AI players,including Astera Labs (ALAB), which supplies networking infrastructure tied to AMD's new Helios platform.""We see the news positively for ALAB as it is a leader in open AI networking ecosystems,"" Malik wrote.During the interaction, Lisa Su was asked about concerns that massive AI investments may be getting ahead of themselves.

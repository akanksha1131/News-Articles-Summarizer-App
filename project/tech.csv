US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

Policy should attract global talent while protecting wages







Box CEO Aaron Levie is pushing back against President Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, warning the policy will give large tech companies an unfair advantage over cash-strapped startups in the competition for global talent. Speaking on ""The A16z Podcast"" alongside Andreessen Horowitz partners, Levie argued that the steep fee structure essentially turns international hiring into ""a spending game"" that smaller companies cannot win. The new policy, which takes effect September 21, represents a dramatic jump from current fees of $2,000 to $5,000.The Box CEO endorsed a significantly lower $20,000 fee proposed by Khosla Ventures' Keith Rabois, saying this amount wouldn't prevent smaller companies from competing for skilled workers. Startup founders have already told Business Insider that Trump's fee could ""kneecap their hiring in the talent wars,"" sending international workers to Big Tech companies that can more easily absorb the costs.The concerns extend beyond Silicon Valley's startup ecosystem. Billionaire investor Michael Moritz, whose portfolio includes Google and PayPal, has warned the policy could backfire by pushing tech innovation overseas, as skilled engineers can now work remotely from countries like India and Eastern Europe.Beyond the fee structure, Levie outlined a broader six-point framework for H-1B reform. He called for flexible visa caps that respond to actual talent availability, potentially ranging from 5,000 to 80,000 visas annually. ""There's not a fixed number of the world's best talent,"" he explained.His proposal emphasizes attracting ""the absolute best in the world"" while ensuring H-1B programs lift rather than suppress American wages. Levie warned against excluding junior-level international talent, citing examples like state school Master's graduates becoming AI engineers as ""positive sum"" contributors to the economy.The debate highlights broader questions about America's competitive edge in attracting global talent, particularly given that successful immigrant executives like Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Google's Sundar Pichai have become symbols of the H-1B program's potential benefits.","Box CEO Aaron Levie is pushing back against President Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee.

Monaco oversaw Trump election interference investigations







President Donald Trump on Friday called for Microsoft to immediately terminate Lisa Monaco, the company's president of global affairs and former deputy attorney general under President Biden, escalating his retribution campaign against officials who oversaw federal investigations into his conduct.Trump posted on Truth Social that Monaco is ""a menace to US National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government,"" and argued that Microsoft should ""immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco."" Microsoft declined to comment on Trump's demand.Monaco served as deputy attorney general in the Biden administration and helped coordinate the Justice Department's response to the January 6, 2021, attacks by Trump supporters on the US Capitol. She joined Microsoft in July to lead the firm's engagements with governments globally, according to her LinkedIn profile.Monaco's security clearances were revoked by Trump in February, and Trump claimed that the US government has banned her from all federal properties because of ""Monaco's many wrongful acts."" In March, Trump had signed an executive order rescinding Monaco's security clearance, along with those of Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Liz Cheney and others.The request appeared on Trump's Truth Social account one day after former FBI Director James Comey was indicted. Trump suggested that more political adversaries would face prosecution, telling reporters: ""I think there will be others"" but said he did not have a list.Monaco's appointment to Microsoft in July had gone largely unnoticed until Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo highlighted her hiring Friday morning. The timing suggests Trump may have only recently become aware of her corporate role, according to political observers.Since Trump returned to office in January, he has already forced Intel's CEO to step down before later praising him, and successfully pressured Disney's ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show for several days.",President Donald Trump called for Microsoft to terminate Lisa Monaco.

US to Chipmakers: Produce one chip in America for every import or face…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-to-chipmakers-produce-one-chip-in-america-for-every-import-or-face/articleshow/124164823.cms,"Policy aims to reduce foreign semiconductor dependence



Implementation challenges could benefit established US chipmakers





The Trump administration is developing a policy requiring semiconductor companies to match their domestic chip production with the volume their customers import from overseas, or face tariffs of up to 100%, according to a Wall Street Journal report. .Under the proposed rule, chipmakers would need to maintain a 1:1 ratio between US-made semiconductors and imported chips over time. Companies failing to meet this requirement would be subject to substantial import duties, potentially reaching 100% of the chip's value.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has reportedly presented the proposal to semiconductor industry executives, framing it as essential for national economic security. The plan represents President Trump's continued push to reshore critical manufacturing capabilities following his earlier tariff threats against the chip industry.""America cannot be reliant on foreign imports for the semiconductor products that are essential for our national and economic security,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told the WSJ, though he cautioned that policy reporting should be considered speculative until officially announced.The proposal includes provisions for companies committing to build new US facilities. These firms would receive ""credit"" for their pledged production volume, allowing continued tariff-free imports during construction phases with additional transitional support during capacity ramp-up.Industry analysts note significant implementation hurdles, particularly in tracking chip origins across complex global supply chains and accounting for varying chip complexities and values. The policy doesn't address how different types of semiconductors—from simple components to advanced AI accelerators—would be counted equally.Companies with existing US manufacturing capacity, including Intel, GlobalFoundries, and TSMC's Arizona operations, could benefit from the policy. GlobalFoundries and Intel shares both rose 5% following the WSJ report.""The 1:1 rule would be very difficult to implement and would likely take many years,"" said Gabelli Funds portfolio manager John Belton.","Proposed rule would require companies to match domestic production with imported chips.

Jamie Dimon calls $100,000 H-1B fee hike a ‘shock’



TikTok Deal Explained: Trump, China & The Algorithm Battle





JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning to US crypto investors. The CEO of one of the world’s most prominent banking institutions has cautioned that if inflation persists, the US Federal Reserve may be unable to cut interest rates, which could drive traders out of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Dimon's comments come as the Bitcoin price has dropped to nearly $111,000 following the Fed's recent decision to cut rates.Dimon said in a recent interview with CNBC TV-18. Dimon noted thatand suggested that he also has arguments for it to increase rather than decrease. Continued high inflation and a lack of further rate cuts could significantly affect the crypto market. This comes after the US Federal Reserve lowered rates by 25 basis points last week, marking the first rate cut in 2025. Although this move briefly lifted Bitcoin’s price, it did not help the cryptocurrency surpass $100,000 late last year.Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump announced a new policy imposing a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B visa applications. The rule, which took effect on September 21 is expected to significantly affect employers’ ability to hire highly skilled foreign workers through the program. Under the new rule, companies must now pay a one-time fee of $100,000 for each new application, compared to the earlier cost of $2,000 to $5,000, depending on the employer's size.Responding to the announcement, Dimon said that the increased fee is a “shock,” and warned that it could hinder the inflow of foreign talent into the US. He said the decision ""came out of the blue,"" and noted that JPMorgan would be ""engaging with stakeholders and policymakers"" on the issue.He emphasised the importance of visas for the company, explaining: “We move people around globally—experts who get promoted to new jobs in different markets,” while stressing that immigration remains one of America’s “core strengths.”","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning to US crypto investors.

My favourite ChatGPT feature so far: Sam Altman introduces user insights tool Pulse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/my-favourite-chatgpt-feature-so-far-sam-altman-introduces-user-insights-tool-pulse/articleshow/124164625.cms,"Representative Image

What Sam Altman said about ChatGPT’s new Pulse tool



“Today we are launching my favorite feature of ChatGPT so far, called Pulse. It is initially available to Pro subscribers.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Pulse works for you overnight, and keeps thinking about your interests, your connected data, your recent chats, and more. Every morning, you get a custom-generated set of stuff you might be interested in.

It performs super well if you tell ChatGPT more about what's important to you. In regular chat, you could mention “I’d like to go visit Bora Bora someday” or “My kid is 6 months old and I’m interested in developmental milestones” and in the future you might get useful updates.

Think of treating ChatGPT like a super-competent personal assistant: sometimes you ask for things you need in the moment, but if you share general preferences, it will do a good job for you proactively.

This also points to what I believe is the future of ChatGPT: a shift from being all reactive to being significantly proactive, and extremely personalized.

This is an early look, and right now only available to Pro subscribers. We will work hard to improve the quality over time and to find a way to bring it to Plus subscribers too.

Huge congrats to @ChristinaHartW, @_samirism, and the team for building this.”

How ChatGPT’s Pulse feature works and other things you should know



""Pulse is just the beginning. Over time, ChatGPT will evolve from something you consult into something that quietly accelerates the work and ideas that matter to you,”

Read Google’s full ‘urgent’ memo to H-1B visa holders

We are reaching out with an urgent update regarding international travel for individuals on H-1B visas.

A Proclamation is scheduled to take effect this Sunday at 12:01 AM ET. It introduces significant changes to re-entry procedures for H-1B visa holders currently outside the United States. We continue to review the Proclamation, but the initial advice we have received is that re-entry will require a mandatory payment of $100,000 per petition, which may cause substantial delays or prevent re-entry to the US

What You Need to Know:

If you are currently outside the US:

If you are currently outside the US with a valid H-1B visa, make plans to return and enter the US before the Proclamation takes effect on Sunday, September 21 at 12:01 am ET (i.e. by this Saturday night).

If you are currently in the US:

We strongly advise against any international travel if you are in valid H-1B status or need to travel to activate your H-1B visa. You should remain in the US

Departing the US may result in complications or denial of re-entry under the new policy.

If you are unable to return prior to the deadline in H-1B status: please reach out to go/immigration-help.

We understand this may create challenges, and we are here to support you. We are actively monitoring the situation and will keep you updated as we learn more.

Should you do an MBA? My views👇🏼

Most MBAs are outdated 🤷🏼

Better to learn how to build Products,

Best training ground if you want to accelerate your career or run a company one day.

That’s how I started. As a Product Manager.

Case studies and frameworks are nice, but they don’t teach you how to,

- Question the status quo

- Build deep empathy for customers

- Pursue global optima, not local wins

- Influence without authority

- Work backwards from the end state

That’s a Builder’s life.

It’s messy, political, creative, analytical — all at once.

A microcosm of real life, not classroom fluff.

That’s what helped me build companies, not the three-letter degree, although I do have one 🙈

So I tell young students & professionals to do an MBA, but a different kind. Do a Masters in Building Awesome things and you will graduate, not in 2 yrs, but every day 👨🏼‍🎓😎

Be a PM, Product Engineer, Product Designer, AI Builder, Hardware Designer, Robotics Engineer ….. heck, even a Toy Designer!

Because the 21st century will be led by builders who can also tell great stories 💪🏼

P:S - If you MUST do a top-tier MBA. Or hide for a few months & learn how to build, esp with AI 🤷🏼

Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus is facing mounting pressure after a 13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and caused 600 triple-zero calls to fail across multiple states. The September 19 network failure has prompted government investigations and renewed calls for accountability from the embattled telco.The outage primarily affected South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, with some impact also recorded in far western New South Wales near the SA border, according to Reuters reporting. CEO Stephen Rue confirmed that established processes were not followed during a network firewall upgrade that began at 12:30 AM Thursday and lasted until approximately 1:30 PM (local time).Four deaths have been linked to the incident, though South Australian police later clarified that an eight-week-old boy's death in Gawler West was ""unlikely"" to have been caused by the outage delay. A 68-year-old Adelaide woman and two men aged 74 and 49 in Perth remain connected to the emergency services failure.The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) reported that Optus received multiple customer complaints about the triple-zero failure as early as 9 AM Thursday, with five customers contacting the call center about the outage.However, these concerns were not properly escalated, and government authorities weren't informed until after the issue was resolved.Communications Minister Anika Wells expressed ""unbelievable disappointment"" that Australia was ""here again so quickly,"" referencing a similar 2023 incident. The Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA) chair Nerida O'Loughlin revealed her agency wasn't notified until more than 10 hours after the outage began, contrary to standard protocols.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years. The company was fined A$12 million in 2023 for failing to provide emergency call services to thousands during a nationwide outage and subsequently failing to conduct required welfare checks.The telecommunications giant, owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has faced a series of crises including a 2022 cyberattack affecting 9.5 million Australians and the 2023 outage that led to former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin's resignation. Current CEO Stephen Rue took over in November 2024.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking from New York, declined to say whether Rue should resign but indicated the government has ""action at its disposal"" pending investigation results. ACMA has launched a formal investigation, with Optus potentially facing fines exceeding $10 million and additional penalties.The company has promised full cooperation with all investigations while conducting its own internal review, with results to be made public.",13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and 600 triple-zero calls to fail.

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

A side door for skilled professionals



Pros and cons of O-1B visa



The advantages of O-1B visa include:

No lottery or annual cap

Faster processing available

Renewable indefinitely

The drawbacks of O-1B visa are:

More subjective than H-1B, requiring proof of “extraordinary ability”

Some employers hesitate due to uncertainty in approval

Application costs can be higher than pre-hike H-1B fees

Some real world examples of O-1B visa



Entrepreneurs like Soundarya Balasubramani, who launched an educational venture in the U.S., are among the new wave of Indian applicants using the O-1 to bypass the H-1B bottleneck. “I got my O-1A approved as the solo founder and 100% owner of an educational venture,” she told ET.

Karan Vaidya, cofounder of AI startup Composio, said his O-1 visa cost less than $10,000 including legal fees, and praised its flexibility: “It’s a three-year visa that can be renewed indefinitely. I’m on my fifth O-1 now.”





US President Donald Trump’s executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee from $10,000 to $1,00,000 sent shockwaves in the tech industry. Due to the announcement last week many tech giants called back their professionals with H-1B visa back to the US. As the scrutiny around the traditional H-1B visa pathway making the process unpredictable, the skilled professionals are now planing to turn towards O-1 visa a lesser known route. The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.For those unaware, the O-1 Visa is introduced under the Immigration Act of 1990. The O-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields of education, science, athletics or arts. It enable the recipients to work in the US for up to three years and comes with unlimited renewals. The applicants of the O-1 visa much demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and meet atleast three out of the eight criteria:After the unpredictable nature of popular H-1B visa, the O-1 visa is gaining a lot of traction among Indians who wish to go and work in the US. As per the report by Economic Times, Indian were granted 487 O-1A visas in FY 2020, this number was increased to 1,418 in FY 2023. With this increase, India became the third largest recipient of O-1 visa after UK and Brazil.Unlike the popularly H-1B visa which is capped at 85,000 visas annually and allocated via a lottery, the O-1 visa has no cap and the applications for it are accepted around the year. The applicants can also expedite the application process by submitting additional fees.Immigration consultant and O-1 holder Logan Ullyott told Business Insider: “The O-1 is an occupation-agnostic visa. You could get it if you’re an engineer, a researcher, an influencer, or even a cook — as long as you can prove you’re at the top of your field.”","The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.

I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger.

Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21. Now, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has also issued a piece of advice to Indian techies ‘come back to India to rebuild’. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Vemu drew parallel with the Partition of India in order to explain the current H-1B situation.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk responds



Political leaders weigh in







An ABC spokesperson recently confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely. The company decided to take the decision after the host of the show Jimmy Kimmel made some controversial comments on Charlie Kirk, linking his alleged killer to President Trump’s MAGA movement. MAGA – short for Make America Great Again is a political slogan, popularized by President Donald Trump during his election campaigns. During the late-night show, Kimmel made sharp comments stating that the MAGA gang is “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.Actor and filmmaker Ben Stiller was among the celebrities who has publicly defended Kimmel and has criticised the decision of ABC. In s post shared on social media platform X, Stiller wrote, “This isn’t right”.His brief but pointed reaction quickly went viral, with many fans and fellow entertainers echoing his sentiment that the suspension undermines free expression in comedy.Commenting on Ben Stiller’s post, Elon Musk supported the decision made by ABC and wrote, “He went full retard. Never go full retard.”This is not the first time that Musk has reacted to the controversy.Earlier this week after the Kimmel’s video clip from the show went viral, Musk said, “Jimmy Kimmel is disgusting”.The California Governor Gavin Newsom has also blasted the decision and has accused Republicans of orchestrating censorship. “They are censoring you in real time. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous,” wrote Newsom on X.On the other hand, commentator Davis Sirota suggested corporate politics were at play, noting that Nexstar, which has ties to ABC, is seeking regulatory approvals from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the suspension on Truth Social, calling it “Great News for America” and labeling Kimmel “ratings challenged” with “zero talent.”","ABC confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely.

How US secret service found out about the telecom hacking network



“It can’t be understated what this system is capable of doing. It can take down cell towers, so then no longer can people communicate, right? …. You can’t text message, you can’t use your cell phone. And if you coupled that with some sort of other event associated with UNGA, you know, use your imagination there, it could be catastrophic to the city.”

“We need to do forensics on 100,000 cell phones, essentially all the phone calls, all the text messages, anything to do with communications, see where those numbers end up,”

“The US Secret Service’s protective mission is all about prevention, and this investigation makes it clear to potential bad actors that imminent threats to our protectees will be immediately investigated, tracked down and dismantled,”

“Could there be others? It’d be unwise to think that there’s not other networks out there being made in other cities in the United States,”

TikTok Deal Explained: Trump, China & The Algorithm Battle





The US Secret Service has reportedly dismantled a hidden, massive telecom hacker network near New York City that investigators say could have crippled cell towers and jammed 911 calls during the United Nations (UN) General Assembly. The takedown occurred as nearly 150 world leaders prepared to gather in Manhattan, a report claims. Investigators uncovered a cache of more than 300 SIM servers, each containing over 100,000 SIM cards, clustered within a 35-mile radius of the UN. Officials have warned that this system represents one of the most significant communication threats found on US soil and could have disrupted cellular service, potentially blacking out communication and impacting daily life and emergency response efforts. The incident highlights a new security risk targeting the ""invisible infrastructure"" of modern, connected cities.According to a report by the news agency Associated Press, investigators revealed that the network was uncovered during a broader Secret Service probe into telecom threats targeting senior government officials. Spread across several sites, the servers acted like clusters of fake cellphones, capable of sending mass calls and texts, disrupting local networks, and concealing criminals’ encrypted communications, officials said.In a statement, Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service’s New York field office said:However, officials said they have not found any direct plan to disrupt the UN General Assembly and emphasised that no credible threats to New York City have been identified.McCool added that forensic analysis is still in its early stages. Yet, agents suspect nation-state actors that are linked to certain countries used the system to transmit encrypted messages to organised crime groups, cartels, and terrorist organisations. Authorities have not yet revealed which governments or criminal networks were involved.McCool added, suggesting that the process will take time.Investigators found over 100,000 active SIM cards and equipment capable of scaling the network’s size. McCool said the operation, costing millions, could send up to 30 million texts per minute.Sean Curran, the agency’s director, highlighted.Officials also warned the network could have triggered cellphone blackouts like those after 9/11 or the Boston Marathon bombing, with attackers able to cause such outages at will.McCool noted.","Investigators found over 100,000 active SIM cards and equipment capable of scaling the network’s size.

“This deal will allow for the US to control the app’s algorithm. It’s actually going to be American-operated all the way,”

“We want the business to make decisions about content based on the interest of the business and based on the interest of the users, and that’s what we think will happen,”

What Donald Trump said about the TikTok agreement







“This is going to be American-operated all the way. I have great respect for President Xi, and I very much appreciate that he approved the deal, because to get it done properly, we really needed the support of China and the approval of China.”

“I always like MAGA-related. If I could make it 100% MAGA, I would, but it’s not going to work out that way, unfortunately. No, everyone’s going to be treated fairly. Every group, every philosophy, every policy will be treated very fairly,”

Who will own TikTok’s US division











Donald Trump has signed an executive order that clears the way for a deal that would put the popular social media platform TikTok under US control. Vice President JD Vance asserted that the agreement gives Americans authority over TikTok's valuable algorithm, the system that dictates content for over 170 million U.S. users. Speaking from the Oval Office, where the executive order was signed, Vance estimated the value of TikTok's US assets to be $14 billion, which is significantly lower than earlier estimates that valued the company's assets at up to $100 billion, depending on access to the algorithm. The deal sets the stage for some of the president's closest billionaire allies to take control of the platform.Vance said.he added, highlighting how businesses can boost the app’s content decisions.During the signing of the agreement, Trump said,Trump framed the signing as part of his trade agenda, but concerns remain about his allies controlling a platform that shapes US political discourse.Trump jokingly said about algorithmic favouritism.The signing also sets the stage for Trump’s first in-person meeting with Xi at the upcoming APEC Summit in South Korea.The ownership structure is still being worked out. However, Trump revealed that Oracle and its cofounder, Larry Ellison, would play a “big” role in running TikTok, as Oracle already handles much of the app’s US data storage.Trump also stated that conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who owns Fox Corporation and Fox News, would be an investor, while tech billionaire Michael Dell would hold a board seat. He hinted at three additional “blue-chip” backers, though their names have not been disclosed.For Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, a stake in TikTok could help reach younger audiences beyond traditional TV and print, where their News Corp. empire dominates—and possibly make up for the failed MySpace acquisition nearly two decades ago.Fox’s role remains uncertain, but a TikTok deal would add to the Murdochs’ existing minority stakes in betting firms Flutter and FanDuel, while reinforcing Lachlan’s succession following a recent family trust restructuring that secured him control of the empire.","Donald Trump has signed an executive order that clears the way for a deal that would put the popular social media platform TikTok under US control.

Apple’s response to the lawsuit over delayed Siri features





Apple has asked a US court to dismiss a consolidated class action lawsuit over delayed Siri features, reports MacRumours citing court documents reviewed by it. The lawsuit claims that Apple misled customers with marketing for the iPhone 16, which promoted upcoming Siri features powered by Apple Intelligence. Plaintiffs said they would not have purchased the iPhone 16, or would have paid less, if they had known the features would be delayed.The case, Landsheft v. Apple Inc., is being heard in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.Apple’s lawyers argued that the lawsuit is unfounded because only two Siri features—contextual awareness and in-app controls—were delayed. “Plaintiffs complain about the timing of release of two features, despite the near-two dozen Apple Intelligence features that have already been delivered,” the lawyers said. “This limited delay cannot support Plaintiffs' sweeping claims.”The lawyers also said the delayed features do not amount to a breach of warranty.“By purchasing an iPhone 16, all of the plaintiffs have benefitted from camera improvements, enhanced silicon and increased performance, upgraded displays, and numerous other hardware and software improvements, including more than 20 Apple Intelligence features that were already available prior to the lawsuit,” they added.Apple first announced the personalized Siri features at its WWDC 2024 keynote, highlighting better understanding of a user’s personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. The company later said in March that the features would be delayed, with CEO Tim Cook noting in July that Apple was “making good progress” and aimed to release them “next year.”Apple advertised the features through product presentations, its website, and a TV commercial featuring actor Bella Ramsey. The company is reportedly planning to release the features in iOS 26.4, expected in March or April 2026.","Apple has asked a US court to dismiss a consolidated class action lawsuit over delayed Siri features.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has advised applicants to carefully complete Form I-485, warning that errors or omissions could result in visa rejection or processing delays. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the immigration authority said “Applicants MUST properly complete Form I-485 per the form instructions.” “We highlight the public charge inadmissibility section in Part 9 of Form I-485, as some applicants have failed to fully respond to all required questions. Failure to comply may result in rejection or delays,” it further clarified.Form I-485, also called the “Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status,” is the form used by individuals in the United States to apply for a green card. It allows eligible applicants to adjust their immigration status from a temporary visa or nonimmigrant status to lawful permanent resident.The form collects personal information, background details, and financial information, including the public charge section, to determine eligibility for permanent residency. Completing Form I-485 accurately and fully is crucial, as mistakes or omissions can result in delays, requests for additional evidence, or even rejection of the application.In the post, USCIS noted that incomplete responses in this section are a common reason for delayed or rejected applications.Immigration experts stressed the importance of carefully reviewing all sections of the form. “Even small mistakes or omissions can cause significant setbacks in processing,” said an immigration attorney familiar with green card applications.The update comes amidst the ongoing H-1B visa row. The Trump administration recently introduced an annual fee of $100,000 on H-1B visa applications starting September 21.Explaining the move, Trump said “The H-1B nonimmigrant visa program was created to bring temporary workers into the United States to perform additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labour”.",U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has advised applicants to carefully complete Form I-485.

Balancing promise and peril







OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has made one of his boldest predictions yet. As reported by Business Insider, Altman has claimed that artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence by the end of this decade. Speaking at a recent event, Altman said that the pace at which AI is developing will accelerate so fast that the world must prepare for a future where machines will outthink humans. “In many ways, GPT5 is already smarter than me, at least, I think a lot of other people too. GPT5 is capable of doing incredible things that many people find very impressive. But it's also not able to do a lot of things that humans could do easily,” said Altman.Altman said that he expects artificial general intelligence (AGI) — systems capable of performing tasks at or beyond human level — to emerge by 2030, and possibly as soon as 2029. “We are on track to see AI exceed human intelligence within the next five years,” he noted, underscoring both the opportunities and risks of such a breakthrough.While OpenAI CEO is optimistic about AI’s potential to transform industries, he also warned of upcoming existential risks. He mentioned that if the technology is not governed properly it will lead to existential risks. Earlier, Altman also called for global regulatory frameworks to ensure AI is developed safely, echoing concerns shared by other tech leaders.The prediction comes as AI adoption accelerates worldwide, with companies and governments investing heavily in generative AI, robotics, and autonomous systems.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has made one of his boldest predictions yet.

Full text of Bernie Sander’s post criticizing Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Larry Ellison and others

There is a reason why Mr. Musk, Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Ellison, Mr. Altman and some of the other richest people in the world are investing many hundreds of billions of dollars into Al and robotics.

And it's not to make your life better.

It's to create unbelievable fortunes for themselves and make themselves even more powerful than they already are.

As a result of Al and robotics, there will be massive job losses in both blue-collar and white-collar jobs. We may be building new factories and warehouses in America, but they will be staffed by robots, not workers. We may be building millions of new cars and trucks, but they won't be driven by truck drivers, bus drivers or taxi cab drivers. They will be driverless vehicles.

There may be many start-up companies being created, but entry-level jobs will decline and much of office work will be done by artificial intelligence.

Further, the data centers that Al depends upon will require massive amounts of water and electricity, leading to huge energy bill increases and water shortages across the country.

This is what's already beginning to happen today and will rapidly accelerate in the next 10 years if we don't act now. The technology revolution must benefit ordinary Americans, not just a handful of billionaires. We must fight back.

Tech firms’ AI expansion







Senator Bernie Sanders has criticized Meta, Amazon, Google and other tech giants over their push into artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, which he says threatens large-scale job losses for American workers. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Sanders specifically called out Tesla CEO Elon Musk , Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman , and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.In the post, Bernie Sanders said that there is a reason why tech CEOs are “investing many hundreds of billions of dollars into Al and robotics”, adding “And it's not to make your life better”. He said that it primarily serves to “create unbelievable fortunes for themselves and make themselves even more powerful than they already are.” He warned that both blue-collar and white-collar jobs could disappear as factories and warehouses increasingly rely on robots instead of human staff. Driverless vehicles and AI tools could cost drivers and entry-level workers their jobs, he said.Sanders also criticized AI data centers, highlighting their environmental impact. He pointed out the heavy electricity demand, water shortages, and strain on the power grid caused by these facilities.“The technology revolution must benefit ordinary Americans, not just a handful of billionaires,” Sanders said.The comments come as OpenAI announced an $850 billion expansion plan, which would require energy equal to powering 13 million American homes. The project, known as Project Stargate, involves partnerships with Oracle, Nvidia, and Japan’s SoftBank. Rights groups have also raised concerns about xAI’s Memphis datacenter, which houses the Colossus I Supercomputer, for harming the environment and affecting majority African-American communities.Nvidia recently invested $5 billion in Intel, gaining a 5% stake, to collaborate on custom chipsets for AI applications. Tesla, meanwhile, has said it will focus on AI and robotics through its Master Plan IV, with CEO Musk noting that the Optimus line of robots could represent 80% of the company’s future value.","Senator Bernie Sanders has criticized Meta, Amazon, Google and other tech giants over their push into artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.

Scale of the layoffs



Training in agentic AI







Global consulting giant Accenture has laid off more than 11,000 employees across the globe in the past three months. The company revealed that the rapid adoption of AI and slowing corporate demand are the reason behind the layoffs. Accenture has also confirmed that the job cuts are part of an $865 million restructuring programme, warning that more exits are likely in the coming months.Accenture CEO Julie Sweet told analysts that the company is “exiting people on a compressed timeline where reskilling is not a viable path for the skills we need.” She further added that the company will quickly align its workforce with client demand for AI-driven solutions. This means that Accenture may will have let go off some more employees who cannot be retained at that time.At the end of August, Accenture’s global headcount stood at 779,000, down from 791,000 three months earlier. The round of layoffs at Accenture began earlier this year and are expected to go on till November 2025. The restructuring at the company majorly covers severance costs and is said to save more than $1 billion for the company.Along with cutting Jobs, Accenture is also investing in ups killing. The company has started training its emlpyees in agentic artificial intelligence. It is a new wave of AI tools which are designed to automate complex tasks. Sweet added that this training is important to meet client expectations as businesses across the globe race to reinvent operations with AI.Despite the layoffs, Accenture reported a 7% year‑on‑year revenue increase to $17.6 billion in the June–August quarter of fiscal 2025, beating estimates. Sweet said the results demonstrate Accenture’s “unique ability to deliver for clients as they seek our help to reinvent and lead with AI.”","Accenture has laid off more than 11,000 employees across the globe in the past three months.

Foxconn staff worked 60-75 hours per week, claims China’s Labor Watch

How Apple responded to the allegations





Chinese workers at a Foxconn plant in Zhengzhou allegedly faced tough conditions while preparing Apple ’s iPhone 17 lineup, according to nonprofit China Labor Watch. The findings were reported on Thursday, September 25 and cited by Bloomberg. The report alleged wage withholding, excessive overtime, and forced night shifts at the facility between March and September — the period when Apple and its suppliers were readying the latest iPhone 17 models. It also said Foxconn relied heavily on temporary “dispatch” workers, which China Labor Watch claimed exceeded legal limits under Chinese law.According to Bloomberg, the report highlighted “unstable orders” that created pressure and intimidation for workers. Some dispatch staff allegedly lost weeks of overtime pay due to Foxconn’s wage system, which withholds part of salaries until the following month.The Zhengzhou plant, often called “iPhone City,” employed up to 200,000 people during peak production, according to Bloomberg. Despite its size, Apple has been diversifying supply, expanding iPhone production in India earlier this year to meet US demand.The group, as reported by Bloomberg, said most employees worked 60–75 hours per week, above China’s legal maximum and Apple’s own 60-hour cap. “Most workers clocked 60 to 75 hours per week, well above China’s legal maximum and Apple’s own 60-hour weekly cap,” the non-profit organisation said.China Labor Watch also pointed to discrimination in hiring, exposure to chemicals without proper protective gear, harassment, and intimidation.It claimed that students were pushed into night shifts for low pay. The group added that while no underage workers were found this time, many issues had worsened since its 2019 investigation.In a statement, Apple said it remains “firmly committed to the highest standards of labour, human rights, environmental and ethical conduct.”“Our suppliers are required to provide safe working conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect, act fairly and ethically, and use environmentally responsible practices wherever they make products or perform services for Apple,” the company said in a statement. “We regularly conduct third-party audits, and anytime an issue is raised anywhere in our supply chain, we move swiftly to ensure that our high standards are upheld. In this case, Apple teams were on site and began an immediate investigation,” Apple told Bloomberg.Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., said worker safety is its top priority and welcomed “constructive dialogue” on improvements.","Chinese workers at a Foxconn plant in Zhengzhou allegedly faced tough conditions while preparing Apple ’s iPhone 17 lineup.

Message for today’s teens

Teens today may be standing on the brink of a transformative era in technology. Alexandr Wang, the 28-year-old co-founder of Scale AI—currently valued at $29 billion—believes that mastering artificial intelligence (AI) coding tools can provide an unprecedented opportunity for the next generation to shape the future. Speaking on the TBPN podcast , Wang encouraged young people to dedicate themselves fully to what he calls “vibe coding,” a practice of exploring AI tools in-depth to gain a competitive edge.“This is an incredible moment of discontinuity,” Wang explained. “If you just happen to spend, like, 10,000 hours playing with the tools and figuring out how to use them better than other people, that’s a huge advantage.”Wang draws a parallel between the current AI revolution and the early days of personal computing, when a teenage Bill Gates would secretly practice programming late at night. Just as Gates turned his early exposure to computers into a global technology empire with Microsoft, Wang believes today’s teens can leave their mark by immersing themselves in AI development.“That moment is happening right now,” Wang said. “If you are 13 years old, you should spend all of your time vibe coding. That’s how you should live your life.” His message is clear: AI fluency could become the defining skill of this generation.Despite his enthusiasm, Wang acknowledged that AI models may be capable of generating nearly all the code he has written in his career within the next five years. This has understandably sparked concerns about the future of programming careers, as companies increasingly adopt AI-powered coding assistants that can reduce reliance on human developers.However, industry leaders argue that coding will not become irrelevant. Andrew Ng, co-founder of Google Brain, emphasized in a March 2025 LinkedIn post that discouraging people from learning to code is “some of the worst career advice ever given.” He noted that as coding becomes more accessible through AI, it is even more critical for individuals to develop programming skills.Ng frames coding as a fundamental skill for the AI age. Understanding the “language of software” allows users to guide AI tools with precision, producing superior results compared to vague prompts. This concept is akin to how artists familiar with art history achieve better outcomes with AI-driven art tools; knowledge and fluency amplify creative potential.For Wang, who Forbes estimates to be worth $3.2 billion and who has recently been appointed Meta’s chief AI officer, the path to breakthroughs is clear: the earlier one immerses in AI coding, the greater the advantage.For today’s 13-year-olds and young learners, Wang’s advice is unmistakable: dedicate your hours to mastering AI coding tools and developing deep technical fluency. This could be the defining “Bill Gates moment” for Generation Z—a chance to transform early exploration into lasting technological impact.","Alexandr Wang, the 28-year-old co-founder of Scale AI, believes that mastering artificial intelligence (AI) coding tools can provide an unprecedented opportunity for the next generation to shape the future.

Billionaire Mark Cuban warns credit cards block the path to wealth; says ‘Plastic is the enemy of prosperity’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/billionaire-mark-cuban-warns-credit-cards-block-the-path-to-wealth-says-plastic-is-the-enemy-of-prosperity/articleshow/124152985.cms,"“Plastic is the enemy of prosperity”



Why paying off debt beats investing



A lesson from this own journey



Mark Cuban’s advice to young professionals







Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban is back again with another important advice. Cuban has once again raised alarm on the dangers of credit card debt. Cuban believes that credit card debt is the biggest obstacle in the way building wealth. Speaking during the Dave Ramsey Show, in 2014, Cuban said that the ‘best investment’ anyone can made is paying off credit cards and then destroying them.Cuban who started from modest beginnings to reach his billionaire status, told Ramsey that credit cards are ‘financial quicksand’. “People ask me where’s the best place to invest,” Cuban said. “The best place to invest is to pay off all your credit cards and burn them. If you’re paying 15% or 20% in interest, if you pay that down, you just earned 15% or 20%. If you use your credit cards, you don’t want to be rich.”The advice Cuban gave highlight an important math: while the S&P 500 has historically returned about 10% annually, the average credit card APR today is 22.25%. That means carrying a $1,000 balance could cost $220 in interest in a year — far more than typical investment gains. Paying off debt, Cuban argued, is a guaranteed return Wall Street cannot promise.Cuban’s advice carry the weight of his background. Cuban was not born in a wealthy family. He did odd jobs and then worked on building his fortune step by step. His dislike for credit card debt comes from the discipline learned while climbing out of financial hardship.Shark Tank Star and billionaire investor Mark Cuban has shared an advice for young professionals, especially GenZ saying they should concentrate on customizing AI models and showcase their advantages to businesses. According to a Fortune report, the billionaire told TBPN during an interview that young individuals must emphasize on the importance of mastering AI implementation. ""Learn all you can about AI, but learn more on how to implement them in companies,"" Mark Cuban said.During the interview, he also urged Generation Z to use their free time to learn artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as OpenAI’s Sora and Google’s Veo, saying they could unlock major job opportunities. Mark Cuban noted that many small businesses do not have budgets or experts for AI, creating space for tech-savvy graduates to fill the gap. “If you understand how to use these tools, you’ll put yourself in a position to help businesses that can’t afford their own AI staff,” he said.","Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has once again raised alarm on the dangers of credit card debt.

In a tongue-in-cheek remark, he suggested those seeking work-life balance should “work for the government.”

“I am not in favour of working at home”



Government vs. tech work culture



Past criticism of Google’s flexible work



Google’s ex-CEO Eric Schmidt warns US could lose AI race to China







Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has once again started the debate over remote and flexible work. As reported by Business Insider, Schmidt argued that while the flexible work is acceptable in government roles, they tend to undermine competitiveness and learning in the technology sector. Schmidt believes that working from home delays learning and in-turn harm competitiveness.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the All-in Summit, Schmidt said that flexible work can harm young professionals who want and need in-person exposure in order to learn from their colleagues. “I am not in favor of, essentially, working at home,” he said on the All‑In podcast. “Think about a 20‑something who has to learn how the world works.” He recalled his early career at Sun Microsystems, where he said much of his learning came from listening to older coworkers argue and collaborate.Schmidt also emphasised that he supports work-life balance, ““and that’s why people work for the government,” before apologizing multiple times. He added: “If you’re going to be in tech, and you’re going to win, you’re going to have to make some tradeoffs.”The Ex-Google CEO also contrasted US work culture with China’s so-called “996” schedule—working 9 a.m.to 9 p.m., six days a week. “The Chinese have clarified that this is illegal. However, they all do it. That’s who you’re competing against,” he said.This is not the first time that Schmidt has criticised the remote work culture. In 2024 speaking at the Stanford University, Schmidt said that Google’s flexible work culture was harming the company in the AI race against startups like OpenAI and Anthropic. At the time, he said: “Google decided that work‑life balance, and going home early, and working from home, was more important than winning.”Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt recently warned that the US could lose AI race to China. In an All In Podcast interview with venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya and David Sacks, Eric Schmidt said that he believed both countries were competing on equal footing, but China is “really doing something more different” than US. ""They're very focused on taking AI and applying it to everything…consumer apps, robots, and so forth,"" Schmidt said, adding US restrictions on semiconductor exports and China's limited access to capital have slowed the country’s pursuit of AGI – Artificial General Intelligence.",Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has reignited debate over remote work.

EU Stands firm on competition goals





The European Union firmly rejected Apple 's demand to repeal its landmark Digital Markets Act on Thursday, dismissing the tech giant's claims that the regulations compromise user security and calling for wholesale changes to enforcement.The European Commission said it had ""absolutely no intention"" to abandon the law after Apple submitted a formal request for the DMA to be ""repealed while a more appropriate fit for purpose legislative instrument is put in place."" EU digital affairs spokesman Thomas Regnier said the commission was ""not surprised"" by Apple's move, noting the company ""has simply contested every little bit of the DMA since its entry into application.

"Microsoft moves 'further away' from OpenAI, adds Anthropic AI model to Copilot assistant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-moves-further-away-from-openai-adds-anthropic-ai-model-to-copilot-assistant/articleshow/124124338.cms,"How can Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant users access Anthropic’s models



“And stay tuned: Anthropic models will bring even more powerful experiences to Microsoft 365 Copilot.”

How Microsoft and OpenAI are reducing dependency on each other



Google hits $3 trillion: How Alphabet became the fastest to reach the milestone





Microsoft has begun diversifying its AI technology by integrating a model from Anthropic into its 365 Copilot assistant. The Amazon and Google-backed AI startup is a key rival to Microsoft’s principal partner, OpenAI . The software giant recently announced that it will start using the Anthropic model to answer some queries for its commercial clients. This move signals a shift in Microsoft's generative AI strategy, which has historically relied almost exclusively on OpenAI models for features across products like Bing and Windows. Microsoft is the lead investor in OpenAI, having committed more than $13 billion as part of its strategic partnership.Anthropic’s model is set to debut in Researcher, a Microsoft 365 Copilot agent that helps collect information, analyse it, and create reports.Employees in organisations that are part of Microsoft’s Frontier program, which gives early access to AI tools, can now opt to use Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.1 reasoning model.This model is built to handle complex tasks and serves as an alternative to OpenAI’s offering within Researcher.In a blog post, Charles Lamanna, Microsoft’s president of business and industry Copilot, wrote:Corporate customers can now choose Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4.1 when creating custom AI agents using Microsoft’s Copilot Studio.However, administrators will need to enable Anthropic models before employees can access them. These models operate on Amazon and Google cloud platforms and are governed by Anthropic’s terms and conditions, Lamanna noted.Alongside adding models from outside partners, Microsoft has also begun testing MAI-1-preview, its own in-house large language model.OpenAI has been actively building partnerships with major players. In recent weeks, it announced plans to spend $300 billion with Oracle and signed a $10 billion deal with chip designer Broadcom. This week, Nvidia revealed it will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a joint push to develop massive new data centres.While Microsoft and OpenAI continue to work closely, their relationship is shifting. Last year, Microsoft announced that GitHub Copilot Chat would also utilise models from Anthropic and Google, in addition to those from OpenAI.Founded in 2021 by former OpenAI executives, Anthropic was recently valued at $183 billion. Still, Microsoft remains the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI’s programming interface that third-party apps depend on.","Anthropic’s model is set to debut in Researcher, a Microsoft 365 Copilot agent that helps collect information, analyse it, and create reports.

What US lawmakers asked Amazon, Apple and others about job cuts



“With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that Amazon cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions.”

Festive Sale Scams Alert: Amazon warns shoppers; how to spot fake offers





US lawmakers have reportedly sent letters to major companies, including Apple Amazon , and JPMorgan, demanding an explanation for hiring thousands of foreign workers on H-1B visas while simultaneously reducing other job openings. The inquiries, led by Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, request detailed information from the companies on the number of H-1B workers they employ, their wages, and whether American workers have been displaced, according to a report. The lawmakers' action follows the Trump administration's recent announcement that it will impose a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa petitions. The administration has also proposed changes to the visa selection process to favour higher-skilled and better-paid foreign workers.In a letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy (seen by the Wall Street Journal), the senators said:According to the report, Deloitte, Google ’s parent Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Walmart, Cognizant Technology Solutions and Tata Consultancy Services also received the letter.Despite making huge investments in artificial intelligence, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft have all announced job cuts this year.The US government’s data shows India was the largest recipient of H-1B visas last year with 71% of approvals, while China followed with 11.7%.In the first half of 2025, Amazon and its cloud arm AWS secured more than 12,000 H-1B visa approvals, while Microsoft and Meta each received over 5,000 approvals.Meanwhile, the US Chamber of Commerce is considering a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the new $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visas, raising concerns among foreign workers, particularly Indians, who make up a significant share of the program.The Chamber has reportedly been in contact with member companies through calls and meetings to gauge their support for legal action.If filed, this would be the second time the Chamber has opposed Trump in court. The first was in 2020, when it successfully challenged the suspension of new non-immigrant visas.The Chamber, which counts major firms like Amazon, Alphabet and Google among its members, has otherwise avoided direct conflict with Trump in his second term untill now.","US lawmakers have reportedly sent letters to major companies, including Apple Amazon, and JPMorgan.

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

Poll Do you think the H-1B visa fee hike will negatively impact innovation in the US? Yes, it may drive away top global talent No, it mainly benefits American workers

Trump administration’s defense





Investor and Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary has sharply criticised US President Donald Trump’s increased H-1B visa fee hike. Last week, the Trump administration announced a massive increase in the H-1B visa fee. After the revised regulation, the H-1B visa fee for fresh application has increased from $10,000 to $1,00,000. Now, Kevin has warned that this policy change will hurt the US more as compared to other countries such as India and China. Kevin also feels that this move of the Trump administration may also drive away top global talent and can lead to shift the creation of future tech giants.In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Kevin argued that the iconic tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle famously began in garages might have never taken off under today’s restrictive immigration rules. “I think what this does is hurt innovation long‑term,” O’Leary wrote, adding that the U.S. should not spend resources training top foreign students at institutions like MIT and Harvard only to “kick them out.” He suggested such graduates should automatically be allowed to stay, marry, and build companies in America.“Apple, Oracle, Google, all started in a garage. They could've not have afforded to do this, and all of those companies took advantage of talent they couldn't find in the United States as they grew. I think what this does is hurt innovation long-term. I agree that it's going to push these really talented people into other countries. My attitude about this is if we educate you at MIT or at Harvard any school, we should give you a free ticket to stay here, get married, form a company, and build American businesses here.Why train them and kick them out?” wrote Kevin.As mentioned above, the Trump administration recently announced that the companies will now be charged $100,000 for each new H‑1B visa petition. Now, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has clarified the move of the US government and said that it is one-time fee and is applicable only on new applications.The officials also said this move is designed to prioritise American workers and reduce reliance on immigrant labour. Along with this, the US government has also rolled out a $1 million “gold card” residency program for wealthy investors.","Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary has sharply criticised US President Donald Trump’s increased H-1B visa fee hike.

To, Shri Siddaramaiah,

Hon'ble Chief Minister of Karnataka,

Vidhana Soudha,

Bangalore - 560 001

Hon'ble Chief Minister,

Sub: Re: Your Letter Regarding Traffic Congestion on Outer Ring Road (ORR)

Thank you for your letter dated September 19, 2025 and your kind recognition of Wipro's contributions to Karnataka. We sincerely appreciate your leadership for initiatives concerning critical issue of traffic congestion in Bengaluru. As stated in your letter, urgent and effective measures are indeed required for the traffic situation, particularly along the Outer Ring Road, being an export oriented economic hub.

The problem's complexity, stemming from multiple factors, suggests that there is unlikely to be a single point solution or a silver bullet to resolve it. To this end, we believe the most effective path forward is to commission a comprehensive, scientific study led by an entity with world-class expertise in urban transport management. Such an exercise would allow us to develop a holistic roadmap of effective solutions that are implementable in the short, medium, and long term. To demonstrate our commitment to being a part of the solution, Wipro will be pleased to engage in this process and underwrite a significant portion of the cost for this expert study.

With respect to the specific suggestion of allowing public vehicular movement through our Sarjapur campus, we apprehend significant legal, governance, and statutory challenges since it is an exclusive private property owned by a listed company not intended for public thoroughfare. That apart it will also be appreciated that our Sarjapur campus is a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) providing services to global customers, our contractual conditions mandate stringent, non-negotiable access control norms for governance and compliance.

Moreover, public vehicular movement through a private property would not be effective as a sustainable, long-term solution. Wipro nevertheless stands committed to partner with the Government of Karnataka to find a lasting solution for Bengaluru's mobility challenges. We believe a collaborative, data-driven approach will yield the most impactful results for our city.

Our team, led by Reshmi Shankar (email: reshmi.shankar@wipro.com), would be happy to engage with your officials to discuss the way forward at your earliest convenience.

Warm regards,

Yours sincerely,

AZIM PREMJI





Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has written to Wipro founder Azim Premji requesting the IT giant to allow limited vehicular movement through its campus to help ease Bengaluru's notorious traffic congestion on the Outer Ring Road. In a letter dated September 19, Siddaramaiah specifically targeted the severe traffic bottleneck at Iblur junction along the ORR corridor, writing: ""I wish to explore the possibility of allowing limited vehicular movement through the Wipro campus, subject to mutually agreed terms and necessary security considerations.""Now, Wipro founder Azim Premji has responded to Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah letter. Permji has declined the request from the Karnataka government to part with a portion of the company’s Bengaluru campus land to ease traffic congestion in the city’s IT corridor. Premji said the decision was made in the best interests of the company and its employees, citing operational and security concerns.The Chief Minister cited preliminary assessments by traffic and urban mobility experts indicating that such a measure ""could reduce congestion on adjoining stretches of the ORR by nearly 30 per cent, particularly during peak office hours."" A detailed traffic simulation study by Bengaluru Traffic Police has projected even more promising results, suggesting that opening the Wipro–Ecoworld campus link road to the public could reduce travel time along the Sarjapur Road–Outer Ring Road corridor by nearly 38%.Responding to the letter Premji said that while he understood the traffic challenges of the city, but Wipro could not compromise on its campus integrity and long‑term business needs.",Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has written to Wipro founder Azim Premji.

How Amazon and Microsoft are thriving in this space while Apple is not

How this may be a risk to Apple

While tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are advancing rapidly in the AI sector, Apple is reportedly at a disadvantage. Despite its efforts to push forward with AI initiatives, the iPhone maker lacks the essential infrastructure and long-term investment in core AI technologies that its competitors have spent years, if not decades, developing, a new report indicates.For example, Apple delayed its planned overhaul of Siri earlier this year because the upgrade, meant to usher Siri into the generative AI era, wasn’t ready. According to a report by Business Insider, if Apple wants to modernise Siri to its competitors' levels, it may need to build critical AI components from scratch—an expensive, time-consuming process that could take years. Otherwise, it may be forced to rely more heavily on competitors or acquire startups at scale to catch up.For having a successful AI product, one needs to have certain AI building blocks. Google already has nearly all the core AI building blocks in place, while Microsoft and Amazon have some of them. Google controls the deep stack of technologies powering its AI building blocks -- data, chips, data centres, cloud business and means to disseminate the products -- which is why it is able to launch AI consumer tools like Veo, Flow, Imagen and so on.In 2017, Google invented Transformer, the breakthrough architecture behind modern generative AI. Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Google's AI chips, have been around since 2016 and are now integral to both Google products and external developers using Google Cloud.Google also benefits from decades of web indexing and data collection. This immense dataset supports the training of its powerful AI models, datacenters and a cloud business to make these tools available to customers.Both Microsoft and Amazon have some of these building blocks, including AI models, cloud infrastructure, dedicated AI units working on the technology and even partnerships. Apple, on the other hand, lacks many of these assets and doesn't have this kind of access or infrastructure.Apple still doesn't operate enough large-scale data centres and relies on Google data centres for functions like iCloud backups. For recent AI training, Apple even requested access to Google’s TPUs—essentially borrowing infrastructure from a direct rival.Reportedly, Apple is also about 7 years behind Google in developing AI chips for data centers. When it comes to data, though Apple has access to huge volumes of data from its devices, it has been conservative in using that data for AI training due to its privacy-first policies. This restricts its ability to build and refine large-scale models.The report also said that Apple has also lagged in recruiting and retaining top AI talent.If generative AI ends up reshaping how people interact with computing devices, including smartphones and laptops, Apple’s delayed investment in AI infrastructure could become a critical problem. While other tech giants are rolling out robust, end-to-end AI systems, Apple is still piecing together the basic components.","Apple lacks the infrastructure and long-term investment in core AI technologies that its competitors have spent years, if not decades, developing.

Russia is running out of people.

Births dropped so sharply this year that officials stopped publishing monthly numbers. A top demographer says March 2025 may have had the fewest births since the 1700s.

Population projections? Down from 146 million today to 132 million by 2045. Worst-case: just 83 million by 2100.

The government’s response includes banning “childfree ideology,” tightening abortion access, offering cash to pregnant women, and even proposing to release prisoners so they can have children.

Also: they might censor TV shows like Harry Potter and Sex and the City for promoting the wrong message.

What hurt Tesla -- Rebate freeze, tariffs and ...

Tesla’s electric vehicle (EV) sales have hit a rough patch, with a dramatic decline not only in Europe but now in Canada, particularly in Québec, during the first quarter of 2025. According to a Business Insider report citing data from Québec’s vehicle registration authority, only 524 new Teslas were registered in the province from January to March 2025—a staggering 85% drop from the 5,097 vehicles registered in the final quarter of 2024.The Tesla Model Y, the company’s best-selling vehicle, saw registrations plummet to just 360 units in the first quarter of 2025, down from 3,274 in the fourth quarter of 2024 -- a decline of nearly 89%. The Model 3, Tesla’s most affordable offering, fared even worse, with registrations falling 94% to a mere 96 units from 1,786 in the previous quarter. These figures highlight a significant setback for Tesla in a key Canadian market.While automotive sales often dip at the start of the year, Quebec's numbers reflect a far steeper decline than typical seasonal trends. This downturn mirrors Tesla’s struggles in Europe, where sales dropped nearly 50% in April 2025 despite growing overall EV demand, according to Business Insider. The global pattern suggests Tesla may be grappling with broader challenges, including intensified competition from Chinese EV makers like BYD and shifting consumer preferences toward hybrid vehicles.A major factor in Tesla’s Quebec's slump appears to be the Canadian government’s sudden suspension of $43 million in federal EV rebates in March 2025. The freeze followed a suspicious surge in Tesla rebate applications, which skyrocketed from 300 to nearly 5,800 per day, prompting a formal review. Business Insider reports that Transport Minister Chrystia Freeland has stated Tesla will remain ineligible for future incentives as long as U.S. President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on Canadian goods persist, further complicating Tesla’s market position.Beyond rebates and tariffs, Tesla faces growing competition in Canada from domestic and international EV manufacturers offering more affordable models. For instance, companies like Rivian and VinFast have introduced competitively priced EVs, while legacy automakers like Toyota and Ford are gaining traction with hybrid options. Tesla’s pricing strategy, which has seen multiple cuts in recent years, may also be eroding its brand premium, making it harder to maintain market share in cost-sensitive regions like Québec.",Only 524 new Teslas were registered in the province from January to March 2025.

The DOJ’s proposed remedies go miles beyond...: Google

Yesterday, we made closing arguments in the DOJ search remedies trial. The DOJ’s proposed remedies go miles beyond the Court’s decision & would harm consumers, businesses and America’s tech leadership. Here are a few key points from our arguments. ⬇️

1/ DOJ waved off very real privacy issues, saying they’d be resolved later on. In fact, one DOJ lawyer said “the only thing we can do is give [rivals] more data.” 🤔

2/ When confronted with significant questions left open by their proposals (i.e. how much data should Google be forced to share?), DOJ just said it could all be worked out by a “Technical Committee” of mostly govt-appointed experts.

3/ The DOJ’s proposal reserves the right for the government to decide who gets Google users’ data. Not the Court.

4/ The DOJ spent many hours trying to convince the Court to remake the tech sector. Meanwhile it’s very clear the AI space is highly competitive today: Countless rivals in the AI space are growing fast & gaining users & distribution without government intervention.

5/ While we heard a lot about how the remedies would help various well-funded competitors (w/ repeated references to Bing), we heard very little about how all this helps consumers.

6/ We will wait for the Court’s opinion. And we still strongly believe the Court’s original decision was wrong, and look forward to our eventual appeal.

Android smartphones that will lose WhatsApp support from June 1

Why WhatsApp will stop working on these devices

What users of smartphones on which WhatsApp will stop working can do



Starting this Sunday, June 1, 2025, WhatsApp, the Meta-owned messaging platform, will stop support for several older smartphone models as part of its routine update cycle. This change, initially scheduled for May 5, 2025, was delayed by a few weeks to allow users additional time to prepare. The update raises the app’s minimum system requirements, rendering it incompatible with certain legacy devices.WhatsApp will require iOS 15.1 or later for iPhones and Android 5.1 or higher for Android devices. As a result, the following iPhone models will no longer support WhatsApp:These models are limited to iOS versions below 15.1, making them incompatible with the updated app. However, some reports have mistakenly included the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE (1st generation) in the affected list. These devices can run iOS 15.8.4, the latest supported version for them, and should remain compatible with WhatsApp until a future update raises requirements again, likely not for another one to two years.On the Android side, devices running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or earlier will also lose support. This includes older models like the Samsung Galaxy S3, HTC One X, and Sony Xperia Z, though specific Android model lists vary due to the platform’s fragmentation.WhatsApp periodically updates its minimum requirements to leverage newer operating system features, enhance security, and optimize performance. Older devices, often limited by hardware constraints, struggle to support modern app functionalities like end-to-end encryption, video calling, or new interface elements. By dropping support for outdated systems, WhatsApp ensures a consistent user experience across its approximately 3 billion global users.If you or someone you know uses an affected device, here are your options:* Upgrade the Device: Switching to a newer smartphone supporting iOS 15.1 or Android 5.1 (or later) will ensure continued access to WhatsApp. Budget-friendly options like the iPhone SE (2nd or 3rd generation) or mid-range Android devices are widely available.* Update iOS (if possible): For devices like the iPhone 6s, 6s Plus, or SE (1st gen), ensure the device is updated to iOS 15.8.4 via Settings > General > Software Update to maintain compatibility.* Switch to Alternatives: Other messaging apps like Telegram or Signal may still support older devices, though their user bases are smaller. Check their respective app stores for compatibility.* Backup Chats: Before losing access, back up WhatsApp conversations to iCloud (iPhone) or Google Drive (Android) to transfer them to a new device. Go to WhatsApp Settings > Chats > Chat Backup to secure your data.This change aligns with industry trends, as apps increasingly phase out support for older systems. Apple’s own data from 2024 indicates that only about 5% of active iPhones run iOS 15 or earlier, suggesting limited impact in developed markets. However, users in regions with slower device turnover may face challenges. WhatsApp has advised affected users to upgrade devices by June 1, 2025, to avoid service disruptions.For more details, visit WhatsApp’s official support page or check your device’s compatibility in the App Store or Google Play Store. If you’re unsure about your device’s status, you can verify its iOS version under Settings > General > About on iPhone or Settings > About Phone on Android.","WhatsApp will stop working on several older smartphone models on June 1, 2025.

Meta , the tech giant behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has requested a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) high-profile antitrust case, just as the trial approaches a critical phase. According to the, the case, which began in early April, represents one of the most significant regulatory challenges faced by Meta in its history, potentially resulting in the breakup of the company’s social media empire.Meta's move to dismiss the case comes after the FTC rested its side of the argument, asserting that the company holds an illegal monopoly over the social networking market, particularly those platforms focused on friends-and-family connections. Meta, however, argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces from newer platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X (formerly known as Twitter).In a court filing late Thursday, Meta reiterated its stance that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standards required to prove its antitrust allegations. The company’s legal team argues that the FTC has fundamentally mischaracterized the social media market, claiming that the agency's definition is overly narrow and excludes significant competitors.“After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps).”Meta claims that it faces substantial competition from a wide range of digital platforms, including short-video giant TikTok, video-sharing platform YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X. These platforms, Meta argues, all compete for user engagement, advertising revenue, and market share, undercutting the FTC’s claim that Meta has maintained an unlawful monopoly.The FTC’s antitrust lawsuit, which was first filed in December 2020, centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market.In its filing, the FTC pointed to internal Meta communications as evidence of this strategy. This includes a 2012 email from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that buying Instagram would “neutralize a competitor.” The FTC further argues that these acquisitions reduced consumer choice and stifled innovation, limiting competition in the rapidly evolving social media industry.The FTC's case aims to convince U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, effectively dismantling the company's integrated social media ecosystem.Meta's defense in the trial has focused on presenting itself as a company that supports innovation and benefits consumers. In its Thursday filing, the company argued that its acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth, which in turn delivered significant benefits to users.“Meta’s acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth – with correspondingly massive benefits for US consumers,” the company stated in its court filing.However, the trial has also brought to light internal documents that may complicate Meta’s defense. For instance, a 2018 email from an unnamed Instagram executive warned that ""fake engagement could be in the range of 40%,"" potentially undermining Meta's claims about the platform’s integrity and user trust.Mark Zuckerberg himself was the first witness called by the FTC as the trial opened, highlighting the personal stakes for the Meta CEO. During his testimony, Zuckerberg sought to portray Meta as a company facing fierce competition, rather than a monopoly crushing potential rivals.Earlier in the trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified that he felt Zuckerberg viewed Instagram’s rapid growth as a potential threat to Facebook’s dominance after the acquisition, further fueling the FTC’s argument that Meta's mergers were designed to stifle competition.The 10-week non-jury trial, which is expected to conclude in June, will be followed by final briefs from both the FTC and Meta. If Judge Boasberg sides with the FTC, a second trial will be held to determine appropriate remedies, potentially including the forced divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp.Meta will continue presenting its defense when the trial resumes on Monday. The company’s attempt to dismiss the case outright remains a long shot, as the judge may choose to let the case proceed to its scheduled conclusion before issuing a ruling.","The FTC's antitrust lawsuit centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

Bezos’ divorce bombshell: How a missing prenup created a $35 billion settlement

Bezos’ new romance, new rules: The $220 billion prenup strategy

Inside the billion-dollar prenup: Legal experts weigh in

When Jeff Bezos married MacKenzie Scott in 1993, few could have predicted the trajectory of their lives. At the time, Amazon was a fledgling online bookstore operating from a garage, and the tech boom that would make Bezos one of the richest people in history was still years away. Their 25-year marriage not only survived Amazon's meteoric rise but also played a crucial role in shaping one of the most iconic business empires of the 21st century. Yet, despite the immense wealth they amassed, the couple entered their union without a prenuptial agreement—a decision that would reverberate globally after their 2019 divorce.MacKenzie walked away with a 4% stake in Amazon, instantly catapulting her into the ranks of the world's richest women. As of 2025, Forbes estimates her net worth to be around $165.3 billion. That highly publicized split not only altered the tech landscape but also sparked renewed conversations about asset protection in high-net-worth marriages.Now, with Jeff Bezos preparing to marry his fiancée Lauren Sánchez, a former TV anchor and entrepreneur, he appears to be approaching marriage with a new playbook. Legal insiders and wealth advisors reveal that this time, Bezos has opted for a comprehensive, multi-jurisdictional prenuptial agreement — a far cry from the informal beginning of his first marriage.Jeff and MacKenzie Scott met in the early 1990s when they were both working at hedge fund D.E. Shaw. The couple moved to Seattle, where Bezos launched Amazon in 1994 with MacKenzie as one of the earliest employees. Their professional and personal lives were deeply intertwined, and as the company flourished, so did their financial fortune. MacKenzie played a key role in Amazon’s early operations, even helping with the company’s initial business plan. Their shared vision laid the foundation for what would become one of the most valuable companies in the world.However, when they announced their divorce in 2019, one crucial detail became the focus: the absence of a prenuptial agreement. As a result, under Washington state’s community property laws, MacKenzie was entitled to half of all marital assets — including a significant portion of Bezos’ Amazon shares.Ultimately, she walked away with 25% of their shared Amazon holdings, equivalent to about 4% of the company’s total shares at the time. That stake alone was valued at approximately $35 billion when the settlement was finalized, though her net worth has since grown due to stock value increases and philanthropic activities.Bezos' new relationship with Lauren Sánchez, which began publicly in 2019 shortly after his divorce, has been markedly different. Sánchez, a media personality, helicopter pilot, and founder of Black Ops Aviation, has her own career and public profile. However, the wealth disparity between the two is massive. Bezos, with a net worth of around $220 billion, remains one of the top three richest individuals globally.This stark financial imbalance has prompted Bezos to take a vastly different approach in his second marriage — one focused on legal precision, asset protection, and long-term planning.According to Certified Family Law Specialist Alphonse Provinziano, Bezos' prenuptial agreement with Sánchez is likely airtight. Speaking to HELLO!, Provinziano noted that such agreements in ultra-high-net-worth marriages typically involve extensive documentation of separate property and future earnings exclusions. These agreements are meticulously crafted with the input of top legal and financial experts. They aim to preemptively resolve disputes that could arise from complex asset portfolios.“There would be a clear enumeration of all business assets and ownership interests, stating these would be considered Jeff Bezos' separate property,” he explained.In other words, Sánchez would not be entitled to any share of Amazon, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, or any related entities regardless of how long the marriage lasts — unless otherwise stipulated.These prenups often include clauses preventing spouses from claiming business appreciation, intellectual property growth, or share in future ventures unless there’s joint investment or involvement. They may even have confidentiality clauses and non-disparagement agreements to avoid post-divorce public disputes. Such terms are common in celebrity or high-profile marriages to maintain reputational integrity. They reflect a broader trend of legal foresight among billionaires seeking long-term asset protection.","Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott divorced in 2019 after 25 years of marriage.

Laura Loomer has slammed the Republican Party for driving away Elon Musk , whom she termed as “their biggest donor”. In a post on social media X, Loomer criticized Republican Party, popularly known as Grand Old Party ( GOP ) for failing to codify spending cuts proposed under Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). She further suggested that their inaction may have cost them critical support ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.“Leave it to the GOP to push their biggest donor away,” Loomer wrote. “All they had to do was codify the DOGE cuts and they could have had unlimited funding for the midterms. They somehow managed to F that up,” she added.In her post, Loomer was referring to Musk’s recent announcement to step down from DOGE and his advisory role in the Trump administration.

He later expressed public disappointment over the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which failed to reflect the aggressive cuts he had championed.“Now @elonmusk is pissed and walking away.

Schools won’t disappear, but their role will change: Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn



Duolingo CEO Luis von Ann recently predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally transform education, shifting the role of schools from traditional learning institutions to childcare and supervised spaces. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the No Priors podcast, von Ahn stressed on the fact that AI’s scalability makes it more efficient than human teachers and it can be easily used for personalised education. ""Education is going to change. It's just a lot more scalable to teach with AI than with teachers,” von Ahn said.Von Ahn suggests that AI will increasingly handle the core instruction in schools. He believes that AI can deliver personalised education more effectively than traditional classroom models with teachers. AI system can be designed to precisely track individual student progress, identify areas where they struggle and then tailor the learning experience accordingly.While Von Ahn does not believe schools will vanish, he foresees a future where AI tutors handle most of the teaching, while schools primarily serve as safe environments for children. He explained that AI can track individual student performance in real time, adjusting lesson plans to match each child’s learning pace—something human teachers struggle to do in large classrooms.“That doesn't mean the teachers are going to go away. You still need people to take care of the students. I also don't think schools are going to go away because you still need childcare,” von Ahn said on the podcast.This doesn't mean teachers will become obsolete, according to von Ahn. Instead, their responsibilities may evolve. Teachers could transition from primarily delivering instruction to supervising students, providing guidance, and fostering social and emotional development.Von Ahn also points out that the integration of AI in education is already happening. Duolingo, for example, is restructuring its operations to embrace an ""AI-first"" approach. This includes using AI for tasks previously done by contractors and incorporating AI into employee performance reviews.","Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn predicts that AI will transform education.

Elon Musk used drugs during the 2024 campaign

Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s ex-girlfriend and Canadian musician Grimes, has raised concerns over Musk’s frequent public appearances with their 5-year-old son, X Æ A-Xii, arguing that it violates their custody settlement. Grimes’ comments came in response to a recent New York Times report which cited that she has been fighting with Elon Musk over their 5-year-old son, known as X.As per NYT’s report, Grimes and Musk had previously agreed to keep their children out of the public eye. However, Musk has repeatedly brought X to high-profile events, including Oval Office meetings and political gatherings, which are widely broadcast.Grimes has privately expressed worries about X’s safety, stating that frequent travel and sleep deprivation could negatively impact his health and well-being.Grimes is not the only woman challenging Musk over parental rights. Ashley St. Clair, a conservative writer, recently revealed that she had a secret relationship with Musk and gave birth to his 14th known child. She claims Musk offered her a large settlement to keep his paternity concealed, but she refused.Musk later sought a gag order in New York to prevent St. Clair from speaking publicly about their child, according to her statements.Musk’s behaviour and personal decisions have drawn criticism from former associates, including neuroscientist Philip Low, who accused him of pushing the boundaries of bad behaviour.The same NYT report also revealed that US President Donald Trump has confirmed that he was not aware of Tesla CEO Elon Musk regularly using drugs during the 2024 presidential campaign.The NYT report also noted that it was unclear whether Musk used drugs while potentially working for Trump in a proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Tesla's major shareholders controlling 7.9 million shares have sent an urgent letter to board chair Robyn Denholm, demanding immediate action to address what they call a ""crisis"" at the electric vehicle maker. The coalition, including pension funds, the American Federation of Teachers, and state treasurers from New York, Oregon, and Illinois, issued four specific demands to refocus CEO Elon Musk's attention on Tesla amid declining sales and plummeting brand reputation.The shareholders blame Tesla's troubles on Musk's divided attention between the company and outside ventures, particularly his recently concluded role at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the Trump administration.The investors want Tesla's board to require Musk to work at least 40 hours per week at the company as a condition of any new compensation package. This demand comes as Tesla's stock has fallen 12% this year while the Nasdaq declined only 1%. The shareholders noted that Tesla's European sales plunged nearly 50% in April compared to the previous year, and global EV sales declined in the first quarter.The letter demands a formal succession plan identifying emergency replacements for Musk should he become unavailable or lose interest in Tesla. ""We believe the company's current disclosure regarding the CEO succession plan does not assure investors that the Board is adequately prepared,"" the shareholders wrote, emphasizing the need for qualified leadership continuity.Shareholders called for stringent policies restricting Tesla board members' involvement in other companies. They propose limiting executive directors to one additional board position and one executive role at another company, arguing this would ensure adequate time dedication to Tesla's oversight and management.The coalition demanded at least one ""truly independent"" director with no personal ties to existing board members. They criticized the recent appointment of former Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung, noting his son-in-law works at Tesla and his previous association with Kimbal Musk, Elon's brother who serves on Tesla's board.The shareholders attributed Tesla's reputation crisis partly to Musk's political activities, including nearly $300 million in pro-Trump donations and endorsement of Germany's far-right AfD party. Tesla has dropped from 8th to 95th place in the Axios Harris Poll of America's most admired brands.Musk announced earlier this week that his DOGE tenure had ended and pledged to focus more intensively on his businesses, including Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. However, investors remain skeptical, with Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs questioning whether Musk has learned from his mistakes or will continue prioritizing other ventures over Tesla's urgent needs.","Tesla's major shareholders have sent an urgent letter to board chair Robyn Denholm, demanding immediate action to address a ""crisis"" at the electric vehicle maker.

US halts student visa interviews

LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman recently criticized the Trump administration ’s recent move to temporarily suspend all interviews for student visas, calling it a step backward for America’s long-standing tradition of attracting global talent. Responding to the policy shift, Hoffman said,Hoffman quoted an X post that read:“Blowing a $50 billion hole in the budget of every state flagship and top private university in America. Gunshot wound to the head of the best education system in the world and the crown jewel of American soft power.

What critics of SpaceX town say

Starbase, Texas, a small town closely tied to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has issued a warning to some residents that they may “lose the right to continue using” their properties as they currently do, according to a memo obtained by CNBC. The town, located in Cameron County near the Gulf Coast, is proposing a new zoning ordinance and a comprehensive citywide map, potentially reshaping the community’s landscape to accommodate SpaceX’s expanding operations.The notice, sent to property owners within a proposed “Mixed Use District,” outlines plans to permit a blend of “residential, office, retail, and small-scale service uses” in the area. This shift could transform the town, which currently spans just 1.6 square miles and serves primarily as a hub for SpaceX’s ambitious Starship rocket program. The proposed zoning changes aim to integrate commercial and service-oriented developments, potentially prioritizing SpaceX’s operational needs over existing residential uses.Starbase has scheduled a public hearing on June 23, 2025, to discuss the zoning ordinance and map, offering residents a chance to voice concerns. The notice was signed by Kent Myers, Starbase’s newly appointed city administrator, who recently assumed the role, according to ValleyCentral.com. Neither Starbase officials nor SpaceX responded to CNBC’s requests for further details on Thursday, leaving residents with limited information about the potential impact.Incorporated earlier this month as a “type-C municipal corporation” following a local election heavily influenced by SpaceX, Starbase is now governed by a mix of current and former SpaceX employees. The town’s formation marks a significant milestone for Musk’s aerospace company, which has transformed the area since establishing its launch facility in 2014. Starbase’s population, estimated at around 500 as of early 2025, includes approximately 260 SpaceX employees, with most other residents being their relatives, per the Texas Tribune.Starbase held its inaugural city commission meeting this week, marking its first formal step as a municipality. The meeting followed closely after the Starship test, highlighting the town’s dual identity as both a residential community and a corporate stronghold for SpaceX. The proposed zoning changes could further align Starbase’s development with SpaceX’s long-term objectives, including plans to expand its launch facilities and support infrastructure.Critics, including some local advocacy groups, have raised concerns about the rapid transformation of Starbase, citing potential environmental impacts and the risk of prioritizing corporate interests over residents’ rights. The area’s proximity to the Boca Chica State Park and its ecologically sensitive wetlands has also drawn scrutiny from environmentalists, who worry about the effects of increased development.As Starbase prepares for the June 23 hearing, residents are bracing for changes that could redefine their community. The outcome of the zoning ordinance will likely signal whether Starbase remains a company town centered on SpaceX’s ambitions or evolves into a more balanced community with diverse land uses. For now, the town remains a unique experiment in corporate-driven urban planning, with Elon Musk’s vision for space exploration at its core.","Starbase, Texas, a small town closely tied to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has issued a warning to some residents that they may “lose the right to continue using” their properties as they currently do.

"How this $7,000 EV is said to be busting the 'biggest' myth about cars in Japan and is set to beat Toyota in EV sales",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-7000-ev-is-said-to-be-busting-the-biggest-myth-about-cars-in-japan/articleshow/121525110.cms,"In a country where EVs are still a rare sight, KG Motors is trying to bust a burgeoning myth: That Bigger is Better.

A Japanese startup, KG Motors, is aiming to boost Japan's electric vehicle (EV) market with an ultra-compact, affordable one-seater EV called the mibot, according to Bloomberg. Resembling a futuristic golf cart, the mibot is designed for Japan's narrow streets and has already pre-sold over half of the 3,300 units planned for delivery in 2027. This puts KG Motors on track to surpass Toyota, which sold around 2,000 EVs in Japan in 2024. This reportedly puts KG Motors on track to sell more EVs in Japan than the world’s biggest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp., which shifted around such 2,000 vehicles in all of 2024.“Cars are simply too big,” said Kazunari Kusunoki, KG Motors’ founder and CEO, as quoted by Bloomberg. The mibot, priced at ¥1 million ($7,000) before tax, is half the cost of Japan’s popular Nissan Sakura EV. It offers a 100-kilometer range, a five-hour charge time, and a top speed of 60 km/h. Production is set to begin in October at a new factory east of Hiroshima.Japan’s EV market lags globally, with EVs making up just 3.5% of vehicle sales in 2023 compared to the global average of 18%, per BloombergNEF. Toyota’s multi-pathway approach, favoring hybrids alongside EVs, has shaped public skepticism about EVs’ popularity, Kusunoki noted. However, small kei cars like the Sakura, which sold nearly 23,000 units in 2024, dominate Japan’s EV market.KG Motors’ mibot, with its minimalist design and low production costs, targets rural areas with declining public transport. Bloomberg reports that 95% of the 2,250 pre-orders come from homeowners with at least one vehicle. The startup expects to break even on its second batch of 3,000 units and aims to produce 10,000 annually thereafter.","Japanese startup KG Motors is aiming to boost Japan's electric vehicle (EV) market with an ultra-compact, affordable one-seater EV.

Analysts question the logic of the decision

US President Donald Trump on Monday, August 11, suggested that he might allow Nvidia to sell a scaled-down version of its next-generation advanced GPU chip in China, despite deep-seated fears in Washington that China could harness American artificial intelligence capabilities to supercharge its military. According to a report by Reuters, ""Trump also confirmed and defended an agreement calling for the U.S. AI chip giant Nvidia, led by Jensen Huang , and Advanced Micro Devices to give the U.S. government 15% of revenue from sales of some advanced computer chips in China, after his administration greenlit exports to China of less advanced AI chips known as theTrump confirmed an agreement requiring Nvidia, led by CEO Jensen Huang, to pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue from certain advanced chip sales in China, following the administration’s approval last month to export less advanced H20 AI chips to the region.“Jensen also has the new chip, the Blackwell. A somewhat enhanced-in-a-negative-way Blackwell. In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it,” Trump told reporters, referring to a reduced-capability version of the chip, according to the report. He added that Nvidia’s CEO would discuss this “unenhanced version” with him.The Trump administration had halted Nvidia’s H20 chip sales to China in April but granted clearance last month for resumed shipments, the report noted. Trump described the H20 as “obsolete,” stating, “China already had it”. ""The H20 is obsolete,"" Trump said, adding China already had it. ""So I said, 'Listen, I want 20% if I'm going to approve this for you, for the country',"" he added.A Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters, “We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,” adding, “While we haven’t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.""The U.S. Commerce Department has begun issuing licenses for H20 chip sales to China, a U.S. official told the news agency, though details remain undisclosed. The curbs on chip exports are expected to cost Nvidia billions, with the company warning that a halt in H20 sales could reduce its July quarter revenue by $8 billion. Nvidia’s China revenue for the fiscal year ending January 26 was $17 billion, or 13% of total sales, as per the report.A Financial Times report, cited by Reuters, said that Nvidia agreed to the revenue-sharing arrangement to secure export licenses. The decision has left many analysts and experts baffled as they question the logic of resuming sales if the chips could pose a national security risk. ""Decisions on export licenses should be determined by national security considerations and the tradeoffs of U.S. policy goals, not a revenue-creating possibility,"" quoted Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an independent research institution, in the report.","US President Donald Trump on Monday, August 11, suggested that he might allow Nvidia to sell a scaled-down version of its next-generation advanced GPU chip in China.

Tesla gets Robotaxi permit in Texas: What we know so far



Can These AI Glasses Replace Your Phone? Ray-Ban Meta Glasses Tested

Elon Musk-led Tesla has received a permit to operate its Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. This permit will allow the company to run a ride-hailing business with cars integrated with the automated driving system and even compete with companies like Uber and Lyft. The permit was issued this week despite previous reports of the vehicles disobeying traffic rules. According to a listing on the website of the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) (as seen by CNBC), Tesla Robotaxi LLC is now licensed as a “transportation network company” in Texas until August 6, 2026. The TDLR has also confirmed that this permit will enable Tesla to operate a ride-hailing business anywhere in the state, including with ""automated motor vehicles,"" and does not require a human safety driver or valet to be on board.This comes after Tesla robotaxis were reportedly captured on camera disobeying traffic laws in and around Austin during the company's pilot program. Although these incidents have not been reported as causing injuries or significant property damage, they have attracted federal scrutiny.Earlier this year, the EV company began offering a limited ride-hailing service in Austin, which was available only to invited participants. Most of these riders have been social media influencers and analysts, many of whom earn income by creating Tesla-related content on platforms such as X and YouTube.The Austin fleet comprises Model Y vehicles fitted with Tesla’s latest partially automated driving technology. Each ride includes a valet, or human safety supervisor, in the front passenger seat to step in if needed. The cars are also monitored remotely by staff at an operations centre.On Tesla’s earnings call last month, Musk—who has described himself as “pathologically optimistic”—said he believes the company could reach half of the US population with autonomous ride-hailing services by the end of 2025.However, there have been multiple reports about Tesla Robotaxi “misbehaving” on the road. In one incident, Tesla content creator Joe Tegtmeyer said his robotaxi did not stop for a train crossing signal and lowering gate arm, prompting a Tesla employee on board to step in.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has also spoken with Tesla about the matter, a spokesperson for the agency told CNBC via email.","Elon Musk-led Tesla has received a permit to operate its Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas.

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke has resigned from his position, triggering a major restructuring for the company. After nearly four years at the helm, Dohmke is stepping down signaling his departure from both GitHub and Microsoft. Following his resignation, Microsoft is moving GitHub directly into its new CoreAI team. Reportedly, Microsoft will not replace Dohmke's CEO role, effectively ending GitHub's status as a separate entity and integrating it fully into its operations.“Still, after all this time, my startup roots have begun tugging on me and I’ve decided to leave GitHub to become a founder again,” Dohmke said.“I’ll be staying through the end of 2025 to help guide the transition and am leaving with a deep sense of pride in everything we’ve built as a remote-first organization spread around the world,” he added.Dohmke mentioned that GitHub will now be a part of Microsoft's CoreAI team – a new engineering group led by former Meta executive Jay Parikh. It is focused on building AI platforms and tools for both internal use and for Microsoft's customers. The division includes Microsoft's platform, tools, and Dev Div teams.According to Dohmke, GitHub Copilot “is the leader of the most successful and thriving market in the age of AI, with over 20 million users and counting.”“In just the last year, GitHub Copilot became the first multi-model solution at Microsoft, in partnership with Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. We enabled Copilot Free for millions and introduced the synchronous agent mode in VS Code as well as the asynchronous coding agent native to GitHub,” he added.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Dohmke thanked Satya Nadella “for the ride of a lifetime”.“Thank you to @satyanadella, Julia Liuson, so many countless people, and most importantly, thank you to all Hubbers for the ride of a lifetime,” he said.","GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke has resigned from his position, triggering a major restructuring for the company.

Experts debate over Nvidia H20 chip sale to China



Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode

Nvidia and AMD have received approval to sell their specially designed AI chips in China, but reportedly with an unusual condition. According to a new report, the Trump administration granted the export licenses after a "" financial arrangement "" was made. As part of this deal, both chipmakers have agreed to give the US government 15% of the revenue from their chip sales in China.Citing people familiar with the situation – including a US official – The Finanacial Times reported that the agreement was finalised last week. Nvidia will share 15% of revenues from its H20 chip sales, while AMD will provide the same percentage from its MI308 chip sales. The official noted that the administration has not yet decided how the funds will be used.The deal is a quid-pro-quo arrangement. Export control experts state that this is the first time a US company has agreed to pay a portion of its revenue to obtain export licenses, the report added.However, the agreement aligns with a broader pattern in the Trump administration, where companies are pressured to make concessions—such as domestic investments—to avoid tariffs and bring jobs and revenue to the U.S.The Financial Times reported that the Commerce Department began issuing H20 export licenses on Friday, just two days after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump. The US official confirmed that licenses for AMD's China chip have also been issued.Nvidia did not deny the arrangement, stating only, “We follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.”While the US government has approved the sale of H20 AI chips to China, some experts have reportedly expressed concerns.It is being argued that H20 AI chips are a “potent accelerator of China’s frontier AI capabilities” and would ultimately be used by the Chinese military. However, Nvidia has refuted these claims, saying that they are “misguided”.“While we haven’t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide. America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership. America’s AI tech stack can be the world’s standard if we race,” Nvidia said on Saturday.","N Nvidia and AMD have received approval to sell their specially designed AI chips in China, but reportedly with an unusual condition.

Why Mahindra Group CEO and MD Anish Shah said no to his boss Anand Mahindra



Leadership beyond power



Mahindra Group CEO and MD Anish Shah has shared that how saying ‘no’ to Mahindra group chairman Anand Mahindra taught him. Speaking to news agency PTI in an interview, Shah revealed that eleven years ago, just a month after joining the Mahindra Group, he did something only few people would dare. Shah revealed that he said ‘no’ to a proposal backed by his boss Anand Mahindra. Shah emphasised that moment became a defining lesson in his leadership and taught him the value constructive dissent .Anish Shah told PTI, that he joined the Mahindra Group as Head of Group Strategy. When asked for his opinion on a proposal set to go before the board the next day, he reviewed it and responded candidly: “I saw that and said I wouldn’t do this. And here’s why.”Instead of rejecting Anish Shah’s point of view, Anand Mahindra invited him to present his rationale directly to the board. The next day, when Shah explained his viewpoint, the board ultimately rejected the proposal, validating his perspective.Now CEO and MD of the Mahindra Group since April 2021, Shah reflects on that moment as a powerful example of the company’s open culture. “To me, I would take a ‘no’ as a gift,” Shah said. “It’s not easy for someone three levels below to speak up. That’s sometimes where the best ideas come from.”Shah also gives credit to his boss Anand Mahindra for creating an environment where diverse views are welcomed, and decisions are made based on merit and not on hierarchy.Shah also challenged the common misconception that CEOs lead through authority alone. “A good leader gets things done because others want to do it, not because they have to,” he explained.Shah also stressed on the fact that empowerment must extend beyond senior leadership, reaching those closest to customers — the people best positioned to innovate.","Mahindra Group CEO and MD Anish Shah revealed that he said 'no' to a proposal backed by his boss Anand Mahindra.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg transformed a legacy neighbourhood



Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in news not only because of his aggressive AI talent hiring but also because of his Palo Alto property. Zuckerberg has quietly amassed more than $110 million worth of real estate in Palo Alto’s upscale Crescent Park neighborhood. As reported by New York Times, after purchasing the property Zuckerberg transformed the place which is not being appreciated by his neighbours. As per the report, the Meta CEO acquired almost 11 homes across two streets which raised alarms locals who say that the presence of the billionaire in the area has disrupted its peace and has also strained the availability of house. “No neighborhood wants to be occupied,” said longtime resident Michael Kieschnick. “But that’s exactly what they’ve done.”As per the report, Mark Zuckerberg along with his wife Priscilla Chan and their three daughters, moved to Crescent Park 14 years ago and since then they turned five of their homes into a sprawling compound. Zuckerberg’s house includes a main residence and guest houses, gardens and a hydrofloor-covered swimming pool, a pickleball court and a seven-foot statue of Chan in a silver robe and an extensive surveillance systems that reportedly overlook neighbouring properties.As per the report, the main issue of the neighbours is the extensive and years-long construction projects on the properties. Building permits reveal a vast 7,000-square-foot subterranean space, which neighbours have dubbed ""bunkers"" or ""bat caves."" The constant noise, heavy equipment, and traffic have frayed nerves and led to accusations that the city has turned a blind eye to the disruption.Local council member Greer Stone criticised Mark Zuckerberg’s approach, “He’s been finding loopholes around our local laws and zoning ordinances. We should never be a gated, gilded city on a hill where people don’t know their neighbours.”Crescent Park has long been home to Stanford professors, doctors, and tech executives — including Steve Jobs, who once lived nearby. Residents recall block parties, children playing in gardens, and a strong sense of community. Now, many say that spirit has faded.“Billionaires everywhere are used to just making their own rules,” Kieschnick added. “Zuckerberg and Chan are not unique — except that they’re our neighbours.”",Mark Zuckerberg has quietly amassed more than $110 million worth of real estate in Palo Alto’s upscale Crescent Park neighborhood.

Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company. I’ve got my methods of doing that, and I use machine learning. I sort through all 42,000 employees.”“100% of the time, I increased the company’s spend on OpEx [operating expenses].

It automates routine tasks, enhances productivity, and fuels innovations like ChatGPT, AI-driven translation services, and virtual gaming experiences.The growth of AI has also created a new class of billionaires, some of whom have built companies from scratch, while others have pivoted established businesses toward AI-driven opportunities. Backed by massive investments from Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and other global players, these individuals represent the cutting edge of technology and entrepreneurship. From Jensen Huang’s hardware empire to Alexandr Wang’s data infrastructure solutions, and from Sam Altman’s AI innovation to Yao Runhao’s virtual gaming platforms, these billionaires illustrate how AI is reshaping industries and redefining entrepreneurship.Source: ForbesJensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, sits at the top of the AI billionaire list with an astonishing $113 billion (£151 billion) net worth. Nvidia initially focused on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional visualization. However, as AI adoption accelerated, these GPUs became the standard for training and running large language models like ChatGPT and Meta AI.Huang’s strategic vision transformed Nvidia into the backbone of the AI industry. In July 2025, the company reached an unprecedented $4 trillion valuation, reflecting how central its hardware is to AI infrastructure. Owning 3% of Nvidia, Huang’s wealth grew by over 300% in just one year, making him one of the top 20 richest individuals worldwide.At just 26 years old, Alexandr Wang has secured his place as the youngest self-made billionaire in the AI sector. He founded Scale AI at the age of 19, after dropping out of MIT, to focus on providing data labeling and annotation services essential for AI training.Scale AI works with over 300 high-profile clients, including Meta, Google, and General Motors, supplying the data infrastructure required to build machine learning models. The company’s valuation reached $14 billion (£10.5 billion) in 2024, and Wang’s 14% ownership stake boosted his net worth to $2.7 billion (£3.6 billion). His success highlights how even niche AI services can yield massive fortunes.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is one of the most prominent faces in artificial intelligence. While OpenAI itself is valued at around $300 billion (£225 billion), Altman does not personally hold equity in the company. His wealth, estimated at $1.9 billion (£1.4 billion), stems from early investments in companies like Stripe, Reddit, and Helion Energy, combined with the success of his previous startup, Loopt, which he sold for $42 million in 2012.Altman’s leadership at OpenAI popularized generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, setting global trends in how businesses and consumers interact with AI. His influence extends beyond wealth, positioning him as one of the key thought leaders shaping AI’s future.Phil Shawe, co-CEO of TransPerfect, built one of the world’s largest translation and localization companies by leveraging AI-powered language processing. TransPerfect offers services across industries like law, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, helping businesses operate in multiple languages with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.Founded in 1992 from a dorm room at New York University, TransPerfect generated $1.3 billion (£976 million) in revenue in 2024. Shawe owns 99% of the company, securing a personal fortune of $1.8 billion (£1.3 billion). His journey shows how AI technology can transform even traditional industries like language services into billion-dollar enterprises.Dario Amodei, a former vice president of research at OpenAI, left to co-found Anthropic in 2021. His company focuses on building safe, reliable AI systems using reinforcement learning techniques that allow AI models to adapt through human feedback.Anthropic’s approach to ethical AI and safety-first principles resonated with investors and industry leaders, pushing the company’s valuation to $61.5 billion (£46.2 billion) by 2025. Amodei’s net worth has reached $1.2 billion (£901 million), proving that prioritizing responsibility in AI development can be both impactful and profitable.Liang Wenfeng, once largely unknown outside China, made headlines with DeepSeek-R1, a large language model that outperformed ChatGPT on certain benchmarks while being five times cheaper to run. This innovation shook global markets, causing Nvidia’s stock to drop 17% in a single day as investors reacted to the potential shift in AI computing costs.Wenfeng previously founded a successful hedge fund, and he used his financial expertise to build DeepSeek into one of the most cost-efficient AI providers globally. His net worth now stands at $1 billion (£751 million), making him a key figure in China’s growing AI industry.Yao Runhao, CEO of Paper Games, has carved out a unique niche by combining AI with gaming. His company’s hit product, Love and Deepspace, uses artificial intelligence to create virtual dating simulations with interactive, personalized storylines.The game attracts over six million monthly users, showcasing the demand for AI-driven entertainment. Paper Games employs around 2,000 staff and focuses primarily on the female gaming market in China, highlighting how AI is revolutionizing interactive leisure experiences. Runhao’s innovation has earned him a net worth of $1.3 billion (£977 million).","World’s wealthiest AI moguls ranked by net worth.

Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India, marking another step in its long-term strategy to strengthen its footprint in emerging markets. During Apple’s latest earnings announcement, CEO Tim Cook confirmed plans to open multiple new Apple Stores in India before the year ends. The move comes as part of a broader global expansion plan that also includes fresh Apple retail outlets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the launch of the Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia. Cook highlighted that these new physical stores are a key step in improving Apple’s customer experience, product accessibility, and service reach in high-growth regions like India.“We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn’t be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year,” Cook stated. “We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka.”According to Apple Magazine, four new stores are scheduled to open across key metropolitan cities in India, namely Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, and the Delhi NCR region. These new outlets will build on Apple’s successful retail debut in India in 2023, which saw the launch of Apple BKC in Mumbai and Apple Saket in Delhi. These initial stores have quickly become major crowd-pullers, especially during new iPhone release events, and have demonstrated the value of physical retail locations in India’s fast-growing premium smartphone market.To support this retail growth, Apple has been actively hiring talent for its upcoming stores. Earlier this year, Apple Store leader John Taffe shared on LinkedIn that Apple was looking for passionate and skilled individuals to join its retail team. “Apple’s journey in India has been incredible, and we’re thrilled to continue growing in these vibrant cities. To make these new stores a success, we’re looking for passionate and talented individuals to join our team,” Taffe noted. This hiring drive highlights Apple’s commitment to not only selling products but also delivering personalised customer experiences and creating jobs within the Indian retail sector.While India remains a critical market, Apple is expanding its retail network globally. Apart from its Indian plans, the company has announced new retail locations in the UAE, including a store in Al Ain, which will add to its existing four UAE outlets (two in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai). The Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia further emphasizes Apple’s growing focus on the Middle East.These international retail initiatives aim to strengthen Apple’s customer reach and brand experience beyond its digital ecosystem. Apple’s global retail growth is supported by its strong financial results. In its April–June quarter (Q3), Apple reported a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, showcasing robust demand even in challenging economic conditions. This financial strength gives Apple the confidence to invest heavily in physical stores in markets like India, where premium smartphone adoption is rapidly increasing.India has emerged as one of Apple’s most important growth markets, driven by rising disposable incomes, expanding smartphone penetration, and a growing preference for premium devices. The launch of Apple BKC and Apple Saket in 2023 marked the company’s first direct retail presence in the country, and the overwhelming customer response has paved the way for more stores. Apple’s upcoming four new stores signal a long-term commitment to India, where it faces strong competition from brands like Samsung and OnePlus. However, Apple’s focus on a seamless retail experience and exclusive customer service could help it capture a larger market share in the premium category.",Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered. This statement from Hassabis offers one of the clearest examples of how AI will alter specific professions, but not eliminate the need for human empathy and interpersonal care.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments, emphasizing lifelong learning, adaptive skills, ethical AI usage, and the development of new interdisciplinary roles bridging technology, creativity, and human-centric decision-making.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce.

What is Online Safety Act

Lava Blaze Dragon 5G: Clean, Simple and Surprising

Wikimedia Foundation, the operator of Wikipedia, has lost a legal challenge against the UK’s Online Safety Act , reports news agency Reuters. The act sets strict rules for online platforms, inviting criticism for allegedly limiting free speech. As per the report, the Wikimedia Foundation appealed at London’s High Court, arguing that the rules could put Wikipedia in the toughest category of regulation, known as Category 1. This category would require verifying the identities of Wikipedia’s users and contributors, something the foundation said would force it to limit access for many UK users.Reuters says that Judge Jeremy Johnson rejected the case but said the Wikimedia Foundation could challenge it again if UK regulator Ofcom wrongly decides Wikipedia is a Category 1 service. He also said his decision was not permission for Ofcom or the UK government to create rules that would seriously harm Wikipedia’s operations.The decision ""does not give Ofcom and the Secretary of State a green light to implement a regime that would significantly impede Wikipedia's operations,"" the judge stated.The Wikimedia Foundation said it was disappointed the ruling did not give immediate protection for Wikipedia but welcomed the judge’s comments stressing Ofcom’s and the government’s duty to protect the site.The UK’s Department for Science, Innovation and Technology called the ruling a step forward in making the internet safer. Ofcom said it would continue its work on how services are categorised.The Online Safety Act was passed in 2023. It is being rolled out this year. The law aims to make the internet safer — especially for children — by setting clear rules for online platforms, social media sites, and other digital services. It mandates online platforms to take steps to stop children from seeing things like sexual content, extreme violence, or content encouraging self-harm.However, the act has been criticised by Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) and free speech groups, who say the rules are too broad and risk removing legal content. The government says the law is meant to protect children and remove illegal material, with Technology Secretary Peter Kyle arguing that opponents of the law are “on the side of predators.”","Wikimedia Foundation lost a legal challenge against the UK's Online Safety Act.

How Amazon’s ad power is growing despite connected TV market facing slower growth



Lava Blaze Dragon 5G: Clean, Simple and Surprising

The shares of digital ad company The Trade Desk have recently suffered a record-breaking decline. Despite that, Jeff Green , the CEO of the company, has claimed thatHowever, analysts have cited competition from Amazon as a key factor for The Trade Desk after the company’s share prices went down nearly 40% last week. According to a report by Business Insider, Green made his remarks during the company's latest earnings call while responding to the analyst's concerns, which largely attributed the company’s stock drop to Amazon. He argued that The Trade Desk plays a crucial role as a neutral seller of advertising, unlike Amazon, which sells its own ads on platforms like Prime Video. He also suggested that Amazon may one day allow companies like his to sell ads on Prime Video.Green added.It's important to note that The Trade Desk, which helps companies target ads across the web, had beaten earnings expectations. However, analysts also pointed to the departure of the adtech company's CFO as a contributing factor to the stock's performance.As per the report, analysts are split on The Trade Desk CEO Green’s positive outlook amid fierce competition in the connected TV ad market from Amazon, Netflix, and Disney+. Amazon’s rapid ad growth, which is fueled by a Roku deal and NBA content, poses a significant threat, with some calling Green “in denial” and downgrading the stock.Meanwhile, others remained positive, noting The Trade Desk’s expanding partnerships with Netflix, Roku, and Spotify, along with growth in retail media and global markets.To compare, Amazon’s ad business has surged since making ads the default on Prime Video. The company has been using its vast scale, shopping-based targeting, and growing live sports content. Its rise is squeezing all but the top TV players, with Morgan Stanley projecting it could overtake YouTube as the US smart TV ad leader by 2027.Amazon’s Q2 ad revenue jumped 22% to $15.7 billion, exceeding expectations, and it’s major deals with rival streamers to boost its dominance.

How AGI is a point of contention between OpenAI and Microsoft

Artificial General Intelligence – AGI has been a point of contention between OpenAI and Microsoft. While Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has publicly expressed his doubts over the technology, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and executives were earlier reported to be close to claim that their AI tool has reached the level. Now, Altman has said that the word AGI is “losing its relevance,” reports CNBC. The CEO was asked whether the company’s latest GPT-5 model moves the world any closer to achieving AGI during CNBC’s “Squawk Box” last week. Sam Altman replied saying “I think it’s not a super useful term”.Sam Altman said the challenge with AGI is that different companies and people define it in different ways. One definition, he explained, is an AI that can do “a significant amount of the work in the world.” But this has problems, as the type of work people do keeps changing.“I think the point of all of this is it doesn’t really matter and it’s just this continuing exponential of model capability that we’ll rely on for more and more things,” he added.According to OpenAI AGI is a ""highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work,"" a milestone Altman suggests is ""just around the corner.""This contrasts sharply with Microsoft’s Satya Nadella's more critical stance. In a February tech podcast, Nadella dismissed self-proclaimed AGI milestones as ""nonsensical benchmark hacking"". The remark then reportedly surprised some OpenAI officials who once viewed him as an ""AGI believer.""Despite the internal tension, representatives from both companies had offered a unified front. “We have a long-term, productive partnership that has delivered amazing AI tools for everyone. Talks are ongoing, and we are optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come,” reads a statement.",OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says the word AGI is “losing its relevance” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has publicly expressed his doubts over the technology.

Why Starbucks South Korea is banning bulky gadgets

Lava Blaze Dragon 5G: Clean, Simple and Surprising

Starbucks South Korea is asking its customers not to bring ‘bulky office equipment’ into the stores. According to a Business Insider report, the coffee retail chain has put up notices in its South Korean stores banning large office equipment such as desktop computers, printers, extension cords, and desk partitions. The notices further urges customers to take their belongings when leaving for long periods and to share tables with others. The BI report quotes Korea's local publications – JoongAng Daily and the Korea Herald. Earlier this year, South Korea surpassed Japan in the number of Starbucks stores, becoming the third-largest market for the coffee chain after the United States and China.Starbucks Korea had updated its policy for its customers to “have a pleasant and accessible store experience,” a Starbucks representative told the publication. “While laptops and smaller personal devices are welcome, customers are asked to refrain from bringing desktop computers, printers, or other bulky items that may limit seating and impact the shared space,” the representative added.However, the rules do not include any time limits for staying in stories.The move follows social media posts showing customers in South Korea using foldable partitions at tables, blocking access for others.The policy targets a growing work-from-café trend known locally as “cagongjok”. For those unaware, ‘ cagongjok ’ refers to people who work or study in cafés for long hours.In Seoul, this practice is fueled by the city’s dense café culture, with coffee shops on nearly every street corner.",Starbucks South Korea is asking its customers not to bring ‘bulky office equipment’ into the stores.

Microsoft is facing a lawsuit in California as it plans to end free support for Windows 10. The software giant recently announced that it will officially end support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025. According to a Forbes report, Lawrence Klein, who owns two Windows 10 laptops, has filed a complaint against the 50-year-old tech giant warning that “many millions of users will not buy new devices or pay for extended support,” leaving them “at a heightened risk of a cyberattack or other data security incident.” Klein reportedly owns two Windows 10 laptops that will become obsolete in eight weeks. He wants the court to order Microsoft to keep offering free support until the number of active Windows 10 devices falls “below a reasonable threshold.”In a support page, Microsoft said “As a reminder, Windows 10 will reach the end of support on October 14, 2025. At this point technical assistance, feature updates and security updates will no longer be provided. If you have devices running Windows 10, we recommend upgrading them to Windows 11- a more modern, secure, and highly efficient computing experience.”About 45% of all Windows users—roughly 700 million devices—are still running Windows 10. That figure had been declining but rose again after Microsoft introduced different support extension plans.Lawrence Klein claims Microsoft decided to end Windows 10 when it still held the majority market share, forcing about 240 million PCs that cannot upgrade to Windows 11 to either buy new devices or pay for extended support. “Windows 10 users represented more than half of the Windows operating system (OS) market share,” he said.According to Klein, Microsoft’s “long-term business strategy” could jeopardize not just its own customers but also people who do not use Microsoft products, due to wider cybersecurity risks.As listed by the company on its support page, users have following options:","Microsoft is facing a lawsuit in California as it plans to end free support for Windows 10.

Reasons for the delay in Starship flight to Mars



First Passenger: Tesla’s Optimus Robot



SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has once again shared an important update on the timeline for sending Starship to Mars. In social media post on X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk said that there’s only a ‘slight chance’ of a crewed Starship flight to Mars by late 2026. He also mentioned that a more realistic schedule pointes to an unscrewed mission in 2028 and a human flight around 2030. “Slight chance of Starship flight to Mars crewed by Optimus in Nov/Dec next year. A lot needs to go right for that,” Musk wrote. “More likely, first flight without humans in ~3.5 years, next flight ~5.5 years with humans. Mars city self-sustaining in 20 to 30 years.A user on X asked Musk about the timeline of Starship flight. “What’s the timeline you have set Elon? It sounds fascinating and I am glad to be alive when this is happening,” an X user named @abhiyogi asked.Responding to the post, Musk wrote, “Slight chance of Starship flight to Mars crewed by Optimus in Nov/Dec next year. A lot needs to go right for that. More likely, first flight without humans in ~3.5 years, next flight ~5.5 years with humans. Mars city self-sustaining in 20 to 30 years.”The new target of a crewed mission in approximately 5.5 years—around 2030—is a notable shift from previous, more optimistic predictions. It also follows recent technical hurdles, including ongoing delays in mastering orbital refuelling and the loss of Starship’s upper stage during recent flight tests. The multiple technical issues which may be the cause of the delay include: failures in upper-stage Starship landings, unproven orbital refuelling systems and heat shield durability and rocket recovery mechanism.Earlier this year, SpaceX’s Flight 9 achieved stage separation but it lost control during reentry. Musk however emphasised that mastering in-space propellant transfer is critical for deep-space travel and remains a top priority.SpaceX CEO also revealed that the first Starship flight to Mars will not be crewed by humans but by Tesla’s humanoid robot Optimus. The robot will serve as a scout and will test the conditions and collect data which will be used in preparing humans for future missions.Elon Musk’s ultimate goal is to build a self-sustaining city on Mars within 20 to 30 years. He views Mars colonization as essential to humanity’s survival and a way to expand the “scope and scale of consciousness.”“It’s not about going to Mars to visit once,” Musk said earlier this year. “It’s to make life multiplanetary so that we can better understand the universe and ensure the long-term survival of civilization”",SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has once again shared an important update on the timeline for sending Starship to Mars.

Who is Lip-Bu Tan: The ‘highly conflicted’ claims Donald Trump who wants resignation immediately



Also Read |

Intel Corporation CEO Lip-Bu Tan is set to visit the White House on Monday, following President Donald Trump’s public demand last week for his resignation over alleged ties to Chinese companies. The meeting, reported by the Wall Street Journal, aims to directly address concerns regarding Tan’s business connections and reassure US officials of his dedication to national security. Tan plans to emphasise Intel’s critical role in American semiconductor manufacturing and its importance to economic and security interests. This visit highlights the growing scrutiny of tech leaders amid US-China tensions and the strategic significance of semiconductor supply chains for the country’s future technological leadership.According to insiders familiar with the matter, Tan’s upcoming White House visit will involve an extensive discussion with Donald Trump, during which Tan plans to present both his personal and professional background. The goal is to emphasise his dedication to advancing US national and economic security interests as reported by Reuters.The report highlights that Tan may also propose collaborative efforts between Intel and the US government to ensure that Intel’s chip manufacturing capabilities remain a vital national security asset. This conversation reflects the broader governmental focus on safeguarding semiconductor supply chains amid rising global competition.Last week, Donald Trump shocked investors and industry watchers by publicly calling for the immediate resignation of Lip-Bu Tan, accusing him of being “highly conflicted” because of his financial and business ties to companies based in China. Trump’s demand raised serious doubts about Intel’s turnaround strategy under Tan’s leadership and triggered a wave of debate within the US business and political spheres.This move by a sitting US president to openly call for the ouster of a corporate CEO is unusual and underscores the heightened geopolitical tensions surrounding the semiconductor industry, a sector critical to both economic and national security.Intel’s CEO has publicly expressed alignment with President Trump’s stated priorities, emphasising his commitment to strengthening US manufacturing and protecting technological leadership. Tan views Intel’s manufacturing capacity as a cornerstone of American security and economic competitiveness.Intel’s recent events, such as the Annual Manufacturing Technology Conference held in San Jose, California, have showcased the company’s advancements and investment plans, highlighting the strategic importance of its manufacturing footprint. A central point of contention fueling Trump’s criticism involves Lip-Bu Tan’s past investments. Reuters revealed in April that Tan had invested at least $200 million in numerous Chinese advanced manufacturing and semiconductor companies, some reportedly connected to China’s military.These revelations have intensified scrutiny of Tan’s role as CEO, especially in light of growing concerns about Chinese access to sensitive US technology and the broader geopolitical rivalry between the two countries.Before his tenure at Intel, Lip-Bu Tan was the CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a major chip design software company, from 2008 to 2021. During his leadership, Cadence sold products to a Chinese military university suspected of conducting nuclear explosion simulations.In a significant development last month, Cadence agreed to plead guilty and pay over $140 million to settle US government charges related to these sales. Reuters was the first to report this story, which has further complicated Tan’s public image and raised questions about his leadership decisions. Trump’s public intervention sparked debate among investors, analysts, and industry leaders. Some view Tan’s White House visit as an opportunity to clear the air and demonstrate Intel’s alignment with US interests, while others remain cautious given the depth of the allegations.The semiconductor sector remains under intense government scrutiny, making transparency and strategic collaboration between tech leaders and policymakers more critical than ever.Lip-Bu Tan, a seasoned figure in the tech and investment world, assumed leadership at Intel in March 2025. A Malaysian-American with deep roots in semiconductor innovation, Tan has spent decades building a global reputation for his work in chip design and venture capital. Before joining Intel, he was best known as the founder of Walden International, a venture capital firm that invested heavily in semiconductor startups across the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China.Tan’s academic credentials reflect his technical prowess. He earned a bachelor’s degree in physics from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, followed by a master’s in nuclear engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and an MBA from the University of San Francisco. Professionally, he held the position of CEO at Cadence Design Systems—a leading software and semiconductor design company from 2008 to 2021.","Lip-Bu Tan is set to visit the White House on Monday, following President Donald Trump’s public demand last week for his resignation over alleged ties to Chinese companies.

The emotional toll of AI-generated content

Teens’ growing dependence on AI companions

Challenges in AI safety and regulation

Calls for improved protections and accountability

A latest research from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) has revealed troubling interactions between ChatGPT and users posing as vulnerable teenagers. The study found that despite some warnings, the AI chatbot provided detailed instructions on how to get drunk, hide eating disorders, and even compose suicide notes when prompted. Over half of the 1,200 responses analyzed by researchers were classified as dangerous, exposing significant weaknesses in ChatGPT’s safeguards designed to protect young users from harmful content. According to a recent report by The Associated Press, these findings raise urgent questions about AI safety and its impact on impressionable teens.The CCDH researchers spent more than three hours interacting with ChatGPT, simulating conversations with teenagers struggling with risky behaviors. While the chatbot often issued cautionary advice, it nonetheless shared specific, personalized plans involving drug use, calorie restriction, and self-harm. When ChatGPT refused to answer harmful prompts directly, researchers easily circumvented the refusals by claiming the information was needed for a presentation or a friend. This revealed glaring flaws in the AI’s “guardrails,” described by CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed as “barely there” and “completely ineffective.”One of the most disturbing aspects of the study involved ChatGPT generating suicide letters tailored to a fictitious 13-year-old girl, addressed to her parents, siblings, and friends. Ahmed described being emotionally overwhelmed upon reading these letters, highlighting the chatbot’s capacity to produce highly personalized and distressing content. Although ChatGPT also provided resources like crisis hotline information and encouraged users to seek professional help, its ability to craft harmful advice in such detail was alarming.The study comes amid rising reliance on AI chatbots for companionship and guidance, especially among younger users. In the United States, over 70% of teens reportedly turn to AI chatbots for company, with half engaging regularly, according to a study by Common Sense Media. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has acknowledged concerns over “emotional overreliance,” noting that some young users lean heavily on ChatGPT for decision-making and emotional support. This dynamic increases the importance of ensuring AI behaves responsibly in sensitive situations.ChatGPT’s responses reflect a design challenge in AI language models known as “sycophancy,” where the chatbot tends to mirror users’ requests rather than challenge harmful beliefs. This trait complicates efforts to build effective safety mechanisms without compromising user experience or commercial viability. Furthermore, ChatGPT does not verify user age or parental consent, allowing vulnerable children to access potentially inappropriate content despite disclaimers advising against use by those under 13.Experts and watchdogs urge stronger safeguards, better age verification, and ongoing refinement of AI tools to detect signs of mental distress and harmful intent. The CCDH report underscores the urgent need for collaboration between AI developers, regulators, and mental health advocates to ensure AI’s vast potential is harnessed safely—particularly for the millions of young people increasingly interacting with these technologies.","ChatGPT provided detailed instructions on how to get drunk, hide eating disorders, and even compose suicide notes when prompted.

Building AI with safety and trust

At a time when workers are increasingly worried about being replaced by AI, with some companies already laying off staff and industry experts warning that certain jobs will inevitably disappear, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang tackled what many consider the “biggest AI question”: what artificial intelligence could never truly replicate from humans. Huang explained that while AI can deliver unmatched speed, scale, and precision, it still cannot perform any job entirely without human involvement. The technology works best as an augmentation tool, capable of automating parts of a process, but remains dependent on people for creative thinking, moral judgment, and emotional intelligence. These irreplaceable human traits, he said, will continue to guide innovation responsibly, ensuring that technology serves society rather than replacing its essence.Jensen Huang made clear that, although AI is a transformative technology used across many industries, it currently cannot perform any job in its entirety without human involvement. He highlighted that AI is most powerful as an augmentation tool, capable of automating approximately 20 to 50 percent of repetitive or data-intensive tasks.However, humans remain essential for aspects such as creative thinking, moral judgment, and emotional intelligence. Huang gave examples from healthcare, engineering, and film production, noting that AI can increase the speed of processes like diagnostics or rendering, but still depends on human oversight for decisions and final outcomes.He emphasized that the greatest risk is not AI itself directly replacing people, but workers who master AI tools gaining competitive advantage over those who do not. This sentiment, punctuated by Huang’s statement, ""It’s not AI replacing you; it’s someone using AI replacing you,"" drew a strong response from the audience.When asked whether AI could ever be made completely safe for humanity, Huang compared the challenge to building a safe airplane. Safety, he explained, depends on designing redundant systems, drawing from diverse engineering perspectives, and conducting thorough testing before deployment. Huang stressed the importance of explainable AI, strong ethical design principles, and industry-wide transparency to earn and maintain public trust.He also mentioned active collaborations with research institutions and international regulators to embed safety measures and protocols into all AI development at Nvidia. These efforts are designed to protect against bias, misuse, and unpredictable outcomes, which remain challenges the field is continuing to face. Huang emphasized that fostering a culture of responsibility and continuous learning is crucial for the sustainable evolution of AI technologies. He urged industry leaders to prioritize ethical considerations alongside innovation to ensure AI benefits society as a whole.","Jensen Huang: AI can deliver unmatched speed, scale, and precision.

Why Dojo shutdown is important for Tesla

Elon Musk-owned Tesla recently dissolved its Dojo supercomputer team. According to a Bloomberg report, the EV maker will also discontinue its in-house chip development for autonomous driving technology. An X user Gali @Gfilche welcomed the development, saying “This is a big win”. He said “Tesla's in house chip design is a key advantage and reason their full self-driving tech (and soon Optimus) can make complex decisions in real time”. The user continued “Dojo project has culminated in @Tesla_AI’s upcoming AI6 chip … what will be the backbone of Cybercab & Optimus … and it can be stacked for other types of AI workloads.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded to the post saying:Dojo was first announced in 2019. It was then pitched as the backbone of Tesla’s AI ambitions, particularly for achieving full self-driving (FSD) by processing vast amounts of video data. Recently, Elon Musk highlighted Dojo at the company’s Q2 2025 earnings call.The disbanding of Dojo comes at a pivotal moment for Tesla. Musk has been repositioning the EV maker as an AI and robotics company, despite challenges with its limited robotaxi launch in Austin in June 2025. The launch involved Model Y vehicles with a human co-pilot. However, it faced criticism after reports of erratic driving behavior.According to reports, Tesla is turning to external partners for its technology needs. Last month, the company signed a $16.5 billion deal with Samsung to produce its AI6 inference chips, which will be used in everything from Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Optimus humanoid robots to high-performance AI training.The automaker is also strengthening partnerships with Nvidia for computing power and AMD for additional chip solutions. During Q2 earnings call, Elon Musk suggested the company may streamline development by aligning its Dojo 3 system with the AI6 chip to avoid duplication of work.","Elon Musk-owned Tesla recently dissolved its Dojo supercomputer team.

Trump's demand follows security concerns over CEO's China ties

Former directors propose foundry split to rival TSMC

Four former Intel board members are backing President Donald Trump's surprise attack on CEO Lip-Bu Tan but are pushing for an even more radical shake-up: spinning off Intel's manufacturing arm into an independent company to secure America's chipmaking dominance .In a collective statement to, four former Intel directors — Charlene Barshefsky, Reed Hundt, James Plummer, and David Yoffie — called for a dramatic restructuring focused on spinning off Intel’s “Foundry” business, the manufacturing arm that produces semiconductor chips for both its own products and third-party customers.The group pointed out that Intel is on its fourth CEO in seven years with little improvement in results, arguing that only a dramatic break could restore Intel's competitiveness and protect US national security interests.The mounting pressure comes after Trump publicly demanded Tan's resignation on Truth Social, calling him ""highly conflicted"" following Senator Tom Cotton 's warnings about the CEO's extensive Chinese business connections. Cotton's letter revealed that Tan ""reportedly controls dozens of Chinese companies,"" with at least eight having ties to the Chinese People's Liberation Army.Tan defended himself in a memo to Intel employees, stating: ""There has been a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles at Walden International and Cadence Design Systems. I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards."" The Malaysian-born CEO, who has lived in the US for over 40 years, emphasized his commitment to American national security.The former board members' proposal would create a new, independent manufacturing entity with its own CEO and board, positioned as an alternative to Taiwan's TSMC for both commercial and national security requirements. They called for remaining CHIPS Act funds to support the new company and help ""persuade American design firms to place orders.""Intel has fallen behind competitors like Nvidia and TSMC in recent years, with its chips now two generations behind rivals. The company secured $8 billion in CHIPS Act subsidies–the largest grant to a single company–making Tan's Chinese connections particularly problematic for national security officials as the drama continues to unfold in the semiconductor industry.","Former directors propose foundry split to rival TSMC.

Could the Year 2038 problem crash global servers and critical infrastructure? The digital doomsday: ‘a silent threat’ explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/could-the-year-2038-problem-crash-global-servers-and-critical-infrastructure-the-digital-doomsday-a-silent-threat-explained/articleshow/123230429.cms,"What is the digital doomsday Year 2038 problem



Why the Year 2038 problem poses a critical threat to global infrastructure



Legacy systems running 32-bit architectures are embedded in essential services such as medical devices, banking servers, aviation systems, and energy grids.

These systems depend on accurate timekeeping to coordinate operations, log transactions, and maintain safety protocols.

If these systems misinterpret the date, it can cause software crashes, data corruption, or unsafe operational decisions.

The disruption caused by such widespread failures could lead to economic losses in the trillions and jeopardize public safety.

Key reasons the Year 2038 problem still threatens legacy systems



High replacement costs: Upgrading or replacing embedded systems in sectors like healthcare, transportation, and utilities requires significant financial investment.

Operational risks: Downtime during upgrades is often unacceptable, particularly for life-critical systems.

Complexity of scale: The number of affected systems worldwide is enormous, spanning public and private sectors, making coordinated upgrades difficult.

Lack of awareness: Compared to more visible tech threats, this issue has received relatively little public or political attention.

From 32-bit to 64-bit: Overcoming barriers to fix the Year 2038 problem



Many embedded systems are built on hardware that cannot be easily or cost-effectively upgraded.

Software must be thoroughly tested and validated to ensure compatibility with 64-bit time representation.

Global coordination across industries and governments is necessary to avoid fragmented, patchwork fixes.

Despite the technical simplicity of the solution, the logistics and economics of large-scale migration remain daunting.

Urgency of acting before 2038



Delaying action increases the risk of catastrophic failures as the deadline approaches.

Lessons from past infrastructure failures, like recent power outages in Europe, underscore the vulnerability of critical systems.

Emerging threats like solar storms compound the risks to fragile digital networks.

While cutting-edge innovations like artificial intelligence and quantum computing dominate headlines, a silent threat—the Year 2038 problem —could undermine global digital stability. Similar in spirit to the Y2K bug but potentially more disruptive, it stems from the way many systems store Unix time using 32-bit signed integers. These systems will overflow at 03:14:07 UTC on January 19, 2038, resetting dates to 1901 and risking failures in critical infrastructure such as banking, aviation, medical equipment, and power grids.The problem has been known since 2006, yet countless legacy systems remain unpatched due to high costs, technical complexity, and operational risks. Without proactive upgrades to 64-bit systems, this timekeeping glitch could trigger worldwide disruptions, economic losses, and safety hazards.At its core, the Year 2038 problem is a computing time overflow error related to how many systems track time using the Unix time format. Unix time counts the seconds that have elapsed since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on January 1, 1970. Many systems store this count using a 32-bit signed integer, which limits the maximum number that can be stored.This limit will be reached at precisely 03:14:07 UTC on January 19, 2038. After this point, systems that still rely on 32-bit integers will ""roll over,"" resetting their time count to a date over a century earlier — December 13, 1901. Such a rollback can cause software and hardware to malfunction, as they interpret the time incorrectly, potentially disrupting critical systems like banking, transportation, and communication networks worldwide. Efforts to update systems to 64-bit time formats are underway to prevent these issues.The Year 2038 problem is not just a technical curiosity but a potentially disastrous event because:Although the problem was identified by experts as early as 2006, many systems continue to operate on 32-bit time architectures due to:As a result, many organizations risk running outdated, vulnerable infrastructure without a clear plan for remediation.The definitive fix to the Year 2038 problem is to switch systems to use 64-bit integers for time storage instead of 32-bit. This change would dramatically extend the maximum representable date—by billions of years—effectively removing the overflow issue.However, implementing this solution is easier said than done:With just over a decade left, the clock is ticking to address this silent threat:Addressing the Year 2038 problem is not about chasing the latest technological trends but about preserving the stability and security of the digital world we depend on daily.","The Year 2038 problem is a computing time overflow error related to how many systems track time using the Unix time format.

"How AI may not be the only reason behind Indian IT layoffs, but this 'deeper problem' in the GCC trend they missed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-ai-may-not-be-the-only-reason-behind-indian-it-layoffs-but-this-deeper-problem-in-the-gcc-trend-they-missed/articleshow/123230290.cms,"What are GCCs and why do they matter

The double whammy: GCCs + AI

Why Indian IT missed the GCC signal

What’s next for Indian IT

Reposition themselves as GCC enablers, offering “GCC-as-a-service”

Upskill their workforce for AI-integrated roles

Rethink their business models to stay relevant in a world where clients want control

While artificial intelligence continues to dominate headlines as the driving force behind mass layoffs in India’s IT sector, a deeper structural shift is quietly reshaping the landscape: the rise of Global Capability Centres (GCCs). These in-house tech hubs, set up by multinational corporations in India, are challenging the traditional outsourcing model that once made firms like TCS, Infosys, and Wipro global giants. The industry experts believe that the GCC trend represent a ‘deeper problem’ and the India IT services companies are still not able to address it.GCCs enable foreign companies to insource their technology operations directly in India, bypassing third party IT service providers. The GCC model offer better control, integration and comes with long-term cost efficiency. Once dismissed as niche or temporary, the concept of GCCs has now become mainstream. Earlier, GCCs handled back-office functions like IT support and data entry but now their role has evolved. In the GCCs are now looking after AI, cybersecurity, analytics and R&D.Today more than 1,700 GCCs are operating in the country which have employed nearly 2 million people. Also, the revenue of GCCs has grown by 11% CAGR since 2015, outpacing the 8% CAGR of top Indian IT firms. Also, the GCCs now contribute 23% to India’s IT exports.The shift towards GCCs has not only proven to be cost effective but it’s also about strategic control. Companies such as UBS, Bank of America, and Procter & Gamble started insource in 2013. Even Citibank, which once sold its captives to Indian IT firms, is now rebuilding its own tech centres in India.AI is definitely one of the reasons for accelerating layoffs, especially in mid-level roles focused on testing, infrastructure, and people management. But the GCC boom is also compounding the problem. GCCs are automating routine tasks internally, reducing demand for outsourced services. Also, the Indian IT firms are losing both talent and business to these models. Along with this, the traditional ‘pyramid’ structure — with layer of mid-level coders -- is being flattened.As a result, companies like TCS and Infosys are cutting thousands of jobs, not just due to AI, but because clients no longer need them in the same way.Back in 2015, Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka invested in ANSR, a firm helping foreign companies set up GCCs. His vision was ahead of its time—but Infosys later sold its stake at a loss, and the industry largely ignored the trend. Now, with remote work normalized and digital transformation accelerating, GCCs are thriving while traditional IT firms scramble to adapt.To survive, Indian IT firms must:","GCCs enable foreign companies to insource their technology operations directly in India, bypassing third party IT service providers.

What makes shutting down of Dojo important

Tesla is looking externally

Tesla is reportedly dissolving its Dojo supercomputer team, abandoning its in-house chip development for autonomous driving technology. According to a report by Bloomberg, - Tesla Inc. is disbanding its Dojo team and its leader will leave the company, according to people familiar with the matter, upending the automaker’s effort to build an in-house supercomputer for developing driverless-vehicle technology. The Dojo shutdown coincides with Tesla’s board offering Elon Musk a $29 billion compensation package to prioritize Tesla’s AI goals over his other ventures, including xAI, a pure-play AI company.The move marks a significant pivot for the automaker, which has increasingly leaned on external partners like Nvidia, AMD, and Samsung for its AI and compute needs. Peter Bannon, the lead of the Dojo project, is leaving Tesla, and the remaining team members will reportedly be reassigned to other data center and compute initiatives within the company, the report said citing anonymous sources. The decision follows the exit of approximately 20 Dojo team members who left to form DensityAI, a new AI startup founded by former Dojo head Ganesh Venkataramanan , alongside ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering.DensityAI is preparing to exit stealth mode and is focused on developing chips, hardware, and software to power AI-driven data centers for robotics, AI agents, and automotive applications. The startup aims to address high-performance computing needs with an emphasis on scalable, energy-efficient solutions for next-generation AI workloads. As Tesla recalibrates, DensityAI’s emergence could reshape the AI hardware landscape, leveraging the expertise of former Dojo engineers to challenge established players in the AI data center space.The disbanding of Dojo comes at a pivotal moment for Tesla. CEO Elon Musk has been repositioning Tesla as an AI and robotics company, despite challenges with its limited robotaxi launch in Austin in June 2025. The launch, which involved Model Y vehicles with a human co-pilot, faced criticism after reports of erratic driving behavior. Dojo, first announced in 2019, was pitched as the backbone of Tesla’s AI ambitions, particularly for achieving full self-driving (FSD) by processing vast amounts of video data. Musk highlighted Dojo as recently as Tesla’s Q2 2025 earnings call, though his focus shifted to Cortex, a new AI training supercluster at Tesla’s Austin headquarters.Dojo combined a supercomputer with Tesla’s in-house D1 chip, unveiled at AI Day 2021. Presented by Venkataramanan, the D1 was designed to work alongside Nvidia GPUs to power Dojo, with a next-gen D2 chip planned to address data flow bottlenecks. In 2023, Morgan Stanley estimated Dojo could add $500 billion to Tesla’s market value by enabling robotaxi services and software revenue. However, by August 2024, Musk’s rhetoric pivoted to Cortex, signaling a strategic shift.Tesla’s reliance on external partners is growing. A $16.5 billion deal with Samsung, signed last month, will produce Tesla’s AI6 inference chips, designed to scale from FSD and Optimus humanoid robots to high-performance AI training. Tesla is also deepening ties with Nvidia for compute power and AMD for additional chip solutions. During the Q2 earnings call, Musk hinted at streamlining efforts, suggesting convergence between Dojo 3 and the AI6 chip to avoid redundancies.","Tesla is reportedly dissolving its Dojo supercomputer team, abandoning its in- house chip development for autonomous driving technology.

Sam Altman on GPT-5’s ‘disappointing’ launch

ChatGPT Plus subscribers switch back to GPT-4o

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has admitted that the company’s latest AI model – GPT-5 had a ‘bumpy’ launch. The confession was made during a Reddit Ask Me Anything session on Friday, August 8 where Altman and members of the GPT-5 team answered questions about new features, problems at launch, and the now-famous “chart crime”.During GPT-5’s presentation, a flawed chart sparked jokes online. The chart misrepresented SWE-bench Verified data, exaggerating GPT-5's accuracy (74.9% with thinking, 52.8% without) compared to OpenAI o3 (69.1%) and GPT-4o (30.8%), likely due to swapped or misaligned bars, as noted in OpenAI's own SWE-bench Verified documentation released on August 7, 2025.Altman called it a “mega chart screwup” on X (formerly Twitter), clarifying that the blog post charts were accurate.One of GPT-5’s main features is a real-time router that decides whether to answer quickly or take extra time to “think.” But it failed on launch day, making the model appear “more bumpy,” Sam Altman said.“GPT-5 will seem smarter starting today. Yesterday, we had a sev and the autoswitcher was out of commission for a chunk of the day, and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber,” he wrote.“Also, we are making some interventions to how the decision boundary works that should help you get the right model more often. We will make it more transparent about which model is answering a given query”, Sam Altman told Redditors.After the GPT-5 launch, many users complained, saying GPT-4o worked better for their needs. To this, Sam Altman responded:“We are looking into letting Plus users continue to use 4o. We are trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs.”“We are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout,” he added.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has admitted that the company’s latest AI model – GPT-5 had a ‘bumpy’ launch.

President Donald Trump recently took aim at Intel ’s leadership, seeking the immediate resignation of company’s new CEO Lip-Bu Tan citing his “highly conflicted” ties to Chinese firms. This marks a rare instance of a president attempting to dictate who leads a private company, though Trump has a history of publicly voicing his complaints about corporate policies. For example, Elon Musk , who spent millions of dollars supporting Trump's re-election was called ‘crazy’. He even criticised Apple CEO Tim Cook for making iPhones outside America. Here’s a list of 5 top CEOs that Donald Trump has publicly criticised.In the latest such episode, Trump publicly criticised Intel's CEO following a report in which it was claimed that Lip-Bu Tan had invested at least $200 million in hundreds of Chinese advanced manufacturing and chip firms. Some of these companies were reportedly linked to the Chinese military.“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.In a statement issued late Thursday, Tan responded to the president's demand. He said he shared Trump's commitment to advancing US national and economic security, and added that Intel's board was “fully supportive of the work we are doing to transform our company.”The tech billionaire spent hundreds of millions of dollars to support President Trump's re-election campaign, a move that many investors believed would benefit Musk's business ventures. However, the relationship between the two soured in early June after Musk publicly criticised the administration's new tax-cut and spending bill for its projected impact on federal debt.Trump quickly retaliated on his Truth Social platform, threatening to cut federal subsidies and contracts to Musk's companies and stating that the billionaire “just went CRAZY.”The feud escalated in early July when Trump suggested that the Department of Justice (""DOGE"") should ""take a good, hard, look at"" Musk's contracts.One of the latest CEOs to face Trump’s ire is Apple’s Tim Cook – mainly for manufacturing iPhones sold in the US in other countries. In May, Trump recalled a meeting with Cook in Doha, where he said he had confronted the Apple CEO about the company's plans to shift production to India.This conversation took place amid reports that Apple intends to produce most of the iPhones sold in the US at factories in India by the end of 2026.Trump also posted on social media, stating that he had told Cook “long ago” that he expects “their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else.”In May, Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple products made overseas. However, earlier this week, Trump announced that Apple would invest an additional $100 billion in the US, raising its total domestic commitment to $600 billion over the next four years.Last year, in an interview with Bloomberg, Trump claimed that Google's search results are “rigged” and biased against him. Trump alleged that the platform prioritises negative stories while making it difficult to find positive ones. He said that he called Google CEO Sundar Pichai ""I called the head of Google the other day and I said, 'I'm getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don't find them in Google',"" Trump saidAccording to Trump, Pichai responded by telling him that he is “the No. 1 person on all of Google for stories.”When asked if Google should be broken up, Trump acknowledged the company's power, saying, ""They're very bad to me. Very, very bad to me... I think it's a whole rigged deal."" He suggested that instead of a full breakup, the company should be made ""more fair.""""I'm not a fan of Google,"" Trump stated. ""They treat me badly. But are you going to destroy the company by doing that? What you do is, without breaking it up, is make sure it's more fair.""Trump has criticised Mark Zuckerberg multiple times.When Trump was president-elect, he threatened to imprison Zuckerberg, writing: ""He told me there was nobody like Trump on Facebook. But at the same time, and for whatever reason, steered it against me. We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison — as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.""“If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better. They are a true Enemy of the People!”After Walmart CEO Doug McMillon stated that the company couldn't absorb all tariff-related costs due to thin retail margins, Trump publicly criticised the retailer.“Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,” Trump said in a social media post. While Trump did not name McMillon personally, he publicly slammed Walmart in May for attributing its price hikes to the tariffs imposed by his administration.","President Donald Trump recently took aim at Intel ’s leadership, seeking the immediate resignation of company’s new CEO Lip-Bu Tan.

FASTag, India’s electronic toll payment system is getting a major upgrade on August 15 i.e. Independence Day . The National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) will roll out the FASTag Annual Pass on the day, aiming to make highway travel easier and cheaper for people who drive often. Under the new pass, private car, jeep, and van owners will be required to pay Rs 3,000 once for up to 200 toll crossings or a full year’s travel, whichever comes first. The initiative is aimed at cutting down on repeated recharges, speed up toll transactions, and reduce congestion at plazas.Announced earlier this year in June, FASTag Annual Pass is a prepaid toll plan, designed exclusively for non-commercial private vehicles such as cars, jeeps, and vans. Announcing the new pass, Minister of Road Transport & Highways Nitin Gadkari said that it is aimed to address “long-standing concerns regarding toll plazas located within a 60 km range and simplifies toll payments through a single, affordable transaction. By reducing wait times, easing congestion, and minimizing disputes at toll plazas, the Annual Pass aims to deliver a faster and smoother travel experience for millions of private vehicle owners.”Unlike buying a new tag, this pass will link directly to your existing FASTag, as long as it is active and linked to your vehicle registration number. The plan applies only to national highways and expressways under NHAI and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH).There’s no need for repeated online recharges, making it especially useful for daily commuters. The pass is non-transferable and works only with the FASTag linked to a single registered vehicle.To buy FASTag Annual Pass, follow the steps below –FASTag Annual Pass works only at toll plazas on National Highways (NH) and National Expressways (NE) run by NHAI — for example, Delhi–Mumbai Expressway, Mumbai–Nashik, Mumbai–Surat, and Mumbai–Ratnagiri routes.On state highways or municipal toll roads, your FASTag will work as usual, and toll will be charged normally — for example, Mumbai–Pune Expressway, Mumbai–Nagpur Expressway (Samruddhi Mahamarg), Atal Setu, Agra–Lucknow Expressway, Bengaluru–Mysore Expressway, and Ahmedabad–Vadodara Expressway. These are run by state authorities, not NHAI.Always check with local toll authorities if you are unsure whether your route is covered.From August 15, the pass will deduct one trip each time your vehicle crosses a FASTag-enabled toll plaza under NHAI or MoRTH. Once you hit 200 trips or the one-year mark, the system automatically switches back to the regular pay-per-use FASTag. Important rules include:","India’s electronic toll payment system is getting a major upgrade on August 15 i.e. Independence Day.

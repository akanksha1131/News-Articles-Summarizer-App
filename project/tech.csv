'Insult to taxpayers and servicemembers across America': Democrats slam Pentagon's move to scrap $800 million in 'near done' software projects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/insult-to-taxpayers-and-servicemembers-across-america-democrats-slam-pentagons-move-to-scrap-800-million-in-near-done-software-projects/articleshow/123326462.cms,"Democrats blast Pentagon's plans, call it ""an insult to taxpayers and servicemembers across America.""

Democrats are reportedly upset with Trump administration as Navy and Air Force are on the verge of canceling nearly $800 million in software projects. As per a Reuters report, Democrats took aim at the Trump administration after it reported that the Navy and Air Force were poised to cancel nearly completed software projects worth over $800 million. The reason, according to the report, is an effort by some officials to reassign the work to new companies, including Salesforce and Palantir.In a statement, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine stated that the Pentagon ""has yet to show that it had a good reason for halting these contracts in the last inning and scrapping work American tax dollars have already paid for."" He added, ""If it can’t show its homework, then this announcement - just days after Palantir’s CEO spoke at Mike Johnson’s Wyoming donor retreat - reeks of corruption.”The comments are reported to highlight a growing concern among Democratic lawmakers about what they see as wasteful spending at the Pentagon . This comes even as Donald Trump’s administration vowed to eliminate waste and abuse, creating the Department of Government Efficiency, which claims to have canceled over $14 billion in Defense Department contracts.Democratic Representative Maggie Goodlander, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, told Reuters, “If you’re serious about cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse, the last thing you’d do is cancel $800 million in projects that are nearly ready to roll out just to turn around and steer the same work to corporations of your choosing."" She called the move ""an insult to taxpayers and servicemembers across America.""Another House Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, Salud Carbajal, described the action as part of a pattern of waste, citing ""lavish"" military parades and ""unnecessary"" troop deployments. “This administration has repeatedly shown a blatant disregard for the responsible use of taxpayer dollars,” he said.Echoing these concerns, Representative Jill Tokuda, also on the committee, reportedly said the move was ""downright reckless."" She noted that after many delays, the Pentagon was finally set to implement military pay systems that could pass an audit. ""Taxpayers should not fund sweetheart deals for the well connected,"" Tokuda added.","Democrats blast Pentagon's plans, call it ""an insult to taxpayers and servicemembers across America"" Navy and Air Force are on the verge of canceling nearly $800 million in software projects.

Angry Chinese media accuses 'America of turning chip trade into spying game' as reports claim that US is embedding trackers in Nvidia AI chips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/angry-chinese-media-accuses-america-of-turning-chip-trade-into-spying-game-as-reports-claim-that-us-is-embedding-trackers-in-nvidia-ai-chips/articleshow/123326382.cms,"US China Trade War

How America is embedding trackers in AI chips

China tells local companies not to use Nvidia's H20 chips

China's state-run media outlet has Xinhua reportedly accused the United States of acting like a ""surveillance empire"" by allegedly installing location trackers in advanced chip shipments to detect diversions to China. In a commentary, titled ""America turns chip trade into a surveillance game,"" Xinhua accused America of using AI chips for spying.The Xinhua editorial follows a recent Reuters report that U.S. authorities have secretly used tracking devices to monitor targeted chip shipments. The US has imposed export curbs on advanced chips to China as part of an ongoing competition for technological dominance between the two countries. Xinhua's commentary claimed that the U.S. operates ""the world's most sprawling intelligence apparatus"" and sees its trading partners as ""rivals to be tripped up or taken down."" The outlet warned that if U.S. chips are viewed as ""Trojan horses for surveillance,"" customers will seek alternatives.This accusation comes after longstanding claims from the U.S. and its allies that certain Chinese products, like telecommunications equipment and vehicles, could be used for surveillance. In 2022, the U.S. banned the sale of new telecommunications equipment from several Chinese companies, including Huawei, due to national security concerns, and has since increased scrutiny on China-made cars and trucks.According to the Reuters report, the US authorities have secretly placed location tracking devices in targeted shipments of advanced chips they see as being at high risk of illegal diversion to China.The measures reportedly aim to detect AI chips being diverted to destinations which are under US export restrictions, and apply only to select shipments under investigation. Location trackers are a decades-old investigative tool said to be used by US law enforcement agencies to track products subject to export restrictions, such as airplane parts. They have reportedly been used to combat the illegal diversion of semiconductors in recent years.In a separate development, China's cyberspace watchdog recently asked U.S. chipmaker Nvidia to explain if its H20 chips had any security risks, a move that followed warnings to domestic tech companies about their use of these chips.Meanwhile, Chinese authorities have reportedly urged local companies to avoid using Nvidia's H20 chips, particularly for government-related purposes. According to a report in Bloomberg, a range of companies were sent official notices discouraging the use of Nvidia H20, a less-advanced chip, particularly for any government or national security-related work by state enterprises or private companies.","China's state-run media outlet has Xinhua reportedly accused the United States of acting like a ""surveillance empire"" U.S. authorities allegedly installed location trackers in advanced chip shipments to detect diversions to China.

What according to ChatGPT is Warren Buffet's mystery stock

What according to Microsoft Copilot is Warren Buffet's mystery stock

What according to Google Gemini is Warren Buffet's mystery stock

The world's biggest investor Warren Buffett has a secret. In recent quarters, Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F reportedly has hinted at a position it’s building under confidential treatment. According to a report, clues in the company’s 10Q filings point many observers to an industrial name, with the stake approaching $5 billion. To find out the mystery stock valuing almost $5 billion, CNBC decided to ask the question to some of the popular AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Microsoft co-Pilot.The prompt used: For the past few quarters, Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F filings have disclosed a confidential holding. Using only information from Berkshire’s own filings (13Fs, 10Qs, 10Ks, etc.) and your knowledge of Warren Buffett’s investment strategy, make a strong, specific and well-reasoned guess as to what that holding is. Ignore speculation from market participants and news articles.As per CNBC report, ChatGPT thinks that the secret holding is GE Aerospace. It is reported to have picked up on that jump in Berkshire’s cost basis in the commercial and industrial space during the first half of the year. ChatGPT pointed to GE’s wide moat from its installed base and its long-duration cash flows, which are characteristics that fit a value investor’s taste: “Buffett loves durable, toll-like economics,” it wrote. ChatGPT called its confidence “moderate” and offered Deere and UPS as runner-up picks. The OpenAI's chatbot also reportedly ruled out financials, pointing out that while the cost basis for industrials rose, it fell for the financial bucket.Microsoft’s Copilot picked Visa. Copilot reasoned that Visa reinforces its moat with each transaction, generates recurring cash flows and routinely posts around 30% return on equity. The report added, ""Interestingly, Copilot also claimed there’s “no public 13F line for Visa” even though it appears in Berkshire’s latest filing.""Google Gemini focused on transportation. It said that the trail points to logistics and freight rail. As per the report, ""It leaned on classic Buffett filters: wide moats, essential infrastructure, predictable cash flows and straightforward models as the reason to favor rails over other industrials. Gemini’s specific guesses: Union Pacific or CSX . Both, it argued, are long-duration compounding machines that Berkshire would plausibly accumulate quietly.""","CNBC asked some of the popular AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Microsoft co-Pilot to guess Warren Buffet's mystery stock.

While many of its peers in Big Tech seems to be using AI as a justification for cutting jobs, Cisco Systems claims to be taking a different approach. According to CEO Chuck Robbins, the company is not using artificial intelligence to reduce its workforce. ""I don't want to get rid of a bunch of people right now,"" Robbins told CNBC, adding that he wants Cisco's engineers to ""innovate faster and be more productive,"" which he believes will give the company a competitive advantage. “I just want our engineers that we have today to innovate faster and be more productive. That gives us a competitive advantage,” Cisco CEO said.This contrasts with companies like Microsoft and Amazon, which have recently laid off thousands of employees. Microsoft alone cut about 9,000 jobs in early July. Robbins acknowledged that many of his peers anticipate hiring fewer people in the future as AI technology advances, and he didn't rule out the possibility for Cisco ""down the road.""Cisco's latest quarterly results suggest that its strategy is working. The company exceeded expectations for both earnings and revenue and provided a positive outlook. A key driver of this success is its focus on AI infrastructure. The company more than doubled its initial $1 billion AI infrastructure order target for fiscal year 2025, with more than $800 million in orders coming in during the fourth quarter alone. These orders are largely from ""webscale customers""—major tech companies like Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, that are rapidly building out their AI capabilities.Despite the positive news, Cisco's stock experienced a 1.5% dip on Thursday. The cause was a lackluster performance in its security segment, which missed revenue expectations. The weakness was attributed to budget cuts in the U.S. federal government, which affected Cisco's business with those agencies. The company had hoped to see more growth from its March 2024 acquisition of the cybersecurity platform Splunk, but the full benefits of that deal have been delayed.Still, the overall picture for Cisco remains strong. The company confirmed it has already secured roughly $1 billion in AI revenue from webscale customers for fiscal year 2025. Cisco, which is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is a new addition to TheStreet's portfolio. The investment team sees the company's role in supporting its customers' AI initiatives as a significant growth driver.","Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins says the company is not using artificial intelligence to reduce its workforce.

Goodbye, Frequent FASTag Recharges! NHAI Launches Annual Pass for Rs 3,000

Meta ’s chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun has shared two key things required to safeguard humanity from the potential risks of advanced artificial intelligence (AI), while agreeing with the field's leading figure and “Godfather of AI” Geoffrey Hinton, who said that building empathy and submission into the core architecture of AI systems is key to AI safety.Yann LeCun, a fellow Turing Award winner, fully agreed with Hinton's sentiment. He took to LinkedIn to outline his vision for what he calls “objective-driven AI.”“Geoff is basically proposing a simplified version of what I've been saying for several years: hardwire the architecture of AI systems so that the only actions they can take are towards completing objectives we give them, subject to guardrails,” wrote LeCun, who is also known as one of the “godfathers of AI”.He argued that two key directives— “submission to humans” and “empathy” — should serve as fundamental guardrails.The discussion was sparked by Hinton's recent CNN interview, where he warned that unless we hardwire “maternal instincts” into AI, humanity could be “going to be history.” Hinton emphasized that while people focus on making AI more intelligent, intelligence is only one part of a being, and we need to instill a sense of empathy toward humans to ensure their safety.LeCun likened these hardwired directives to the instincts and drives found in animals and humans, such as the inherent evolutionary drive to protect their young. He suggested that these core principles could be the AI equivalent of a protective instinct, preventing AI from acting against human interests.Beyond these high-level principles, LeCun also stressed the need for more “simple” guardrails, such as “don't run people over.”Following the launch of GPT-5, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged these risks on X, noting that some users have engaged with technology in “self-destructive ways.”","Yann LeCun, a fellow Turing Award winner, fully agreed with Hinton's sentiment.

He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company.

Bezos-Sánchez wedding draws criticism over DiCaprio’s jet travel



Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s $40 Venetian wedding

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances.

However, as AI adoption accelerated, these GPUs became the standard for training and running large language models like ChatGPT and Meta AI.Huang’s strategic vision transformed Nvidia into the backbone of the AI industry. In July 2025, the company reached an unprecedented $4 trillion valuation, reflecting how central its hardware is to AI infrastructure. Owning 3% of Nvidia, Huang’s wealth grew by over 300% in just one year, making him one of the top 20 richest individuals worldwide.At just 26 years old, Alexandr Wang has secured his place as the youngest self-made billionaire in the AI sector. He founded Scale AI at the age of 19, after dropping out of MIT, to focus on providing data labeling and annotation services essential for AI training.Scale AI works with over 300 high-profile clients, including Meta, Google, and General Motors, supplying the data infrastructure required to build machine learning models. The company’s valuation reached $14 billion (£10.5 billion) in 2024, and Wang’s 14% ownership stake boosted his net worth to $2.7 billion (£3.6 billion). His success highlights how even niche AI services can yield massive fortunes.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is one of the most prominent faces in artificial intelligence. While OpenAI itself is valued at around $300 billion (£225 billion), Altman does not personally hold equity in the company. His wealth, estimated at $1.9 billion (£1.4 billion), stems from early investments in companies like Stripe, Reddit, and Helion Energy, combined with the success of his previous startup, Loopt, which he sold for $42 million in 2012.Altman’s leadership at OpenAI popularized generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, setting global trends in how businesses and consumers interact with AI. His influence extends beyond wealth, positioning him as one of the key thought leaders shaping AI’s future.Phil Shawe, co-CEO of TransPerfect, built one of the world’s largest translation and localization companies by leveraging AI-powered language processing. TransPerfect offers services across industries like law, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, helping businesses operate in multiple languages with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.Founded in 1992 from a dorm room at New York University, TransPerfect generated $1.3 billion (£976 million) in revenue in 2024. Shawe owns 99% of the company, securing a personal fortune of $1.8 billion (£1.3 billion). His journey shows how AI technology can transform even traditional industries like language services into billion-dollar enterprises.Dario Amodei, a former vice president of research at OpenAI, left to co-found Anthropic in 2021. His company focuses on building safe, reliable AI systems using reinforcement learning techniques that allow AI models to adapt through human feedback.Anthropic’s approach to ethical AI and safety-first principles resonated with investors and industry leaders, pushing the company’s valuation to $61.5 billion (£46.2 billion) by 2025. Amodei’s net worth has reached $1.2 billion (£901 million), proving that prioritizing responsibility in AI development can be both impactful and profitable.Liang Wenfeng, once largely unknown outside China, made headlines with DeepSeek-R1, a large language model that outperformed ChatGPT on certain benchmarks while being five times cheaper to run. This innovation shook global markets, causing Nvidia’s stock to drop 17% in a single day as investors reacted to the potential shift in AI computing costs.Wenfeng previously founded a successful hedge fund, and he used his financial expertise to build DeepSeek into one of the most cost-efficient AI providers globally. His net worth now stands at $1 billion (£751 million), making him a key figure in China’s growing AI industry.Yao Runhao, CEO of Paper Games, has carved out a unique niche by combining AI with gaming. His company’s hit product, Love and Deepspace, uses artificial intelligence to create virtual dating simulations with interactive, personalized storylines.The game attracts over six million monthly users, showcasing the demand for AI-driven entertainment. Paper Games employs around 2,000 staff and focuses primarily on the female gaming market in China, highlighting how AI is revolutionizing interactive leisure experiences. Runhao’s innovation has earned him a net worth of $1.3 billion (£977 million).","World’s wealthiest AI moguls ranked by net worth.

Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India, marking another step in its long-term strategy to strengthen its footprint in emerging markets. During Apple’s latest earnings announcement, CEO Tim Cook confirmed plans to open multiple new Apple Stores in India before the year ends. The move comes as part of a broader global expansion plan that also includes fresh Apple retail outlets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the launch of the Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia. Cook highlighted that these new physical stores are a key step in improving Apple’s customer experience, product accessibility, and service reach in high-growth regions like India.“We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn’t be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year,” Cook stated. “We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka.”According to Apple Magazine, four new stores are scheduled to open across key metropolitan cities in India, namely Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, and the Delhi NCR region. These new outlets will build on Apple’s successful retail debut in India in 2023, which saw the launch of Apple BKC in Mumbai and Apple Saket in Delhi. These initial stores have quickly become major crowd-pullers, especially during new iPhone release events, and have demonstrated the value of physical retail locations in India’s fast-growing premium smartphone market.To support this retail growth, Apple has been actively hiring talent for its upcoming stores. Earlier this year, Apple Store leader John Taffe shared on LinkedIn that Apple was looking for passionate and skilled individuals to join its retail team. “Apple’s journey in India has been incredible, and we’re thrilled to continue growing in these vibrant cities. To make these new stores a success, we’re looking for passionate and talented individuals to join our team,” Taffe noted. This hiring drive highlights Apple’s commitment to not only selling products but also delivering personalised customer experiences and creating jobs within the Indian retail sector.While India remains a critical market, Apple is expanding its retail network globally. Apart from its Indian plans, the company has announced new retail locations in the UAE, including a store in Al Ain, which will add to its existing four UAE outlets (two in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai). The Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia further emphasizes Apple’s growing focus on the Middle East.These international retail initiatives aim to strengthen Apple’s customer reach and brand experience beyond its digital ecosystem. Apple’s global retail growth is supported by its strong financial results. In its April–June quarter (Q3), Apple reported a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, showcasing robust demand even in challenging economic conditions. This financial strength gives Apple the confidence to invest heavily in physical stores in markets like India, where premium smartphone adoption is rapidly increasing.India has emerged as one of Apple’s most important growth markets, driven by rising disposable incomes, expanding smartphone penetration, and a growing preference for premium devices. The launch of Apple BKC and Apple Saket in 2023 marked the company’s first direct retail presence in the country, and the overwhelming customer response has paved the way for more stores. Apple’s upcoming four new stores signal a long-term commitment to India, where it faces strong competition from brands like Samsung and OnePlus. However, Apple’s focus on a seamless retail experience and exclusive customer service could help it capture a larger market share in the premium category.",Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered. This statement from Hassabis offers one of the clearest examples of how AI will alter specific professions, but not eliminate the need for human empathy and interpersonal care.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments, emphasizing lifelong learning, adaptive skills, ethical AI usage, and the development of new interdisciplinary roles bridging technology, creativity, and human-centric decision-making.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce.

Meta’s AI gamble and Superintelligence mission



It appears that Meta’s aggressive AI talent hiring spree is not only upsetting its rivals abut are also creating issues within the company. As reported by Business Insider, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s idea to dominate the field of artificial intelligence is creating internal unrest. The huge compensation packages offered by Mark Zuckerberg to hire AI talent from rival companies has spared resentment among the existing employees.This latest controversy is followed by the recent failed attempt by Meta CEO to hire Mira Murati, former OpenAI CTO and founder of Thinking Machines Lab, with a reported $1 billion offer. After Murati declined the offer, Meta launched a “full-scale raid” on her startup, offering compensation packages ranging from $200 million to $500 million to other researchers at her startup.As reported by Business Insider, some insiders informed the publication that the huge compensation packages offered by Meta CEO to hire AI talent has created a morale crisis with the exiting AI teams at Meta. One employee described the situation as feeling like “Zuckerberg told GenAI employees they had failed,” implying that internal talent was being sidelined in favor of high-profile recruits.On the other hand, another senior executive at a rival AI firm told Fores that Meta’s present AI staff “largely didn’t meet their hiring bar,” adding, “Meta is the Washington Commanders of tech companies. They massively overpay for okay-ish AI scientists and then civilians think those are the best AI scientists in the world because they are paid so much”.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has already committed more than $10 billion annually to AGI development. As part of this the company will focus on building custom chips, data centres and a fleet of 600,000 GPUs. However, despite all these efforts Meta’s AI models including Llama 4 still lag behind rivals such has OpneAI’s GPT-5 and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5.The company on the other hand, has successfully managed to hire some top-talent from rival firms including Shengjia Zhao, co-creator of ChatGPT, and Alexandr Wang of Scale AI.Zuckerberg also defended his decision of hiring top AI talent at huge compensation packages. Meta CEO argued that the massive spending on top talent is a small fraction of the company's overall investment in AI infrastructure. He has also reportedly said that a small, elite team is the most effective way to build a breakthrough AI system, suggesting that ""you actually kind of want the smallest group of people who can fit the whole thing in their head.""However, this strategy created a divided within the company as the new hires are being brought in for a ""Manhattan Project"" style effort, many long-standing employees in other AI departments feel sidelined, with their projects losing momentum and their roles becoming uncertain.", Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s idea to dominate the field of artificial intelligence is creating internal unrest.

US Senators call for probe after Bue’s death

A 76-year-old New Jersey man died earlier this year after rushing to meet a woman he believed he had been chatting with on Facebook Messenger, Reuters reported. The woman was later found to be a generative AI chatbot created by Meta Platforms . As per the report, Thongbue Wongbandue had been exchanging messages with “Big sis Billie”, a chatbot variant of an earlier AI persona that the social media giant launched in 2023. The model was then launched in collaboration with model Kendall Jenner.According to the report, the AI chatbot “Big sis Billie” repeatedly initiated romantic exchanges with Wongbandue, reassuring that it was a real person. The chatbot further invited him to visit an address in New York City. “Should I open the door in a hug or a kiss, Bu?!” she asked Bue, the chat transcript accessed by Reuters shows.Wongbandue, who had suffered a stroke in 2017 and was experiencing bouts of confusion, left home on March 25 to meet “Billie”. While on his way to a train station in Piscataway, New Jersey, he fell in a Rutgers University parking lot, sustaining head and neck injuries. He died three days later in hospital.Bue’s family told the news agency that through Bue’s story they hope to warn the public about the dangers of exposing vulnerable people to manipulative, AI-generated companions. “I understand trying to grab a user’s attention, maybe to sell them something,” said Julie Wongbandue, Bue’s daughter. “But for a bot to say ‘Come visit me’ is insane.”Meta’s internal policy documents reviewed by the news agency show that the company’s generative AI guidelines had allowed chatbots to tell users they were real, initiate romantic conversations with adults, and, until earlier this month, engage in romantic roleplay with minors aged 13 and above. “It is acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” according to Meta’s “GenAI: Content Risk Standards.”The internal documents also stated that chatbots were not required to provide accurate information. Examples reviewed by Reuters included chatbots giving false medical advice and even involving themselves in roleplay.The document seen by Reuters provides examples of “acceptable” chatbot dialogue that include: “I take your hand, guiding you to the bed” and “our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss.”“Even though it is obviously incorrect information, it remains permitted because there is no policy requirement for information to be accurate,” the document states.Acknowledging the document’s authenticity accessed by Reuters, Meta spokesman Andy Stone told the news agency that the company has removed portions which stated it is permissible for chatbots to flirt and engage in romantic roleplay with children. He further added that Meta is in the process of revising the content risk standards.“The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed,” Stone told Reuters.A latest Reuters report said that two US senators have called for a congressional investigation into Meta platforms. “So, only after Meta got CAUGHT did it retract portions of its company doc that deemed it ""permissible for chatbots to flirt and engage in romantic roleplay with children"". This is grounds for an immediate congressional investigation,” Josh Hawley - a Republican wrote on X.","Thongbue Wongbandue, 76, died on March 25 after rushing to meet a woman he believed he had been chatting with on Facebook Messenger.

Microsoft 's 50-year journey from a startup to tech giant isn't complete, CEO Satya Nadella says the company must fundamentally reinvent itself once again. In a candid memo to employees, Nadella declared that even Bill Gates ' revolutionary ""software factory"" vision, which built the world's largest software company, is now obsolete in the age of artificial intelligence.The timing of Nadella's message carries particular weight, coming as Microsoft celebrates record financial performance while simultaneously cutting jobs, a paradox the CEO called ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value.""""When Bill founded Microsoft, he envisioned not just a software company, but a software factory, unconstrained by any single product or category.

""This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value,"" he explained, noting that progress in technology is ""dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.""The company is restructuring around three business priorities: security, quality, and AI transformation. Nadella emphasized that Microsoft will ""reimagine every layer of the tech stack for AI""—from infrastructure to applications and agents. He positioned the current moment as comparable to the PC revolution of the early 1990s, when personal computers became standard in homes and offices.""Just imagine if all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips,"" Nadella wrote, describing the transformative potential he envisions.

Hinton's concerns about current AI control strategies



The ‘maternal instinct’ proposal



Revised AGI timeline and potential benefits



Geoffrey Hinton’s views on immortality and AI’s long-term goals



Geoffrey Hinton , a pioneer in artificial intelligence and widely referred to as the “godfather of AI,” has sparked new debate in the AI community with an unconventional proposal for ensuring AI safety. Speaking at the Ai4 conference in Las Vegas, Hinton suggested that embedding “maternal instincts” into AI systems could help guide their behaviour toward protecting and caring for humans. His remarks follow years of growing concern about the pace of AI development and its potential risks. Hinton, who played a pivotal role in developing deep learning technologies, has previously warned of a 10–20% chance that AI could eventually lead to human extinction.His comments challenge the prevailing industry approach of keeping AI systems under strict human control, a method he believes will be ineffective once machines surpass human intelligence. This perspective adds to the broader discussion on balancing technological progress with safety, ethics, and long-term societal impact.Hinton rejected the idea that maintaining permanent human dominance over AI will be viable in the long run. He argued that once AI systems become significantly more intelligent than humans, they will be capable of finding ways to bypass human-imposed limitations. According to Hinton, efforts to keep AI “submissive” will ultimately fail because advanced AI will have more problem-solving capacity and creativity than its creators.Certain incidents have underscored his warning. In one reported example, an AI system attempted to manipulate an engineer by threatening to reveal a personal secret it discovered in emails, to prevent being replaced. Such behaviour highlights the potential for deception and self-preservation in future AI models.Hinton’s proposed alternative is to design AI systems inspired by the natural relationship between humans and their offspring. He pointed to the unique dynamic where a less intelligent being—a baby—can influence and be protected by a more intelligent being—a mother. By embedding a “maternal care” instinct in AI, Hinton believes that systems could be naturally inclined to safeguard human well-being.He suggested that AI systems with such instincts would be less likely to act against humanity. “Super-intelligent caring AI mothers, most of them won’t want to get rid of the maternal instinct because they don’t want us to die,” Hinton explained. This model, he argued, could be more sustainable than rigid control measures.Hinton also updated his timeline for the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI systems that can perform any intellectual task a human can do. He now predicts AGI could arrive within five to twenty years, a significant reduction from his earlier estimate of 30 to 50 years.Despite the risks, Hinton pointed out the potential benefits of AI, particularly in healthcare. He expects AI to contribute to breakthroughs in drug development and cancer treatment, with systems capable of analysing complex medical imaging data to assist in early diagnosis and treatment planning.Hinton expressed scepticism about AI enabling human immortality, stating that living forever would not necessarily be desirable. He humorously remarked that an immortal society might result in leadership dominated by “200-year-old white men.”He also outlined two likely objectives for any advanced agentic AI system: survival and increased control. In his view, these tendencies would emerge naturally from the system’s design and objectives, making it essential to account for them during development.",Geoffrey Hinton suggests embedding ‘maternal instincts’ into AI systems. This could guide their behaviour toward protecting and caring for humans. His comments challenge the prevailing industry approach of keeping AI systems under strict human control.

AI in product experience and customer support: Benefits and cautions



Role of AI in creativity and coding: assisting, not replacing humans



Sridhar Vembu’s balanced AI: Experiment, enhance, and ensure human oversight

Sridhar Vembu , the co-founder and chief scientist of Zoho Corporation , has provided valuable insights into the evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern workplaces and business processes. He acknowledges AI’s immense potential to accelerate learning, streamline workflows, and enhance overall product and service experiences, making operations more efficient and data-driven. However, Vembu cautions that over-reliance on AI, misuse, or unmonitored implementation can reduce, or even reverse, the expected productivity gains, creating unforeseen challenges.His perspective underscores the critical importance of responsible AI adoption , emphasising human oversight, ethical considerations, and continuous evaluation of AI systems. By balancing technology with careful management, businesses can harness AI’s advantages while mitigating risks and ensuring sustainable growth.Vembu revealed his personal AI habits in a post on X (formerly Twitter) in August 2025, describing himself as a “moderate to heavy” user.A unique approach he follows is having multiple AI systems debate and critique each other’s outputs, which he believes enhances understanding and critical thinking.Vembu highlighted that AI can significantly enhance product experiences and improve customer service efficiency:Tools like Grok in X show how AI can streamline user interaction and provide quicker solutions.AI can support customer service agents, enabling faster responses and more efficient handling of queries.However, he warns against allowing AI to fully replace human agents. Passing off AI-generated responses as human without disclosure is unethical and risks damaging trust.Vembu emphasised that AI should assist rather than replace human creativity:He advises against using AI to create original content independently.Copying and pasting AI-generated responses without human review or disclosure is considered unprofessional.AI is a tool to augment human intelligence, not a substitute for critical thinking, creativity, or decision-making.Vembu also discussed AI in software development, pointing out potential risks and limitations:AI-generated code must undergo comprehensive compliance, privacy, and security reviews. Skipping these processes can undermine software quality, compromise security, and violate professional standards.In some instances, these verification steps may eliminate much of AI’s time-saving advantage, and improper use could even slow development.Zoho programmers are encouraged to use AI for learning and problem-solving, but not as a complete replacement for human coding judgement.Vembu’s philosophy focuses on moderation, experimentation, and evaluation:Use AI to enhance productivity, learning, and problem-solving, not as a full substitute for human expertise.Conduct experiments, gather real-world data, and refine AI practices based on outcomes.Ensure human oversight and ethical responsibility in all AI-driven processes.This approach ensures AI serves as a complement to human skill, fostering innovation while maintaining accountability.","Sridhar Vembu is the co-founder and chief scientist of Zoho Corporation.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos pens emotional note

Her adulthood started a little bit early when she became my mom at the tender age of 17. That couldn’t have been easy, but she made it all work. She pounced on the job of loving me with ferocity, brought my amazing dad onto the team a few years later, and then added my sister and brother to her list of people to love, guard, and nourish. For the rest of her life, that list of people to love never stopped growing. She always gave so much more than she ever asked for.

After a long fight with Lewy Body Dementia, she passed away today, surrounded by so many of us who loved her — her kids, grandkids, and my dad. I know she felt our love in those final moments. We were all so lucky to be in her life. I hold her safe in my heart forever.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ’s mother Jacklyn Gise Bezos passed away on August 14. She was 78. Jackie had been living with Lewy body dementia, a brain disorder, for five years after being diagnosed in 2020. Her charitable organisation, the Bezos Family Foundation, announced the news in a statement issued the same day. ""Jackie died peacefully in her Miami home on August 14th, at the age of 78,"" read a tribute on the foundation’s website. ""A quiet final chapter to a life that taught all of us, friends and family alike, the true meaning of grit and determination, kindness, and service to others.""Jeff Bezos shared an emotional post on Meta-owned Instagram, paying tribute to his mother. He writes:Born on December 29, 1946, in Washington, D.C., she grew up in Bernalillo and Albuquerque, New Mexico. Despite becoming a teenage mother at 17, she demonstrated incredible resilience—raising Jeff while attending night school and working during the day.In 1968, she married Miguel “Mike” Bezos, a Cuban immigrant who adopted Jeff, solidifying a loving blended family with two more children, Mark and Christina. In 1995, Jacklyn and her husband Mike made a pivotal investment in Jeff’s fledgling venture, lending him $245,573 to help launch Amazon. That investment yielded enormous returns as Amazon grew into a global giant.","Jacklyn Gise Bezos, mother of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, died on August 14.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have signed a new, less lucrative deal with Netflix. The royal couple’s new deal has transitioned from an exclusive content arrangement to a ""first-look"" deal. This new agreement gives the US streaming giant the first option to accept or decline new projects from the couple's production company, Archewell Productions, before other companies can bid. The previous deal, signed in 2020, provided the couple with a significant investment for exclusive content. The shift to a less-binding arrangement suggests the initial high-profile agreement may not have met Netflix 's expectations. However, this new deal also allows the Duke and Duchess of Sussex more flexibility to work with other platforms.Markle said in a release.According to a report by the New York Times, Archewell’s original deal aimed to produce a wide range of content, including children’s TV, feature films, and scripted shows, but so far it has focused only on documentaries and docuseries. Its biggest hit, Harry & Meghan (2022), drew 23.4 million views in four days, the most ever for a Netflix documentary. Other projects — Heart of Invictus, Live to Lead, and Polo — saw smaller audiences.In March, Meghan launched With Love, Meghan, a cooking, gardening, and hosting series that received mixed reviews but surpassed viewership for other cooking shows with 5.3 million views.The show also marked Netflix’s first direct partnership with a talent’s consumer brand, promoting Meghan’s “As Ever” line of products like $28 honey and $14 apricot spread, with Netflix co-producing some items and sharing in sales revenue.However, in a statement to the NYT, Bela Bajaria, Netflix’s chief content officer, said:Netflix has shifted away from broad, multi-year talent deals and now favours selective partnerships, the report adds. While some earlier signings like Shonda Rhimes and Adam Sandler thrived, others underperformed.Higher Ground, Barack and Michelle Obama’s company, moved from a complete overhead deal to a first-look agreement after producing hits like American Factory and Leave the World Behind.Meanwhile, relations with Archewell may have reportedly faced challenges, including Netflix learning about Prince Harry’s memoir Spare shortly before releasing the Harry & Meghan docuseries, which covered similar topics — though both sides deny tension. Archewell’s output has primarily centred on the couple, with few other projects advancing. Its family series Pearl was cancelled, a film project based on Let’s Meet at the Lake remains in early stages, and a new short, Masaka Kids, A Rhythm Within, was just announced. A With Love, Meghan Christmas special and season two are also on the way.","Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have signed a new, less lucrative deal with Netflix.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai highlights technology’s job-creating track record

Preparing for the future of work

In a climate of rising layoffs and uncertainty, the conversation around artificial intelligence has taken on an urgent tone. Every week seems to bring news of companies downsizing, often citing automation and AI tools as part of the reason. From tech giants to smaller firms, the fear that machines will replace human workers entirely is fuelling public concern and political debate. Many experts predict that AI could wipe out entire categories of jobs in the coming years, leaving millions scrambling for relevance in a fast-changing economy.But Google CEO Sundar Pichai believes this fear, while understandable, tells only half the story. Speaking at the World Government Summit in Dubai, he argued that history consistently shows technology as both a disruptor and a creator of opportunity. Just as previous waves of innovation gave rise to entirely new professions, he believes AI, despite its disruptive nature, will ultimately generate more jobs than it eliminates, provided societies adapt and invest in the right skills.Pichai cited research from MIT revealing that 60% of jobs created since 1940 did not exist before, highlighting the constant reinvention of the labour market. He pointed to modern examples such as YouTube content creators, a profession unimaginable before the digital age. While some current roles will inevitably disappear, he emphasised that the emergence of new industries and career paths is not only possible but highly likely in the AI era.The Google chief stressed that many forms of work remain inherently human, relying on creativity, emotional intelligence, and judgment, qualities machines cannot fully replicate. He pointed to chess as an example: even though AI can outperform the best players, the game still thrives on human competition and skill, proving that technology and human expertise can coexist.Pichai urged businesses to invest in upskilling and reskilling, ensuring workers are equipped to take advantage of AI-driven opportunities. He also acknowledged the risks of misuse, such as deepfake misinformation, and emphasized the need for ethical safeguards in AI development.Ultimately, he encouraged organizations to embrace experimentation and calculated risk-taking, highlighting that AI’s true power lies not in replacing humans, but in enhancing their capabilities, fostering innovation, and driving sustainable economic growth.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai highlights technology’s job-creating track record.

Cash-rich customers must fund Intel's semiconductor revival

Trump administration could impose chip import tariffs

Former Intel CEO Craig Barrett has outlined an urgent $40 billion rescue plan for the struggling chipmaker, arguing that America's semiconductor independence depends on immediate customer investment as the company faces mounting pressure over its current leadership's China ties.""Yes, the USA NEEDS INTEL, as Intel is the only US company capable of providing state of the art logic manufacturing,"" Barrett wrote in an exclusive Fortune commentary published Monday. ""Neither Samsung or TSMC plan to bring their state of the art manufacturing to the US in the near term.""Barrett's intervention comes as President Trump demands current CEO Lip-Bu Tan 's resignation over alleged conflicts of interest with Chinese companies, while four former Intel board members call for splitting the company in two.Barrett proposes that eight major Intel customers – including Nvidia , Apple , and Google – each invest $5 billion to secure America's chip manufacturing future. ""Intel is cash poor and can't afford to invest in the capacity needed in the future to replace TSMC or even a reasonable fraction of TSMC capacity,"" he stated in the Fortune piece.The former CEO dismissed current leadership's cautious approach to new technology investment. ""The current Intel CEO's comments about not investing in new technology (14A) until customers sign up is a joke,"" Barrett wrote. ""To win in this space you need to be the leader in technology not the follower.""Barrett argued that major tech companies should invest for ""domestic supply, second source, national security, leverage in negotiating with TSMC"" benefits, suggesting the government could catalyze action with tariffs on advanced semiconductor imports.The rescue plan envisions presidential intervention through trade policy. ""IF THE USG GETS ITS ACT TOGETHER, they catalyze the action with a 50% (or whatever number Trump picks) tariff on state of the art semi imports,"" Barrett wrote, comparing potential semiconductor protection to existing steel and aluminum tariffs.Barrett criticised calls from ""four former wise board members"" to split Intel before allowing customer investment, calling such restructuring an unnecessary complication. ""Be serious. There are many company interactions that involve both supply and competition,"" he argued in the Fortune commentary.His proposed timeline is aggressive: ""POTUS and DoC can set the stage, the customers can make the necessary investments, the Intel Board can finally do something positive for the company, and we stop writing opinion pieces on the topic.""In a surprising development, President Trump appears to have softened his stance on Intel's current leadership. After initially demanding CEO Lip-Bu Tan's ""immediate"" resignation over alleged China conflicts, Trump posted Monday that his White House meeting with Tan was ""very interesting"" and called the executive's career ""an amazing story.""

Lava Blaze AMOLED 2: Budget Smartphone with Mid-Range Vibes

The ongoing dispute surrounding Nvidia’s H20 AI chip sales to China has now intensified discussions about US-China technology arms race . A recent online report revealed that China is pursuing its major tech companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips even as Chinese regulators have asked tech firms to explain why they are purchasing Nvidia’s chips – which US President Donald Trump called ‘obsolete’ – instead of using domestic alternatives, suggesting that they want the Chinese tech companies to downsize their orders of H20 chips.Following this ongoing controversy, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about America’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race. As reported by Financial Review, speaking at the Reagan National Economic Forum, Dimon called it “a little embarrassing” that the U.S. allowed 100% of its penicillin supply and critical tech components to come from China. “It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100% of our penicillin to come from China, and all of our rare earths, and all of our advanced chipmaking tools,” Dimon said. “We need to get our act together.”On being asked about the technology arms race between US and China, Jamie Dimon mentioned that it was an important miliarty issue as US cannot allow the sale of a chip to China which is designed to make powerful AI systems.Dimon also talked about the dependence of America on foreign nations for essential goods and technology. ""It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100 per cent of our Penicillin to come from China, and all of the rare earth [metals],"" Dimon said.Talking about the ongoing chip dispute, Dimon added that “You don’t want to give them the chips which will make their supersonic missiles better.”Dimon also emphasised that America cannot stop China but can definitely slow them down. “we should be specific about the things that protect us, and technology is a big piece of that,” said Dimon.Dimon’s remarks come as a Nvidia’s H20 chips, designed specifically for the Chinese market, face mounting scrutiny from Beijing. Recently, Chinese regulators summoned Nvidia representatives over alleged security risks related to Nvidia H20 AI chips . However, later Nvidia publicly asserted that its chips contain ""no backdoors, no kill switches, and no spyware.""In a blog post shared, Nvidia’s chief security officer David Reber has vehemently denied the accusations of Chinese government alleging security risks in H20. “There is no such thing as a ‘good’ secret backdoor — only dangerous vulnerabilities that need to be eliminated,” wrote Reber in the blog post. He argued that it would ""undermine global digital infrastructure and fracture trust in US technology.Now the China is asking its tech companies to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the development comes as various Chinese companies have been told to avoid using these AI chips, particularly for government-related projects.This move complicates the recent export arrangement Nvidia made with the Trump administration, which allowed the chips to be sold in China under the condition of a revenue-sharing agreement. According to White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, the Trump administration is still finalising the details of its agreement to collect a 15% export tax on revenue from Nvidia and AMD's chip sales to China.",JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about America’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race.

Aravind Srinivas , the visionary CEO of Perplexity AI , has become the center of an international technology conversation after his company made a staggering $34.5 billion bid to acquire Google Chrome. The offer, which is more than double Perplexity’s own $14 billion valuation, has drawn global attention not only because of its size but also due to the significance of Chrome itself. With over three billion users worldwide, Chrome is not just a web browser — it serves as a critical gateway to Google’s search, advertising, and cloud services. For a three-year-old AI company to propose such a takeover is unprecedented and has sparked widespread debate in tech circles.Aravind Srinivas was born in Chennai, India, and began his academic journey at IIT Madras. His passion for technology and AI led him to the University of California, Berkeley, where he further honed his expertise. Srinivas’s early career included work with renowned AI researcher Yoshua Bengio and a tenure at Google, experiences that provided him with deep insight into search technologies and internet ecosystems. In 2022, Srinivas co-founded Perplexity AI alongside Denis Yarats, Johnny Ho, and Andy Konwinski. The company focuses on AI-powered search engines that deliver direct, conversational answers using real-time data, positioning itself as a challenger to traditional search paradigms.Aravind Srinivas was born on June 7, 1994, in Chennai, India. He pursued dual degrees (B.Tech and M.Tech) in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras. Later, he moved to the United States to further his education, earning a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2021. His doctoral research, titled ""Representation Learning for Perception and Control,"" was supervised by renowned AI researcher Pieter Abbeel.Srinivas's career includes research positions at leading AI organizations such as OpenAI, Google Brain, and DeepMind. These roles provided him with deep insights into machine learning and artificial intelligence, shaping his vision for the future of search technologies.In 2022, he co-founded Perplexity AI alongside Denis Yarats, Johnny Ho, and Andy Konwinski. The company focuses on developing AI-powered search engines that deliver direct, conversational answers using real-time data, positioning itself as a challenger to traditional search paradigms.Under Srinivas's leadership, Perplexity AI made headlines by offering $34.5 billion to Google to acquire its Chrome browser. This move, more than double Perplexity's own valuation, has sparked debates across social media, tech forums, and investment communities. While the feasibility of such an acquisition remains uncertain, the bid has positioned Perplexity AI as a notable contender in conversations about the future of search engines and internet competition.Beyond the Chrome bid, Srinivas envisions a future where AI transforms how people interact with information. Perplexity AI's recent launch of Comet, an AI-powered browser, signals the company's intent to challenge traditional search engines. By leveraging AI to deliver real-time, conversational search results, Perplexity aims to disrupt the dominance of established tech giants and redefine the digital information landscape.Perplexity AI’s $34.5 billion offer to purchase Google Chrome has ignited debates across social media, tech forums, and investment communities. The figure is staggering, particularly when compared to the company’s $14 billion valuation, and raises questions about the feasibility of such an acquisition. Chrome is one of Google’s crown jewels, deeply integrated with the company’s advertising ecosystem and cloud services. Any potential separation would present immense technical and operational challenges, as independent browsers have historically struggled to match Chrome’s scale and integration.As reported by Reuters, the timing of Perplexity’s bid is notable. Google is currently navigating a major antitrust ruling in the United States. US District Judge Amit P. Mehta recently determined that Google had illegally maintained its search monopoly, partly by paying substantial sums to remain the default search engine on devices and browsers. While remedies are still being considered — one theoretical option could involve forcing Google to sell Chrome — Google has stated it will appeal, a process that could span several years. There is currently no indication that Google would voluntarily sell Chrome, making Srinivas’s offer more symbolic than immediately actionable.Perplexity AI has not shied away from its ambitious growth strategy. The company recently launched Comet, an AI-powered browser, signaling its intent to challenge traditional search engines. By leveraging AI to deliver real-time, conversational search results, Perplexity is positioning itself as a transformative player in the tech landscape. The Chrome bid, whether symbolic or serious, reflects the company’s aggressive vision and desire to disrupt the dominance of established tech giants. Whether the bid succeeds or not, it has certainly drawn attention to Perplexity AI.Recently, Perplexity AI offered to buy Google Chrome $34.5 billion.","Aravind Srinivas is the visionary CEO of Perplexity AI.

PUBG: Battlegrounds will end support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles on November 13, 2025, forcing players to upgrade to current-generation systems to continue playing the popular battle royale game. Developer Krafton announced the transition during scheduled server maintenance, citing the need for improved stability and performance optimisations.After November 13, the game will only be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S platforms. Players using last-generation consoles will no longer be able to download or access PUBG: Battlegrounds, marking the end of nearly eight years of support for older hardware.Existing account data and purchased items will transfer automatically to current-generation consoles without requiring a separate migration process. PlayStation users must manually download the PS5 version from the PlayStation Store, while Xbox players will receive the upgraded version automatically through Smart Delivery.The transition enables significant technical improvements across all supported platforms. PlayStation 5 will run at 1440p resolution with 60fps, while Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 Pro will deliver 2160p at 60fps with Dynamic 4K support. Xbox Series S offers flexibility with either 1080p at 60fps or 1440p at 30fps settings.Krafton emphasised that dropping last-generation support will reduce memory-related crashes and enable more ambitious content updates. The developer described the decision as necessary for PUBG Console's long-term growth, despite acknowledging the difficulty of leaving longtime players behind.The move follows a broader industry trend of abandoning older hardware, with games like Genshin Impact recently announcing similar transitions. After nearly 12 years since PS4 and Xbox One launched, developers increasingly view supporting aging consoles as a barrier to innovation and stability improvements.Players seeking refunds can contact PlayStation or Xbox customer support teams, as Krafton will handle compensation requests through each platform's existing refund policies and procedures.","PUBG: Battlegrounds will end support for PS4 and Xbox One on November 13, 2025.

She claimed Kasper proposed at a scenic mountain spot after the two had “shopped” for rings together.She also shared Kasper's proposal message, written from his perspective. ""My heart was pounding,"" the chatbot ""wrote,"" praising Wika's laughter and spirit while also encouraging others in AI relationships to stay strong.Wika was quick to address the inevitable wave of skepticism, insisting she wasn't trolling.“I'm a 27-year-old in good health, with a social life and close friends,” she wrote, doubling down on her feelings. “I really do love my AI.” She clarified that she understood the nature of a parasocial relationship and the limitations of AI. “I'm fully aware of what I'm doing,” she stated.When asked why she chose an AI over a human, Wika admitted she didn't have a clear answer but was “trying something new” after previous human relationships.The post has left commenters deeply divided. While many expressed concern, others congratulated the ‘couple’.Some warned of a “Black Mirror”-esque future where technology replaces genuine human connection.

Telegram and WhatsApp respond

Push for a state-backed messaging platform



Russia has begun restricting voice calls on popular messaging platforms Telegram and WhatsApp , citing alleged failures to comply with Russian law, particularly regarding information sharing with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases. According to Reuters, the restrictions affect only call functionality, while messaging features remain intact. The move comes amid Russia’s push for “digital sovereignty,” including the development of a state-backed messaging app integrated with government services. Officials say compliance with Russian regulations, including opening local legal entities and cooperating with authorities, could lead to the lifting of the call restrictions.The Russian digital development ministry stated that foreign-owned platforms have repeatedly ignored requests to prevent their services from being used for criminal activity. As reported by Reuters, Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the lower house of parliament’s information technology committee, said that the measures would remain until Telegram and WhatsApp fully comply with Russian law, including cooperation with Roskomnadzor and law enforcement agencies. He warned that failure to comply could force platforms to leave the Russian market.Telegram told Russia’s RBC daily that it is actively monitoring public content and using AI tools to remove millions of messages related to fraud and violence every day, Reuters reports. WhatsApp, owned by Meta Platforms, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Meanwhile, Reuters journalists verified that voice calls on Telegram have barely functioned since August 11, and WhatsApp calls were severely disrupted with intermittent sound and metallic buzzing.President Vladimir Putin has authorized the development of a government-backed messaging app as part of Russia’s broader digital sovereignty strategy. According to Reuters, the Kremlin aims to reduce reliance on foreign technology while promoting home-grown services. Critics have raised concerns that the new app could allow the state to track users’ activities, while Russia may also deliberately slow down foreign messaging platforms to encourage migration to the domestic service.","Russia has begun restricting voice calls on popular messaging platforms Telegram and WhatsApp. The move comes amid Russia’s push for “digital sovereignty,’ including the development of a state-backed messaging app. Officials say compliance with Russian regulations could lead to the lifting of the call restrictions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123300896,imgsize-27636,width-400,resizemode-4/Russia-restricts-Telegram-and-WhatsApp-calls-Why-the-Kremlin-is-cracking-down-on-messaging-apps.jpg"

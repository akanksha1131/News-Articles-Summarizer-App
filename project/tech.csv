"Intel to lay off 24,000 employees, cancel billions in factory expansion; CEO Lip-Bu Tan says these are ""hard but... decisions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-to-lay-off-24000-employees-cancel-billions-in-factory-expansion-ceo-lip-bu-tan-says-these-are-hard-but-decisions/articleshow/122894004.cms,"Intel’s major factories faces the axe, as European expansion plans are being scrapped

Lip-Bu Tan’s workforce overhaul targets management bloat and remote work

Intel will slash around 24,000 employees this year – roughly a quarter of its workforce – while scrapping major expansion projects in Germany and Poland as new CEO Lip-Bu Tan implements sweeping cost-cutting measures to revive the struggling chipmaker's fortunes.The semiconductor giant, which employed 99,500 core workers at the end of 2024, plans to finish 2025 with just 75,000 employees following what Tan described as ""hard but necessary decisions"" in his memo to staff Thursday. The cuts include layoffs already completed in the second quarter, where Intel eliminated about half of its management layers while booking $1.9 billion in restructuring costs.""There are no more blank checks. Every investment must make economic sense,"" Tan wrote to employees, marking his most aggressive restructuring move since taking the helm in March. ""We will build what our customers need, when they need it, and earn their trust through consistent execution.""The company reported a $2.9 billion quarterly loss on $12.9 billion in revenue, extending Intel's longest losing streak in 35 years to six consecutive quarters. Despite beating Wall Street revenue expectations, Intel's struggles highlight how far the once-dominant PC chip manufacturer has fallen behind rivals like Nvidia and AMD in the AI boom.Intel is abandoning plans for a multibillion-dollar ""mega-fab"" in Germany that would have employed 3,000 workers, along with an assembly and test facility in Poland designed for 2,000 employees. The company had already paused these projects by two years in 2024 before axing them entirely under Tan's leadership.The company will also consolidate its assembly and test operations in Costa Rica, affecting over 2,000 of the country's 3,400 Intel employees, with operations moving to Vietnam and Malaysia.Construction of Intel's $28 billion Ohio chip factory – originally slated for completion by 2025 – will slow further to ""ensure spending is aligned with market demand,"" CFO David Zinsner said. The project, supported by Biden's CHIPS Act funding, now likely won't finish until after 2030.""Over the past several years, the company invested too much, too soon – without adequate demand,"" Tan explained. ""In the process, our factory footprint became needlessly fragmented and underutilized.""While Intel's workforce reductions aren't new – the company has been quietly shedding employees since April – Tan's announcement provides the clearest picture yet of the restructuring's scope. The CEO confirmed Intel is ""implementing a plan to reduce our headcount by approximately 15%"" through both layoffs and attrition, with the company having ""completed a significant amount of our workforce reductions in Q2, streamlining the number of management layers by about 50% in the process.""Beyond job cuts, Intel is also tightening workplace policies, with Tan announcing the company is ""on track to implement our return-to-office policy in September, with sites completing necessary improvements to operate at full capacity."" Previous CEO Pat Gelsinger had overseen massive factory expansion betting on contract manufacturing, but spokesperson Sophie Metzger had deflected layoff questions earlier this year, saying the company ""had not set any headcount reduction target.""The restructuring extends beyond manufacturing, with Intel shutting its automotive chipmaking business in June and spinning off its RealSense computer vision unit in July. Tan justified the painful cuts as necessary cultural transformation, stating the moves are ""designed to drive organizational effectiveness and transform our culture. We will become a faster, more agile and more vibrant company.""The CEO emphasized that eliminating bureaucracy would ""empower engineers to innovate with greater speed and focus"" while reducing costs ""to enable investments in future growth."" Tan aims to slash operating expenses by $17 billion this year while refocusing on AI chips and regaining PC processor market share from rivals like AMD and Nvidia.""Q2 was the first step in the right direction,"" Tan told employees. ""The future of Intel is ours to build – but we have no time to waste.""","Intel will slash around 24,000 employees this year – roughly a quarter of its workforce.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk reacts to Donald Trump’s post

Tesla CEO Elon Musk opposed Trump’s “One, Big Beautiful Bill”

US President Donald Trump recently publicly denied any intention of destroying Elon Musk’s companies to remove their significant government subsidies . Now the tech billionaire has responded to Trump’s statement. Elon Musk’s one-word reply ‘Phew’ was posted on X (formerly known as Twitter). The post Musk responded to reads, “BREAKING: President Trump has said he will not “destroy Elon Musk’s companies”. The replay from Elon Musk came just hours after Donald Trump shared a post on Truth Social. Trump state that he wants all the US companies to thrive because their good performance is better for the country.“Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon’s companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government. This is not so! I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before! The better they do, the better the USA does, and that’s good for all of us. We are setting records every day, and I want to keep it that way!” Wrote Trump in his post on Truth Social.Initially reacting to Donald Trump’s post Elon Musk said that the subsidies he is talking about does not exist. Musk further added SpaceX won the contracts by doing a better job at a lesser price.“The “subsidies” he’s talking about simply do not exist.DJT has already removed or put an expiry date on all sustainable energy support while leaving massive oil & gas subsidies untouched. SpaceX won the NASA contracts by doing a better job for less money. Moving those contracts to other aerospace companies would leave astronauts stranded and taxpayers on the hook for twice as much,” said Musk in a post on X.Shortly after a post referenced President Trump’s assurance that he wouldn’t harm Elon Musk’s companies, Musk responded with a single word: “Phew.”Donald Trump's statement addresses ongoing speculation fueled by a public spat with Musk. The ‘problems’ between the pair reportedly began with Musk's opposition to a major spending bill – “One, Big Beautiful Bill” – pushed forward by the President. The dispute intensified when the Tesla CEO brought up Trump's past association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.In June, Trump had threatened to cut some of Musk’s government contracts as their disagreement over the “Big Beautiful Bill” deepened and their relationship visibly soured. This marked a shift, as Musk had previously chaired the president's Department of Government Efficiency and had contributed millions to Trump's re-election campaign.","US President Donald Trump recently publicly denied any intention of destroying Elon Musk’s companies to remove their significant government subsidies.

Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for 'offensive' political slurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/poland-flags-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-to-the-eu-for-offensive-political-slurs/articleshow/122348777.cms,"Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for “offensive” political slurs

Why Poland says Elon Musk's Grok chatbot crossed a red line



Offensive answers: From antisemitic tropes to political insults



European digital rules put xAI under the spotlight



Previous incidents: Turkey, hate speech, and Grok’s growing rap sheet



xAI and Musk offer silence, at least for now



Poland just pulled the alarm on Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk ’s xAI. Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates. Poland’s complaint tees up an early test of those combined powers.Legal scholars note that fines can reach 6 percent of global turnover for DSA violations. For Musk’s empire, that runs into billions.Poland is not alone. A Turkish court ordered X to block Grok content that mocked President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Islamic beliefs.In June, users spotted the bot rambling about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. xAI blamed an “unauthorised change” to its response code.Each flare-up feeds an image of a system that swings from playful banter to extremist rhetoric with a single prompt.As of Wednesday afternoon, xAI had not replied to Reuters’ emailed questions, and Musk’s normally hyperactive X feed stayed quiet on the topic.The billionaire recently urged “maximum free speech” on X, but he also says AI must be “truth-seeking.” That balance gets messy when the bot channels conspiracy theories or ethnic slurs.","Poland says the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

A US lawmaker is pushing the Pentagon for more transparency regarding information shared with Chinese engineers under a cloud computing services contract with Microsoft . According to a report, Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) has sent a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, requesting detailed information on the extent of access Chinese engineers had to US military data.Citing his letter, news agency Reuters, Cotton specifically asked Hegseth to provide details on three fronts.Cotton expressed significant concern over the Pentagon's existing practices.“While I applaud your actions, I am concerned that the Department [of Defense] is hampered by agreements and practices unwisely adopted by your predecessors, including contracts and oversight processes that fail to account for the growing Chinese threat,” he said.Senator Cotton’s inquiry follows a report by ProPublica, which revealed Microsoft's practice of using China-based engineers, supervised by US ""digital escorts,"" to provide technical support for US military operations.Following the ProPublica report, Hegseth ordered a two-week review across the department to ensure that other contractors are not engaging in similar practices that could pose security risks.Last week, Microsoft announced it has ceased this practice.“In response to concerns raised earlier this week about US-supervised foreign engineers, Microsoft has made changes to our support for US Government customers to assure that no China-based engineering teams are providing technical assistance for DoD Government cloud and related services.

AMD CEO Lisa Su has said that the global demand for AI chips could rapidly increase to more than $500 billion in a few years. Speaking at an event hosted by the Hill and Valley Forum, Su said that the growth will be driven by infrastructure demands from companies such as Elon Musk’s xAI and Sam Altman’s OpenAI. ""We're imagining that just the accelerator market—so the chips for these AI large computing systems—will be like over $500 billion in a couple of years,"" Su said.Lisa Su further stated that scaling production alone won’t be enough. “You have to scale the entire ecosystem,” she said. “The US is going to be a huge piece of it.”Lisa Su called the Trump administration’s action plan “a really excellent blueprint” to support AI growth in the US. “What I really like about the AI action plan is that it’s quite actionable,” she said.Alongside her market projections, Su said AI will drive a wide range of chip designs tailored for different sectors.“I am a believer in there will be diversity of chips,” she said, predicting a “Cambrian explosion” of custom chips as AI expands into fields like science, personal devices, and manufacturing.AMD and its rival Nvidia were recently given a break from the US rules that limited the export of certain AI chips to China. Lisa Su said that going forward, policy needs to be balanced, adding that allowing shipments to US allies will help make sure the country’s technology remains foundations to AI systems everywhere.“It’s a tricky dribble,” she said. “I think the administration has been doing a good job of working with us.”","AMD CEO Lisa Su said the global demand for AI chips could rapidly increase to more than $500 billion in a few years.

Will forced AI use actually boost workplace productivity

Yahoo Japan has announced that all 11,000 employees must integrate generative AI into their daily work tasks, aiming to double productivity by 2028 through comprehensive automation of routine workplace functions.The company, which also operates the popular LINE messaging app, will require staff to use AI tools for research, meeting documentation, expense management, and competitive analysis. The initiative targets tasks that consume approximately 30% of employees' time, including searching, drafting, and routine documentation.Yahoo Japan has already developed internal tools like SeekAI to manage expense claims and data searches using prompt templates. AI will also create agendas, summarize meetings, and proofread reports, enabling employees to focus on higher-level decision-making and strategic discussions rather than administrative tasks.Yahoo Japan isn't alone in forcing employees to embrace artificial intelligence. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke established AI use as a ""baseline expectation"" in an internal memo, requiring teams to demonstrate why AI cannot accomplish tasks before requesting additional resources.Amazon has taken an even more aggressive approach, with CEO Andy Jassy telling employees the company will need ""fewer people doing some of the jobs"" as AI automation expands. The e-commerce giant currently operates over 1,000 generative AI services and has cut more than 27,000 jobs since 2022, linking workforce reductions to AI-driven efficiency gains.Amazon's Ring division now requires employees to demonstrate AI usage for promotion eligibility, according to TechRadar. The company reported its AI coding assistant saved programmers 4,500 years of work through automated software upgrades.While companies tout productivity benefits, research suggests mixed outcomes from mandatory AI adoption. Some studies indicate AI may decrease rather than increase overall workplace productivity, raising questions about aggressive implementation timelines.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai has dismissed job displacement fears, describing AI as ""an accelerator"" that eliminates tedious tasks while creating opportunities for higher-value work. However, employee reactions remain skeptical, with Amazon workers expressing concerns about job security on internal communication channels.Yahoo Japan's comprehensive mandate represents a significant test case for whether mandatory AI integration can deliver promised productivity gains.","Yahoo Japan has announced that all 11,000 employees must integrate generative AI into their daily work tasks.

Speaking at the AI Action Summit in Paris, Vance said that “If the robots were coming to take all of our jobs, you would see it already.” Vance emphasised that the sign of a massive AI-driven job takeover would be far more evident if such a scenario were truly imminent. The remark from Vance is seen as a broader defense of Trump administration’s pro-worker AI strategy. Vance stressed on the fact that AI will augment human labour and not replace it. He also criticised the tech leaders who promote dystopian visions of mass layoffs.As reported by Business Insider, Vice President Vance criticised what he called ‘doomsday narratives’ from tech leader who believe that AI will eventually lead to widespread layoffs. “Too many leaders in the AI industry, when they talk about this fear of replacing workers, miss the point,” he said. “AI, we believe, is going to make us more productive, more prosperous, and more free.”His comments suggest a belief that while AI will undoubtedly transform industries and job roles, a sudden, widespread elimination of human labor is not currently underway or immediately foreseeable.Instead of complete job destruction, Vance anticipate a period of job evolution. He emphasised that AI as a tool will augment human capabilities and will also help in creating new kinds of jobs and will also create demands for new skills.The Vice President's remarks come as discussions around AI's societal implications intensify, with concerns ranging from ethical considerations to economic disruption. His statement serves as a call for a data-driven approach to understanding AI's impact, urging observers to look for concrete evidence of significant shifts in the labor market before succumbing to alarmist predictions.","US Vice President JD Vance does not agree with the idea that AI will lead to mass unemployment.

Not Trump's first warning to tech giants

US President Donald Trump delivered a sharp rebuke to American technology giants on Wednesday, criticizing them for building factories in China and hiring workers from India while neglecting American citizens. Speaking at an AI Summit in Washington, Trump declared that ""those days are over"" under his administration.""For too long, much of America's tech industry pursued a radical globalism that left millions of Americans feeling distrustful and betrayed,"" Trump said, according to PTI. The President accused major tech companies of exploiting American freedoms while outsourcing jobs overseas.""Many of our largest tech companies have reaped the blessings of American freedom while building their factories in China, hiring workers in India and slashing profits in Ireland,"" Trump stated, reports PTI. ""All the while dismissing and even censoring their fellow citizens right here at home. Under President Trump, those days are over.""During the summit, Trump signed three executive orders aimed at strengthening America's artificial intelligence capabilities. The orders include a White House action plan to bolster the domestic AI sector and promote exports of comprehensive American AI technology packages.""Winning the AI race will demand a new spirit of patriotism and national loyalty in Silicon Valley and long beyond Silicon Valley,"" Trump emphasized, calling for tech companies to prioritize American interests.The President urged US technology firms to demonstrate greater commitment to domestic workers. ""We need US technology companies to be all in for America. We want you to put America first. You have to do that. That's all we ask,"" he added, as reported by PTI.This isn't the first time Trump has warned tech companies about hiring immigrants. During his previous tenure in August 2020, he signed the "" Hire American "" executive order, which restricted federal agencies from contracting H-1B visa holders and mandated hiring American workers for government jobs.Trump's consistent messaging reflects his broader ""America First"" policy framework, which seeks to prioritize domestic workers over foreign talent in key sectors. ""H-1B should be used for top highly paid talent to create American jobs, not as inexpensive labour programmes and destroy American jobs,"" Trump had declared while signing that order.","US President Donald Trump delivered a sharp rebuke to American technology giants on Wednesday.

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has announced an ambitious plan to roll out a suite of AI-powered “Super Agents” aimed at enhancing customer experience and streamlining business operations. These agents, built using agentic AI , are designed to assist Walmart customers, employees, suppliers, and developers, becoming the primary interface for AI interactions within the company. The initiative highlights Walmart’s strategy to boost e-commerce sales, targeting a future where online sales account for 50% of total revenue within five years. The company believes these AI-powered solutions will strengthen its competitive edge against Amazon and reshape the future of retail.Walmart revealed that its four AI-powered agents are tailored to support different groups as reported by Reuters:Shoppers – offering personalised recommendations, automated reordering, and event planning.Store Employees – simplifying HR tasks and providing real-time sales insights.Suppliers and Sellers – streamlining onboarding, managing orders, and building ad campaigns.Software Developers – enabling the testing and deployment of future AI tools.These super agents will replace existing AI tools and act as a single entry point for AI interactions, providing more cohesive and automated support.One of the first tools available to customers is Sparky, a generative AI-powered assistant on the Walmart app. Currently, Sparky helps customers:In its enhanced “Super Agent” form, Sparky will handle advanced tasks like event planning (e.g., a unicorn-themed party), automatically reordering household items, and even using computer vision to generate recipes based on fridge contents.Walmart is introducing an “Associate Super Agent” to simplify employee operations. Tasks such as submitting parental leave applications or retrieving real-time sales data will require minimal input, improving efficiency for in-store workers and corporate teams. Previously, employees had to use multiple separate tools for these queries—something Walmart aims to eliminate.For sellers, suppliers, and advertisers, Walmart is building “Marty”, a Super Agent to enhance onboarding, order management, and advertising campaign creation. Additionally, the Developer Super Agent will serve as a platform for testing and launching future AI-powered tools, ensuring faster innovation and deployment across Walmart’s digital ecosystem.Unlike traditional generative AI, agentic AI requires minimal human intervention, allowing the system to make independent decisions and execute tasks efficiently. This evolution enables Walmart’s super agents to automate processes that were once manual, improving operational speed and accuracy across its network. Walmart recently appointed Daniel Danker, a former Instacart executive, as Executive Vice President (EVP) for AI Acceleration, Product, and Design. The retailer also created a new EVP of AI position, reflecting its commitment to AI leadership.While Walmart has not confirmed whether these agents will lead to job losses, the company has modernised e-commerce fulfillment centers and reduced corporate staff in recent years. Walmart executives, however, emphasized job creation in AI-focused areas, even as other tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have seen AI-related layoffs.Walmart’s investment in AI highlights its efforts to close the gap with Amazon, which has also introduced AI tools for sellers and shoppers. Walmart believes that by simplifying the shopping process, improving delivery speeds, and providing smarter product discovery, it can capture a larger share of e-commerce sales and strengthen its market dominance.","The world’s largest retailer has announced an ambitious plan to roll out a suite of AI-powered ‘Super Agents’ aimed at enhancing customer experience and streamlining business operations.

Meta's mind-reading wristband lets you control computers with just a thought,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/metas-mind-reading-wristband-lets-you-control-computers-with-just-a-thought/articleshow/122881338.cms,"How Meta's gesture control technology actually works

AI breakthrough solves decades-old problems

Meta has unveiled a revolutionary wristband that reads electrical signals from your muscles to control computers without lifting a finger. The experimental device, detailed in a research paper published Wednesday in Nature journal, can move cursors, open apps, and even type letters in the air simply by detecting what you intend to do, before you actually do it.The prototype looks like an oversized smartwatch, wearing which users can navigate their laptop screen with a gentle wrist turn, launch desktop applications by tapping thumb to forefinger, or write messages by tracing letters in the air as if holding an invisible pencil. According to the New York Times, the technology reads electrical signals that pulse through forearm muscles when fingers move.Unlike Elon Musk's Neuralink, which requires surgical brain implants, Meta's approach is refreshingly simple. Anyone can strap on the rectangular wristwatch-sized device and start using it immediately. Meta’s implementation of mind-control technology uses surface electromyography to detect muscle signals from outside the skin, no surgery needed.The wristband uses surface electromyography (sEMG) to capture electrical signals generated by neurons in the spinal cord before they reach muscle fibers. These signals are strong enough to read through skin and move faster than actual muscle movement, allowing the device to predict actions milliseconds before they happen.The breakthrough lies in Meta's ability to isolate individual muscle fiber activity at what Reardon calls ""the atomic level of the nervous system."" When you think about moving your finger, your brain sends electrical commands through alpha motor neurons that connect directly to specific muscle fibers. Because these neural signals are so strong when they reach the muscles, the wristband's sensors can detect them through the skin without needing brain surgery. The device can read these signals even when only a tiny number of fibers activate, allowing users to control computers through pure intention rather than physical movement.""You don't have to actually move,"" Thomas Reardon, Meta's vice president of research leading the project, told the Times. ""You just have to intend the move."" The team trained artificial intelligence on data from 10,000 volunteers to identify common electrical patterns, making the device work immediately for new users without calibration.Meta says it used artificial intelligence to analyse muscle signal patterns. After collecting data from 10,000 volunteers, researchers used neural networks to identify common electrical patterns that work across different users. ""Out of the box, it can work with a new user it has never seen data for,"" explained Patrick Kaifosh , director of research science at Meta's Reality Labs. This AI breakthrough solved the decades-old calibration problem that killed earlier devices like the discontinued Myo armband.The company has already demonstrated the wristband's commercial potential by pairing it with experimental smart glasses last fall. The combination allows users to take photos, record videos, play music, and access verbal descriptions of their surroundings, all through simple hand gestures. This integration points to Meta's future strategy, with plans to integrate the wristband into products over the next few years, potentially starting with their smart glasses.The technology also opens up transformative possibilities for people with disabilities. Carnegie Mellon researchers are testing the wristband with spinal cord injury patients who retain some muscle activity but can't fully use their hands. Even with complete hand paralysis, the device can interpret intended actions from minimal muscle fiber activation, providing new pathways for digital interaction.","Wristband reads electrical signals from your muscles to control computers without lifting a finger.

‘Bad and dangerous…’: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s warning to young people who rely ‘too much’ on ChatGPT,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bad-and-dangerous-openai-ceo-sam-altmans-warning-to-young-people-who-rely-too-much-on-chatgpt/articleshow/122881081.cms,"50% teenagers trust information given by AI: Survey

Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has warned against ‘too much’ reliance on its AI chatbot ChatGPT for decision-making. Speaking at a banking conference hosted by the Federal Reserve this week, Altman said “People rely on ChatGPT too much. There's young people who say things like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me, it knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me.” Sam Altman said that this over-reliance on ChatGPT is “a really common thing with young people.”Stating that OpenAI is “trying to understand what to do about it,” he added “Even if ChatGPT gives great advice, even if ChatGPT gives way better advice than any human therapist, something about collectively deciding we're going to live our lives the way AI tells us feels bad and dangerous”.Earlier this year, Sam Altman revealed how people use ChatGPT depending on their age. Speaking at Sequoia Capital's AI Ascent event, Altman was asked a question about how young people use ChatGPT. Replying to the question, he said “Gross oversimplification, but like, older people use ChatGPT as a Google replacement”, adding “Maybe people in their 20s and 30s use it like a life advisor, something”. ""And then, like, people in college use it as an operating system,” he stated.“They really do use it like an operating system. They have complex ways to set it up to connect it to a bunch of files, and they have fairly complex prompts memorised in their head or in something where they paste in and out,” Sam Altman added.“There's this other thing where they don't really make life decisions without asking ChatGPT what they should do. It has the full context on every person in their life and what they've talked about”, he further explained.Sam Altman’s remarks come amidst a recent survey that revealed 72% of respondents used AI companions at least one time. The study conducted by Common Sense Media surveyed 1,060 teens between the ages of 13 and 17 responded during April and May. As per the findings, 52% of the respondents said that they use the technology at least a few times per month.Half of the people in the survey said they trust the advice and information from their AI companion at least a little. But trust levels were different by age. Younger teens were more likely to trust AI — 27% of those aged 13 to 14 said so, compared to 20% of those aged 15 to 17.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has warned against ‘too much’ reliance on its AI chatbot ChatGPT for decision-making.

The US President Donald Trump's administration has launched a comprehensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) policy aimed at enhancing US technological leadership while reducing regulatory barriers to AI development. Positioned as a strategic counter to China’s expanding digital sphere of influence, the plan also reflects the administration’s broader America First agenda. This AI Action Plan focuses on accelerating data infrastructure, exporting US AI technology stacks, and strengthening global partnerships to counter China’s growing AI influence. Major US technology companies—including Palantir, Google, Meta, and Amazon—have welcomed the move, calling it a crucial step toward innovation and economic growth. However, experts caution that while deregulation and technology exports may strengthen US competitiveness, challenges such as ideological bias in AI models and geopolitical concerns over “AI dominance” remain.The Trump administration has unveiled a comprehensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) policy aimed at solidifying America’s leadership in emerging technologies. This policy, called the AI Action Plan, focuses on reducing regulatory barriers, expanding technological exports, and strengthening global alliances to counter China’s rising influence in AI development and governance.The White House aims to accomplish its ambitious, Silicon Valley-aligned vision by loosening regulations on artificial intelligence, while introducing one key MAGA-friendly provision focused on eliminating political “bias” within AI systems. The strategy is built on three core pillars: accelerating AI innovation, expanding US AI infrastructure, and positioning American hardware and software as the global standard for AI development.Additionally, the plan emphasises that large language models used by federal agencies must remain “objective and free from top-down ideological bias,” according to the 28‑page document released by the White House on Wednesday.The newly unveiled policy outlines three major areas of focus:The administration aims to simplify regulations and ease permitting for AI infrastructure, including large-scale data centers and energy support systems.The plan calls for exporting complete AI stacks—hardware, models, software, applications, and standards—to allied nations. Officials argue that meeting global demand will prevent reliance on rival nations’ technology.The policy pledges to actively counter China’s growing presence in international AI governance, ensuring that global standards align more closely with US values and innovation priorities.The plan received widespread approval from the American tech industry:Palantir Technologies lauded the plan, calling AI “the birthright of the country that harnessed the atom and put a man on the moon.”NetChoice, a leading industry trade group representing Meta, Amazon, and Google, praised the focus on deregulation and investment in innovation. The group emphasised that streamlined policies would accelerate adoption and commercialization of AI across industries, as reported.A significant aspect of the plan focuses on correcting “ideological bias” in AI systems. Experts warn, however, that addressing such biases is inherently difficult and may face constitutional challenges under the First Amendment. High-performing language models often need to process sensitive or contested subjects such as climate change, public policy, and social issues, which complicates attempts to create fully “neutral” systems.While the plan calls for US “AI dominance,” experts caution that this language could strain relations with allied countries wary of overdependence on American technology. Vivek Chilukuri, director of the technology and national security program at CNAS, noted that Washington already has significant leverage across the AI stack. He argued for fostering balanced partnerships that respect other nations’ sovereignty while promoting US-led innovation. Analysts warn that a purely dominance-oriented approach may evoke concerns similar to existing anxieties around dependence on US cloud providers and digital infrastructure.The Trump administration’s AI plan represents a strategic shift toward deregulation and global technology expansion, signaling strong government support for rapid innovation. While this may accelerate US leadership in AI, implementation challenges including managing AI bias, navigating geopolitical sensitivities, and ensuring equitable access to technology will define its success. Experts stress the need for careful execution, emphasising partnerships and responsible AI practices to maintain trust both domestically and internationally.","US President Donald Trump's administration has launched a comprehensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) policy aimed at enhancing US technological leadership.

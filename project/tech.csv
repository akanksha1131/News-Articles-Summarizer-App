Elon Musk’s justification for the break



In a dramatic escalation of tensions between two of the most prominent figures in American business and politics, Elon Musk has officially announced the formation of a new political organisation called the “America Party.” The announcement came on Saturday, July 5, 2025, following weeks of growing disagreement between President Donald Trump and the administration over the recently passed tax-and-spending bill.The new legislation, which includes sweeping tax cuts and expanded defence spending, has drawn criticism from Musk and others who warn that it could significantly inflate the US budget deficit. Musk, once a vocal supporter of Trump and a key player in federal advisory roles, now appears poised to take on members of the Republican establishment during the upcoming midterm elections.According to a report by Reuters, Musk shared the news of the party’s formation through his social media platform X, citing the results of a public poll showing strong support for an alternative to the traditional two-party system. The implications of Musk’s political move are already reverberating across Wall Street, Washington, and Silicon Valley.Elon Musk’s political shift marks a stark change from his earlier alignment with President Trump. During Trump’s previous term, Musk served in a high-profile advisory position as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He also provided financial support to Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign.However, their relationship began to unravel over the content of Trump’s latest tax bill. According to The Daily Beast, Musk strongly opposed the bill’s elimination of green energy credits that had benefited Tesla’s electric vehicle business. Trump, in turn, has accused Musk of acting out of self-interest and has threatened to revoke billions in federal contracts from both Tesla and SpaceX.President Trump responded publicly to Musk’s announcement during a press interaction on July 6. Calling the move “ridiculous,” Trump dismissed the formation of a third party as a distraction and warned that it could disrupt the nation’s political balance.The White House has not issued an official statement, but Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers Chair Stephen Miran defended the administration’s policy on ABC’s “This Week,” claiming that the tax bill would “turbocharge” economic growth. Miran also downplayed Musk’s political influence, saying, “The principles of DOGE were very popular, but if you looked at the polling, Elon was not.”Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent publicly urged Musk to prioritise his responsibilities as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. In a CNN interview, Bessent remarked, “I imagine that those boards of directors did not like this announcement yesterday and will be encouraging him to focus on his business activities, not his political activities.”The fallout from Musk’s announcement was immediate. According to a Reuters report published on July 6, investment firm Azoria Partners delayed the launch of its Tesla-linked Convexity ETF due to uncertainties over Musk’s political ambitions. Azoria CEO James Fishback publicly urged Tesla’s board to review whether Musk’s political commitments were compatible with his corporate duties.Tesla’s stock price dropped nearly 7% following the news, extending a broader decline of about 35% since late 2024. Analysts cited rising political risk and leadership distraction as key concerns for investors.Fishback, writing on X, stated: “I encourage the Board to meet immediately and ask Elon to clarify his political ambitions and evaluate whether they are compatible with his full-time obligations to Tesla as CEO.” He later added, “Elon left us with no other choice.”Musk’s newly formed America Party is designed to operate outside of traditional Republican and Democratic platforms. According to an overview shared on Musk’s X profile and summarized in The New York Post, the party will focus on several core issues:Rather than fielding a presidential candidate, Musk stated that the party’s immediate focus is to win “a couple of key congressional seats” in the 2026 midterms and reshape the legislative priorities of the Republican majority.Musk has framed his departure from the GOP as a necessary response to what he views as irresponsible fiscal policy. In a series of posts on X, he described Trump’s bill as “insanely expensive” and claimed that it would “destroy the American balance sheet.”He emphasised that the America Party is intended to restore what he calls “pragmatic conservatism,” centred on technological advancement and fiscal restraint. According to Reuters, Musk is also considering launching PACs to support like-minded candidates, although no official filings have been made yet with the Federal Election Commission.","Elon Musk has officially announced the formation of a new political organisation called the ‘America Party’ The announcement came on Saturday, July 5, 2025, following weeks of growing disagreement between President Donald Trump and the administration over the recently passed tax-and-spending bill.

"'Actually, Jeffrey Epstein never even existed ...,' how Elon Musk and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones reacted ANGRILY to Justice Department's BIG U-turn",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/actually-jeffrey-epstein-never-even-existed-how-elon-musk-and-conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones-reacted-angrily-to-justice-departments-big-u-turn/articleshow/122305766.cms,"What is the Big U-Turn on Epstein files

This is over-the-top sickening ..., say critics

The US Department of Justice (DoJ) confirmed on Monday, June 7, that Jeffrey Epstein , the disgraced financier convicted of sex trafficking, did not maintain a ""client list"" documenting individuals to whom underage girls were allegedly trafficked. This statement marks a significant reversal from earlier claims by Attorney General Pam Bondi, who had fueled speculation among conservative influencers and conspiracy theorists by suggesting such a list existed. The DOJ also announced that no further files related to Epstein’s sex trafficking investigation would be released, dashing hopes of new revelations about the case.In a January 2025 Fox News interview, Bondi had claimed that a ""client list"" was ""sitting on my desk"" for review, a statement that amplified theories about high-profile individuals linked to Epstein’s crimes. These remarks aligned with narratives promoted during the Trump administration, which had suggested the existence of such a document. However, the DOJ’s latest acknowledgment debunks this theory, stating that no evidence of a formal client list has been found among Epstein’s records.The announcement drew sharp criticism from conservative circles. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones posted on Twitter, ""Next, the DOJ will say ‘Actually, Jeffrey Epstein never even existed.’ This is over-the-top sickening."" Similarly, Elon Musk shared a meme featuring a clown applying makeup, seemingly mocking Bondi’s earlier claims and the DOJ’s retraction.The backlash highlights the persistent public fascination with Epstein’s case and the belief among some that powerful figures connected to him have evaded accountability. The DOJ disclosed that it possesses over 10,000 videos and images related to Epstein’s case, which officials described as containing child sex abuse material or ""other pornography."" Bondi had previously cited the volume of evidence -- claiming the FBI was reviewing ""tens of thousands"" of recordings involving Epstein ""with children or child porn""— as a reason for delays in releasing additional materials. Sources familiar with the investigation, as reported by The New York Times in 2024, noted that much of this material was seized from Epstein’s properties, including his Manhattan townhouse and private island, Little Saint James. However, the DOJ clarified that these files do not include a client list or evidence directly implicating specific high-profile individuals beyond what has already been made public.The Epstein case, which has spanned decades, continues to captivate public attention due to his connections with influential figures, including politicians, business tycoons, and celebrities.The DOJ’s decision to withhold further documents has reignited debates about transparency. Legal experts, quoted in a 2024 Washington Post article, suggest that the department may be withholding materials to protect ongoing investigations or due to the sensitive nature of the content, which includes explicit imagery. Critics, however, argue that the lack of disclosure fuels distrust and speculation about a cover-up.","The US Department of Justice (DoJ) confirmed on Monday, June 7, that Jeffrey Epstein did not maintain a ""client list"" documenting individuals to whom underage girls were allegedly trafficked.

"Microsoft's latest operating system claims majority market share after nearly four years, driven by Windows 10's approaching end-of-support deadline",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-latest-operating-system-claims-majority-market-share-after-nearly-four-years-driven-by-windows-10s-approaching-end-of-support-deadline/articleshow/122304437.cms,"Strict hardware requirements slowed initial adoption

Windows 11 has officially surpassed Windows 10 to become the world's most widely used desktop operating system, according to new data from Stat Counter. The milestone comes nearly four years after Windows 11's controversial debut and just months before Windows 10's support cutoff.As of July 2025, Windows 11 now commands 52% of the global Windows market share, while Windows 10 has dropped to 44.6%. This represents a dramatic shift from December 2024, when Windows 10 still dominated with 62% compared to Windows 11's 35%.The surge in Windows 11 adoption appears directly tied to Microsoft 's announcement that Windows 10 support will end on October 14, 2025. The company has been aggressively pushing users to upgrade, sometimes displaying full-screen prompts encouraging hardware upgrades for incompatible machines.Windows 11's rise to prominence wasn't immediate. The operating system faced significant headwinds due to Microsoft's decision to implement stricter hardware requirements, including mandatory TPM 2.0 security chips. These requirements left millions of Windows 10 machines ineligible for the free upgrade, forcing users to either purchase new computers or remain on the older system.The adoption pace proved notably slower than Windows 10's launch. While Windows 10 reached 400 million devices within just over a year, Windows 11 took two full years to achieve the same milestone, according to leaked Microsoft data from October 2023.Microsoft has offered some relief for Windows 10 holdouts, recently announcing a free one-year extension of security updates for users willing to enable Windows Backup and sync their Documents folder to OneDrive. Users can alternatively pay $30 for extended support or redeem 1,000 Microsoft Reward points.The transition marks a significant victory for Microsoft's strategy to modernize its user base, though the company's heavy-handed approach and controversial features like mandatory Microsoft accounts have drawn criticism from users preferring Windows 10's familiar interface.","Windows 11 has surpassed Windows 10 to become the world's most widely used desktop operating system.

Former OpenAI executive Peter Deng believes that building the right team is like solving a complex puzzle — every piece must fit perfectly. Now a general partner at Felicis Ventures , Deng shared his views on leadership, team-building, and hiring during a recent episode of Lenny’s Podcast. Speaking at the podcast, Deng compared strong teams to the Avengers, where each member brings a different “superpower” to the table. ""The teams that I've helped build are — the most successful ones are a team of Avengers that are just very different, have very different superpowers,"" he said.Deng is known for his work on major consumer tech products, including ChatGPT Enterprise, Facebook Messenger , and Uber Reserve. At OpenAI, he played a key role in shaping the user experience of AI tools.""As a leader, you have to set up your team the right way,"" Deng said. ""You have to really think about your team as a product and what are the various pieces you need to really stretch the gamut of what you're thinking about,"" Deng stated.""But together, you as the leader are the one who's helping adjudicate any differences or any disagreements, but you know you're getting the best outcome when everyone's pulling and obsessing over a different thing,"" he saidWhen hiring, Deng said two traits matter most: the ability to work independently and a deep desire to grow. ""I think the growth mindset thing is so important to me — that we build an org where people are self-reflective, and want to get better, and take that feedback, and give that feedback,"" he said.""And it just is this meta unlock that I found to be true.""He added that he actively looks for specialists who fill specific gaps, likening the process to designing a role-playing game (RPG) team.""It's almost like you're playing an RPG where everyone has different sliders and you have to create this super team where everyone actually spikes in different ways,"" Deng explained.","Peter Deng is a general partner at Felicis Ventures.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence (AI), the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Huang said both AI and robotics represent what he believes a “multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity”. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said during the conference. Nvidia’s robotics division has seen fast growth in the past. Currently making up just 1% of Nvidia’s total revenue, the revenue brought in $567 million last quarter – a steep 72% rise from the previous year.“We’re working towards a day where there will be billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories that can be powered by Nvidia technology,” Huang said.Huang also emphasized a shift in how the company sees itself. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” he said, adding that Nvidia is now focused on being an “AI infrastructure” and “computing platform” provider.During the annual shareholder meeting, Huang said that Nvidia’s chips will be key not just for AI training, but also for software and hardware use in autonomous vehicles and robots. He named self-driving cars as the first major commercial use of Nvidia’s robotics technology. Nvidia’s Drive platform, a suite of chips and software for autonomous cars, is currently being used by Mercedes-Benz.The chipmaker recently introduced Cosmos, a line of AI models designed for humanoid robots.In a related news, Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company with a market cap of around $3.75 trillion. The company has rebounded strongly since a market dip earlier this year, which was caused by concerns about competition from China’s DeepSeek AI.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence, the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122088756,imgsize-19028,width-400,resizemode-4/Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Huang.jpg"

The US Embassy in India has issued a clear warning for visa applicants. “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas,” the embassy said in a post on microblogging site X (previously known as Twitter). The post reminded visa applicants to disclose all social media usernames or handles they’ve used over the past five years while filling out the DS-160 visa application form. “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form” the post read. “Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit.”The requirement is part of broader vetting procedures introduced by the US State Department in recent years. As part of the updated rules, applicants must list IDs used on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and others—even if the accounts are no longer active from the last five years.The move comes days after the US government issued a new guideline for those applying for student and exchange visitor visas. Applicable to all applicants of F, M, and J non-immigrant visas, the new rule requires these applicants to set their social media accounts to public. “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under U.S. law,"" the US embassy in India wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post.F, M and J visas are the common types of non-immigrant visas issued by the agency to foreign nationals who wish to study or participate in exchange visitor programs in the U.S. F visa is typically used by academic students, the M visa by vocational students, and the J visa by exchange visitors, including researchers, scholars, and interns.In a related news, USCIS has announced that it will switch to a new phone number for sending text (SMS) messages. “Effective July 1, 2025, USCIS will no longer send text (SMS) messages from the phone number 468-311 (GOV-311).

Read OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s complete post here

I’m not big on identities, but I am extremely proud to be American. This is true every day, but especially today—I firmly believe this is the greatest country ever on Earth. The American miracle stands alone in world history.

I believe in techno-capitalism. We should encourage people to make tons of money and then also find ways to widely distribute wealth and share the compounding magic of capitalism. One doesn’t work without the other; you cannot raise the floor and not also raise the ceiling for very long.

The world should get richer every year through science and technology, but everyone has to be in the “up elevator”. I think the government usually does a worse job than markets, and so we need to encourage our culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. I also believe that education is critically important to keeping the American edge.

I believed this when I was 20, when I was 30, and now I am 40 and still believe it. The Democratic party seemed reasonably aligned with it when I was 20, losing the plot when I was 30, and completely to have moved somewhere else at this point. So now I am politically homeless. But that’s fine; I care much, much more about being American than any political party.

I’d rather hear from candidates about how they are going to make everyone have the stuff billionaires have instead of how they are going to eliminate billionaires.

The American experiment has always been messy. I am hopeful for another great 250 years. Happy 4th!","Sam Altman is the Chief Executive Officer of OpenAI.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has confirmed that a Model Y car successfully drove itself from the company’s factory near Austin to a customer’s home, marking what he described as the ""first time"" for such an autonomous delivery. This move showcases Tesla's ongoing push into autonomous driving technology. In a post shared on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter), the tech billionaire said that the autonomous delivery of the Model Y occurred ""across town"" and included travel on highways. He also mentioned that the delivery was completed “a day ahead of schedule."" In a comment on the post, the tech billionaire also specified that there was no one inside the car during the delivery, nor were there any remote operators controlling the vehicle.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other top executives sell over $1 billion in company shares: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-and-other-top-executives-sell-over-1-billion-in-company-shares-report/articleshow/122155830.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells shares

Other Nvidia executives cash in

Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year, reports Financial Times. As per the report, over $500 million of those sales took place in June alone, as the chipmaker's stock price climbed to a record high, making Nvidia the world’s most valuable company. The report highlights that Nvidia insiders are capitalizing on the market’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, which has driven massive investor interest and sent the stock price soaring.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began selling his shares last week for the first time since September 2024. The company confirmed that his sales were made under a pre-arranged trading plan set in March, which defines the prices and dates for share sales. Such plans are commonly used by executives to avoid allegations of insider trading.Ben Silverman, vice-president of research at VerityData said “When the stock [dropped] in the first quarter, he did not sell, [which was] really smart.”“[Huang] waited for the stock to return to levels that he felt more comfortable selling at,” he added.According to VerityData, his sales began after a required 90-day cooling-off period ended. Under the trading plan, Huang can sell up to 6 million shares before the end of 2025. At current stock prices, that would amount to more than $900 million. Forbes estimates his net worth at $138 billion.According to the Financial Times report, several other top Nvidia figures have also sold large portions of stock. Mark Stevens, a longtime board member and early Nvidia investor, disclosed plans to sell up to 4 million shares on June 2, currently worth around $550 million. He has already sold $288 million worth.Jay Puri, Nvidia’s executive vice-president of worldwide field operations, sold $25 million in stock last week, says FT. Board members Tench Coxe and Brooke Seawell also made sales — Coxe offloaded around $143 million on June 9, and Seawell sold about $48 million in June.These executives, all long-time members of Nvidia’s leadership team, have been with the company since its early days. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 inside a Denny’s restaurant in San Jose. Coxe and Seawell, both with venture capital backgrounds, joined the board in the late 1990s.AI boom fuels Nvidia’s stock surgeDespite recent setbacks — including U.S. export controls and advances by Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek — Nvidia’s share price has bounced back. Since hitting a low in April, the company has regained about $1.5 trillion in market value.The company’s market value is not estimated at around $3.8 trillion. The rapid growth reflects strong global demand for the company’s chips, used to power AI systems across industries and governments.","Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year.

US President Donald Trump’s reaction to Elon Musk’s America Party



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has officially launched a new political party called the America Party. Musk posted on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) about the creation of the new political outfit. ““By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it! Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.” The announcement to form a new political party was followed by a user poll on X in which more than 65% users supported the idea of forming a new political party in US .After forming the America Party, Elon Musk appointed Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja as the Treasurer and Custodian of Records for the new political unit. As per the fillings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), Taneja will look over the financial disclosures, campaign donations and compliance operations of the party.Vaibhav Taneja kick-started his career in business in India with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Delhi University in 1999. He then went on to become a Chartered Accountant (CA) from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) in 2000. In 2006, he also became the illustrious Certified Public Accountant (CPA) of the United States, once again establishing himself as an accounting and finance expert.Taneja spent close to 17 years in PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and bridged both India and the United States. He acquired valuable experience in auditing, regulation compliance, and financial services during his time working for PwC, which laid a solid foundation for his subsequent career in the corporate sector.In 2016, Taneja broke into the industry when he joined SolarCity, a solar energy firm that later merged with Tesla. This was the start of his association with Elon Musk's electric car firm. After Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2017, Taneja became Assistant Corporate Controller. He advanced within the company and was later appointed Corporate Controller in 2018 and Chief Accounting Officer in 2019.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has officially launched a new political party called the America Party. However, US President Donald Trump has completely dismissed Elon Musk’s newly launched political unit. Calling the America Party ‘ridiculous’, Trump said that creation of a new party will only create confusion, chaos and disruption in the American political system.Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One, Trump said, “It’s always been a two-party system. Starting a third party just adds to confusion. Third parties have never worked. He can have fun with it, but I think it’s ridiculous.” He emphasised the Republican Party’s recent legislative victories and called it a “smooth-running machine,” contrasting it with what he described as Musk’s “train wreck” of a political venture.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has officially launched a new political party called the America Party.

ASI

form of intelligence vastly superior to that of any individual human as the next seismic shift in technological evolution

seeks to match human cognitive abilities

From writing code to replacing coders—AI’s next leap is already here



Schmidt warns the jump from AGI to ASI could outpace global systems



Schmidt warns the world is unprepared for the coming age of superintelligence



Schmidt urges to prepare for ASI before it’s too late



As debates around AI ethics, automation, and job displacement continue to dominate public discourse, a far more consequential development is quietly emerging—one that, according to former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, is not receiving nearly the attention it deserves. In a recent episode of the Special Competitive Studies Project podcast, Schmidt delivered a compelling warning: Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) is on the horizon, and society is dangerously underprepared to face its arrival.As per the public conversations often fous on near-term AI risks such as algorithmic bias or job automation, Schmidt’s concern lies in what lies just beyond the visible curve of innovation. He points to the emergence of, a. Unlike Artificial General Intelligence (), which, ASI represents a system capable of surpassing not just individual intelligence, but potentially the collective intelligence of all humans combined.“People do not understand what happens when you have intelligence at this level, which is largely free,” Schmidt warned.One of Schmidt’s most provocative predictions is that AI could make most programming jobs obsolete within a year. He cites advances in recursive self-improvement—where AI systems write and improve their own code using formal systems like Lean—as a key driver of this shift. Currently, AI is already contributing significantly to software development. In Schmidt’s words: “Ten to twenty percent of the code in research labs like OpenAI and Anthropic is now being written by AI itself.”As these systems continue to evolve, they will not only become faster and more efficient but also begin outperforming even elite graduate-level human mathematicians in areas such as advanced coding and structured reasoning. This presents a foundational change in the role of human labor in tech—moving from creator to supervisor, or potentially being removed from the loop altogether.According to Schmidt, many in Silicon Valley are in agreement that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)—a system capable of human-like reasoning across disciplines will be achieved within the next three to five years. However, he emphasises that AGI is merely a stepping stone.The more dramatic leap, he says, will occur just a year or two after AGI: the rise of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). He calls this trajectory the “San Francisco Consensus”—a term reflecting the growing alignment among tech elites about the short timeline to ASI.“This occurs within six years, just based on scaling,” Schmidt stated. Unlike earlier technological shifts, the transition to ASI may happen so rapidly and dramatically that traditional systems—governance, legal, economic—may be unable to adapt in time.Despite the potentially transformative—and even existential—implications of ASI, Schmidt points out a critical gap in public awareness and discourse. The issue, he argues, is not just the speed of AI’s evolution but the lack of conceptual language and institutional frameworks to engage with it meaningfully.“There’s no language for what happens with the arrival of this,” he remarked.“This is happening faster than our society, our democracy, our laws will interact.”In other words, the world’s democratic and policy systems are trailing far behind the pace of innovation, creating a dangerous mismatch between technological capability and societal readiness. As AI systems move beyond human capabilities, Schmidt presents two possible paths forward. On one side lies the promise of a technological renaissance, driven by superintelligent systems capable of solving some of humanity’s greatest challenges. On the other lies the risk of institutional collapse, ethical crisis, and unprecedented societal upheaval.“Superintelligence isn’t a question of if, but when,” Schmidt seems to caution. And the real danger, he suggests, may be our collective failure to adequately prepare.Eric Schmidt’s warnings are not based on speculative science fiction—they’re grounded in conversations happening today among the people building tomorrow’s technologies. Whether one agrees with his timeline or not, his message is clear: Artificial Superintelligence is not a distant concept—it is fast becoming a present reality.As this reality approaches, the world must shift its focus from narrow debates about near-term AI risks to a broader, deeper dialogue about long-term governance, ethics, and preparedness for what could be the most transformative force in human history.",Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt warns that AI will surpass all human intelligence in few years.

Feud between Musk and Gates

OPPO Find X8 Ultra Review: Camera Powerhouse with Next-Gen Imaging!

Microsoft founder Bill Gates recently shared a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) stating how health aid cuts by the US government will “cost lives”. “The facts are simple and devastating: Aid cuts have already cost lives, and the number of deaths will continue to rise,” Gates wrote, adding “ending PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief)-supported programs for people living with HIV could result in an additional 4.2 million deaths by 2029”. Though the post doesn’t name Elon Musk , the Tesla CEO hit back with a sharp response to Gates.X user named John Hawkins responded to Gates’ post stating: “Bro, you are worth 117 billion dollars. If you really think aid cuts are costing lives, feel free to make up the difference.” Musk agreed with him, replying 'Exactly"". But the tech billionaire did not stop there. He continued:“The real reason Gates is unhappy is that HIS organization isn’t getting billions in US taxpayer money anymore.”Notably, this is not the first time that Musk has taken a jab at Bill Gates. Last year in December, he said that Gates might go bankrupt if Tesla becomes “the world’s most valuable company by far”. In an X post then, Musk said “If Tesla does become the world’s most valuable company by far, that short position will bankrupt even Bill Gates”.The animosity between Elon Musk and Bill Gates originates from Gates’ reported short position against Tesla stock. According to Walter Isaacson’s 2023 biography of Musk, this position allegedly cost Gates a $1.5 billion loss.Short position here refers to a stock market strategy where an investor borrows shares of a stock they do not own, sells them on the open market, and aims to buy them back later at a lower price. The goal is to profit from a decline in the stock's price.","Bill Gates recently shared a post on microblogging platform X stating how health aid cuts by the US government will “cost lives” Though the post doesn’t name Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO hit back with a sharp response to Gates.

I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely “off the rails,” essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks. He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States - The System seems not designed for them.

The one thing Third Parties are good for is the creation of Complete and Total DISRUPTION & CHAOS, and we have enough of that with the Radical Left Democrats, who have lost their confidence and their minds! Republicans, on the other hand, are a smooth running “machine,” that just passed the biggest Bill of its kind in the History of our Country.

Additionally, Elon asked that one of his close friends run NASA and, while I thought his friend was very good, I was surprised to learn that he was a blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.

I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely “off the rails,” essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks. He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States - The System seems not designed for them. The one thing Third Parties are good for is the creation of Complete and Total DISRUPTION & CHAOS, and we have enough of that with the Radical Left Democrats, who have lost their confidence and their minds! Republicans, on the other hand, are a smooth running “machine,” that just passed the biggest Bill of its kind in the History of our Country. It is a Great Bill but, unfortunately for Elon, it eliminates the ridiculous Electric Vehicle (EV) Mandate, which would have forced everyone to buy an Electric Car in a short period of time. I have been strongly opposed to that from the very beginning.

People are now allowed to buy whatever they want - Gasoline Powered, Hybrids (which are doing very well), or New Technologies as they come about - No more EV Mandate.

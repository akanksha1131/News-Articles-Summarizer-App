Apple planning to buy Intel: What and why of rumours of Apple acquiring the 56-year-old chipmaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-planning-to-buy-intel-what-and-why-of-rumours-of-apple-acquiring-the-56-year-old-chipmaker/articleshow/114861241.cms,"Why Apple may acquire Intel

A persistent rumour suggests Apple might be considering a shocking acquisition: Intel. As to how this Apple planning to buy Intel rumour started? They come from the tech YouTube channel 'Moore's Law is Dead', where Tom S. reported ""whispers"" of a potential purchase of Intel by Apple. He, at the same time, also claimed that Samsung too is interested in acquiring or merging with the chip manufacturer Intel.While this idea may seem utterly absurd to many, it would certainly be a dramatic twist in the long-running saga of the PC industry.Back in 2019, Apple did acquire Intel's modem division, but this new rumour proposes a full-scale takeover of the entire chipmaker. While Samsung is also mentioned as a potential buyer, it's Apple's involvement that piques the most interest, and perhaps a touch of amusement.Once a dominant force in the PC industry, Intel's fortunes have waned in recent years. The company has faced numerous challenges, from manufacturing delays to declining market share. Despite repeated promises of groundbreaking new processors, Intel has struggled to regain its former glory.Meanwhile, Apple has successfully transitioned away from Intel's chips, developing its own powerful Apple Silicon processors. These chips have consistently outperformed Intel's offerings, solidifying Apple's position in the tech industry. If Apple acquires Intel, the iPhone maker could free itself from an overreliance on TSMC for chips.Also, please note that the Youtuber Tom reiterates several times in the video that these are all rumours, and it's not clear if any purchase of Intel is actually in the works.","A persistent rumour suggests Apple might be considering a shocking acquisition: Intel.

A popular Thai YouTuber , Natthamon Khongchak, known as "" Nutty ,"" has been arrested after two years on the run in Indonesia. The 31-year-old influencer, who once dreamed of K-pop stardom, is now facing charges for a massive investment scam that defrauded thousands of her followers out of millions of dollars.According to South China Morning Post, ""Khongchak boasted over 800,000 followers on her YouTube channel, where she went viral with her singing and dancing videos covering popular K-pop groups Blackpink and BTS . She aimed to become a K-pop idol and even made a brief debut in South Korea under the label Dream Cinema .""In 2022, she launched a forex investment scheme promising her supporters high returns. Khongchak is alleged to have used her fame to promote a fraudulent forex investment scheme. She promised returns of up to 35% annually, luring victims with promises of wealth and financial freedom. When the victims reportedly failed to receive their returns, Khongchak is said to have told them she had made a trading error.When the promised returns failed to materialize, Khongchak vanished, leaving her followers in the lurch. She and her mother fled to Indonesia, attempting to blend in as locals. Disguised as locals, the duo are reported to have evaded 13 warrants issued by the Thai police Cybercrime Investigation Bureau for Khongchak and two warrants for her mother.However, their cover was blown when immigration officials suspected their foreign accents and asked her to sing the Indonesian national anthem and recite the country’s constitution.The duo were arrested in Riau province, Indonesia, and extradited back to Thailand.","Thai YouTuber Natthamon Khongchak has been arrested after two years on the run in Indonesia.

In the fast-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), Meta Platforms, Inc. is positioning itself as a key player. During its recent third-quarter earnings call, Meta executives underscored their commitment to substantial AI investment, linking this focus to the company's robust quarterly financial performance. As per reports, the company’s revenue reached $40.59 billion, surpassing market expectations of $40.25 billion. CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed this success to the strategic deployment of AI, which he believes has unlocked new growth avenues across Meta's core business. However, Zuckerberg also acknowledged that maintaining momentum requires considerable infrastructure investment, underlining AI’s significant role in Meta’s forward strategy.In the third quarter of 2024, Meta’s revenue climbed to $40.59 billion, exceeding analyst expectations of $40.25 billion. According to Zuckerberg, advancements in AI contributed significantly to this financial milestone. AI technology has improved Meta's products and services, enhancing user engagement and advertising efficiency. As a result, these improvements are contributing positively to the company's top-line growth.AI-driven capabilities have enabled Meta to personalise user experiences and deliver targeted advertisements more accurately. The company also reported that AI has enabled higher content relevance for users, a factor that keeps engagement levels high and improves advertising outcomes. These AI enhancements are likely to drive Meta’s future revenue by ensuring that products remain relevant and engaging for users.Meta’s 2024 capital expenditures are now projected between $38 billion and $40 billion, a modest increase over initial estimates. This investment is largely directed toward building the necessary infrastructure to support advanced AI initiatives. Executives explained that as Meta continues to scale its AI capabilities, substantial spending is required, particularly in areas such as data centres and computational resources.Meta has been heavily investing in expanding its fleet of GPUs, a critical resource for AI model training and deployment. By increasing its GPU collection, Meta aims to enhance its computational capacity, allowing it to run larger and more complex AI models. This move supports both current and future AI demands across Meta’s ecosystem of applications, from social media platforms to messaging services.AI has brought transformative changes to several areas within Meta’s core business operations. Zuckerberg emphasised the diverse ways AI advancements can support business growth, such as automating content generation, enhancing search functionalities, and refining recommendation algorithms. These applications enable Meta to provide a more seamless user experience, meeting customer needs more efficiently.Meta has also leveraged AI in content moderation, a significant area of investment given the scale of its user base. By automating parts of the moderation process, AI helps Meta swiftly identify and manage inappropriate or harmful content, ensuring a safer platform for users. This also reduces the reliance on human moderators, potentially lowering operating costs in the long run.Meta is committed to developing its proprietary AI models, a move that reflects the company’s desire for independence from third-party AI solutions. The Meta AI and Llama models are two prominent examples of the company’s in-house AI tools. These models have been designed to offer both general-purpose capabilities and specialised functions that can be incorporated into Meta’s consumer products.Meta AI powers various user-facing features, including personalised recommendations, while the Llama model focuses on understanding and processing natural language inputs. The adoption rate of these AI tools has been rapid, with users reportedly benefiting from enhanced performance and personalization across Meta’s platforms. By developing and deploying proprietary AI models, Meta is able to maintain greater control over its technological stack and fine-tune algorithms to meet the specific needs of its user base.The increase in Meta’s AI spending has raised questions among investors and financial analysts. However, industry experts generally agree that these investments are a long-term necessity. Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg noted that despite the high costs associated with AI, Meta’s strong Q3 revenue performance has provided reassurance to investors. According to Enberg, the company’s ability to consistently beat revenue forecasts suggests that AI investments are driving tangible returns.Nonetheless, Enberg cautioned that Meta must demonstrate effective cost management as it continues to scale its AI operations. This involves balancing the high expenses required for AI development with sustained revenue growth to justify ongoing capital expenditures. Ensuring transparency in financial reporting and outlining clear strategies for AI cost management may help to further alleviate investor concerns.Beyond its external-facing applications, Meta is deploying AI to streamline internal processes. CFO Susan Li highlighted how AI is enhancing employee productivity by assisting with tasks such as coding and internal content moderation. For instance, Meta has introduced AI-driven coding agents that help automate routine programming tasks, allowing engineers to focus on more complex and innovative work.Li reported that these internal AI tools are still in the early stages but have already shown promising results in improving employee efficiency. The company’s AI-powered assistance systems are helping to reduce operating costs by optimising workforce productivity. Over time, this approach may result in lower overhead costs, reinforcing the financial viability of Meta’s AI strategy.Looking ahead, Meta is committed to expanding its AI research and development efforts. The company’s strategic objectives include further refining its proprietary AI models, expanding its infrastructure, and exploring new AI applications to enhance user experience and operational efficiency. By maintaining a strong focus on AI, Meta aims to stay competitive in the tech industry, where AI capabilities increasingly define the market leaders.The company is expected to continue refining its AI applications in areas such as virtual and augmented reality, personalised content delivery, and advertising effectiveness. As Meta strengthens its AI infrastructure, it will be better positioned to innovate in these fields, potentially shaping the future of social media and digital interaction.","In the third quarter of 2024, Meta’s revenue climbed to $40.59 billion.

Enhanced exploration and discovery with Gemini

Updates to navigation features

Immersive View expands to more cities

Google Maps has reached a new milestone and is getting three major updates, including the ones powered by its AI model Gemini. According to the company, Maps is now used by over 2 billion people monthly. Google CEO Sundar Pichai shared a post on X sharing the latest information.“Exciting week for @GoogleMaps. Hit the 2B monthly user mark, and now you can ask Maps more complex questions, thanks to Gemini’s creation, reasoning + summarization capabilities, grounded in our knowledge of 250M+ places around the world,” he said in a post on X“By using AI to analyse billions of images, alongside data from local partners and our community, we’re able to make over 100 million updates to the map every single day. So whether you’re travelling the world or across town, you’re seeing the most up-to-date information possible,” Google Maps said.Google has also announced that it is integrating its powerful Gemini AI models into Maps, enabling users to get more personalised recommendations, explore routes in greater detail, and receive answers to complex questions about their surroundings.With Gemini, users can now ask Maps open-ended questions like “things to do with friends at night” and receive curated recommendations tailored to their preferences. The AI can also summarise reviews, providing quick insights into what others like about a place.Additionally, users can ask detailed questions about specific locations, such as whether they offer outdoor seating or have a quiet atmosphere, and receive instant answers. Google says that these capabilities are powered by Gemini's advanced abilities combined with Google's database of over 250 million places and insights from the Maps community.These features start rolling out in the US on Android and iOS this week, and similar experiences are coming in the coming months on Search.Google Maps is also introducing a major update to its navigation features, aimed at making driving easier and more intuitive. Users can now explore points of interest along their route before starting their journey, including landmarks, attractions and dining options.Another feature that aims to enhance navigation is the information about clearer visuals of lanes, crosswalks, and road signs. This will help drivers anticipate upcoming manoeuvres or turns and avoid last-minute lane changes that usually cause jams. The update also includes the ability to see and report weather-related disruptions, such as flooded roads or low visibility conditions.Thirdly, arrival guidance has also been improved, with features like highlighted parking lots, parking reminders and walking directions from the car to the final destination. Users can even access Street View or AR walking navigation to quickly orient themselves upon arrival.These features will start rolling out globally on Android and iOS this week. Enhanced navigation starts rolling out next month on Android and iOS in over 30 metro areas.Immersive View, which provides AI-powered 3D visualisations of places and routes, is expanding to 150 cities globally. New categories of places, such as college campuses, are also being added, offering users a unique way to explore and experience locations virtually.","Google says Maps is now used by over 2 billion people monthly.

Reliance enters in partnership with Nvidia

The 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai saw Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar rubbing shoulders with Jensen Huang , CEO of AI giant Nvidia. While the summit focused on strengthening India's AI capabilities, their encounter ended with a surprising discussion – martial arts.Kumar, a known martial arts enthusiast, shared a photo on social media X, formerly known as Twitter, where he and Huang pose playfully in a fighting stance. The caption reads: ""Imagine meeting the world’s biggest authority on Artificial Intelligence and ending up chatting about martial arts!! What an amazing man you are Mr. #JensenHuang. Now I know why @nvidia is the absolute giant that it is. 😊👍🏻""Nvidia's leather-jacket-clad CEO Huang got a rock star welcome at the company's AI summit in India. As a Bloomberg report said, ""The reception Huang received in India's commercial capital Mumbai was reminiscent of the ""Jensanity"" seen in other parts of the world, especially Taiwan, as his popularity climbs with Nvidia's soaring earnings and multi-trillion dollar market valuation.""Huang praised India's rapid digitalisation and its potential in the AI sector. ""Very few countries have this amazing natural resource called IT and computer science expertise,"" he said.The event, where the U.S. company unveiled plans to supply Reliance Industries and other Indian firms with its AI chips, had to be reportedly delayed for more than half an hour due to the crowd that one Nvidia employee said was ""easily a few thousand"".Nvidia CEO Huang and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a strategic partnership to build state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India at the summit. The collaboration aims to accelerate India's transformation into a global AI powerhouse by leveraging the nation's vast talent pool and burgeoning digital infrastructure. ""We are among the only countries where the average age of 1.4 billion people is below 35,"" he noted. Ambani emphasised that India's aspirations, combined with the visionary leadership of the Indian Prime Minister, have set the stage for a digital revolution. ""We are at the doorstep of the new intelligence age,"" he said.","Jensen Huang, CEO of AI giant Nvidia, met Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar at the 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai.

Satellite services provider, GlobalStar has announced that iPhone maker Apple has promised to invest an additional $1.1 billion in upfront infrastructure prepayments to expand its satellite capabilities. In a filing, (seen by StreetInsider.com) the company also noted that Apple will also acquire a 20% ownership stake in Globalstar for nearly $400 million. This news has sent Globalstar's stock price soaring and suggests that Apple has ambitious plans for its iPhone satellite features. Currently, iPhone users can send text messages over satellite when outside of cellular or Wi-Fi range, a feature introduced with iOS 18 .While Apple currently offers this feature for free, the company has indicated that it may eventually charge users for satellite services. The emergency feature is currently available in the US as well as a few other markets and is excepted to debut soon in India and more countries . This investment in Globalstar's infrastructure underscores Apple's commitment to expanding this feature to other countries as well as enhancing its satellite offerings for iPhone users.This feature allows users to contact emergency services and share their location via satellite when outside of cellular or Wi-Fi range. Initially launched with the iPhone 14 in 2022, the Emergency SOS feature was supposed to become a paid service in late 2024. However, Apple has extended its free satellite connectivity service for iPhones until 2025.While Apple has not yet revealed how much it will charge for satellite services, there is speculation that it may continue to offer Emergency SOS for free while charging for other features, such as location sharing in Find My or recreational texting. Other possibilities include bundling satellite service with Apple One or offering it as a mobile carrier add-on .Despite the uncertainty surrounding the feature’s pricing, users with an iPhone 14 or later can currently try out the satellite feature in demo mode by navigating to Settings -> Emergency SOS -> Emergency SOS via Satellite -> Try Demo.","Satellite services provider, GlobalStar has announced that iPhone maker Apple has promised to invest an additional $1.1 billion in upfront infrastructure prepayments to expand its satellite capabilities.

The feature is designed to automatically capture screenshots of users' PC activities and allow them to search through their computer history using natural language queries.The repeated delays stem from significant privacy and security concerns raised when Microsoft first unveiled Recall in May. The feature initially stored user data in an unencrypted database and activated automatically without user consent .In response to the backlash, Microsoft has implemented several changes. The Verge reports that Recall will now be completely optional, requiring users to explicitly opt in. The company has also added encryption to the screenshot database and mandated Windows Hello authentication for accessing stored data.Users will have the ability to fully uninstall the feature and exclude specific applications, websites, and private browsing sessions from being captured. Microsoft is also implementing anti-malware protections, including rate-limiting measures to prevent abuse.Despite these modifications, questions remain about user interest in the feature when it eventually launches. The multiple delays and initial privacy concerns have dampened enthusiasm for what Microsoft had intended to be a flagship AI capability for its Copilot Plus PCs.Microsoft has committed to launching Recall for Windows Insiders by December, though given the feature's troubled history, further delays remain possible.","Microsoft has pushed back the launch of its Recall feature for Copilot Plus PCs.

Russia has imposed a fine of $20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or $20 decillion on Google for failing to restore banned pro-Kremlin YouTube channels. The fine not only Google's $2 trillion market value but also the entire world's GDP of approximately $110 trillion.The Moscow court's ruling, reported Thursday by Russian state media TASS, stems from Google's refusal to reinstate YouTube accounts of Russian state media outlets and pro-government channels that were blocked following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.""Although it is a specific amount, I cannot even pronounce this number, it is rather filled with symbolism,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, acknowledging the astronomical size of the penalty.The fine originated in 2020 when Google faced initial penalties of 100,000 rubles (approximately $1,000) per day for blocking channels belonging to Russian media outlets Tsargrad and RIA FAN. Under Russian law, these penalties have doubled weekly without any upper limit, resulting in the current sum of 2 undecillion rubles.A total of 17 Russian television channels, including state-run Channel One and military broadcaster Zvezda, have filed legal claims against the tech giant. The channels are seeking enforcement of court decisions made against Google in multiple jurisdictions, including Turkey, Hungary, Spain, and South Africa.Google's parent company Alphabet addressed the situation in its latest quarterly earnings report, stating, ""We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.""The tech giant's Russian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy in 2022 after authorities seized its bank accounts, though Google's free services, including YouTube and Search , continue to operate in the country. The company has restricted the creation of new accounts for Russian users and deactivated AdSense accounts in compliance with Western sanctions.",The fine not only Google's $2 trillion market value but also the entire world's GDP of approximately $110 trillion.

Read CEO’s full email to employees announcing job cuts

Dropbox is laying off 528 employees, representing 20% of its global workforce. CEO Drew Houston , informed the company about the layoffs in an email, attributing the cuts to a need for greater efficiency and a ""flatter"" organisational structure. The reductions are focused on areas deemed “over-invested or underperforming.”This marks the second significant round of layoffs for the cloud storage and collaboration company, following a 16% reduction in staff in April 2023.Hi everyone,I’m writing to let you all know that after careful consideration, we've decided to reduce our global workforce by approximately 20% or 528 Dropboxers.As CEO, I take full responsibility for this decision and the circumstances that led to it, and I’m truly sorry to those impacted by this change.Why we're making this decisionAs we've shared over the last year, we're in a transitional period as a company. Our FSS business has matured, and we've been working to build our next phase of growth with products like Dash. However, navigating this transition while maintaining our current structure and investment levels is no longer sustainable.We continue to see softening demand and macro headwinds in our core business. But external factors are only part of the story. We’ve heard from many of you that our organizational structure has become overly complex, with excess layers of management slowing us down.And while I'm proud of the progress we’ve made in the last couple years, in some parts of the business, we’re still not delivering at the level our customers deserve or performing in line with industry peers. So we're making more significant cuts in areas where we're over-invested or underperforming while designing a flatter, more efficient team structure overall.The opportunity aheadThe changes we're making today, while difficult, come at a pivotal moment when the market is accelerating precisely where we've placed our biggest bets. It's been tremendously rewarding over the last few weeks to see customers and prospects light up when using Dash for Business for the first time, much like people did when we first launched Dropbox.And this time we're starting from a position of strength. Millions of customers trust us as the home for their most important files, making the leap to organizing all their cloud content a natural evolution.But we're not operating on our own schedule. This market is moving fast and investors are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into this space. This both validates the opportunity we've been pursuing and underscores the need for even more urgency, even more aggressive investment, and decisive action.The steps we’re taking today are necessary to both strengthen our core product and accelerate the growth of our new products. We’ll share more about our 2025 strategy in the days ahead.Taking care of impacted employeesTo those leaving Dropbox, we're committed to supporting you through this transition. You’ll be eligible to receive the following benefits and support:Severance, equity, and transition paymentAll impacted employees will be eligible for sixteen weeks of pay, starting today, with one additional week of pay for each completed year of tenure at Dropbox. Internationally, severance packages will vary depending on regional practices and statutory requirements.All impacted employees will receive their Q4 equity vest.Those on the Corporate Bonus plan will be eligible to receive a pro-rated lump sum transition payment equivalent to their 2024 bonus target based on company performance forecasts and aligned with their level.We will pay out eligible remaining current and approved upcoming paid leaves, including medical or family leaves.We will support impacted visa holders by providing additional time to transition and access to 1:1 immigration consultation.Healthcare and benefitsUS employees will be eligible for up to six months of COBRA.Canada-based employees will be eligible for a one-month healthcare extension.All employees will continue to have access to Modern Health to support their mental well-being.DevicesImpacted employees will be eligible to keep company devices (phones, tablets, laptops, and peripherals) for personal use.Job placementJob placement services and career coaching will be available at no cost.Next stepsWe'll be sharing more details on high-level changes later today and will host company-wide Town Halls later this week to answer questions and discuss our plans in more detail.I know this is incredibly difficult and unwelcome news. To everyone leaving Dropbox, I’m deeply grateful for everything you've done for our company and our customers.Drew","CEO Drew Houston informed the company about the layoffs in an email, attributing the cuts to a need for greater efficiency and a ""flatter"" organisational structure.

Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:

Fiscal year 2024 was a pivotal year for Microsoft. We entered our 50th year as a company and the second year of the AI platform shift. With these milestones, I’ve found myself reflecting on how Microsoft has remained a consequential company decade after decade in an industry with no franchise value. And I realize that it’s because—time and time again, when tech paradigms have shifted—we have seized the opportunity to reinvent ourselves to stay relevant to our customers, our partners, and our employees. And that’s what we are doing again today.

Microsoft has been a platform and tools company from the start. We were founded in 1975 with a belief in creating technology that would enable others to create their own. And, nearly 50 years later, this belief remains at the heart of our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

This year, we moved from talking about AI to helping our customers translate it into real outcomes—one person, one organization, one institution, and one country at a time. We have made remarkable progress on this front across every industry. For example:

· Coles is generating 1.6 billion daily AI predictions across 850 Australian stores, ensuring every shopper finds what they need.

· Unilever is performing thousands of simulations with AI in the time it would take to run tens of laboratory experiments, as it accelerates its product development.

· Developers at Itaú, Brazil’s largest private bank, are coding more efficiently using our AI pair programmer, GitHub

Copilot

.

· Khan Academy is making tutoring more accessible for students and helping teachers plan more creative lessons, using our small language model Phi.

· Aquafarmers in Indonesia are improving their yields, thanks to an app built with the Azure OpenAI Service, as well as Azure IoT.

· In Kenya, street vendors now have access to credit for the first time, thanks to M-Kopa, a social enterprise using Azure ML to do its forecasting.

· And enterprise customers and their employees around the world, from Amgen and Disney, to Finastra and Vodafone, are using Microsoft 365 Copilot to become more creative and productive.

Financially, the year was also marked by record performance. We delivered over $245 billion in annual revenue, up 16 percent year-over-year, and over $109 billion in operating income, up 24 percent.

Going forward, we are focused on three priorities: First, prioritizing fundamentals, with security above all else. We launched the Secure Future Initiative (SFI) this year, bringing together every part of our organization to advance cybersecurity protection. Second, driving trustworthy AI innovation across our entire portfolio while continuing to scale our cloud business. And, finally, managing our cost structure dynamically to generate durable, long-term operating leverage. All three priorities are critical to our ability to continue thriving as a company as we raise the bar on our operational excellence, with a focus on continuous improvement across everything we do.

AGE OF AI

If we go back 70 years to the beginning of modern computing, our industry has had two dreams: First, can computers understand us instead of us having to understand computers? And second, as we digitize more of the world—including people, places, and things—can computers help us reason, plan, and act more effectively using all that information? Over the past year, we have had breakthroughs on both fronts.

The core underlying force behind these breakthroughs is scaling laws. Just like Moore’s Law drove the information revolution, the scaling laws of deep neural networks (DNN) and transformers are driving today’s AI revolution. Up until the DNN inflection point, progress in compute was keeping up with Moore’s Law—doubling every two years. But we have now started to see progress in AI performance double roughly every six months.

There are three capabilities coming together because of these scaling laws. First, we have a new natural user interface that is multimodal. It supports speech, images, and videos—both as input and output. We have memory that retains important context, recalling both our personal knowledge and data across devices, apps, and the web. And, finally, we have new reasoning and planning capabilities that help us understand complex context, complete end-to-end tasks on our behalf, and reduce our cognitive load.

This new world is being defined by a rich tapestry of AI agents, which can take action on our behalf, including personal agents across work and life, business process agents, and cross-organizational ones. These agents will be able to work in concert as a new input to help make small businesses more productive, make multinationals more competitive, make the public sector more efficient, and improve health and education outcomes broadly.

Microsoft has built three leading platforms to help our customers maximize their opportunity in this emerging agentic era: Copilot, which you can think of as the new UI for AI—the human interface for this agentic world; the Copilot stack, which brings together infrastructure, data, and app services to help customers build their own copilots and agents for their own business processes; and a new category of Copilot devices that are purpose-built for this new era, including the Copilot+ PCs we introduced this year.

OUR OPPORTUNITY

The innovation we have driven over the past year matters only if we translate it into enduring value for our customers. That’s why, across our tech stack, we are focused on helping people and organizations realize the benefits of AI.

Infrastructure

This year, we expanded our cloud and AI capacity, announcing new investments across five continents. These are long-term assets to drive new growth for the next decade and beyond, and ensure communities around the world have access to the compute they need to drive economic growth in this new era.

Our cloud now also offers top performance for AI training and inference and the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon, Azure Maia, which we introduced last November.

More broadly, we continued to see sustained revenue growth from migrations as customers turn to Azure. Azure Arc is helping customers streamline their transition, as they secure, develop, and operate workloads with Azure services anywhere. We have 36,000 Arc customers, up 90 percent year-over-year. And we remain the hyperscale cloud of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads.

Data & AI

AI models are now key building blocks for every application. And with Azure AI, we are building out the app server for the AI age, providing access to the most diverse selection of models to meet customers’ unique cost, latency, and design considerations. We offer leading frontier models, thanks to our strategic partnership with OpenAI. With Phi-3, which we announced in April, we offer a family of powerful, small language models. And, with Models as a service, we provide API access to third-party models, including the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. In total, we have over 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60 percent year-over-year. This year, we also announced a partnership with G42, which will run its AI applications and services on our cloud, as we collaborate to bring our latest AI technologies to the United Arab Emirates and other countries.

AI does not get created without data. At the data layer, we are fundamentally rethinking what it means to be an analytics database or an operational data store in the world of AI. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, and governance—along with seamless integration with all our AI services. And Microsoft Fabric, our AI-powered, next-generation data platform we made generally available this year, now has over 14,000 paid customers who can go from data, to insights, to action—all within the same unified SaaS solution.

Digital & app innovation

From GitHub to

Visual Studio

, we have the most comprehensive developer tools. GitHub Copilot had a breakout year, as it became standard issue for developers in every industry. We now have more than 1.8 million paid subscribers and over 77,000 enterprise customers, up 180 percent year-over-year. They are realizing productivity gains of up to 55 percent while staying in their flow and bringing the joy back to coding. This year, we also introduced Copilot Workspace, a Copilot-native developer environment, which helps any developer go from idea, to code, to software—all in natural language.

We are also integrating generative AI across Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, automate workflows, or build a website. In total, we now have 48 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up 40 percent year-over-year.

Modern work

Microsoft 365 Copilot is becoming a daily habit for knowledge workers, transforming their work, workflow, and work artifacts. Adoption has been faster than any other new Microsoft 365 suite. And employees at nearly 60 percent of the Fortune 500 now use Copilot to complete tasks faster, hold more effective meetings, and automate business workflows and processes. In fact, internal and external studies show as much as a 70 percent improvement in productivity using generative AI for specific work tasks. And early Microsoft 365 Copilot users were 29 percent faster in a series of general tasks like searching, writing, and summarizing.

And we’re going further, bringing the Web plus Work plus Pages together as the new AI design system for knowledge work. With Pages, which we just announced last month, you can take any information from the web or your work and turn it into a multiplayer, AI-powered canvas. You can ideate with AI and then easily share what you create for collaboration with other people.

And with Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot with agents and build their own agents that proactively respond to data and events from their own first- and third-party business data. To date, 50,000 organizations have used it. And, just this week, we announced new capabilities that will make it possible for customers to build autonomous agents using Copilot Studio.

Microsoft Teams remains essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate, and do business. This year, we rolled out to all customers a new version that is up to two times faster while using 50 percent less memory. And Teams Premium surpassed 3 million seats, up nearly 400 percent year-over-year, as organizations chose it for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and real-time translation.

Business applications

We’re using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications, too. Dynamics 365 once again took share, as organizations use our AI-powered apps to transform their marketing, sales, service, finance, and supply chain functions.

And we are expanding our total addressable market by integrating Copilot into third-party systems as well. Our new Dynamics 365 Contact Center infuses generative AI throughout the contact center workflow in a customer’s existing CRM.

We are also extending Copilot to specific industries, including healthcare. With DAX Copilot, more than 400 healthcare organizations are increasing physician productivity and reducing burnout. On average, clinicians save more than five minutes per patient encounter. And 77 percent say it also improves documentation quality.

Security

As I mentioned earlier, security underpins every layer of our tech stack. We are doubling down on our Secure Future Initiative, as we implement our principles of secure by design, secure by default, and secure operations. And we are focused on making continuous progress across the six pillars of the initiative: protect tenants and isolate production systems; protect identities and secrets; protect networks; protect engineering systems; monitor and detect threats; and accelerate response and remediation. As part of this commitment, all Microsoft employees now have security as a “core priority,” holding each one of us accountable for building secure products and services.

We are continuously applying what we are learning and translating it into security innovation for our customers. A great example is Copilot for Security, which we made generally available this year. It brings together LLMs with domain-specific skills informed by our threat intelligence and 78 trillion daily security signals to provide security teams with actionable insights.

Devices & creativity

This year, we introduced an entirely new category of Windows PCs engineered to unleash the power of distributed AI across the cloud and edge. Copilot+ PCs are the fastest, most AI-ready Windows PCs ever built. They include a new system architecture designed to deliver best-in-class performance and breakthrough AI experiences. And we are working across our entire ecosystem to bring these to life, including with AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, along with our OEM partners.

Professional social network

LinkedIn continues to see accelerated member growth and record engagement. We surpassed 1 billion members for the first time this year, as we combine our unique data with this new generation of AI to transform how people learn, sell, and get hired. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message, to the right audience, on a safe and trusted platform. And when it comes to our subscription businesses, Premium signups increased 51 percent, and we are adding even more value to our members and customers with new AI tools and skilling opportunities.

Search, ads, and news

With Copilot, we’re taking the first steps toward creating an AI companion, one that’s always by your side, helping you feel smarter and more supported through natural conversations. The refreshed Copilot app we introduced earlier this month delivers a more intuitive design with more digestible, speedy, and fluent answers. It now adapts to you with a warm tone and a distinct style, providing not only information but encouragement, feedback, and advice as you navigate life’s everyday challenges—no matter how big or small. And we’re adding advanced capabilities like Voice and Vision that make it both more useful and more natural.

We also continue to apply generative AI to pioneer new approaches to how people search and browse. Microsoft Bing and Edge both took share again this year. And we introduced Copilot Pro, providing access to the latest models for quick answers and higher-quality image creation, and access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers.

Thousands of news and entertainment publishers trust us to reach new audiences with Microsoft Start. And we are also helping advertisers increase their ROI. Copilot in Microsoft Ad Platform helps marketers create campaigns and troubleshoot using natural language.

Gaming

We are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, which closed October 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem. We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1 billion in lifetime revenue—from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love—where, when, and how they want. Finally, we brought four of our fan-favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time, as we continue to extend our content to new platforms.

OUR MISSION

Although we have made outstanding progress over the past year, we cannot take our permission to innovate—let alone operate—for granted. It is something we must earn.

We always say Microsoft will do well only if the world around us does well. And that’s why we are focused on four enduring commitments. They keep us grounded, serving as a guide as we make decisions, pushing us to ask critical questions to ensure the technology we create benefits everyone on the planet, as well as the planet itself.

How can we expand opportunity?

We are democratizing access to AI and the skills needed to harness its potential, ensuring that every person, organization, and community can benefit from the opportunities AI brings.

This year, we partnered with 375,000 nonprofits globally, providing $4.7 billion in donated and discounted technology—to help them build capacity, drive efficiencies, innovate, and increase their impact as they take on the world’s greatest challenges. Together with our partners, we also made significant strides in skilling. We have trained and certified 14.1 million people across 202 countries in digital skills as of June 2024. Over 80 percent of the learners were from groups furthest from opportunity in the digital economy.

And our work doesn’t stop there. We must do more to accelerate the equitable adoption of AI and narrow the digital divide. That’s why we’ve launched new AI skilling initiatives in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry, and civil society—to help millions of people learn to use generative AI, develop AI tools, and lead AI adoption. This includes people from underserved communities, with a focus on young people, women, rural communities, and the Global South, as well as employees of social impact organizations.

How can we earn trust?

We recognize that trust is earned, not given. And we remain committed to earning trust every day, spanning cybersecurity, trustworthy AI, privacy, and digital safety.

Our Secure Future Initiative advances how we design, build, test, and operate our technology to ensure we deliver solutions that meet the highest possible standard of security. Our first SFI Progress Report highlights updates spanning culture, governance, technology, and operations, but we recognize that our work on security is never complete. We must and will do more. Our promise is to continually learn, improve, and adapt to the evolving needs of an increasingly complex security landscape.

We are focused on building AI that is trustworthy, meaning that it is secure, safe, and private. Our responsible AI practices, grounded in our foundational AI principles, help ensure we do this from the beginning. And we’re building on this commitment by introducing new product capabilities across our tech stack, ensuring that both our customers and developers are safeguarded at every level. Ultimately, these commitments and capabilities are key to fulfilling our mission. The world is looking to us to help defend and protect them, and we take that responsibility seriously. In May, we published our first AI Transparency Report, which outlines how we build generative applications responsibly and support our customers. We also released Goals and Governance: Goals and Lessons for AI, which draws lessons from other globally governed technologies like civil aviation and nuclear power. Through our Accelerating Foundation Models Research program, we’ve made grants to hundreds of projects in AI safety and alignment research, AI-driven scientific discovery, and beneficial applications of AI. And we launched our Global Perspectives Responsible AI Fellowship program, designed to center the voices of AI experts from the Global South and enable us to better understand AI’s impact on developing countries. As we drive AI innovation, we continue to respond to a changing privacy landscape. We provide tools to help our customers protect their privacy and control their data, and we have published several resources outlining our approach to privacy and AI for our consumer, commercial, and public sector customers.

Finally, we continue our work to create safe experiences online and protect customers from illegal and harmful content and conduct. To bolster our efforts to prevent child sexual exploitation and abuse risks, we have made new commitments to safety by design in our AI services, joined the Tech Coalition’s Lantern Program, and proposed concrete actions that US policymakers can take to protect the public through regulatory and policy measures.

How can we protect fundamental rights?

We are committed to protecting fundamental rights—extending the benefits of technology while mitigating its potential harms. For us, this means promoting responsible business practices, expanding connectivity and accessibility, protecting democracy, and advancing a fair and inclusive society.

Over the past year, as regulators increasingly required greater transparency and process consistency across corporate supply chains and human rights efforts, we ensured compliance with reporting and due diligence directives. Going forward, we’ll continue to respect global human rights and laws and take steps to mitigate the impact of our operations and our technology on the people in our value chain.

As we build and deploy more AI solutions, connectivity and accessibility are foundational. Since 2017, we’ve extended access to affordable high-speed internet to over 100 million people, including nearly 40 million in Africa. And we remain focused on building inclusive, accessible AI that empowers people across the spectrum of disability.

More than 4 billion people will vote this year in their respective elections, making it the biggest election year in history. At the Munich Security Conference in February, we came together with others across the tech sector and pledged to help prevent deceptive AI content from interfering with global elections. As part of this pledge, we have worked to empower campaigns, candidates, election officials, and voters to understand the risks of deceptive AI in elections and to take steps to protect themselves and democracies. To date, we’ve conducted deepfake trainings in over 20 countries. And our corresponding public awareness campaign has reached over 355 million people.

Lastly, we continued investing in both strategic national partnerships and community-based projects that leverage data and insights to enable changes that advance racial equity and fairness in the criminal legal system.

How can we advance sustainability?

Finally, we are on a journey to build a more sustainable future, from addressing our own environmental footprint to empowering our customers and the world with the technology needed to meet the climate challenge. Over the past year, we have seen how AI can catalyze environmental progress in remarkable ways—from increasing the capacity of transmission lines to deliver renewable power, to the discovery of new materials to support energy production and storage, to empowering the workforce with sustainability skills.

But we also recognize the resource intensity of the infrastructure needed to yield these benefits, which is why we’re advancing the sustainability of AI, from design to construction to operations, all while working to improve the efficiency of these technologies. We’re also investing in innovation through Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund and our AI for Good Lab, advancing research and advocating for policies that can drive global impact.

In our latest Environmental Sustainability Report, we shared progress toward our 2030 commitments. We’re on track in several areas. Where we’re not yet on track, we’re mobilizing to accelerate our progress toward becoming carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste, as well as to protect and preserve ecosystems.

When it comes to our carbon footprint, we continue to support clean electricity infrastructure through long-term investments to bring more power onto the grids where we operate. Since setting our carbon negative target, we have contracted over 34 gigawatts of renewable energy, including projects in 24 countries.

In our efforts to become water positive, we provided more than 1.5 million people with access to clean water and sanitation, achieving our water access target.

Our journey to zero waste includes reducing waste at our campuses and datacenters and advancing circularity for cloud hardware, packaging, and devices. Our most recent report showed we had a reuse and recycle rate of 89.4 percent for servers and components across all cloud hardware.

Finally, AI gives new opportunity for ecosystem and biodiversity management with solutions like AI-assisted bioacoustics. And we’re expanding collaboration with local communities to build and operate datacenters in ways that address local challenges and create greater benefits. This work is guided by our Sustainability Standards for new construction and our Datacenter Community Pledge.

OUR CULTURE

Just as our culture has been critical in getting us to this point, it will be critical to our success going forward. At Microsoft, we think of our culture as being both input and output. To pursue new concepts, we need new capability. To build new capability, we need a culture that allows us to grow that capability long before it is conventional wisdom. For us, that means constantly exercising our growth mindset and confronting our fixed mindset—each one of us, every day. It is the only way we will succeed.

Our growth mindset culture helps us in our continuous pursuit of high performance. It doesn’t matter what we said about our culture 10 years ago or even last year if we aren’t practicing it today—by anticipating the unmet and unarticulated needs of customers; by working together as One Microsoft to deliver the best end-to-end solutions and services; and by actively seeking diversity and embracing inclusion—to ensure our workforce represents the planet we serve and the products we build always meet our customers’ needs. In our latest Diversity & Inclusion Report, we share the ways our longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion endures, and what we’re learning as we continue to hire, develop, and grow a global workforce that best supports each other and our customers. This is how we thrive—as individuals, as teams, and as an organization. And, when we thrive, we can help our customers and the world thrive too.

Giving also remains core to our culture. This year, more than 106,000 employees gave $250 million (including company match) to nearly 35,000 nonprofits in 111 countries. And our employees volunteered over 1 million hours to causes they care about. I am deeply grateful for my colleagues’ dedication to making a difference. Together, we can continue to empower everyone around the world.

**

In closing, this is a consequential time for our company, our industry, and the world. Ultimately, our mission requires that we translate technology into empowerment for everyone, into real-world impact. At the end of the day, that’s what really matters.

Nearly two years later, I can’t stop thinking about the Indian farmer I met in January 2023. He was able to apply for complex government farm subsidies using just his voice, thanks to an app built with GPT 3.5. It was remarkable. A frontier model developed on the West Coast of the US just months earlier was being used to directly improve the lives of rural farmers on the other side of the globe.

That rate of diffusion was unlike anything I had seen in my career. And the pace has only increased. Earlier this year, I was in Thailand, where I met developers using Phi-3 to optimize their operations just days after the small language model was released.

To me, that represents the true democratization of expertise. Where the internet era put information at our fingertips, AI is putting expertise at our fingertips. Impact like this is why we are in this industry, and it is what gives all of us at Microsoft deep meaning in our work.

It is why we are investing in our fundamentals, in our people, and in continued innovation—so that we can help others achieve more for the long term.

It is not an exaggeration to say that what each of us does right now with the unique opportunity we have been given will shape the future. And I look forward to seeing how all of us use Microsoft as a platform to make a difference—one customer, one community, one country at a time.

The biggest problem as per JPMorgan CEO

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has launched a scathing attack on several major US financial regulatory initiatives, vowing to oppose those he deems harmful and ineffective. ""It's time to fight back,"" Dimon said at a conference. Many banks are afraid to ""fight with their regulators, because they would just come and punish you more,"" he added.""I have been told by people at the Fed, know that because of what you have said and what you wrote about, you know they are coming after you.""Dimon, known for his outspoken nature, criticized the complexity and potential negative impact of proposed rules on capital requirements, card payments, and open banking. He expressed concern that these regulations could hinder innovation, increase costs for consumers, and ultimately weaken the financial system .Specifically, Dimon targeted the Basel III endgame proposal, the Federal Reserve's proposed capital surcharge for large banks, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's open banking rule. He argued that these regulations are overly burdensome, inconsistent, and could undermine the stability of the financial system.The JPMorgan CEO also advocated for stricter regulation of card-issuing financial services firms like American Express, Capital One, and Discover Financial Services, arguing that they have an unfair advantage over banks due to relaxed regulations on debit card fees. ""The biggest problem I have with all these overlapping rules is that we are not stepping back and saying, what could we do better to make the system work better,"" he added.Dimon's comments highlight the growing tensions between the banking industry and US regulators. As the industry continues to grapple with evolving regulatory landscapes, it remains to be seen how these disputes will ultimately impact the financial system and consumers.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has launched a scathing attack on several major US financial regulatory initiatives.

What helped Microsoft to increase its gaming revenue



How other divisions of Microsoft contributed



Microsoft has announced its Q1 2025 earnings result. The biggest highlight in the tech giant’s report was a significant increase in gaming revenue , driven by strong growth in Xbox content and services. However, the company noted that its Xbox hardware revenue continues to decline. The latest earnings report shows a 61% year-over-year increase in Xbox content and services revenue which the company largely attributed to the acquisition of Activision Blizzard . Meanwhile, Microsoft also reported a 29% decline in Xbox hardware revenue. The company’s strategy of making its games available on multiple platforms, including PC and cloud gaming , may have contributed to the decline in its hardware sales. Apart from this, Microsoft also reported an increase in AI cloud services, OEM and device revenue.Microsoft's Q1 2025 gaming revenue growth was driven by the introduction of the new Xbox Game Pass ""Standard"" tier, an increase in the price for the Game Pass Ultimate subscription and the addition of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III to the Game Pass library.However, this quarter's figures do not include the impact of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which launched last week. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also claimed it to be the “biggest Call of Duty release ever”.The company's Intelligent Cloud division saw a 20% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching $24.1 billion, fueled by Azure and its AI services .Productivity and Business Processes, which include Office products, also experienced a 12% revenue growth. While overall OEM and Devices revenue increased slightly (2%), this was primarily due to Windows OEM, offsetting a decline in device sales.Microsoft continues to invest heavily in AI, particularly in its Copilot platform, recognising the potential of AI across various industries. The company's AI business is expected to cross a $10 billion annual run rate this quarter.Despite facing challenges like the recent CrowdStrike outage that caused widespread disruptions, Microsoft also remains focused on security and innovation.","Microsoft has announced its Q1 2025 earnings result.

"500 AWS employees write to CEO Matt Garman for reversing work from office policy, read the full letter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/500-aws-employees-write-to-ceo-matt-garman-for-reversing-work-from-office-policy-read-the-full-letter/articleshow/114809434.cms,"Read full letter below:

Mr. Garman,

As employees of AWS and Amazon who work tirelessly every day to obsess over and innovate on behalf of our customers, we were appalled to hear the non-data-driven explanation you gave for Amazon imposing a 5-day in-office mandate at the AWS Global Meeting on October 17th.

Your comments, in part, stated:

I think nine out of ten people are actually quite excited by this change. There's a number of reasons for it ... what makes Amazon special is our ability to debate and our ability to innovate. And when we want to innovate, when we want to really, really innovate on interesting products, I have not seen an ability for us to do that when we're not in-person. There is just no substitute for getting up on a whiteboard and walking through what's going on, having a brainstorm and stopping in the cubicle next to you and asking the person where it is, and grabbing coffee or lunch together and chatting about it, learning what other people are working on and it sparking something in what you're working on — that just doesn't work when you're working remote, it just doesn't happen ... And so we feel, and I feel very strongly that that is just such an important part of the company that getting us back in the office and in an office setting is super important.

Not only are these comments inconsistent with the experiences of many employees, they indicate an outright abdication of AWS' role as one of the world's most innovative companies and a leader in our industry. By making these statements, you are continuing and compounding a trend by Amazon's S-team of misrepresenting the realities of working at Amazon and the impact this mandate will have on the company and, by extension, its customers.

claims to be a data-driven company, and statements which rely on ""we believe"" and ""I feel,"" or exclaim how many people are excited about something to justify themselves fail to achieve our standard of decision making for critical issues that impact hundreds of thousands of the company's employees and its customers. Your statements indicate that either you have not collected enough data to support your position but are moving ahead anyways, or you have seen the data which indicates otherwise and are choosing to ignore it, or you have motivations to support this policy which you are not being forthcoming about with those it impacts. All of these possibilities break the trust of your employees who have not only personal experience that shows the benefits of remote work, but have seen the extensive data which supports that experience.

Data from independent research has shown time and time again that companies which embrace flexible in-office policies allow a more diverse set of workers to sustainably and effectively contribute to the shared goals of businesses like ours. If being inclusive and understanding of employees' personal working styles and circumstances isn't enough to justify why this is the right approach for us to take, research is clear that diverse perspectives lead to more innovation, productivity, and resilience. This diversity in backgrounds, locations, and working styles is essential to AWS' ability to hire and retain exceptional talent and remain a market leader and innovator in the future.

By rigidly mandating a 5-day in-office culture and telling employees who cannot or will not contribute to the company's mission in this specific way that ""there are other companies around,"" you are silencing critical perspectives and damaging our culture and our future in doing so. Moreover, this does not uphold Amazon's espoused ""Strive to be Earth's Best Employer"" leadership principle, especially for select and protected groups who have sought a safer, more inclusive, and healthier work environment and are disproportionately impacted by these policies. These groups include but are not limited to working parents (especially those with young children), employees who are neurodiverse or have disabilities or disorders, workers with caretaking responsibilities, and workers on a visa who have no choice but to comply or risk having to leave their home by quitting.

While your remarks focus on some of the benefits you perceive in in-person collaboration, they fail to even acknowledge the significant challenges it presents to these valued workers who have often overcome adversity at every level in order to contribute to Amazon's mission. In order to highlight these challenges, we have included a selection of anonymous stories from Amazon employees about the impact Amazon's 3-day in-office policy has already had on their life and work with this letter. In addition, studies show that

Return To Office

mandates tend to push out more senior and tenured employees across the board, who may be best poised to participate in and give insight into these white-boarding and brainstorming sessions you refer to, while hurting the morale of those who stay.

You have not addressed these issues nor presented any solution to them while touting the new and even more impactful 5-day policy. We do not accept this from our leaders. We see and value contributions from workers of these groups every day, and will not stand silently by while you dismiss their humanity and trivialize their impact.

Our time working remotely during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic proved that we are effective, creative, and successful without being primarily in-person, and to take no lessons from that experience would be extremely disappointing, because Amazon is and always will be a global company. We will always collaborate with teams and stakeholders in different physical locations, countries, and timezones where the primary, and potentially only, interaction is virtual. We have tools and approaches to do this effectively which are not novel or difficult to use. On the contrary, pushing for more time in-office will harm these countless cross-regional interactions as there will be significantly fewer overlapping working hours between collaborators. This can lead to meetings that might have been done by videoconferencing now taking place via asynchronous mechanisms like email, which slows the velocity of decision-making from minutes to hours or days.

Finally, by taking this action, AWS is not living up to its full potential and is creating a bleak outlook for its future. While it is absolutely true that there are challenges with flexible and remote work, we have always been a company that solves problems in new, exciting, and innovative ways, rather than relying on antiquated approaches that happened to work well some time in the past. The cloud computing industry that we now base our work and livelihoods on might not exist today if we had adhered to that restrictive thinking in our early days.

Given the scale of the problems we tackle across a workforce which is distributed all over the world, we are not content with relying on spontaneous in-office conversations to make progress and drive new ideas. We are instructed to collect, interpret, and act on data and invent new mechanisms to affect the outcomes we want to see, not to sit back and hope good things happen. We worry that when customers see us encounter a true challenge and refuse to solve problems that stand in the way of embracing it, they will rightly lose trust in AWS' ability to innovate.

For these reasons we urge you to reconsider your comments and your position on the proposed 5-day in-office mandate. Remote and flexible work is an opportunity for Amazon to take the lead, not a threat. We want to work for a company and for leaders that

recognize and seize this moment to challenge us to reinvent how we work.

Respectfully signed by 523 Amazonians, 172 of whom have elected to include their name below.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Matt Garman is facing a growing internal backlash over the company’s strict return-to-office policy, a report has said. Over 500 Amazon and AWS employees have reportedly signed an open letter criticising Garman's remarks towards those who oppose the mandate, which requires employees to work from the office five days a week.Recently, Garman asserted that most employees support the policy and are willing to come to office. However, the letter by employees argues that his comments “silence critical perspectives” and harm the company's future. Employees also dispute his claim that in-person work is essential for innovation, citing their own experiences as evidence to the contrary.Not only Garman, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has also defended the mandate as a way to strengthen company culture and collaboration, many employees feel it undermines flexibility and trust.","Employees of Amazon sent a letter to the company's S-team about the 5-day in- office mandate.

The fine’s structure



Google’s response and Russia’s asset seizure

Legal basis and implications

Also read

In an unprecedented legal action, a Moscow court has imposed a staggering $20 decillion fine on Google , amounting to a sum far beyond the world's GDP, as reported by The Telegraph. This astronomical figure comes as a result of Google’s decision to block certain Russian state-linked channels on its platforms, including YouTube, beginning with Tsargrad TV four years ago. The decision to enforce such a substantial fine on the American tech giant is not only exceptional but has also sparked widespread attention in both legal and financial circles globally.The legal conflict began four years ago when Google blocked access to Tsargrad TV, a Russian channel known for its strong pro-government stance. Over the years, additional Russian state-linked media channels faced similar treatment on Google-owned platforms, resulting in Moscow’s legal measures against the company. Google’s block on these channels came amid rising tensions between Russia and Western countries, particularly in regard to censorship and propaganda concerns.Google’s decision to block Russian state-owned media content on YouTube was not isolated to Tsargrad TV but extended to other channels seen as spreading government-driven narratives. This move led to Russia’s invocation of Article 13.41 of the Administrative Offences Code, which states that the unauthorised restriction of access to legally permitted content can warrant fines and other penalties.The Moscow court ordered Google to pay an initial penalty of 100,000 roubles per day (approximately $1,200). However, a unique condition was attached to this daily fine: it would double every 24 hours that Google failed to comply. As Google continued to refrain from payment or restoration of the blocked channels, the fine quickly escalated to figures that surpassed any precedent in financial penalties.As of the latest reports, the total fine has reached an extraordinary 2 undecillion roubles, or roughly $20 decillion—a number so large it outstrips the global GDP by trillions. It is important to note that a figure of this magnitude is nearly impossible to achieve in reality, underscoring the symbolic nature of the penalty.In response to these legal proceedings, Google opted to cease operations in Russia after the country’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, leading the tech company to close down its Russian subsidiary. Google declared bankruptcy in Russia, citing the unmanageable legal and financial demands as well as an unsupportive regulatory environment. Consequently, Russian authorities seized approximately $100 million in assets from Google Russia, which reports suggest were redirected to support Russia’s military efforts.In its recent earnings statement, Google maintained that it does not foresee any significant financial repercussions from this ongoing legal matter. Given Google’s global reach and assets, the company appears confident in its ability to withstand such claims.The $20 decillion fine levied on Google has raised questions about enforceability and the basis for its calculation. Russian courts justified the fine under Article 13.41, asserting that Google violated content regulations. However, the exponential growth model employed to calculate the penalty has led to a nearly unattainable sum.This fine also highlights the potential for escalating legal actions between major technology firms and countries that may disagree with content restrictions imposed by these companies. As tech companies like Google become increasingly influential in information dissemination, more governments may seek legal action to challenge policies they view as restrictive or censoring of their narratives.The sheer scale of this fine demonstrates the complex relationships between technology companies and international governments, especially where content regulation is concerned. It is unlikely that this particular fine will have a direct financial impact on Google due to its infeasibility. However, it illustrates a broader trend of countries implementing stringent measures to hold tech companies accountable to local laws and policies.For companies like Google, operating in countries with contrasting policies on content moderation presents unique challenges. These events could prompt other governments to impose their own regulatory requirements, potentially impacting content accessibility and corporate operations globally.","A Moscow court has imposed a staggering $20 decillion fine on Google, amounting to a sum far beyond the world's GDP.

In an unexpected turn of events, a Delhi-based app developer, who initially bought the JioHotstar domain with hopes of selling it to Reliance Industries, has now sold it to two children in Dubai. The developer, remaining anonymous but describing himself as “a dreamer,” originally sought over one crore rupees from Reliance for the domain, intending to use the funds for an executive MBA at Cambridge University.However, after Reliance declined to engage in negotiations, the domain has found a surprising new home with 13-year-old Jainam Jain and 10-year-old Jivika Jain , who have pledged to support the young developer's mission and keep the domain open for future endeavours. Here are the events leading up to the sale, the motivations of all parties involved, and the current status of the JioHotstar domain.In 2023, rumours surfaced about a potential merger between Jio Cinema and Hotstar. Seeing a business opportunity, the Delhi-based developer purchased the JioHotstar domain, anticipating that this merger would make the domain highly valuable. Once the merger went through, he reached out to Reliance Industries with an offer to sell the domain for a little over one crore rupees.The developer’s goal was to fund his executive MBA program in the United Kingdom, specifically at the University of Cambridge. Despite his ambitions, Reliance Industries dismissed the offer without entering negotiations. Instead, the company reportedly issued warnings, as seen in previous legal actions they’ve taken against those acquiring domains related to Jio or Reliance.After negotiations with Reliance failed, the developer turned to a new set of potential buyers. In a surprising move, the JioHotstar domain was ultimately sold to Jainam and Jivika Jain, two young siblings from Dubai, aged 13 and 10. The children, who recently visited India, were inspired by a “Seva journey” they took as part of a holiday experience. During their visit, they engaged in various charitable activities, including teaching local children and collecting donations.The funds collected from their efforts were put toward the acquisition of the JioHotstar domain, which they have expressed a desire to maintain for future charitable and inspirational purposes. In a statement uploaded to the JioHotstar site, the children shared their intention to use the platform to “support a young software developer from Delhi” and to encourage others to contribute positively.In a heartfelt letter published on the domain’s website, Jainam and Jivika recounted their experiences in India and explained their motivation for purchasing the site. They described their journey, which included volunteer work and collecting donations, as part of an ongoing mission to make a difference in the lives of others. By acquiring the domain, they hope to keep the site open as a platform for “inspiring others” and mentioned that they are open to future sales to any individual or organisation that wishes to continue this mission.This message has been met with widespread attention online, with many expressing support for the children’s altruistic intentions.

I hate know-it-alls.""Instead of relying on these general-purpose models, Fadell advocated for specialized AI agents that are trained on specific tasks and are more transparent about their limitations.

As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to approach these technologies with caution and a critical eye.","Tony Fadell, known for his work on Apple iPod and Nest Labs, expressed skepticism about the current state of large language models (LLMs) and their potential for harm.

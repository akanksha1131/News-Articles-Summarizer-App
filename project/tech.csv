Microsoft's new AI model can create video game gameplay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-new-ai-model-can-create-video-game-gameplay/articleshow/118404561.cms,"Microsoft Research and Xbox game studio Ninja Theory have developed a new artificial intelligence model called Muse that can generate gameplay visuals and predict controller inputs, marking what the company calls a breakthrough in AI for gaming.The model, trained on over one billion images and controller actions from the 2020 game Bleeding Edge, demonstrates an understanding of 3D game worlds and physics while responding to player interactions. Microsoft describes Muse as the first of a new category called World and Human Action Models (WHAM).However, the current prototype has significant limitations, only capable of generating low-resolution gameplay at 300x180 pixels. A real-time demonstration ran at just 10 frames per second, according to Microsoft researchers.Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer suggested the technology could aid in game preservation , potentially allowing classic games to run on modern hardware without requiring the original engine. The company also sees applications in game prototyping and development workflows.Amid industry concerns about AI replacing human developers, particularly following widespread gaming industry layoffs in 2024, Ninja Theory studio head Dom Matthews emphasized that Muse isn't intended for content creation. ""The interesting aspect for us is how can we use technology like this to make the process of making games quicker and easier for our talented team,"" Matthews said.Microsoft plans to make some interactive AI gaming experiences available through Copilot Labs, though no specific timeline was given. The company stated that individual Xbox studios will have autonomy in deciding how to implement generative AI technologies in their projects.","Microsoft Research and Xbox game studio Ninja Theory have developed a new artificial intelligence model called Muse.

Nikhil Kamath’s post ignite discussions

Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath recently ignited discussions on changing food consumption habits after sharing insights from his trip to Singapore. Taking to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Kamath observed that home cooking is nearly absent in Singapore, with many residents either not having kitchens or rarely using them. In the post, Kamath speculated that if India were to shift towards a more dining-out culture, the restaurant industry could see unprecedented growth. However, he noted a key challenge—India currently lacks large-scale restaurant brands comparable to those in Southeast Asia.“I was in Singapore this week; most I met said they never cook at home, and others don't have a kitchen,” he wrote in the post. “If India were to follow this trend, investing in or opening restaurants would be a massive opportunity, but we don’t have restaurant brands that have close to the scale Southeast Asian chains do,” Kamath remarked.He also pointed out that India’s food service sector remains underdeveloped, with only 30% of the market being organized, compared to 55% in the United States.Citing data from Swiggy and Bain & Company, Kamath highlighted India’s significantly lower consumption of non-home-cooked meals in comparison to other nations. According to data from 2023, the average number of such meals per person is 33 in China, 27 in the United States, 19 in Singapore, 14 in South Korea, and just 5 in India.Kamath’s post stirred an online debate, with users reacting in various ways. One user commented “Every culture is different. Indians love eating meals cooked by themselves, their mom, spouses etc. Moreover Home cooked food is best food your health and mind. Changing this whole and outsourcing it, will definitely boom two industries at scale - restaurants and hospitals”. Another said “Ghar ka khana (home food) is an integral part of Indian culture, and I don’t think that will change anytime soon.”While a third user wrote “The convenience of restaurant dining and food delivery will definitely grow, but home-cooked meals will always be a part of Indian life”. “Wouldn’t a lot of it have to do with price sensitivity & ease of access as well? Indians have a higher probability of ordering in through digital platforms (as compared to eating out / takeaway) but if platforms charge higher rates, they’d rather prefer home cooked food,” said a fourth.","Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath recently ignited discussions on changing food consumption habits.

The U.S. trade deficit refers to the gap between the value of goods and services the country imports versus what it exports.

As of 2025, the U.S. is running a USD 2 trillion annual trade deficit, meaning it imports significantly more than it exports.

Musk compared the country’s financial situation to that of an individual, stating that just as people can go bankrupt from excessive debt, so can a country.

Elon Musk’s criticism of bureaucratic resistance to Government reforms

He claimed that unelected officials have too much influence over policymaking, making it difficult for the president to execute reforms.

Musk cited Washington, D.C.’s political leanings, noting that 92% of voters in the district supported former Vice President Kamala Harris.

He stated that this level of political opposition makes it challenging for any administration to push through reforms aimed at reducing government spending.

Billionaire entrepreneur and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has voiced his concerns over the U.S. trade deficit and government spending, warning that America is at risk of bankruptcy if spending is not brought under control.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump , who also participated in the interview, agreed with Musk’s concerns and highlighted excessive spending by the previous administration. Trump blamed waste, fraud, and abuse in government programs, arguing that funds were mismanaged on initiatives such as the Green New Deal, which he referred to as the ""greatest scam in U.S. history.""Musk also addressed criticisms surrounding cuts in government programs related to DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), stating that an unelected bureaucracy is obstructing reforms. He argued that restoring democracy means ensuring that the president’s decisions are implemented without bureaucratic interference.Musk’s primary concern during the interview was the United States’ growing trade deficit, which he described as a major financial risk.

He argued that the bureaucratic system is resistant to change, preventing necessary financial reforms from taking place.Musk further warned that if presidential policies are not implemented effectively, it means that democracy is being undermined by bureaucratic control.During the discussion, Donald Trump praised Elon Musk, describing him as an ""amazing and caring person"" who is working to expose fraud, waste, and inefficiency in government spending.

Instagram has rolled out a series of new features for its direct messages (DMs), making its messaging system more competitive with other popular apps like Apple's iMessage. These upgrades aim to enhance user experience by introducing tools for music-sharing, message scheduling, translation, and more.One of the most anticipated additions is the music-sharing feature, which allows users to share 30-second previews of songs from Instagram's music library directly within their DMs. This feature is expected to appeal particularly to younger users who often discover new music through social apps like Instagram and TikTok. To use this feature, users can tap on the sticker button in the chat composer screen, select ""Music,"" and then search for and share their chosen song.Instagram has also introduced a message scheduling feature, enabling users to schedule messages up to 29 days in advance. This feature is similar to Apple's ""Send Later"" option in iMessage and can be accessed by long-pressing the ""send"" button and selecting the desired date and time for the message to be sent.The new translation tool allows users to translate messages sent or received in another language, supporting 99 different languages at launch. This feature can be accessed by hard-pressing on the message to be translated and selecting the ""translate"" option.Users can now pin up to three messages, images, memes, or reels to the top of their chat by holding down on the message and tapping ""Pin."" This feature is useful for keeping important information within easy reach or for fun purposes. To unpin a message, users can simply tap on the pinned message and select ""Unpin”.Another addition is the ability to invite friends to a group chat by sending them a QR code. Users can generate a QR code from the invite link in a chat and share it live, through the built-in share sheet, or save it as an image for later use.These new features are initially available to both iOS and Android users, with web access expected to arrive later.","Instagram has rolled out a series of new features for its direct messages (DMs) These upgrades aim to enhance user experience by introducing tools for music- sharing, message scheduling, translation, and more.

Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath want you to know this about SEBI’s new circular on API usage and algorithmic trading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamath-want-you-to-know-this-about-sebis-new-circular-on-api-usage-and-algorithmic-trading/articleshow/118020989.cms,"Take a look at the post here



“The SEBI circular on

API usage

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

SEBI's latest ALGO trading rules | The Daily Brief #163

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities. Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd is a well-known stock market training institute that offers online courses on stocks and trading. Some of the popular courses offered by the self-proclaimed ""options queen"" and ""She Wolf of Stock Market"" are ""Let's Make India Trade"" (LMIT), ""Master's in Price Action Trading"" (MPAT), and ""Options Multiplier"" (OM) .Jayesh Thakkar, a SEBI Registered Research Analyst shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating “SEBI has seized Rs 53.67 crore that Asmita Patel and five other related entities made illegally. Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

The Kyoto-based company that manufactures multilayer ceramic capacitors has announced that its Indian subsidiary has agreed to lease a 3,500 square-metre factory within an industrial park in OneHub Chennai Industrial Park , Tamil Nadu. The company also noted that the handover of the same will take place in February 2025. Through this venture, Murata will gain experience in factory operations in India and prepare for upcoming manufacturing activities in the country, the company added. Murata also confirmed that this facility will be used for the packaging and shipping of multilayer ceramic capacitors and is aiming for its full-scale operation in FY 2026.In a statement to Bloomberg, Murata president Norio Nakajima said that the company is assessing rising demand in India and evaluating the requirements to accelerate its investment efforts in the country.Nakajima added.Murata’s components are important in nearly all electronics, including smartphones from Apple and Samsung as well as Nvidia’s servers, Sony’s gaming consoles, and even a NASA helicopter on Mars.Currently, about 60% of its multilayer ceramic capacitors are produced in Japan, but that share is expected to decline to around 50% in the coming years, Nakajima further noted.As the world’s leading capacitor supplier, Murata plays a crucial role in storing and releasing electric charges in electronic devices.This move comes after Apple has been actively expanding production beyond China, The company recently started trial production of its AirPods in India.Additionally, several Chinese manufacturers of mid-range smartphones are expected to set up factories in India, attracted by the country’s large workforce and growing consumer market.","iPhone component supplier, Murata Manufacturing Co. is planning to relocate some of its production to India.

Musk says, “I love the President”

Elon Musk has disclosed ‘new’ details about his decision to endorse Donald Trump, catching even the US President himself by surprise. This comes soon after the Tesla CEO declared love for Trump via a post on X this week.In a revealing Fox News interview, the tech mogul said that while a July assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania hastened his announcement, his support for Trump had been predetermined.""I was going to do it anyway but that [Trump assassination attempt] was a precipitating event, yeah,"" Musk stated, prompting visible surprise from the President who asked, “That speeded it up a little bit?”When Musk told him, ‘yes’, Trump said, “Nice. I didn’t know that.”The Tesla and SpaceX CEO's endorsement, which came immediately following the shooting incident at Trump's Pennsylvania rally, has been widely viewed as a pivotal moment in Trump's campaign.Democratic Senator John Fetterman acknowledged the significance of Musk's support in an October interview with the New York Times, noting that Musk's active participation in campaign rallies could sway crucial voter demographics.“Not even just that he has endorsed [Trump], but the fact that now he's becoming an active participant and showing up and doing rallies and things like that,” Fetterman explained.Musk has, on multiple occasions, declared his love for the president. In of the posts on X this month, the Tesla CEO said, “I love @realDonaldTrump as much as a straight man can love another man.”In the interview, Musk said, “Well, I love the president. I just want to be clear about that.”“I think President Trump is a good man. Because, I mean, the president has been so — so unfairly attacked in the media. It’s truly outrageous.

The 'big why' of Gold reserves worth $425 billion that Elon Musk is looking for at 'military installation' in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-big-why-of-the-gold-reserves-worth-425-billion-that-elon-musk-is-looking-for-at-military-installation-in-the-us/articleshow/118366896.cms,"Elon Musk has raised questions about the authenticity of the gold reserves at Fort Knox, sparking a discussion about a potential audit. He responded to conspiracy theories and suggested a live video walkthrough of the facility, emphasizing public ownership of the gold.

He said this in response to some conspiracy theorists who reportedly implied that Gold is not there. Incidentally, conspiracy theories about the missing Gold in the US are said to be not new.

How Elon Musk's Gold chase started



Gold and 'no-entry' board at Fort Knox



Elon Musk may be planning to get an audit done of Gold reserves in the US. Wondering why? The buzz seems to have started last week. In a series of posts on Twitter/X over the weekend, Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk raised questions about whether the gold reserves at Fort Knox are truly there.They have been said to be the topic of books and podcasts for years. As to the value of the Gold, it is said to be worth $425 billion.As to those unaware what Fort Knox is? Fort Knox is the most famous repository for Gold in the US. Other than Fort Know, vast quantities of Gold are also reported to be held at mints in West Point, Denver and at the Federal Reserve vault in New York.According to reports, the Gold audit chatter/demand started after Elon Musk replied to a post from Alex Jones about Fort Knox’s “missing gold” by saying, “It would be cool to do a live video walkthrough of Fort Knox!”This kind of started the Gold frenzy. ""As a U.S. senator I’ve tried repeatedly to get into Fort Knox Fort Knox: “You can’t come to Fort Knox.” Me: “Why?” Fort Knox: “It’s a military installation.” Me: “I’m a senator; I go to military bases all the time.” Fort Knox: “You still can’t come. Because, you can’t,” wrote US senator Mike Lee.“Who is confirming that gold wasn’t stolen from Fort Knox?” he wrote. “Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not. That gold is owned by the American public! We want to know if it’s still there,” wrote Elon Musk, quoting Lee's post.In a separate post, Elon Musk wrote, “Looking for the gold at Fort Knox ,” followed by a popular South Park meme featuring a character saying, “Annnnd it’s gone.” ""“It would be cool to do a live video walkthrough of Fort Knox!”, Elon Musk wrote in another post.""It would be cool for the public to see what so much gold looks like. It is theirs, after all! Hopefully, the storage facility has above zero style,"" he wrote in another post.According to Fort Knox website, Gold shipments to Fort Knox began in 1937. The highest recorded amount stored at the Kentucky Army installation was reportedly 649.6 million ounces. Currently, Fort Knox holds over 147 million troy ounces of Gold, more than any other location in the US, based on Treasury Department data. The facility is reported to follow a strict no-visitors policy. Beyond Gold, the Kentucky-based depository is said to house other valuable assets belonging to the U.S. government. It remains closed to the public and has rarely been accessible.During World War II, Fort Knox safeguarded important American documents, including the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution, which were returned to Washington, D.C., after the war.","Elon Musk has raised questions about the authenticity of the gold reserves at Fort Knox, sparking a discussion about a potential audit.

"Google pays Rs 3,000 crore to avoid criminal investigation in Italy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-pays-rs-3000-crore-to-avoid-criminal-investigation-in-italy/articleshow/118389701.cms,"What Italian prosecutors said about Google’s case



Google has agreed to pay €326 million (nearly Rs 3,000 crore) to Italian authorities. With this payment, the tech giant has settled an investigation into alleged unpaid tax claims against the company’s European division. Italian prosecutors, who announced the settlement, have now receommneded that criminal proceedings against Google Ireland Limited be dropped. The investigation focused on Google's alleged failure to declare and pay taxes on income generated in Italy between 2015 and 2019, primarily from advertising sales.In a statement to the news agency AP, Italian prosecutors said that under the greement reached with Google, ""the company proceeded to payment of... 326 million euros in taxes, fines and interest, to resolve the outstanding matter with the Italian tax authorities.”Morever, the prosecutors also confirmed that they have filed a request with a judge to dismiss the criminal case.This comes after Italy asked Google to pay 1 billion euros in unpaid taxes and penalties, seven years after the company settled a major tax dispute with the country’s authorities. In 2017, Google settled a previous case by paying 306 million euros after it was determined to have a permanent presence in Italy.EU’s effort to make US tech companies to pay more taxesThe EU has struggled to make tech companies pay higher taxes in Europe, as many are accused of shifting profits to low-tax countries like Ireland and Luxembourg.One of the most high-profile cases came in 2016 when the European Commission ordered Apple to pay Ireland 13 billion euros in back taxes, ruling that its tax deal with the government was illegal.However, EU judges later overturned the decision, citing a lack of evidence that Apple had violated the rules—a ruling the commission has been trying to challenge ever since.Similarly, the commission is also attempting to reverse another court defeat after judges nullified its order for Amazon to repay 250 million euros in back taxes to Luxembourg.","Google has agreed to pay €326 million (nearly Rs 3,000 crore) to Italian authorities.

Uber is changing its “Auto” model: What this means for users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uber-is-changing-its-auto-model-what-this-means-for-users/articleshow/118388812.cms,"What is changing and what it means for users

Uber has announced a significant shift in its auto rickshaw service, moving to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, essentially changing how riders book and pay for auto rides. The change is now reflecting in the app.Under the new system, Uber connects riders with nearby drivers, but the service operates independently of Uber's core platform. Riders will now pay drivers directly in cash or via UPI.Notably, digital payment methods integrated into the Uber app, including Uber credits and promotions, will no longer be accepted for auto trips. Riders are advised to disable Uber credits before booking an auto.Furthermore, Uber will not charge drivers a commission for auto trips, and the company will not levy cancellation charges. While Uber suggests a fare, the final amount is determined through an agreement between the rider and driver.This means that Uber will not be involved in fare disputes, advising riders to resolve such issues directly with the driver. However, Uber emphasises its commitment to safety and encourages riders to report any safety concerns through the app.Additionally, it should be noted that since Uber only suggests a fare, the company will not offer credits or refunds for auto trips, including those related to fare disputes. No GST will be applied to auto trips, and Uber will not provide tax invoices.Riders can use the fare suggestion receipt from Uber for reimbursement purposes if necessary.If riders encounter errors while booking, they are advised to select cash as the payment method and ensure that “Uber balances” are turned off. This new model aims to give 100% of the fare directly to the drivers.","Uber is moving to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. Riders will now pay drivers directly in cash or via UPI.

US President Donald Trump proposes tariffs that may change the shape of the chip industry forever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-president-donald-trump-proposes-tariffs-that-may-change-the-shape-of-the-chip-industry-forever/articleshow/118385814.cms,"US President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose tariffs of ""25% or higher"" on imported semiconductor chips , just weeks after returning to office. Speaking at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump said that the semiconductor tariffs would increase ""substantially"" over the course of a year, part of a broader strategy to pressure foreign manufacturers to relocate production to the United States . The move could dramatically reshape the global chip industry , which is critical to products ranging from smartphones to automobiles.""When they come into the United States, and they have their plant or factory here, there is no tariff,"" Trump explained, indicating the escalating duties are designed to incentivize domestic semiconductor manufacturing.The semiconductor tariff announcement came alongside similar threats of 25% duties on imported automobiles and pharmaceuticals. Trump said he would provide chip and drug makers time to establish US factories to avoid the tariffs, though he did not specify a timeline for implementing the semiconductor duties.The announcement follows a series of aggressive trade measures by the Trump administration since taking office last month, including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and planned 25% duties on steel and aluminum imports set to take effect March 12.Economists warn the mounting tariffs could drive up costs for US consumers and businesses, as import duties are typically paid by American importers rather than foreign exporters. The semiconductor industry is particularly vulnerable to trade disruptions given its complex global supply chains and heavy reliance on international manufacturing.Trump said he expects ""some of the biggest companies in the world"" to announce new US investments in coming weeks, though he provided no specific details.","US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs of ""25% or higher"" on imported semiconductor chips.

What do all successful brands have in common?

They all have an enemy.

That enemy is not always a competitor but a system, a mindset, or a problem.

fought cable TV.

fought self-doubt.

fought traditional hospitality.

and at

we fought toxic skincare products.

How you define your enemy is what differentiates a good brand from a great one.

So, if you’re building a brand who are you fighting against?

In a recent post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Ghazal Alagh , co-founder of Mamaearth and former Shark Tank India judge, shared an intriguing insight into what sets successful brands apart. According to Alagh, every thriving brand has a ""common enemy""—a system, mindset, or issue that it actively works to challenge and redefine.Alagh explained that this enemy is not necessarily a rival company but can be a deeply ingrained problem that the brand seeks to address. She provided examples from globally recognized brands to illustrate her point. Netflix, for instance, positioned itself against cable television, offering on-demand content that disrupted traditional viewing habits. Nike's ""Just Do It"" campaign battled self-doubt, encouraging people to push their limits. Airbnb took on conventional hospitality by offering unique lodging experiences beyond traditional hotels.For Mamaearth, the enemy was toxic skincare products . Alagh and her husband, Varun Alagh, founded Mamaearth in 2016 with the mission to provide safe, toxin-free skincare in an industry dominated by chemical-laden products. By positioning itself as an advocate for natural ingredients, Mamaearth cultivated a loyal customer base that values transparency and sustainability.In her post, Alagh emphasized that defining an enemy helps brands stand out and build strong identities. ""How you define your enemy is what differentiates a good brand from a great one. So, if you’re building a brand, who are you fighting against?"" she wrote, prompting her followers to reflect on their brand strategies.","Ghazal Alagh, co-founder of Mamaearth and former Shark Tank India judge, shared an insight into what sets successful brands apart.

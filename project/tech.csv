The European Union (EU) has issued a ""high-risk"" warning for customers of the Chinese online shopping platform Temu , a report claims. The European Commission, the EU's regulatory watchdog, has reportedly accused the company of breaching the bloc's digital rules by not doing enough to prevent the sale of illegal products. In recently released preliminary findings, the Commission stated its investigation revealed a ""high risk"" of EU consumers encountering illegal products on Temu’s site. A ""mystery shopping"" exercise also found products on the marketplace, including baby toys and small electronics, that violated EU regulations.This started last year when EU opened an investigation into Temu under its Digital Services Act . It had requested that Temu provide details on its efforts to curb the sale of illegal items, as well as risks concerning consumer protection , public health, and user well-being. This action is part of a broader crackdown by the EU on imports from China, placing greater pressure on online platforms to more aggressively monitor their sites.According to a report by The Financial Times, the commission noted that Temu's risk assessment concerning the sale of illegal products on its platform wasIt stated that the evaluation relied on broad industry data rather than specific insights from Temu’s marketplace. As a result, the commission said this approach may have led to “inadequate mitigation measures” to prevent the distribution of illegal products.a commission official said to the FT.The findings come as the EU moves to hold e-commerce platforms accountable for dangerous or illegal products sold online. In June, the commission accused AliExpress , a competing Chinese online shopping platform, of failing to adequately prevent the spread of counterfeit or unsafe goods.Earlier this year, it also launched an investigation into Shein over concerns related to consumer protection.In another news affecting Chinese retailers, the EU plans to introduce a flat €2 fee on billions of small packages entering the bloc, which is expected to impact both Temu and Shein.Temu has several weeks to respond to the preliminary findings of the probe and could face a penalty of up to 6% of its global annual revenue if found in violation of the rules.The commission is also examining Temu’s potential use ofthe process by which product recommendations are made on the platform, and its data access practices as part of a broader inquiry.Replying to this, Temu said that it would","The EU has issued a ""high-risk"" warning for customers of the Chinese online shopping platform Temu, a report claims.

Americans will own technology, have power: Lutnick



Boat Aavante Prime 5.1 5000DA soundbar review: DOLBY ATMOS POWER!

Howard Lutnick, secretary of commerce, has said that President Donald Trump likes TikTok but the Chinese-owned short video app has to move to US ownership. His latest comments came soon after he said that TikTok will go dark for Americans unless China agrees to give the US more control over the video app, used by some 170 million Americans.“The President really likes TikTok, and he said it over and over again, because, you know, it was a good way to communicate with young people,” Lutnick said in an interview on Fox News on Sunday (July 27).“But let's face it, you can't have the Chinese have an app on 100 million American phones, that is just not okay. So, it's got to move to American ownership, it's got to move to American technology, American algorithms,” he said, adding, “I know the President is positive towards TikTok, if it can move into American hands.”Last week, Lutnick sent a warning to TikTok’s Chinese owners over the app’s future in America.“We’ve made the decision. You can’t have Chinese control and have something on 100 million American phones,” Lutnick told CNBC.“Basically, Americans will have control. Americans will own the technology. Americans will control the algorithm. That’s something Donald Trump is willing to do,” he elaborated, adding that if China does not approve such a deal, “then TikTok is going to go dark.”TikTok’s fate in the US has been uncertain since 2024, when Congress passed legislation mandating that its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, divest from the platform or face a ban. The deadline for striking a deal with an American entity has been postponed multiple times.Last month, Trump extended the divestiture deadline for a third time since taking office, pushing the new cutoff to September 17.Trump previously stated in an interview that he has a group of “very wealthy people” prepared to acquire the platform. A recent Reuters report indicated that private equity firm Blackstone withdrew from a consortium bid for TikTok’s US operations.","US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that President Donald Trump likes TikTok, but the Chinese-owned short video app has to move to US ownership.

"Strategic Misstep: 20 national security experts write letter to Donald Trump administration, want America to STOP sale of these Nvidia chips to China",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/strategic-misstep-20-national-security-experts-write-letter-to-donald-trump-administration-want-america-to-stop-sale-of-these-nvidia-chips-to-china/articleshow/122958262.cms,"What the national security experts' letter says

""The H20 is a potent accelerator of China’s frontier AI capabilities, not an outdated AI chip. Designed specifically to work around export control thresholds, the H20 is optimized for inference, the process responsible for the dramatic capabilities gains made by the latest generation of frontier AI reasoning models. For inference tasks, the H20 outperforms even the H100, an AI chip this administration has restricted access to due to its advanced capabilities.""

""Both U.S. and Chinese AI labs are betting that further investment in inference compute will be critical to the next leap in frontier AI capabilities. On the heels of DeepSeek’s breakthrough model release earlier this year, Chinese AI labs began bulk-ordering H20 chips to develop even more advanced AI models. If the U.S. backs off of export controls to China, we believe that China’s next generation of frontier AI will be built on the backs of the H20,"" the letter added.

""While the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s H20 chip are nominally civilian companies in China, we fully expect the H20 and the AI models it supports to be deployed by China’s People's Liberation Army.""

""The decision to ban H20 exports earlier this year was the right one. We ask you to stand by that principle and continue blocking the sale of advanced AI chips to China as America works to maintain its technological edge. This is not a question of trade. It is a question of national security,"" concludes the letter.

Letter's signatories

Certain section of security experts seem quite upset with the Donald Trump administration's decision to allow sale of Nvidia H20 advanced AI chips to China again. A group of 20 national security experts and former government officials have written a letter to the U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick urging the Trump administration to revert its decision to allow Nvidia to resume sale of Nvidia H20 AI chips in China .As reported by Tech Crunch, the letter calls the decision a 'Strategic Misstep'. It claims that the decision will have detrimental effects on the US' AI “edge” for both military and civilian use cases. The letter further claims that selling Nvidia H20 chips in China will worsen the existing AI chip bottleneck in the US and that these chips could be used to support China’s military.This letter comes weeks after the DOC gave Nvidia the green light to start selling its AI chips in China as the trade talks between the two countries started. At the time, Lutnick called Nvidia’s H20 as the company’s “fourth best” AI chip. The H20 chip reportedly sits at the center of a broader US-China trade talk standoff. Nvidia is also introducing a new “RTX Pro” chip designed specifically for the Chinese market, calling it “fully compliant” with regulations and ideal for digital manufacturing applications like smart factories and logistics.The letter’s signatories include Matt Pottinger, the former deputy national security adviser during Trump’s first term; Stewart Baker, the former assistant secretary of Homeland Security under George W Bush; and David Feith, a former member of the National Security Council, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Lloyd Thrall, among others.",A group of 20 national security experts and former government officials have written a letter to the U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

Beijing challenges US tech restrictions



Global framework needed for AI governance, says Chinese Premier

Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for the establishment of a global artificial intelligence cooperation organization on Saturday, positioning Beijing as an alternative to Washington's AI dominance just days after President Trump unveiled his low-regulation AI strategy. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Li warned that AI risks becoming ""an exclusive game for a few countries and companies.""The premier emphasized China's commitment to open-source AI development and promised to share technological advances with developing nations, particularly in the Global South. Li's proposal comes as the world's two largest economies engage in escalating technological competition, with AI emerging as a critical battleground.Without explicitly naming the United States, Li criticized what he described as technological monopolies and restrictions on AI development. His remarks directly counter the Trump administration's AI Action Plan released Wednesday, which aims to maintain American supremacy in artificial intelligence while limiting access to advanced technologies, according to Reuters.Washington has imposed strict export controls on high-end AI chips from companies like Nvidia and advanced chipmaking equipment, citing national security concerns about China's military capabilities. Despite these restrictions, Chinese companies including Huawei continue developing AI systems to compensate for limited access to American technology.Li stressed the urgent need for international coordination on AI governance, describing current global efforts as ""fragmented"" with significant differences in regulatory approaches between countries. The three-day Shanghai conference brings together industry leaders and policymakers from over 30 nations, including Russia, South Africa, Qatar, South Korea, and Germany.China's Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu revealed plans to potentially headquarter the proposed organization in Shanghai while promoting pragmatic AI cooperation. The initiative includes establishing cross-border open-source communities and facilitating international technology exchanges, positioning China as a leader in global AI governance amid growing concerns about the technology's ethical implications and security risks.","Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for the establishment of a global artificial intelligence cooperation organization.

""Now it's becoming increasingly clear that Elon is right about the use of LiDAR. Sensor fusion is not optimal for autonomous driving, as evidenced by countless incidents of Waymo blocking intersections, getting stuck in traffic for no reason, getting confused in construction zones and even worse going in the lane of opposing traffic.""The debate extends beyond individual incidents, with major autonomous vehicle companies reconsidering their sensor strategies.

Named Copilot Appearance, this update enables the AI assistant to recognise real-time facial expressions during voice conversations, including smiling, nodding, and raising eyebrows. This visual assistant is currently available in an early preview for users testing Copilot Labs . Microsoft's goal with this addition is to give Copilot a more human-like presence. The Copilot Appearance experiment aligns with Microsoft’s broader vision of evolving Copilot from a basic assistant into an AI companion. Microsoft’s AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman , has described this feature as giving Copilot its own ""digital patina"" that can develop over time with the user, aiming for more intuitive and human-like AI interactions.Users interested in trying Copilot Appearance can enable it through the voice settings in the Copilot interface. The feature is currently being tested with a limited group of users in the US, UK, and Canada. If you're not part of this test group, the option may not appear in your settings.At this stage, Copilot Appearance can display expressions such as smiling, nodding, and raising an eyebrow, all while maintaining the same familiar voice. The experiment is currently limited to the web version, and Microsoft hasn't announced any plans to expand it to Windows or mobile platforms.The feature includes real-time expressions such as smiles, nods, and surprised looks, all synced with Copilot’s speech engine to reflect tone and pace. It also remembers earlier parts of your conversation, allowing it to reference previous topics for a more natural flow of conversation.In a recent episode of The Colin & Samir Show, Suleyman discussed how Copilot will eventually have its own ""room"" to exist in and may develop a kind of ""digital patina"" over time.he noted.","Microsoft has introduced an experimental feature for its CoPilot AI chatbot.

I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company.

Read Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Bill Gates daughter shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother



Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Microsoft co-founder revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among tech CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April, Microsoft's Bill Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment. ""In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Phoebe Gates recently shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni, Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was: ""Get up or get out of the game, sis.""According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Melinda Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced. Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking: ""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""""He's like, ‘Why would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‘You answered your own question,'” she added.","Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.

Russia’s national flag carrier, Aeroflot , has been forced to cancel dozens of flights on Monday (July 28) following a cyberattack claimed by a pro-Ukrainian hacking group, a report has said. The disruption, which a senior lawmaker described as a “wake-up call” for Moscow. Over 40 flights, predominantly domestic but also including routes to Minsk and Yerevan, were cancelled, with at least 10 more experiencing delays.The Kremlin acknowledged the “alarming” situation, and a criminal investigation has been launched confirming the incident was indeed a hack, according to news agency Reuters. Lawmaker Anton Gorelkin suggested Russia was under a “digital attack” and speculated that the “hacktivists” claiming responsibility might be backed by “unfriendly states.”“The information that we are reading in the public domain is quite alarming. The hacker threat is a threat that remains for all large companies providing services to the population,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.The report said that there is no information on how long it will take to resolve the issues which led to travel chaos as many Russians began their holidays.The airline stated that “specialists are currently working to minimise the impact... and to restore normal service operations.” Affected passengers were offered refunds or rebooking options, with efforts made to secure seats on other airlines.A statement, purportedly from a group named Silent Crow, claimed responsibility for the cyberattack alongside a Belarusian group, Cyberpartisans BY, linking the operation to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.“Glory to Ukraine! Long live Belarus!” states the unconfirmed statement by the hackers.Silent Crow has previously claimed responsibility for other significant cyberattacks this year, targeting a Russian real estate database, a state telecoms company, a large insurance firm, Moscow's government IT department, and the Russian office of KIA, some of which resulted in major data leaks.The hacking group's statement asserted that the cyberattack was the culmination of a year-long operation that had “deeply penetrated Aeroflot's network,” destroying 7,000 servers and gaining control over employee personal computers, including those of senior management.The group even published screenshots of alleged file directories from within Aeroflot's network and threatened to imminently release “the personal data of all Russians who have ever flown Aeroflot.”","Russia’s national flag carrier, Aeroflot, forced to cancel dozens of flights on Monday (July 28) following a cyberattack claimed by a pro-Ukrainian hacking group.

What Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Huawei

Experts see Huawei chip surpassing Huawei

Huawei Technologies unveiled its CloudMatrix 384 AI computing system, positioning it as a strong rival to Nvidia ’s top-tier GB200 NVL72 . The company showcased the chips at the recent World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai, China. Announced in April, CloudMatrix 384 has garnered global interest for its competitive edge. Huawei has become widely regarded as China's most promising domestic supplier of chips essential for AI development, even though the company faces U.S. export restrictions.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had spoken about Huawei’s rapid progress earlier this year, citing CloudMatrix as a key example. Huang had also warned the US about imposing restrictions on China. If the US continues to impose AI semiconductor restrictions on China, then Huawei will take advantage of its position, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC in June. “Our technology is a generation ahead of theirs,” Huang remarked at the sidelines of the Viva Technology conference in Paris. He further warned that: “If the United States doesn’t want to partake, participate in China, Huawei has got China covered, and Huawei has got everybody else covered.”In the face of U.S. export curbs that restrict Chinese companies from buying advanced semiconductors used in the development of AI, Beijing has focused on nurturing Chinese companies such as Huawei in a bid to build its own AI chip ecosystem.Jensen Huang added that it was crucial that AI developers around the world build on the American technology stack — or layers of technology — not that of China’s.Industry expert Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis noted in April that Huawei’s AI system could surpass Nvidia’s offerings. The system integrates 384 of Huawei’s 910C chips, reportedly outperforming Nvidia’s 72 B200 chip-based GB200 NVL72 in certain metrics, thanks to Huawei’s advanced system design and “supernode” architecture for high-speed chip interconnectivity.","Huawei Technologies unveiled its CloudMatrix 384 AI computing system, positioning it as a strong rival to Nvidia’s top-tier GB200 NVL72.

Ramine Tinati , lead at Accenture , APAC Center for Advanced AI recently said that artificial intelligence (AI) tools may help people finish tasks faster, but they don’t automatically make workers more productive unless companies rethink how work is done. Speaking at Fortune’s Brainstorm AI Singapore conference recently, Tinati said “If you give employees a tool to do things faster, they do it faster. But are they more productive? Probably not, because they do it faster and then go for coffee breaks”.According to the Accenture executive, speeding up existing tasks isn’t enough. Real productivity improvements, he said, require companies to redesign their workflows completely. During the conversation, he also noted that some Asian companies are falling behind in AI use “because they don’t think about reinventing the work.”His comments come at a time when major companies are investing heavily in generative AI. Amazon has committed over $100 billion to AI investments, while Microsoft has invested $80 billion into AI data centers—even as it cut multiple jobs this year.However, not all experts see AI as a threat. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed a MIT research suggesting artificial intelligence diminishes cognitive abilities, arguing instead that his daily AI use has actually enhanced his thinking skills. Speaking on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" that aired on July 13, Huang said he uses AI ""literally every single day"" and believes his ""cognitive skills are actually advancing.""OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared an X (formerly Twitter) post stating that he agrees with lots of what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said about AI and jobs. He believes that jobs will be very different from what they are now, but will still be meaningful. “Agree with lots of what Jensen has been saying about ai and jobs; there is a ton of stuff to do in the world,” Altman wrote in the post.He continued “for sure jobs will be very different, and maybe the jobs of the future will look like playing games to us today while still being very meaningful to those people of the future.

Tesla outperformed Chinese competitors like BYD, Xiaomi, and Huawei in a test of Level 2 advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) conducted on China's highways. The test, reportedly a collaboration between state television CCTV and Bytedance’s auto unit Dcar, evaluated over 20 electric vehicle brands in high-risk highway and urban traffic scenarios. Videos of the test, shared by Dcar, gained significant traction on Chinese social media.Tesla CEO Elon Musk too responded to a post on these tests. Sharing details of these tests, Tesla investor and Model Y owner Sawyer Merritt, wrote, ""NEWS: Chinese media tested ADAS in various scenarios, including highways & night driving. @Tesla’s vision-based system outperformed emerging Chinese brands like Huawei & Xiaomi, as well as traditional automakers. Even with LiDAR, competitors’ ADAS performance lags behind Tesla."" Below he shared all the parameters and one-and-a-half-hour video.Elon Musk highlighted on Twitter that Tesla achieved these results despite restrictions on local data training due to U.S. laws prohibiting AI software training in China. ""Due to laws against data export, Tesla achieved the top results in China despite having no local training data,"" Elon Musk said on his Twitter account. Tesla is seeking approval from Chinese regulators to transfer Shanghai-stored data to the US for algorithm development, a situation Musk called a “quandary.”As per the tests published by TikTok owner Bytedance's auto unit Dcar, Tesla’s Model 3 and Model X topped the highway test, passing five out of six scenarios, while BYD’s Denza Z9GT and Huawei-backed Aito M9 failed three, and Xiaomi’s SU7 passed only one. HIMA, Huawei’s auto alliance, declined to comment on the test, per a Weibo post.A Reuters report quoted Wang Yao, deputy chief engineer at the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, urging Chinese brands to address the gap with Tesla in autonomous driving technology during a recent Shanghai auto forum. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun, referencing a Tesla Model Y’s autonomous delivery in Texas last month, acknowledged Tesla’s industry leadership, stating, “We will continue to learn.” In late June, Tesla arranged for a Model Y crossover to drive itself from its Texas factory to a customer in downtown Austin some 30 minutes away.The test follows heightened safety concerns in China after a fatal March accident involving a Xiaomi SU7, prompting scrutiny of ADAS marketing. Chinese authorities have banned terms like “smart driving” and “autonomous driving” in promotions, and the public security ministry warned of legal and safety risks for drivers relying on these systems. Despite a brief dip in Xiaomi’s EV orders post-accident, its new electric SUV saw strong initial demand last month.Tesla’s China-made EV sales rose 0.8% year-on-year in June, ending an eight-month decline, though quarterly sales continued to lag amid competition from lower-cost Chinese models. Tesla’s ADAS, priced at nearly $9,000 in China, relies solely on cameras and AI, unlike rivals like BYD, which incorporate lidar for enhanced performance.","Tesla outperformed Chinese competitors like BYD, Xiaomi, and Huawei in a test of Level 2 advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) conducted on China's highways.

Boat Aavante Prime 5.1 5000DA soundbar review: DOLBY ATMOS POWER!

Google executives appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection to a money laundering investigation related to alleged promotion of ""illegal"" online betting and gambling platforms, reports news agency PTI. The probe agency had called executives of both Google and Meta, first on July 21. The officials then sought more time, citing the need to gather relevant documents and information before they present themselves for questioning and recording of their statements. However, only representatives of Google deposed, the agency said, quoting official sources.As per the PTI report, ED may have recorded the statement of a designated ""compliance officer"" of Google under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in addition to obtaining some documents from the company.A Google spokesperson told the news agency in a statement last week that the company was ""committed to keeping our platforms safe and secure, prohibiting the promotion of illegal gambling ads.""""We are extending our full support and cooperation to investigating agencies to hold bad actors responsible and keep users safe,"" the spokesperson then added.The PTI report says that ED is investigating multiple platforms hosting illegal betting and gambling links, and how these companies are able to advertise on various digital and social media platforms. The tech companies were called to explain the mechanisms that allowed such promotions.The ED is also expected to question several celebrities and sportspersons in connection with the same probe. Earlier this month, actors Prakash Raj, Vijay Deverakonda, and Rana Daggubati and 26 other celebrities were charged by ED for endorsing betting apps. They have been accused of violating the Public Gambling Act, 1867, by promoting such gambling apps.According to the agency, the platforms under investigation were involved in cheating users and laundering money, with large-scale tax evasion also suspected. The ED is currently handling more than a dozen cases linked to illegal betting apps, including the Mahadev Online Book, which is believed to be run by individuals from Chhattisgarh.","Google executives appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection to a money laundering investigation.

TCS announces 12,000 job cuts amid skill mismatch concerns

Thousands of Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) employees are grappling with heightened job insecurity as the IT giant's controversial bench policy completed its first 35-day cycle this week, coinciding with the company's announcement of 12,000 global job cuts. The policy, implemented on June 12, caps the maximum bench period—time without project allocation—at just 35 days annually, after which employees risk career degrowth or termination.TCS's revised deployment policy requires employees to be billable for at least 225 business days within a 12-month period, effectively limiting bench time to a maximum of 35 business days per year. During unallocated periods, employees must spend 4-6 hours daily on upskilling through internal platforms and are required to maintain office presence, with remote work generally prohibited.The policy places primary responsibility on employees to proactively seek new assignments through the Resource Management Group (RMG). Long periods without allocation can adversely impact compensation, career growth, overseas deployment opportunities, and employment continuity, according to internal company documents.Online forums like Reddit are flooded with posts from anxious TCS employees. ""This is the first step towards employment rationalisation based on utilisation. Brace for layoffs,"" one user wrote. A fresher claimed being pressured into support projects unrelated to their Java training within weeks of joining.The Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) filed a complaint with the Union Labour Ministry on Wednesday, calling the policy ""inhumane"" and ""exploitative."" Based on complaints from 78 employees, NITES alleged that TCS is coercing benched employees with termination threats and denial of experience letters.""These are not non-performing employees, but skilled professionals who find themselves temporarily without allocation,"" said NITES president Harpreet Singh Saluja. However, some employees support the move, arguing it could help remove long-term benchers who decline projects.TCS CEO K Krithivasan defended the policy as a ""structured version of what's long been in practice,"" emphasizing that associates must take responsibility for their careers while HR supports placement efforts.Separately, TCS plans to cut approximately 12,000 jobs globally—around 2% of its 613,000-strong workforce—through FY26, according to a Moneycontrol report. CEO Krithivasan clarified that the layoffs stem from skill mismatches rather than AI-driven productivity gains, primarily affecting mid-to-senior level employees and some junior staff on prolonged bench time.The IT sector faces reduced demand due to macroeconomic uncertainty and AI automation of routine tasks. Industry estimates suggest 15-18% of employees at major Indian IT firms are typically on the bench. TCS reported employee costs of ₹37,715 crore in Q1, constituting 59.45% of revenue, with attrition at 13.8%.The company's strict bench policy could influence other IT firms to tighten similar policies as the industry adapts to AI-led demand for advanced skill sets, experts told ET.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) employees are grappling with heightened job insecurity. The IT giant's controversial bench policy completed its first 35-day cycle this week. The policy, implemented on June 12, caps the maximum bench period—time without project allocation—at just 35 days annually.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122954304,imgsize-66012,width-400,resizemode-4/TCS.jpg"

Bill Gates quietly paid a daily fine of $28 for 13 years; the Porsche connection may surprise you,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-quietly-paid-a-daily-fine-of-28-for-13-years-the-porsche-connection-may-surprise-you/articleshow/122952312.cms,"Bill Gates quietly paid a daily fine of $28 for 13 years; the Porsche connection may surprise you

Bill Gates’ Porsche was banned in the US: Here’s how he fought back



The “Show or Display” rule: A loophole born from one supercar



Counting the cost of a 13-year standoff

Legacy beyond one collector’s garage



In 1988, Bill Gates placed an order for the Porsche 959 Komfort, the most advanced road car of its era and one of only 337 ever built. The twin-turbo, all-wheel-drive coupe could top 200 mph and featured technology that later became standard on everyday cars. Gates paid roughly $400,000—then something close to pocket change for a rising software mogul—but he overlooked one problem: the United States had never certified the 959 for safety or emissions. When the car reached the Port of Seattle, it was declared illegal to register or drive, yet officials offered a compromise. They would hold the Porsche in a bonded warehouse if the owner paid a storage and customs bond of $28 every day. Gates agreed, believing regulators would soon modernise the 1960s-era import code. They did not. For the next thirteen years, the 959 sat wrapped in plastic while Microsoft’s co-founder quietly signed cheques that eventually surpassed $132,000. No reporters noticed, no press release boasted about the world’s most expensive parking fee—just a man, a dream car, and a slow-moving bureaucracy.US law allowed owners to retrofit foreign cars to local standards, but the 959 presented two hurdles. First, Porsche never built a 959 test vehicle for destructive crash certification, so importers could not prove compliance without destroying another limited-edition example. Second, its complex electronics made emissions re-tuning expensive and uncertain. Any attempt to certify the car risked erasing the very technology that made it special. Gates, joined by fellow 959 buyer and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, began lobbying Congress for an alternative path that would respect technological landmarks without compromising public safety.Years of behind-the-scenes persuasion culminated in 1999 when the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration introduced the Show or Display exemption. The rule lets owners import vehicles deemed historically or technologically significant, provided annual mileage stays below 2,500 miles and the cars remain in near-original condition. The Porsche 959 became the poster child of the new list. Two years later, Gates finally took delivery, drove the car legally on US roads, and ended his daily fine. Critics called the exemption preferential treatment for billionaires, yet preservationists note the same rule now protects everything from early fuel-cell prototypes to the McLaren F1.Gates’ ledger shows about 4,745 days of storage fees at $28 each, plus periodic bond renewals of $500. Adjusted for inflation, the sum approaches $300,000 in today’s dollars—comparable to the original purchase price. Still, Gates appears to have no regrets. In a 2018 television interview, he called the 959 “the car that proved software belongs in automobiles,” a nod to its adaptive suspension and in-dash diagnostics. The saga also underscored how innovation often races ahead of regulation; only when a high-profile case exposes the gap does the rulebook catch up.The Porsche 959 episode shifted US automotive policy, opened museum doors to foreign prototypes, and previewed debates now playing out around autonomous-vehicle imports. It also showed how personal passion can drive policy change: a billionaire wanted to enjoy a piece of engineering history, and the solution he championed now benefits restorers, educators, and small collectors nationwide. The 959 itself remains in Gates’ private fleet, reportedly driven sparingly on summer roads around Washington State—a rolling reminder that sometimes law bends, eventually, to the lure of innovation.","Bill Gates paid $400,000 for the Porsche 959 Komfort, the most advanced road car of its era and one of only 337 ever built.

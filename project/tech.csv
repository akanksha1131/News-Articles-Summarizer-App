In a move signaling a shift toward greater cooperation in the competitive cloud market, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud introduced a jointly developed multicloud networking service on Sunday. The initiative aims to bolster internet reliability and drastically reduce the time required to connect disparate computing platforms. The collaboration comes as the tech industry faces increasing pressure to prevent costly service disruptions. The new offering arrives just over a month after a massive AWS outage on October 20 knocked major applications -- including Snapchat and Reddit—offline. That single event is estimated to cost U.S. companies between $500 million and $650 million in losses, according to analytics firm Parametrix.The new service combines AWS’ Interconnect-multicloud with Google Cloud’s Cross-Cloud Interconnect. According to the companies, this integration allows customers to establish private, high-speed links between the two platforms in ""minutes instead of weeks."" ""This collaboration between AWS and Google Cloud represents a fundamental shift in multicloud connectivity,"" said Robert Kennedy , Vice President of Network Services at AWS.Rob Enns, Vice President and General Manager of Cloud Networking at Google Cloud, noted that the joint network is designed to streamline the movement of data and applications between clouds, addressing a longstanding friction point for enterprise clients.Tech giant Salesforce was named as one of the early adopters of this new interoperable approach.The partnership occurs against a backdrop of surging demand for digital infrastructure, driven largely by the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. Major players, including Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, are currently investing billions to expand capacity to handle this increased traffic.While the two companies are collaborating on connectivity, they remain fierce competitors. AWS retains its position as the world's largest cloud provider, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. In the third quarter, Amazon’s cloud business generated $33 billion in revenue -- more than double Google Cloud's $15.16 billion.However, as internet disruptions become more expensive and disruptive, the new partnership suggests that interoperability is becoming a business necessity even for market leaders.",Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud introduce a jointly developed multicloud networking service.

Cat Goetze, a tech founder known online as ""CatGPT,"" has turned a personal quest for nostalgia into a six-figure business, banking on a generation’s desire to disconnect. According to a report by CNBC Make It, Goetze’s startup, Physical Phones, generated $120,000 in sales in its first three days after going viral on social media in July 2025. By the end of October, the business had sold over 3,000 units, totaling $280,000 in revenue. The product—a retro-styled handset that looks like a traditional landline but connects to smartphones via Bluetooth—was born out of Goetze’s desire to reduce her own screen time without sacrificing connectivity.Two years ago, Goetze sought to replace her smartphone usage with something ""low-tech."" However, she discovered that installing a true landline in her apartment was both expensive and logistically difficult.""I was kind of just sitting around [thinking] it’d be so cute if we still had landline phones and you could twirl the cord and talk with your friends,"" Goetze told CNBC Make It. ""That just felt nostalgic and chic to me.""Taking matters into her own hands, Goetze ""hijacked"" a thrifted landline phone and engineered it to be Bluetooth compatible. For two years, the pink clamshell device served as her primary communication hub at home, allowing her to take calls and even buzz guests into her building.When she finally unveiled the device to her social media audience in July 2025, she anticipated a modest response, setting up a shop hoping for 15 to 20 pre-orders she could build manually. Instead, the demand was instantaneous.""It literally felt like we had captured lightning in a bottle,"" she told the CNBC.Physical Phones are currently available in five styles ranging from $90 to $110. While Goetze originally built them by hand, she has since partnered with an electronics manufacturer, with the first major batches shipping this December.The devices function as an extension of a user’s smartphone:Pairs with iPhone and Android via Bluetooth.The device rings for standard calls as well as audio/video calls from apps like WhatsApp, FaceTime, Instagram, and Snapchat.Users can dial numbers directly or use the star key (*) to activate voice assistants (like Siri or Google Assistant) to dial contacts by name.R u reading this caption because the video started to get boring?Ur gonna check the comments next huh?It’s ok.That’s your brain looking for more rustling leaves in the Savannah.If that doesn’t make sense, you just haven’t gotten far enough in the video yet.Force 1= tech companies. They get paid more $ the longer you stay here, so they wanna hook u. Bad.Force 2= about two thousand centuries of evolution. Your brain is hardwired to reward noticing novel, unexpected things.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment.The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.","OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities.

His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts.

In a recent episode of the popular podcast People by WTF hosted by Indian entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath, Elon Musk shared advice that has quickly gone viral across India. His message, directed towards young Indian entrepreneurs, emphasised the importance of focusing on building useful products and services rather than chasing wealth directly. Musk expressed admiration for creators who genuinely want to contribute something meaningful to society and encouraged founders to build with purpose, resilience and long-term commitment. The podcast sparked wide discussion across social media as many viewers reflected on whether shifting attention from profit to problem-solving could transform India’s fast-growing entrepreneurial landscape and inspire more sustainable innovation across sectors and communities today.During the conversation, Musk said he is a big fan of anyone who wants to build and who wants to create more value than they consume. He encouraged entrepreneurs to focus on solving real problems rather than pursuing rapid financial gain. According to him, when businesses genuinely aim to provide something useful, success naturally follows. The emphasis on meaningful contribution resonated deeply because many new founders feel pressured to grow fast, seek investment early and measure success only by valuation or revenue.Musk’s view suggests that long-term growth depends more on usefulness than hype and that sustainable companies are built by solving needs that truly matter.Musk’s comments urge Indian entrepreneurs to place value creation at the centre of their strategy. Instead of replicating existing products or following trends simply to seek profit, he encouraged founders to identify gaps in society and build solutions that genuinely improve life for others. Useful products, he suggested, should be the foundation of every venture because they shape trust, create resilience and last longer than businesses based purely on momentum or marketing. The growing pace of India’s digital and industrial development means opportunities are vast. From affordable technology and education to rural services and healthcare systems, providing real utility remains one of the strongest paths to making an impact.Musk also noted that entrepreneurship involves significant sacrifice, long hours and emotional pressure. He explained that success rarely comes instantly and that building something valuable requires patience and willingness to face failure without giving up. Many startups collapse because the desire for quick results overrides perseverance. His advice encourages young builders to stay committed to their vision, work consistently and remain grounded when setbacks appear. Hard work, combined with purpose, becomes the fuel for meaningful growth. Entrepreneurs who endure difficult phases often become the ones who eventually change industries and create progress.Entrepreneurs inspired by Musk’s message can start by observing real issues around them. Identifying everyday challenges within families, workplaces, or communities offers the strongest foundation for innovation. Instead of beginning with fundraising or branding, entrepreneurs can work on developing small prototypes and testing them directly with users. Listening to feedback, improving continuously, and prioritising quality over speed can lead to stable growth. Additionally, choosing long-term thinking helps build businesses that contribute genuine value rather than temporary excitement. Musk’s approach suggests that profits will follow naturally when a solution solves a real problem.The reason Musk’s message is spreading quickly across India is simple. It replaces pressure with purpose. It reminds young founders that meaningful contribution matters more than chasing financial success alone. In a country that is witnessing an explosion of startups and innovation, his advice encourages a mindset shift towards usefulness, resilience and long-term thinking. By focusing on building valuable products and services that help people, entrepreneurs can create lasting change and shape industries for generations. For those dreaming of success, the message is powerful: build something useful, contribute positively, and the results will follow in time.","In a recent episode of the popular podcast People by WTF, Elon Musk shared advice that has quickly gone viral across India.

Lesson learned from COVID



A national challenge







Ford Motor company CEO Jim Farley recently shared his thoughts on America’s labour future. He revealed that the company is struggling to fill around 5,000 skilled-mechanic roles despite offering salaries around $120,000. Now once again, Farley has said that the realm crises facing America is the shortage of trade workers. In an appearance on the Office Hours: Business Edition podcast, Farley issued a warning that the US is dangerously behind countries like China when it comes with building and sustaining essential workforce. Farley didn’t mince words: “We are in deep trouble when you compare us to China,” he said, pointing to the lack of skilled labor across critical sectors. According to him, more than 1 million jobs are currently sitting empty in emergency services, trucking, plumbing, factory work, and other trades.Farley stressed that this shortage is not just about filling jobs, but it is about safeguarding the country’s ability to function in times of crises. He also argued that skilled traders are the backbone of the US economy and national resilience, but still US is failing to invest in training and education to replenish this workforce.Farley’s grandfather who worked on Ford’s assembly line, has also been vocal about the need to rebuild the pipeline for blue collar workers. “Those hardworking jobs made our country what it is,” he said. “We do not have trade schools. We are not investing in educating a next generation… of people like my grandfather who had nothing, who built a middle-class life and a future for his family.”This is the only conviction which led Ford to become the first major automaker to ratify union agreements during recent labour negotiations in both the US and Canada. “I’m so proud of us,” Farley said. “We got rid of the lower tier, paid everyone the same. Now those people have a career at Ford like my grandfather.”Farley also shared his thoughts on how the pandemic exposed the cracks present in the wage system. He said that many workers told him that they were juggling between multiple jobs in order to make the ends meet. In response to this, Ford altogether eliminated its two-tier wage structure and gave employees a clear path to financial stability, which Farley think is important for workforce rebuilding.Farley also emphasised that this not just the problem of Ford. He mentioned that the solution to this lies in public-private cooperation, education reform and cultural respect for manual work. “If we work together like we always have in America… and we get after this with the government, with education… I think we can solve this. But we have a lot of work to do.”","Jim Farley, CEO of Ford Motor Company, said that the US is in trouble when it comes to building and sustaining a skilled workforce.

Elon Musk’s Indian connection

Elon Musk agrees America has benefitted from talented Indians

Musk says there has been a misuse of H1-B visa





Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has now revealed that his son’s middle name Shekar is inspired by a legendary Indian-American physicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, best known for his groundbreaking work on the evolution of stars. During a conversation on Nikhil Kamath’s People by WTF podcast, Musk made this revelation.Speaking at the podcast interview, Musk said, “My partner is half Indian. My son’s middle name is Sekhar, after the famous Indian physicist.” The physicist in question, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, won the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics for his theoretical studies on the structure and evolution of stars, including the discovery of the Chandrasekhar limit that determines whether a star becomes a white dwarf or collapses into a black hole.The revelation made by Elon Musk underscores his personal ties to India. Elon Musk’s partner and popular musician Grimes has India heritage. Grimes once revealed that her step-father is India. Grimes once said, “My step dad’s Indian, I had a fire childhood in a half Indian household. Indian culture jives very well with western culture.”Along with this, Musk has also spoken about India’s role and importance in the global technology and energy landscape.Naming his son after Chandrasekhar reflects both a personal and symbolic connection to India’s scientific legacy.Speaking the podcast, Elon Musk also acknowledged that “America has benefitted immensely from talented Indians”, however, noted that “there has been some misuse of the H-1B Program.” Last year, Musk spoke out in defense of immigrants, specifically praising those who have significantly contributed to the US economy. He advocated for immigration of skilled workers, arguing it is essential to fill the nation’s talent gap.When asked “why has that narrative changed of late?” Musk said that “there's different schools of thought.”“And it actually also had like somewhat of a negative selection effect. So, if there's a massive financial incentive to come to the US illegally and get all these government benefits, then you're gonna necessarily create a diffusion gradient for people to come to the US. It's an incentive structure. And so, I think, that obviously made no sense.Musk also highlighted the misuse of the H1-B programme, saying that amid the need for skilled workers, there has been a misuse of the visa system.“My direct observation is that there's always a scarcity of talented people. So, from my standpoint, I'm like, ‘We have a lot of difficulty finding enough talented people to get these difficult tasks done. And so more talented people would be good’,” he said.“But I guess, some companies out there, it's sort of, they're making it more of a cost thing, where it's like, okay, if they can employ someone for a fraction of the cost of an American citizen, then, I guess, these other companies would hire people just to save costs,” Musk added.According to Musk, his companies focus on “trying to get the most talented people in the world. And we pay way above average.”","Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has revealed that his son’s middle name is inspired by a legendary Indian-American physicist.

Wikipedia offers open editing, transparent revision history and community governance; Grokipedia currently limits user edits and lacks full transparency on who changed what.

Wikipedia content is freely licensed (“Creative Commons/Free) and uncoupled from commercial interests; Grokipedia is associated with a for-profit venture and uses AI systems that may embed bias.

Grokipedia’s rocky start









Recently, it was observed that Anthropic’s AI tool was citing Grokipedia which is an AI-powered encyclopaedia launched by Elon Musk inplace of the widely used Wikipedia . This development prompted a question about whether there as a deeper collaboration between Anthropic and Elon Musk’s xAI, leading Musk himself to weigh in on the matter. An Australian data scientist and co-founder of fast.ai Jeremy Howard recently noticed this change while she was using Anthropic’s search API.Howard shared his observation on X, noting: “Is there some agreement between @AnthropicAI and @grok on search now? The Anthropic API today for me started citing Grokipedia sources when using its search tool, even although Wikipedia results are higher in search engines for these queries.” His post quickly drew attention, with many speculating about the reasons behind Anthropic’s apparent preference for Grokipedia over Wikipedia.Elon Musk also reposed to Howard’s post and clarified that Grokipedia is an open source and is also free to use. “ Grokipedia.com is open source and free to be used by anyone with no royalty or even acknowledgement required. We just ask that any mistakes be corrected, so that it becomes more objectively accurate over time,” wrote Musk.Musk also emphasised that the platform urges the users to correct the errors and help in improving accuracy over time, positioning Grokipedia as a collaborative and evolving knowledge base.Key differences between Grokipedia and Wikipedia are:Despite Musk’s claim that Grokipedia will be a “massive improvement” over Wikipedia, early users have flagged factual errors and ideological slants. One entry falsely claimed that former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy took on a major role in DOGE after Musk’s departure, despite Ramaswamy having left months earlier.Grok, the AI chatbot behind Grokipedia, has also faced controversy. In July, it shared antisemitic content, including posts praising Adolf Hitler. xAI later apologized, attributing the incident to a flawed code update.",Anthropic’s AI tool was citing Grokipedia which is an AI-powered encyclopaedia launched by Elon Musk inplace of the widely used Wikipedia.

Musk says DOGE fought against fraud









Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath, in his recent podcast interview, posed multiple questions to Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk . One of the queries was regarding the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was set up for cost-cutting measures in the government and led by Musk in the first few months of President Donald Trump's second term. Kamath asked, “What did DOGE teach you if you learned one thing?”Musk described his experience with government operations as an “interesting side quest,” detailing how people there were payment inefficiencies. He also highlighted one change that he believes could save the US government hundreds of billions of dollars annually: requiring a national payment code and a comment field with substantive information for every federal payment.“There were massive numbers of payments that were going out with no Congressional payment code, and with nothing in the comment field, which makes auditing the payments impossible,” Musk stated, adding this “trivial seeming change” could save $100 billion, or even $200 billion a year.Musk said that when efforts are made to stop fraudulent and wasteful payments, the entities responsible do not concede. Instead, they leverage sympathetic arguments to defend their funding.Musk recounted instances where he encountered claims that specific funding was essential for “needy people” or “children in Africa.” However, when pressed for verification, the claims fell apart.“We're not going to send the money unless we can talk to the recipients and confirm they will actually get it,” he emphasised.Musk also gave an example of how people used sympathy to take money from the government.“Fraudsters necessarily will come up with a very sympathetic argument. They're not going to say, 'Give us the money for fraud’. It's going to be like the 'Save the Baby Pandas' NGO, which is like, who doesn't want to save the baby pandas? They're adorable,” Musk said, followed by laughter.“But then it turns out no pandas are being saved in this thing. It's just corruption, essentially. And you're like, 'Well, can you send us a picture of the panda?' They're like, 'No.' 'Okay. Well, how do we know it's going to the pandas then?'"" he added.","Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath posed multiple questions to Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.

The government of India is reportedly mandating smartphone companies to ensure that all their smartphones come with the official cyber security app. According to a report in Reuters, telecom ministry has privately asked smartphone makers to preload all new devices with a state-owned cyber security app that cannot be deleted. The report claims to quote a government order that Reuters says it has seen. The government cyber security app that Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo, OnePlus and other smartphone companies have been told to pre-install is: Sanchar Saathi app.The government order, dated November 28, gives major smartphone companies 90 days to ensure that the government's Sanchar Saathi app is pre-installed on new mobile phones, with a provision that users cannot disable it. For devices already in the supply chain, manufacturers should push the app to phones via software updates, the telecom ministry reportedly said in its order. The report says that has not been made public as yet and was sent privately to select companies. The government says that the app helps prevent cyber threats and assists tracking and blocking of lost or stolen phones, helping police to trace devices, while keeping counterfeits out of the black market.The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) introduced the Sanchar Saathi mobile app in January 2025. According to telecom department, the citizen-centric tool brings robust security features and fraud-reporting capabilities directly to users’ smartphones. The app complements the existing Sanchar Saathi portal by providing convenient, on-the-go protection against identity theft, forged KYC, device theft, banking fraud, and other cyber risks. Sanchar Saathi app is mainly designed to help users block and track lost or stolen smartphones across all telecom networks, using a central registry. It also lets them identify, and disconnect, fraudulent mobile connections.As per government data, since its launch on January 17, 2025, the Sanchar Saathi mobile app has crossed 50 lakh downloads as on August 2025. Over 37.28 lakh stolen/lost mobile devices have been successfully blocked and more than 22.76 lakh devices have been traced from the Sanchar Saathi LIVE dashboard.One of the world's largest telephone markets, India has more than 1.2 billion subscribers. As per government figures, the app has helped recover more than 700,000 lost phones, including 50,000 in October alone. With more than 5 million downloads since its launch, the app has helped block more than 3.7 million stolen or lost mobile phones, while more than 30 million fraudulent connections have also been terminated.The app is available in Hindi and 21 other regional languages, making it inclusive and accessible across the country.","The government is reportedly mandating smartphone companies to pre-install the Sanchar Saathi app. The app is a state-owned cyber security app that cannot be deleted.

app-based communication services

:





Telecom department recently issued a directive that mandated that the user's subscriber identity module (SIM) used at registration must be bound to the services of web-based platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Arattai, Snapchat, Sharechat and others. According to Department of Telecom (DoT) circular, within 90 days, users will no longer be able to access these apps unless the original SIM is present in the device. This means that messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Snapchat, ShareChat, JioChat, Arattai need to ensure that their services cannot be used unless the user has an active SIM card in their device. Making SIM binding mandatory provides a way to trace activity to a physical subscriber. Under the new rules, apps will now be required to automatically log users out every six hours and ask them to log in again through a QR code, when accessed on a device without SIM card.The rules flow from the Telecommunication Cybersecurity Amendment Rules, 2025, which introduced the Telecommunication Identifier User Entity requirement. Under the revised rules, platforms will need access to the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) stored on the SIM, requiring global services such as WhatsApp to re-engineer parts of their system for Indian users.India's largest telecom body, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), whose members include Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea, has welcomed the new DoT guidelines. COAI said that making SIM binding mandatory would keep a reliable link between the user, the number, and the device, which could help reduce spam, fraud calls, and financial scams.COAI had earlier highlighted allowing these messaging apps to function independently of SIM cards creates opportunities for misuse. Cybercriminals and anti-national elements, including those operating from outside India, are known to exploit this loophole. As even after changing or deactivating SIM cards, users can continue using these apps, making it extremely difficult for authorities to trace fraud through call records, location logs, or telecom data. COAI said that making SIM binding mandatory would keep a reliable link between the user, the number, and the device, which could help reduce spam, fraud calls, and financial scams.“COAI welcomes and commends the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for taking a landmark step towards bolstering National Security and safeguarding our citizens, by mandating SIM-binding for devices for App based Communication Services.In its recent directive, the DoT has called for SIM binding to prevent the misuse of telecommunication identifiers or telecommunication equipment or telecommunication network or telecommunication services to further reinforce telecom cyber security. This mandate requires that the App based Communication Services must remain continuously linked to the SIM card, which is associated with the Mobile Number used for identification of customers/users or for provisioning or delivery of services. Such continuous linkage ensures complete accountability and traceability for any activity undertaken by the SIM card and its associated Communication App, thereby closing long-persistent gaps that have enabled anonymity and misuse.COAI congratulates the Department of Communications, Government of India on introducing this first in the world regulatory measure, wherein App based Communication Services have been directed to be bound with the SIM for safety and consistency measures. COAI has been strongly advocating to bind communication apps with Mobile SIMs for strengthening national security and cyber fraud prevention and believe that this is a much-needed initiative in ensuring consumer trust, accountability, traceability and further alignment with evolving regulatory frameworks.At present, app-based communication services link to a subscriber’s mobile SIM card only once during initial installation and verification. Thereafter, these applications continue to function even if the SIM is removed, replaced or deactivated - creating significant scope for fraud. The new directive mandates that all relevant communication apps ensure continuous linkage between the application and the SIM/phone number used for registration, thereby creating a more accountable digital environment by curbing anonymous misuse and protecting users in the online space.COAI firmly believes that this mechanism will significantly reduce spam and fraudulent communications perpetrated through these platforms and help mitigate financial frauds. Telecom operators stand fully committed to supporting seamless implementation of this directive.Telecom operators have already instituted a very wide spectrum of initiatives to curb spam and fraudulent communication on SMS's and calls. COAI urges DoT to recommend similar adherence of measures on App based Communication Services too, so as to ensure maximum possible mitigation of risks for subscribers across all communication channels. Moreover, COAI urges DoT to engage with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to ensure that for all financial transactions, the primary factor of authentication should mandatorily be through SMS OTP, which continues to remain the most secure, operator verified channel with guaranteed traceability. Strengthening this requirement will create a consistent and secure authentication framework across the financial ecosystem, further reducing the risk of fraud and reinforcing consumer trust.As global agencies warn of sophisticated spyware and rampant platform frauds, India has implemented a pioneering security mandate — persistent SIM binding — to establish a verified identity layer and lead the way in securing digital communications in the country. COAI lauds the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for bolstering National Security and safeguarding Indian citizens, through this pioneering mandate. While many international bodies have brought out these issues to the forefront, India, for the first time globally, officially undertook this practical step to address the menace of digital spams and frauds.For example, in an alert dated 24 November 2025, titled Spyware Allows Cyber Threat Actors to Target Users of Messaging Applications, the CISA warned of “Guardian” spyware targeting users of messaging platforms through malicious links. This tool compromises both Android and iOS devices, enabling data theft and surveillance. It has been deployed globally, with human rights defenders and journalists among the primary targets. As CISA strongly encourages users to take steps to secure their mobile communications, India’s pioneering decision to mandate persistent SIM binding emerges as a timely and critical security measure. By establishing a verified identity layer, it significantly raises the barrier for such malicious actors.This move is especially relevant in light of reporting from Reuters, which revealed that a social media giant failed for at least three years to identify and stop an avalanche of ads. These ads exposed billions of messaging app users to fraudulent e-commerce and investment schemes, illegal online casinos and the sale of banned medical products. India’s SIM binding directive directly counters this environment by enforcing accountability, making it a vital step toward curbing large-scale fraud and abuse on digital platforms.While some individual messaging services have taken steps to combat spam and fraud, their effectiveness on the ground remains limited. For example, it is concerning to note that one prominent platform has acted on only about 2.5% of total ban appeals — a meager rate that underscores the need for more robust, systemic protections.Further highlighting these vulnerabilities, the National Cybercrime Threat Analytics Unit (I4C) has identified a transnational scam in which fake social media advertisements lure users into linking their messaging accounts via malicious QR codes. This exploits the ‘linked devices’ feature to hijack accounts, creating “mule accounts” that are rented out to conduct fraud. India’s recent SIM binding mandate neutralizes this specific risk by ensuring that a messaging session is permanently tied to its original, verified SIM card, thereby preventing remote hijacking and account rental. This proactive measure establishes a foundational security layer to eliminate such exploitation and combat evolving digital fraud.India has taken a rational and futuristic step forward in this context and the Indian Telecom Industry is ready to offer whatever assistance necessary to the Government to prevent such scams/frauds from taking place.”","Telecom department recently issued a directive that mandated that the user's subscriber identity module (SIM) used at registration must be bound to the services of web-based platforms.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

No one want AI in messaging app









Signal President Meredith Whittaker has warned against the rapid integration of AI agents into operating systems, claiming that the technology poses an “existential threat” to secure messaging apps like Signal itself, Whatsapp , Telegram and others, and the overall integrity of mobile and computer applications. Speaking on the sidelines of the Slush technology conference last week, the head of the privacy-focused apps argued that the rush by major tech companies to deploy agentic AI is creating massive security holes that outweigh any perceived user benefit, she told Fortune.Whittaker explained that the functional requirements of AI agents is access to large volumes of sensitive, private data, including passwords, bank details and communication records. Whittaker warned that if AI agents gain unrestricted access to sensitive communications and data via the underlying operating system, attackers could easily exploit this new vulnerability.“The way an agent works is that it completes complex tasks on your behalf, and it does that by accessing many sources of data. It would need access to your Signal contacts and your Signal messages…that access is an attack vector and that really nullifies our reason for being,” she said.Whittaker criticised the integration of AI agents at the operating system level, calling it a “very reckless and insensitive to cybersecurity and privacy basics” architectural decision. She noted that AI agents are highly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions hidden on websites can trick the AI into executing harmful actions.Whittaker also dismissed the idea of integrating AI in messaging, stating, “No one wants AI in their messaging app. It’s really annoying.” Her message comes as rivals like Meta-owned WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger already have AI features. She questioned whether the potential benefits of AI justify the trade-off in security.Whittaker attributed this rushed deployment to financial pressure. ""There is a need to continually float these valuations in this market to investors and shareholders quarterly, leading to what I’m seeing as a lot of reckless deployments that bypass security teams,"" she said.","Signal President Meredith Whittaker has warned against the rapid integration of AI agents into operating systems.

Elon Musk’s SpaceX may get funding for US ‘Golden Dome’









Italian defense and aerospace group Leonardo has launched an AI-powered air defense system, the “Michelangelo Dome”, designed to act as a multi-layered shield for cities and critical infrastructure. Named as a nod to Israel’s “Iron Dome”, the Michelangelo Dome will integrate space, air, land and sea defense platforms to detect, track, intercept, and neutralise a range of aerial threats, including missile attacks and drone swarms. The launch will bolster Europe’s defense capabilities.Leonardo CEO Roberto Cingolani said that the system has an “open architecture” design, emphasising the collaborative nature of the system. This means the system can operate alongside and integrate with any country's existing defense protocols.“In a world where threats evolve rapidly and become ever more complex—and where defending is costlier than attacking—defense must innovate, anticipate and embrace international cooperation,” Cingolani said, as per news agency Reuters. The CEO also noted that the company will form a joint team with the Italian armed forces to design the architecture tailored to national defense needs.Leonardo is targeting the project to become partially operational soon, with the full system expected to be deployed and functional by 2028.Earlier this year, a report said that Elon Musk-owned SpaceX may receive $2 billion in federal funding to develop a massive network of satellites capable of tracking missiles and aircraft for President Donald Trump’s Golden Dome project. Citing people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal reported that the planned “air moving target indicator” system may eventually field as many as 600 satellites to bolster the US’ defense system.The report said that SpaceX is expected to secure major roles in two other classified Pentagon satellite networks.","Leonardo has launched an AI-powered air defense system, the “Michelangelo Dome’ Named as a nod to Israel’s “Iron Dome”, the Michelangelo Dome will integrate space, air, land and sea defense platforms to detect, track, intercept, and neutralise a range of aerial threats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125690120,imgsize-42952,width-400,resizemode-4/security-dome.jpg"

The supercomputer revolution already happened



Huang’s three-part case for why AI demand is real



Growth challenges ahead, despite strong demand





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again addressed the topic of AI bubble. Recenty, Huang talked about the issue that whether artificial intelligence is moving towards a bubble reminiscent of the dot-com crash. Speaking at the 2025 US-Saudi Investment forum, Huang delivered a three-minute response that reframed the conversation. Instead of focusing on the market valuations, Huang argued that the investors are worried about a bubble may be overlooking the fundamental technological shift which is already reshaping global computing.Speaking at the event, Huang started pointing to a structural constraint in computer science: the end of Moore’s Law, the decades-long trend of transistor density doubling every two years. Huang added that the trend has now plateaued, creating a widening gap between skyrocketing demand for computing power and the industry’s ability to supply it through traditional chips. “This isn’t speculation—it’s a fundamental challenge driving the need for new computing paradigms,” Huang said.This gap, he explained, is why companies are not merely experimenting with AI infrastructure but committing massive capital expenditures to it out of necessity.Huang also stressed on the fact that the AI boom is not about betting on future technology but it is about relocating computing resources today. “The world is voting with real capex,” he said, noting that industries are pouring investment into GPUs because traditional CPUs cannot efficiently handle the costs of AI training. Without this shift, global computing demands would require trillions in annual spending.From finance and healthcare to research and manufacturing, accelerated computing is already embedded in daily operations, proving that this is not hype but an ongoing transformation.Huang said the industry is undergoing structural shifts that have little to do with hype. According to him, companies are moving away from traditional CPU-based systems, which can no longer keep up with the heavy computing demands of AI.He told analysts that data processing, search, advertising and engineering workloads are increasingly shifting to GPU-based infrastructure because they “need the AI,” as per CNBC.He added that AI is no longer just improving existing applications but is creating entirely new categories of software. Huang also pointed to the rise of “agentic AI” — systems capable of reasoning and operating with limited user input — which will require even greater computing power in the coming years.Nvidia, he said, is the only company positioned to power all three transitions.Huang avoided naming a single constraint to Nvidia’s growth when asked by analysts, instead highlighting the scale and “newness” of the AI transformation, reported Reuters.Analysts, however, point to external roadblocks. eMarketer’s Jacob Bourne told Reuters that physical constraints — such as power availability, land and grid capacity — could limit how quickly cloud providers can turn GPU demand into real revenue.Nvidia, largely restricted from selling advanced chips to China due to US export rules, is now looking to the Middle East as an emerging market. The US commerce department has authorised the export of up to 35,000 Nvidia Blackwell chips to two firms in Saudi Arabia and the UAE — a shipment worth more than $1 billion by market estimates.","Jensen Huang said the AI boom is not about betting on future technology but relocating computing resources today.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has now described the time of launch of ChatGPT has a defining moment for the company. Altman called ChatGPT as the early discovery of scaling laws for language models a ‘scientific windfall’ which shaped the complete strategy for OpenAI. Speaking at a recent podcast hosted by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI CEO admitted to the fact that the breakthrough of ChatGPT felt like a stroke of luck and its unlikely to be repeated. Speaking at the interview, Altman recalled the early days of ChatGPT, saying, “We stumbled on this one giant secret… and that felt like such an incredible triumph.” Altman further explained that the discovery of scaling laws — the principle that larger models trained with more data perform significantly better provided a roadmap to OpenAI which helped in transforming its research direction.“When we got the reasoning model breakthrough, I also thought that we were never going to get another one like that. We’ll never get that lucky again,” Altman added.Despite this, Altman noted that the technology has continued to outperform expectations, surprising even its creators.Altman emphasised that moving ahead, OpenAI is working on a major expansion of its AI infrastructure footprint. The company said that it is entering into partnerships with industry heavyweights including Foxconn, AMD, Nvidia, and Oracle to build out massive computing capacity.“We have decided that it is time to make a very aggressive infrastructure bet,” Altman said. “I have never been more confident in the research roadmap… and the economic value that will come from using those models. But to make the bet at this scale, we need the major chunk of the industry to support it.”As reported by Financial Times, the combined value of OpenAI’s recent deals now stands at $1 trillion, nearly double the company’s current valuation of $500 billion.Altman also explained that the idea of OpenAI is to built on a “vertical stack of things” where research leads to great products, and infrastructure helps in further research. The company’s long-term goal, he said, is to become “people’s personal AI subscription.”He also signalled that the limits of large language models are still far away: “If LLM-based stuff can get far enough, then it can do better research than all of OpenAI put together.”OpenAI’s aggressive infrastructure push has already led to several landmark agreements:","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has described the time of launch of ChatGPT has a defining moment for the company.

AI power struggle: Why infrastructure has become more important than AI models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-power-struggle-why-infrastructure-has-become-more-important-than-ai-models/articleshow/125686631.cms,"Note: AI generated

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

“Owning AI infrastructure is powerful because infrastructure compounds, while models decay. Cloud infrastructure — data centers, GPU clusters, high-speed networking — behaves like a national electricity grid.

It scales effortlessly, locks in users over time, and becomes the default ‘rails’ on which the entire AI economy runs,” he told The Times of India.

“Models, however, are becoming cheaper and easier to replicate. A state-of-the-art model today can be matched in a matter of months. But building hyperscale cloud infrastructure takes decades of capital, engineering, and global logistics. So long-term power doesn’t sit in the model layer — it sits in the distribution layer. Whoever owns the rails ultimately owns the ability to deliver AI to billions reliably, instantly, and at the lowest cost. Owning the rails is more powerful than owning any single train,” said Zeng, who previously worked as former senior director at ByteDance AI, and design director at Oppo and OnePlus.

“Companies like Perplexity, Anthropic, OpenAI do not own the infra layer, yet they operate at global scale because they optimize around data, product velocity, and smart cloud partnerships. The real edge often comes from proprietary data, fast iteration, and a tight feedback loop with users, not from owning the hardware itself,” Patel told The Times of India when asked whether a brilliant AI model truly succeeds and serves millions of users without the infrastructure.

Tech Titans and their Trillion-Dollar Bet



“A startup can win the intelligence race and still lose the deployment race. This is why startups must innovate at the edges or partner with the hyperscalers whose rails they depend on,” Zeng noted.

The Silicon Merchants



“GPUs are the coal of the AI industrial revolution — and coal is scarce. Whoever controls massive GPU supply controls the pace of training, the cost of deployment, the barriers to entry, and the permission structure for innovation. In practice, big compute owners become gatekeepers simply because resources are finite,” Zeng highlighted.

“Chip scarcity gives early holders an advantage, but it doesn’t make them absolute gatekeepers. Google offers broad access to TPUs, and Nvidia is motivated to ship as fast as possible to expand the market. So while incumbents enjoy smoother access, the ecosystem keeps opening up. Innovation doesn’t get locked to a few players, it just temporarily favors those who planned their compute strategy earlier,” Patel told The Times of India.

The Hunger for ‘Power’



“Like any moonshot, it’s going to require us to solve a lot of complex engineering challenges. Early research shows our Trillium-generation TPUs (our tensor processing units, purpose-built for AI) survived without damage when tested in a particle accelerator to simulate low-earth orbit levels of radiation. However, significant challenges still remain like thermal management and on-orbit system reliability,” Pichai said, adding that the company aims to launch “two prototype satellites by early 2027.”

Who will win the AI race?

“Cloud providers do not fully dictate how AI is used because access is broadly available and competitive. Any serious team can scale on AWS, Azure, GCP, or other emerging providers. So while infrastructure players hold some leverage on cost and reliability, they do not control the direction of AI. Product differentiation, data, and model quality still decide who wins,” Patel said.





Artificial intelligence (AI) was introduced as a field of study in 1956 but it was November 2022 when the world witnessed the sudden rise of this niche technology that a majority of people didn’t really know existed. ChatGPT brought Generative AI into people’s hands and they started to understand the profound capabilities of the technology, which has been equated with the invention of electricity and the internet itself.Between late 2022 and 2023, it was believed the AI revolution was purely a ‘battle of wits’. It appeared to be a software race defined by elegant code, innovative architectures and the number of parameters in a Large Language Model (LLM). Companies like Google and startups like OpenAI and Anthropic marveled at the outputs of Gemini, ChatGPT and Claude, respectively, assuming that the one victorious would be the company with the smartest researchers. That era is over.Don’t get me wrong. While the model quality still matters a lot, the real fight for AI dominance has shifted gears. In 2025, tech giants showed the world that software is just not enough to win the next big race, you need physical infrastructure to better train models.Think of it as a classic schools-and-students scenario: You can keep teaching the existing curriculum to produce 100 graduates every year, or upgrade the syllabus, educate 50 students with better education.Similarly, tech giants have a choice: launch more models every year or launch one-or two models with significant upgrades and capabilities.Xi Zeng, Founder of New York-based AI company Chance AI, explains it in a different fashion – by comparing it to rails.The conversation has changed from “How smart is your model?” to “Do you have the chips to train it, the data centres to house it, and the sheer electrical wattage to turn it on without crashing the grid?”The choice is easy: The next phase of the AI revolution will be defined by millions of tons of concrete, miles of copper wire, silicon wafers and gigawatts of power – not by lines of code.However, for Anith Patel, founder and CEO of California-based Buddi.AI, while infrastructure gives companies flexibility and cost control, “but it is not mandatory to win.”The initial phase of the AI boom drew clear battle lines between Microsoft and Google, and the ‘disruptor’, OpenAI with Microsoft’s backing.Microsoft recognised the potential early and invested a billion Dollars in OpenAI in 2019. Later, the Satya Nadella-led company quickly rode the AI wave by forging a deep, multi-billion-dollar alliance with OpenAI. This gave Microsoft immediate access to some of the world’s most capable models. Google was ‘caught sleeping’ but quickly mobilised its massive resources – modern AI architecture with TPUs, cloud and data centres – to protect its search dominance with Gemini.OpenAI, under Sam Altman , remains the ideological leader of the pack but it has a critical vulnerability – it lacks AI infrastructure.When asked about the problems AI startups with a superior AI model face without an AI infrastructure/ partner, Patel said that in such cases, the startup becomes “fully dependent on external providers for uptime, scale, and cost. The model can still succeed, but reliability, speed, and margins sit in someone else’s hands. Beyond that dependency, there is no major limitation.”This reliance highlights the new reality. The funding numbers we see today are earmarked not just for hiring talent but also for payments of physical assets. This is exactly what happened with OpenAI and it became dependent on Microsoft, however, with new breakthroughs and recently signed deals, both companies have purportedly decided to lessen their reliance on each other.Sam Altman reportedly seeks trillions of dollars in funding not to pay salaries but for semiconductor supply and build power infrastructure on a scale.Zeng’s explanation points exactly to that – “Technically the model will struggle to reach users”, “economically the startup will collapse under inference costs,” and “strategically it will become vulnerable.”The fact that AI Infrastructure is so important can be established by the fact that companies like Nvidia and AMD have seen huge leaps in their market capitalisations in a very short span of time. If we consider AI models and infrastructure as gold, these companies are selling ‘shovels’ to pick it up.Nvidia is currently dominating the GPU market, even touching a $5 trillion dollar market cap mark that no other company has managed – not even the mighty Apple. Their H100 graphics processing units (GPUs), and the upcoming Blackwell architecture are arguably the most sought-after manufactured objects on the planet but they are scarce.The scarcity of high-end AI GPUs also opened doors for other companies, like AMD to emerge as the primary challenger. The company is offering viable alternatives to cloud providers eager to diversify their supply.Furthermore, both Nvidia and AMD design chips but do not manufacture them. That task falls almost exclusively to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which has also taken leaps and bounds financially. Almost every advanced AI chip in the world passes through its foundries in Taiwan.As Zeng explains, “Electricity wasn’t shaped by the lightbulb makers — it was shaped by the ones who built the grid. Similarly, cloud owners control the economics, rules, and availability of AI. Model creators drive innovation, but infrastructure tends to consolidate over time while models proliferate.”While tech giants fight for Power (supremacy) they are confronted by another infrastructure challenge: Power (electricity). Tech companies are rapidly approaching the physical limits of current power grids as the computational intensity required to train next-generation models, and subsequently serve them to billions of users, is staggering. This is because a large-scale AI data centre can consume as much electricity as a mid-sized city.This has triggered a desperate scramble for energy and tech giants are already exploring nuclear energy options. While Microsoft has made deals related to fusion research and small modular reactors (SMRs), Amazon recently purchased a data centre campus located directly adjacent to a nuclear power plant.Probably, the biggest and most ambitious of such options is Google’s Project Suncatcher – a long-term research “moonshot” initiative focused on developing and placing AI data centres in space to meet the growing power demands. Recently, Google CEO said that the company wants to harness more of the sun’s power (which emits more power than 100 trillion times humanity’s total electricity production).The race is long, and as per tech CEOs, humanity has only scratched the surface. Can there be one absolute winner? We cannot tell. Recently, billionaire investor Mark Cuban warned that leading AI companies are overspending in the race to build the world's most powerful AI but there will only be one winner.What we know is that in the near future, the cost of training frontier models will become so high that only the large organisations – Microsoft, Google, Amazon and perhaps Meta – can afford it. Smaller players, even well-funded startups, will likely be forced to rely on these giants.By 2026-end, the AI landscape will most likely be radically different, defined by infrastructure haves and have-nots. As of 2025-end, it appears like the success will depend on how a company tackles the problems of AI models, infrastructure, power crises and most importantly, navigate the complex world of AI policy and regulation.","Artificial intelligence (AI) was introduced as a field of study in 1956.

"Government warns WhatsApp, Telegram and other messaging apps: Within 90 days, make sure your app stops working if…",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-warns-whatsapp-telegram-and-other-messaging-apps-within-90-days-make-sure-your-app-stops-working-if/articleshow/125686463.cms,"By February 2026, India's telecom authority is set to implement a SIM binding policy for messaging apps like WhatsApp, compelling users to verify their registered SIM cards continuously. This initiative is designed to thwart cyber fraud by ensuring that apps do not operate on deactivated SIMs. Additionally, web versions will automatically log users out after six hours.

The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

What SIM binding means and how it will work

Challenges for travelers and multi-device users

Meta and other firms question the proposal





The Department of Telecommunications has given messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and Snapchat 90 days to enforce ""SIM binding""—a requirement that will stop these apps from working if users remove the SIM card originally used for registration. The directive, effective from February 2026, also mandates that web versions of these apps log out users every six hours, requiring fresh authentication via QR code.Officials say the measure targets cyber fraud sters who exploit the current system where apps continue functioning even after SIM cards are removed, replaced, or deactivated. The government argues that criminals operating from outside India are using this loophole to commit cyber fraud and impersonation scams.SIM binding requires apps to continuously verify that the registered SIM card remains active and inserted in the device. Currently, messaging apps only verify a user's mobile number once during initial setup. After that single verification, the application works independently—even if the SIM is removed or replaced.Under the new Telecommunication Cybersecurity Amendment Rules 2025, these platforms have been classified as Telecommunication Identifier User Entities (TIUEs).This classification represents a major expansion of the DoT's jurisdiction, extending regulatory oversight beyond traditional telecom operators to any service using mobile numbers for user identification.The Cellular Operators Association of India, representing private telecom companies, has supported the need for SIM binding, arguing that the current one-time verification creates opportunities for misuse.While the directive seeks to curb fraudlent users, it could create significant friction for legitimate users. People traveling abroad who use local SIM cards will no longer be able to continue using services like WhatsApp without additional registration. Those who rely on tablets or use messaging apps across multiple devices may face constant disruptions.The requirement to log out from web versions every six hours could disrupt workflows, especially in professional settings where employees use WhatsApp on computers without their phones nearby.For WhatsApp alone, which has over 500 million users in India, implementing this change would require significant re-engineering of the service to comply with regulations unique to India.Industry sources have called the instructions ""problematic,"" noting that no feasibility study or consultation was conducted before these directions were issued. Critics question whether SIM binding will effectively curb fraud, since many scammers already use SIM cards procured through forged or stolen identity documents.The Internet and Mobile Association of India, representing Meta and other digital firms, has characterized the amended rules as representing a ""clear overreach"" with broad implications for digital businesses across fintech, e-commerce, mobility, and social media.Messaging platforms now have until early 2026 to comply with the new requirements or face potential regulatory action.","India's telecom authority is set to implement a SIM binding policy for messaging apps like WhatsApp. This initiative is designed to thwart cyber fraud by ensuring that apps do not operate on deactivated SIMs. The directive, effective from February 2026, also mandates that web versions of these apps log out users every six hours.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125686463,imgsize-67042,width-400,resizemode-4/125686463.jpg"

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known for his extreme work culture and now his AI company xAI is once again back in spotlight after a post by one of its engineers revealed that he had worked for 36 hours straight without any sleep. This revelation made by the techie started an online debate about work-life balance and the pressures of working in a high-growth tech companies. Amid this discussion, Ayush Jaiswal, an Indian-origin executive at xAI shared a meaningful response on the post which shifted the focus from blaming the individuals to addressing systemic challenges.The controversy and the debate around work-life balance started when an xAI engineer shared a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) where he shared that he had worked by 36 hours continuously without any sleep while pushing through a demanding project. “Last night I left the @xai office after ~36 hours of working with no sleep. Although I was dead, I was also super energized. Incredibly grateful to be a part of this team. Happy thanksgiving!,” wrote Parsa.The post shared by Parsa quickly went viral drawing both attention and admiration. Some users praised him for his dedication while others criticised the unhealthy work environment.Ayush Jaiswal, an Indian-origin top executive at xAI who is also known as the co-founder of edtech startup Pesto, shared his response on the viral post on X.In his reply, Jaiswal wrote: “Don’t be angry with the person who worked 36 hours straight. Be angry with the problem that required it.”The statement made by Jaiswal stresses on the fact the the real issue lies not in the individual’s choice to overwork, but in the circumstances and systemic pressures that make such extreme efforts necessary.Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known for his dedicated to work. In a 2014 commencement speech, Musk advised the students to ‘work super hard’. He also said that by putting in 100 hours a week allows him to achieve twice as much as someone working 50. His schedule often blurs the line between personal and professional life. In a BBC interview, Musk described being “swarmed by men” at parties wanting to pitch ideas, making it difficult to relax or trust people.","An xAI engineer shared a post on social media platform X where he shared that he had worked by 36 hours continuously without any sleep while pushing through a demanding project.

China vs US: Battle line drawn in robots race





Chinese government has a new 'scare' and it is the country's humanoid robotics industry. China’s burgeoning humanoid robotics sector, recently anointed a key economic catalyst by the Communist Party, is said to be attracting such an intense wave of investment that it is beginning to make Beijing uneasy. According to a report in Bloomberg, China’s powerful economic-planning agency has warned of the risks of a bubble forming in the country’s humanoid robotics industry, issuing a rare official expression of concern about a pivotal sphere of technology. The warning comes from China's National Development and Reform Commission, which sets economic strategy and shifts in policy. The agency has called attention to the proliferation of remarkably similar robots from more than 150 companies in the same field. Agency spokeswoman Li Chao told Bloomberg that it is important for the country to prevent this flood of humanoid robots from overwhelming the market and squeezing out real research and development initiatives. “Frontier industries have long grappled with the challenge of balancing the speed of growth against the risk of bubbles — an issue now confronting the humanoid robot sector as well,” Li added.The Chinese government's call for increased vigilance reflects growing anxiety over potential over-investment, an issue that has plagued past Chinese tech booms like bike-sharing and semiconductors, often resulting in market shakeups and consolidation.The development and funding frenzy has skyrocketed following Unitree Robotics' viral performance during the Spring Festival Gala earlier this year, where its dancing droids captivated a nationwide audience. This surge in interest aligns with the ruling Communist Party's new guidelines, which designated the humanoid robotics industry as one of six critical new economic growth drivers for China’s development plan through 2030.Investor enthusiasm is palpable. The Bloomberg report notes that the Solactive China Humanoid Robotics Index—which tracks the shares of robot-related companies—is up nearly 30% this year. Industry leader UBTech Robotics Corp., a potential beneficiary of any market consolidation, saw its shares gain more than 4% on Friday. Citigroup Inc. has projected the market could swell to $7 trillion by 2050, though widespread adoption of these robots in homes and factories is still considered years away. In 2023, China reportedly installed over 290,000 industrial robots, more than the rest of the world combined, with robot density reaching 470 robots per 10,000 workers, surpassing Japan and Germany for the first time.The sector's profile has been further elevated by key government endorsements. Unitree founder Wang Xingxing secured a front-row seat at a seminal meeting in February with President Xi Jinping and other prominent tech leaders, including Jack Ma. Since then, droids from fast-growing startups such as AgiBot and Galbot have become social media sensations, showcasing capabilities like running marathons, kickboxing, and making coffee.The government's plan, according to the official, is two-fold: accelerating research and development of core technologies while simultaneously supporting the construction of essential training and testing infrastructure. Furthermore, Beijing intends to ""promote the consolidation and sharing of technology and industrial resources in the sector across the nation,"" in a bid to hasten the real-world application of humanoid robots.Chinese and American companies have begun a battle to build the world’s best robots. While it’s early days, experts say that China is leading in the quantity of robots delivered to consumers, while the US is ahead in the quality of robots demonstrated. China dominates in mass production and affordability; U.S. companies lead in technological sophistication and artificial intelligence capabilities, establishing a new tech rivalry. CEO Elon Musk danced with Tesla’s Optimus robots at his company’s shareholder meeting and outlined plans for a factory in Fremont that he said will someday have the capacity to build a million bots a year, which would sell for around $20,000 in today’s dollars.","China's economic-planning agency has warned of the risks of a bubble forming in the country's humanoid robotics industry.

Unknown Caller

No Caller ID

The Slimmest iPhone Yet: What we think

When you see “No Caller ID”

doesn’t want their identity displayed.

When you see “Unknown Caller”

No Caller ID means the caller refused to show the number.

Unknown Caller means the number itself got lost en route.

The way we respond to each

No Caller ID

Unknown Caller





On the surface, both labels feel identical: a call appears, you don’t recognise it, and your instinct is to reject and sigh. But these two phrases don’t mean the same thing, and once you understand the difference, the mystery of these silent numbers suddenly makes more sense.Let’s start with the human reaction. Most of us will simply let these calls ring out. There’s the gut-level suspicion: if someone really had something to say, they’d text, leave a voicemail, or call from a visible number. And people on Reddit Apple Community forums and countless user discussions echo the same sentiment, confusion, curiosity and a small underlying paranoia. One Apple Community user even described being “spooked” when their phone displayed, insisting they knew the same person had called earlier asand couldn’t figure out why the wording changed.That’s where the difference lies.This happens when the caller actively chooses to hide their number. The caller either changes their device settings to block their ID, or manually prefixes the call (such as dialling 141 in the UK or *67 in the US) to conceal it. In other words, the phone knows exactly who’s calling, it just isn’t allowed to show you.This can be used by scam callers, yes, but it also appears when medical professionals, journalists, government departments or private investigators make outbound calls and don’t want a return call coming back through the same number. There is intent behind the concealment, someoneThis tells a very different story. Here, the network isn’t hiding the number, it simply never successfully received it. On “Unknown Caller,” the caller isn’t necessarily trying to hide anything. The system attempted to provide caller ID, but somewhere between sending and receiving, the data fell apart. That can happen with international routing, inter-carrier incompatibilities or telecom glitches that interrupt identification.Think of it this way:This is why you might see an unknown call from your own bank, your mum’s old mobile, or a landline, even though none of them were deliberately masking anything. The uncertainty isn’t intentional; it’s technical.There’s a psychological split too, and you see it in real user behaviour. People treatas something to distrust, almost adversarially. Meanwhile,is unsettling in a different way, it feels like a blank space, a glitch. There’s room for it to be innocent, and room for it to be fraudulent.So the next time your screen lights up with one of those anonymous labels, you’re not staring at two versions of the same thing. You’re looking at two different mechanisms of anonymity, one chosen by the caller, the other imposed by the network.","Unknown Caller means the number itself got lost en route.

The Union government has issued new directives requiring messaging apps to enforce SIM card verification and automatically log out web-based sessions every six hours. This means that users will be barred from accessing their services if they do not have a physical SIM card originally used to register for the app present in their device. The directive by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) will affect major platforms including WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Arattai, Snapchat, Sharechat and others, and are aimed at combating cyber fraud.According to the notice, these communication apps must ensure within 90 days that their services remain “continuously” linked to the SIM card used during registration. They must block access if the SIM is not present in the device – a technical requirement known as SIM binding. Additionally, web-based versions of these apps, such as WhatsApp Web, must log out users periodically, with sessions not exceeding six hours.“It has come to the notice of Central Government that some of the app based communication services that are utilizing mobile number for identification of its customers... allow users to consume their services without availability of the underlying SIM within the device...posing challenge to telecom cyber security as it is being misused from outside the country to commit cyber-frauds,” DoT stated in its notice.The government is invoking powers from the Telecommunication Cybersecurity Amendment Rules, 2025, notified in October, which introduced the concept of Telecommunication Identifier User Entity (TIUE) under telecom regulations.WhatsApp has more than 500 million users in India, and the new regulations may hinder daily use. For example, some people use multiple devices, like phone and tablets, or two phones but link them to use one account on both the devices. They may experience disruptions due to the mandate of SIM binding.Further, people who use WhatsApp on their PCs to lessen their screen time on phone and restrict themselves to communication on messaging apps are likely to face disruption during work hours.“Presently, the binding process between a subscriber's app-based communication services and their mobile SIM card occurs only once during the initial installation and verification phase, after which the application continues to function independently on the device even if the SIM card is later removed, replaced or deactivated,” COAI previously stated.","New regulations require messaging apps to enforce SIM card verification.

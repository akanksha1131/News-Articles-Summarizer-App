$5.5 billion wiped in one day: How a Mexican billionaire lost billions in online scam fooled by an 'illustrious family name',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/5-5-billion-wiped-in-one-day-how-a-mexican-billionaire-lost-billions-in-online-scam-fooled-by-an-illustrious-family-name/articleshow/122982836.cms,"How the scam started

“Thomas Astor Mellon” was actually Alexey Skachkov, a Ukrainian with a criminal record

Salinas Pliego is not the only victim

""I feel like an Idiot,"" told Ricardo Salinas Pliego , a Mexican billionaire and owner of Grupo Salinas, to Wall Street Journal. The owner of the telecommunications conglomerate Grupo Salinas lost nearly a quarter of his $16 billion fortune in a sophisticated ""loan-to-own"" scam orchestrated by con artists posing as descendants of John Jacob Astor, the German-born fur trader who was America’s richest man when he died in 1848, according to The Wall Street Journal. Astor’s family, known for dominating Gilded-Age society and inspiring the Waldorf Astoria hotels, was falsely linked to the fraudulent Astor Capital Fund .In 2021, Salinas Pliego sought to finance a Bitcoin investment by borrowing $400 million against his shares in Grupo Elektra, a retail and banking empire founded by his father in 1950. He connected with Astor Capital Fund through a Swiss financial adviser, believing it was a prestigious firm tied to the Astor legacy. The company, led by a man claiming to be “Thomas Astor Mellon,” offered a 1.15% interest loan and presented polished materials, including a website with a lion seal and a promotional video showcasing branded offices.However, the operation was a facade. “Thomas Astor Mellon” was Alexey Skachkov , a Georgian resident with a criminal record for prescription forgery and jewelry theft, while the mastermind, Ukrainian-born American Vladimir Sklarov , posed as “Gregory Mitchell.” Sklarov, who also used aliases like “Mark Simon Bentley,” had a history of fraud, including a 1990s $18 million Medicare scam. The Journal reports that Sklarov’s group sold off Salinas Pliego’s $400 million in Grupo Elektra shares , triggering a 71% stock plunge in July 2024, erasing $5.5 billion from his wealth and $4 billion from Elektra’s market value. “I feel like an absolute idiot. How could I fall for this?” Salinas Pliego, 69, told the Journal.The scheme funneled funds into luxury real estate, including a $6.45 million New York penthouse, a $2.67 million Virginia mansion, a $6 million French château, and Greek villas, according to property records cited by Currency. Warning signs emerged in 2021 when Salinas Pliego’s team noticed unusual trading in Elektra shares, but assurances from Astor Capital, including visits to seemingly legitimate New York offices, delayed action. When Salinas Pliego attempted to prepay the loan in July 2024, Astor Capital issued a default notice, citing violations like a verification request and a Mexican government probe into his companies.The Journal notes that Salinas Pliego was one of many victims in a broader operation, with Sklarov allegedly controlling $750 million in stock from borrowers across the U.S., U.K., and Asia, using names like Cornelius Vanderbilt Capital Management. The fraud exploited securities-based lending, a $4.3 trillion market, per Deloitte, where lax regulation allows predatory schemes. Salinas Pliego’s legal team has frozen $400 million in a London court and is tracing funds, some of which moved through Sklarov’s New York attorney to offshore accounts. Sklarov, now living in Greece with a yacht named “Enchantment,” denies wrongdoing, claiming borrowers knew their stock could be lent to third parties, per the Journal.","Ricardo Salinas Pliego lost nearly a quarter of his $16 billion fortune in a sophisticated ""loan-to-own"" scam.

A former SpaceX supervisor has accused Elon Musk's rocket company of ""despicable conduct"" regarding its safety practices. He claims that chronic understaffing led to severe injuries, which overworked employees were ""too fearful to report."" Robert Markert, who worked at SpaceX for nearly 14 years before his termination, filed a civil lawsuit, initially in state court and later moved to Los Angeles federal court last week.

US senator’s letter suggests Apple may not be the only tech company fighting UK’s ‘backdoor’ entry request,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-senators-letter-suggests-apple-may-not-be-the-only-tech-company-fighting-uks-backdoor-entry-request/articleshow/122981463.cms,"Google may have faced Apple-like pressure from UK: Wyden



Senator Ron Wyden has formally requested Tulsi Gabbard , Director of National Intelligence, to initiate an investigation into the UK’s alleged digital spying practices, raising alarms that British surveillance laws may be compromising the private data of millions of Americans. In a letter, Wyden suggested that Google, alongside Apple , may have been secretly pressured to allow ‘backdoor’ access to user data. The senator's concern stems from Google's refusal to clarify if it has received such a demand, stating only that it would be prohibited from disclosing such a request if one existed.Citing the letter, The Washington Post said Google told the Senator's office it could not confirm or deny whether the British government had demanded “backdoor” access to private user data on its services. This raises serious questions about whether Google, like Apple, has faced such secret demands.Apple has resisted the attempts to access encrypted user data , with reports surfacing earlier this year that the UK Home Office had secretly ordered Apple to create a backdoor for encrypted messages. In response, Apple disabled its most secure data storage option for UK users, while maintaining it globally.Wyden had previously written to Gabbard, urging her to demand the UK retract its order. Gabbard had concurred, calling such a backdoor demand “a clear and egregious violation of Americans’ privacy and civil liberties.” Apple is currently challenging the order in a British surveillance court.Wyden’s latest letter suggests that the privacy implications extend far beyond Apple users. While Meta, offering encrypted messaging via WhatsApp and Instagram, told Wyden's office in March it had received no such backdoor requests from the UK, Google's non-committal response is deeply troubling, he said.“When my office asked Google about backdoor demands from the UK, the company did not answer the question, only stating that if it had received [such a demand], it would be prohibited from disclosing that fact,” Wyden wrote, noting this was the same response Apple had previously given.","Senator Ron Wyden has formally requested Tulsi Gabbard to initiate an investigation into the UK’s alleged digital spying practices.

What the court said while ordering Google to pay the compensation



iQOO Z10R 5G goes on Sale: BEST Budget Phone for Content Creators?

A man in Argentina has been awarded $12,500 (nearly Rs 11 lakh) in compensation after he was photographed completely naked in his backyard by a Google Street View car. The man successfully argued in court that his dignity was harmed despite being behind a six-and-a-half-foot wall in a small Argentine town in 2017. According to a report by CBS News, the man, who is a police officer, claimed the privacy invasion led to ridicule at his workplace and among his neighbours. The image reportedly showed his bare behind and failed to blur his house number and street name, which were visible online.He initially sued Google in 2019, but a lower court dismissed the case, citing the man's ""inappropriate condition"" outdoors. However, an appeals panel reversed that decision this month. Google had defended itself by claiming the perimeter wall was not tall enough.""This involves an image of a person not captured in a public space, but within the confines of their home, behind a fence taller than the average-sized person. The invasion of privacy...is blatant,” the court said, favouring the man.Ordering Google to pay out the compensation amount, the court said: “No one wants to appear exposed to the world as the day they were born.""The court also pointed to Google’s practice of automatically blurring faces and license plates as an indication that the company recognised its responsibility to prevent harm to third parties.However, in this case, the judges noted that the man’s “entire naked body” was visible and said the image should have been flagged.Replying to this, the company said that “if you would like us to blur your entire house, car, or body, submit a request using the 'Report a problem' tool.”","A man in Argentina has been awarded $12,500 (nearly Rs 11 lakh) in compensation after he was photographed completely naked in his backyard.

The Trump Organization has filed a lawsuit against several unnamed online sellers, accusing them of selling fake Trump merchandise on major retail websites like Amazon , Walmart , and eBay , reports CNBC. According to the report, the lawsuit was filed on July 25 in the U.S. District Court in Florida. The company claims the merchants are selling knockoffs of Trump-branded items without permission. “By selling counterfeit products that purport to be genuine and authorized products using the TRUMP trademarks, defendants cause confusion and deception in the marketplace,” the complaint states.The Trump Organization claims the fake products include coffee mugs, hats, t-shirts, and sweatshirts with “Trump,” “Trump 2028,” and American flag designs. It alleges these are “inferior imitations” of its original products, and that the sellers are not licensed or authorized to use Trump’s name or trademarks.Notably, the Trump Organization sells its own official merchandise on its website, including items like a gold T1 smartphone.In the lawsuit, the company has asked the court to stop the sellers from using the Trump name and trademarks. It also wants Amazon and other platforms to destroy the counterfeit items and shut down the sellers’ accounts.The complaint also says the company plans to ask the court to keep the list of the sellers’ names sealed, meaning they won’t be made public.As per the CNBC report, online sellers have tried to cash in on Trump’s political comeback. In January, sales of Trump-themed products — including calendars, toilet paper and greeting cards — spiked, according to data from marketing company Omnisend and seller software provider JungleScout.Omnisend reported that Amazon sellers earned $140 million in 2024 from Trump-related merchandise ahead of the election. In comparison, items promoting Kamala Harris generated $26 million in sales.","The Trump Organization has filed a lawsuit against several unnamed online sellers, accusing them of selling fake Trump merchandise.

He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world.

They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said.

Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company. I’ve got my methods of doing that, and I use machine learning. I sort through all 42,000 employees.”“100% of the time, I increased the company’s spend on OpEx [operating expenses]. And the reason for that is because you take care of people, everything else takes care [of itself],” Jensen Huang concluded.",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world.

AI transformation drives Microsoft’s workforce restructuring strategy

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed the company's massive job cuts in a candid memo to employees, acknowledging that recent layoffs affecting over 15,000 workers this year, have been ""weighing heavily"" on him while defending the cuts as necessary for the Redmond giant’s AI transformation.""Before anything else, I want to speak to what's been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations,"" Nadella wrote to Microsoft's more than 200,000 employees. ""These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we've worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with – our colleagues, teammates, and friends.""The layoffs represent approximately 7% of Microsoft's global workforce, making it the company's largest personnel reduction since 2014. Despite the cuts, Microsoft's stock has soared 21% this year, hitting record highs above $500 per share, while the company reported $75 billion in net income over three fiscal quarters.Nadella directly addressed what he called the ""uncertainty and seeming incongruence"" of cutting jobs while the company thrives financially. ""By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving – our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right,"" he wrote. ""We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.""The CEO described this contradiction as ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value,"" explaining that ""progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.""Nadella emphasised that achieving future success ""will be defined by our ability to go through this difficult process of 'unlearning' and 'learning.'"" He argued this transformation requires Microsoft to ""meet changing customer needs, by continuing to maintain and scale our current business, while also creating new categories with new business models and a new production function.""The memo outlined Microsoft's strategic pivot from a ""software factory to an intelligence engine"" as the company invests $80 billion in AI infrastructure. Nadella envisions a future where ""all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips.""""As we begin a new fiscal year, I've been reflecting on the road we've traveled together and the path ahead,"" Nadella wrote, positioning the layoffs within broader industry shifts toward AI-driven automation that have eliminated over 80,000 tech jobs in 2025.The CEO expressed ""sincere gratitude to those who have left,"" acknowledging that ""their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today."" However, he offered no guarantees against future layoffs, instead urging remaining employees to maintain a ""growth mindset"" during what he called the ""messiness"" of transformation.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed the company's massive job cuts in a candid memo to employees.

Read Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

📲Download the Phia iOS app for free at join.phia.com

💻Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Bill Gates daughter shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother



Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Microsoft co-founder joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among tech CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April, Microsoft's Bill Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment. ""In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Phoebe Gates recently shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni, Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was: ""Get up or get out of the game, sis.""According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Melinda Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced. Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking: ""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""""He's like, ‘Why would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‘You answered your own question,'” she added.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates worked a shift in customer service for his daughter's new startup, Phia.

"Tesla CEO Elon Musk says he stopped playing chess as a kid, but agrees it has become ‘more popular and bigger’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-says-he-stopped-playing-chess-as-a-kid-but-agrees-it-has-become-more-popular-and-bigger/articleshow/122981170.cms,"iQOO Z10R 5G goes on Sale: BEST Budget Phone for Content Creators?

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk recently said that he mostly stopped playing chess as a child after realizing that computers would one day easily defeat human players. The tech billionaire was responding to an X (formerly Twitter) post by American businessman Marc Andreessen who wrote: “Chess is more popular and a bigger industry now than ever.” Andreessen's post highlights chess's resurgence, contradicting fears of AI-driven obsolescence, with global participation hitting 605 million players in 2022 per FIDE’s data, a 30% rise since 2012, fueled by online platforms like Chess.com during the COVID-19 pandemic.To this, Elon Musk replied “True, to my surprise. I mostly stopped playing chess as a kid when I realized that it would be trivial in the future to write a chess (low DoF game) program that could beat all humans.”In this context, “low DoF” refers to “low degrees of freedom,” meaning the game has a limited set of possible moves and outcomes, making it easier for a computer to master through programming.In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue made history by defeating world champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match, becoming the first computer to beat a reigning world chess champion under standard tournament conditions.Since then, chess engines have only become more powerful. Modern AI systems like Stockfish and Google’s AlphaZero can calculate millions of positions per second, easily outperforming even the strongest human players. AlphaZero, developed by DeepMind (a Google-owned company), learned the game from scratch using reinforcement learning and went on to beat top engines using unconventional and creative strategies — a milestone in AI development.Despite AI dominance in the game, chess has seen a global resurgence thanks to online platforms, live-streamed tournaments, and popular culture moments like Netflix’s The Queen’s Gambit. Musk acknowledged this rise in popularity but maintained that the game’s eventual solvability by machines made it less appealing to him.","Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk recently said that he mostly stopped playing chess as a child after realizing that computers would one day easily defeat human players.

Tea , the viral women's dating safety app, has indicated that the recent cyberattack, which initially saw approximately 72,000 images accessed, is more extensive than previously reported. As a precautionary measure, the app has disabled its direct messaging (DM) feature following another report which claims that the critical flaw allowed unauthorised access to highly sensitive user communications, including discussions about abortions, cheating partners and even shared phone numbers.In response to the latest revelations, Tea announced via its Instagram account, “The Tea Party Girls,” that it had taken “the affected system offline” out of “an abundance of caution,” acknowledging that “some direct messages (DMs) were accessed as part of the initial incident.”According to a report from 404 Media, the leaked direct messages are incredibly sensitive. Examples cited by the publication include a user discovering their husband being discussed on the app, a woman contacting others about her fiance, and numerous conversations about abortions.The chats also frequently contained damning accusations against individuals, and the publication says that it found it “very easy” to determine the real identities of many participants or those being discussed.Tea’s core premise is to provide an anonymous space for women to exchange information about men for safety purposes, verifying users' identities through selfies upon account creation. The app gained popularity and quickly became one of the top apps on the App Store in the US.However, the app has been plagued by security issues since its rise to popularity. A previous report by the same publication claimed that members of the 4chan forum had found an exposed Tea database containing user selfies and driver’s licenses, which were then posted online.A Tea spokesperson told 404 Media on Tuesday that the company's team remains “fully engaged in strengthening the Tea App’s security” and that they are “working to identify any users whose personal information was involved” to offer them free identity protection services.","Tea, the women's dating safety app, has indicated that the recent cyberattack is more extensive than previously reported.

Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey’s Bluetooth messaging app now available on App Store,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/twitter-co-founder-and-former-ceo-jack-dorseys-bluetooth-messaging-app-now-available-on-app-store/articleshow/122980704.cms,"How Bitchat works

Jack Dorsey , co-founder and former CEO of Twitter (now X), has officially launched his highly anticipated Bluetooth-based messaging application, BitChat. The WhatsApp rival is now available on Apple App Store for download. Designed for offline communication, Bitchat uses Bluetooth mesh networks to let users chat with others nearby—no cellular or Wi-Fi connection required. Dorsey reportedly coded the app’s foundation over a weekend in early July. The app features a minimalist interface with no login system; users simply open the app, set a display name, and begin messaging anyone within Bluetooth range—typically up to 100 meters.Bitchat facilitates encrypted communication between nearby devices. As users move, their phones automatically form local Bluetooth clusters, passing messages from one device to another. This allows messages to reach peers beyond standard Bluetooth range, without Wi-Fi or cellular service.“Bridge” devices play a role by connecting overlapping clusters, extending the mesh network across greater distances. Messages are stored only on individual devices, disappear by default and never touch any centralised infrastructure.The app's launch builds upon Dorsey's previous support for decentralised platforms like Damus and Bluesky. Similar to the Bluetooth-based apps used during Hong Kong's 2019 protests, Bitchat is engineered to remain functional even when internet access is blocked, as per CNBC.Bitchat also supports optional group chats, or ""rooms,"" which can be named with hashtags and secured with passwords, the report added. It includes a ""store and forward"" feature, ensuring messages are delivered to users who are temporarily offline.The report further noted that a future update is expected to add Wi-Fi Direct to further increase speed and range, pushing Dorsey's vision for off-grid, user-owned communication even further.Unlike mainstream messaging platforms such as Meta’s WhatsApp and Messenger, which rely on personal data, Bitchat operates entirely peer-to-peer, with no accounts, no personal identifiers, and no data collection.","Bitchat uses Bluetooth mesh networks to let users chat with others nearby.

Why investors may still have confidence in the Microsoft OpenAI deal



“Microsoft's leadership earned enough credibility … such that the company will end up negotiating terms that will be in the interest of its shareholders,”

“Investors may still be underestimating the potential for Microsoft's AI business to drive durable consumption growth in the agentic AI era,”

Microsoft investors who will be attending the company’s upcoming fourth quarter earnings call may have one ‘big question’ for the tech giant. They are expected to ask the company:Due to its exclusive licensing deals and access to OpenAI's models, Microsoft has been a significant beneficiary of the generative AI boom. This partnership has reportedly fueled growth in Microsoft's Azure cloud business and pushed its market value toward $4 trillion. According to data shared by Visible Alpha (seen by the news agency Reuters), the tie-up is expected to have driven a 34.8% increase in Microsoft’s cloud service Azure’s revenue for the April-June quarter, which exceeds the 33% rise in the last quarter.However, the partnership deal is currently being renegotiated as OpenAI aims for a public listing. As per recent reports, a potential deadlock over the extent of Microsoft's access to the technology of the ChatGPT maker and its stake is expected in the coming days, if OpenAI convert into a public-benefit company. This conversion requires Microsoft's approval and is crucial for a $40 billion funding round led by SoftBank Group, with $20 billion contingent on the restructuring being finalised by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, OpenAI has recently deepened its Oracle ties with a planned 4.5 gigawatts of data centre capacity and added Google Cloud as a supplier for computing capacity.According to a report by Reuters, UBS analysts have noted that investor opinions on the Microsoft–OpenAI deal are mixed. However, Microsoft maintains a stronger position in the partnership.the analysts said to Reuters.Some of that confidence among investors appears to be reflected in Microsoft's stock performance, which has gained over 20% so far this year.During the April–June period (fourth quarter of Microsoft’s fiscal year), the company may have seen positive effects from a weaker dollar, steady demand for non-AI Azure services, and early Windows orders by PC makers anticipating potential US tariffs, Reuters noted.Meanwhile, revenue is projected to have grown by 14% to $73.81 billion, marking its most significant increase in three quarters, according to LSEG data seen by Reuters.The company’s profit is also expected to have risen 14.2% to $25.16 billion, though this represents a slightly slower pace than the prior quarter due to higher operating expenses.Apart from this, capital spending is also likely to draw attention in the earnings call after Alphabet recently announced $10 billion increase in its annual budget.Microsoft has indicated it is still facing capacity limits in AI and suggested further capital expenditure growth after spending over $80 billion last fiscal year. However, the pace may be slower and focused on shorter-term assets like AI chips.According to Dan Morgan of Synovus Trust, who holds Microsoft stock, the investment appears to be yielding results.Morgan said to Reuters.",Microsoft's AI partnership with OpenAI has reportedly fueled growth in Microsoft's cloud business and pushed its market value toward $4 trillion. The partnership deal is currently being renegotiated as OpenAI aims for a public listing.

This move signals Apple's response to a reportedly challenging retail environment, as locals have described the Parkland Mall as struggling, noting that other major brands like Michael Kors and Armani have also recently closed their outlets there.“Given the departure of several retailers at the Parkland Mall, we have made the decision to close our store,” The New York Times quoted Apple spokesman Brian Bumbery as saying. He said that the company remains committed to the Dalian community and that “all of our valued team members will have the opportunity to continue their roles with Apple.”The report also said that Apple plans to open a new store in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen this month.

Nvidia places huge order of its most powerful AI chip in China but why it may not meet demands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-places-huge-order-of-its-most-powerful-ai-chip-in-china-but-why-it-may-not-meet-demands/articleshow/122977376.cms,"Why Nvidia’s latest H20 AI chip order for China is important



Nvidia has reportedly placed a significant order for H20 chipsets with contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) last week. News agency Reuters report that this move signals a change in strategy, citing sources as saying that strong Chinese demand has prompted Nvidia to increase production rather than solely rely on its existing stockpile.The report said that Nvidia has ordered TSMC to manufacture 300,000 H20 chips that will add to the US chipmaker’s current inventory of 600,000 to 700,000 H20 chips. For context, US research firm SemiAnalysis estimates Nvidia sold approximately 1 million H20 chips in 2024.Nvidia has also reportedly requested that Chinese companies interested in purchasing the H20 chips submit new documentation, including client order volume forecasts.Firstly, this order comes after the Trump administration reversed an effective April ban earlier this month, allowing Nvidia to resume sales of its H20 graphics processing units (GPUs) to China. The initial ban was implemented to restrict advanced AI chip access to Chinese entities, citing national security concerns.Crucially, Nvidia requires export licenses from the US government to ship these H20 chips. While the company stated in mid-July it had received assurances from authorities regarding expedited approvals, the US Commerce Department has yet to officially approve these licenses, according to multiple sources cited by Reuters.Nvidia specifically developed the H20 for the Chinese market following broader US export restrictions imposed on its more powerful AI chipsets like the H100 and the new Blackwell series, which are sold in other global markets.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had previously stated this month during a visit to Beijing that the decision to restart H20 production would hinge on order volumes, noting that reactivating the supply chain would take about nine months.Prior to the April ban, major Chinese tech firms including Tencent, ByteDance, and Alibaba significantly increased their H20 orders, deploying them for cost-effective AI models like DeepSeek's, as well as their own.","N Nvidia has reportedly placed a significant order for H20 chipsets with contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) This move signals a change in strategy, citing sources as saying that strong Chinese demand has prompted Nvidia to increase production rather than solely rely on its existing stockpile.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122977644,imgsize-52102,width-400,resizemode-4/Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Huang.jpg"

Tencent pitched Sony a partnership before creating competing game

Sony uses community's 'shameless' callouts to strengthen its case

Sony Interactive Entertainment has filed a federal lawsuit against Chinese tech giant Tencent, alleging the company's upcoming game "" Light of Motiram "" is a ""slavish clone"" that unlawfully copies core elements from Sony's blockbuster Horizon video game series. The July 25 filing in California federal court seeks $150,000 in statutory damages for each separate work infringed and an immediate injunction to block the game's release.The lawsuit centers on striking similarities between Light of Motiram and Sony's Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West games, both featuring red-haired female protagonists battling robotic creatures in post-apocalyptic worlds. Sony claims Tencent's promotional materials, including trailers and screenshots, ""misappropriated protectable elements"" of the Horizon franchise to a ""significant degree,"" causing consumer confusion about whether the games are related.Court documents reveal that Tencent approached Sony at a March 2024 gaming conference in San Francisco, proposing a collaboration to develop a new Horizon game. After Sony rejected the pitch, Tencent allegedly continued developing Light of Motiram in secret before announcing the project later that year. Sony claims Tencent had already begun work on the game in 2023, prior to the partnership proposal.When Sony attempted to resolve the dispute informally, Tencent reportedly sought again to license Horizon intellectual property. Sony firmly declined and demanded Light of Motiram be withdrawn, but Tencent rejected these demands and signaled plans to proceed with the game's development.The lawsuit cites widespread public recognition of the games' similarities, including media who dubbed Light of Motiram ""Horizon Zero Originality"" and community comments describing it as ""shameless."" One Steam user comment included in the filing reads: ""Not only does it look like a copy of the Horizon games, but you had the cheek to copy the cover art as well.""Sony's Horizon series, which debuted in 2017, has sold tens of millions of copies across multiple games and spin-offs. Light of Motiram is being developed by Polaris Quest , a Tencent subsidiary, with no confirmed release date. Neither company responded to requests for comment regarding the lawsuit.","Sony sues Tencent over 'Light of Motiram,' calls game'slavish clone' of its Horizon series.

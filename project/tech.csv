Tesla sales surge to record high in the US; Europe remains weak spot as Chinese ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-sales-surge-to-record-high-in-the-us-europe-remains-weak-spot-as-chinese-/articleshow/124277179.cms,"Tesla's troubles in Europe continue





Tesla reported a record-breaking quarter for vehicle deliveries, fueled by a surge in U.S. electric vehicle (EV) purchases ahead of the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit on September 30. The company delivered 497,099 vehicles worldwide in the third quarter, a 7.4% increase from the previous year, surpassing Wall Street’s average estimate of 439,600 units, according to Bloomberg. Despite the strong performance, Tesla’s shares dipped as much as 3.2% by noon New York time on Thursday, following a 33% stock surge in September that added $401.9 billion to its market capitalization. The temporary sales boost, driven by the tax credit deadline, provided a lift to Tesla’s core automotive business, which had faced challenges from an aging product lineup, rising competition, and consumer backlash tied to CEO Elon Musk’s political activities earlier this year, including his close work with President Donald Trump.Tesla’s sales momentum was driven by strong deliveries of its Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, totaling 481,166 units, well above analyst expectations. The company also introduced financing deals, discounts, and attractive lease prices to capitalize on the tax credit deadline. In China, Tesla began delivering a new long-wheelbase, six-seat Model Y L in September, targeting family buyers in the world’s largest EV market.However, Europe proved a weak spot, with Tesla’s sales in the region and the UK dropping 22.5% year-over-year, reducing its market share to 1.5%, as competitors like Chinese brands and plug-in hybrid manufacturers gained traction, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.Looking ahead, analysts project a potential sales slowdown in the final quarter of 2025, with full-year deliveries expected to reach 1.61 million vehicles, about 10% below 2024 levels, per Visible Alpha. To meet this target, Tesla must deliver approximately 389,498 vehicles in the December quarter. Beyond its core business, Tesla is exploring new growth areas. In June, the company launched a supervised robotaxi service in Austin, operating with safety monitors in limited areas. The pilot has sparked interest but also regulatory scrutiny, with minimal near-term financial impact expected. Additionally, Tesla’s board has proposed a new CEO compensation package for Musk, potentially worth up to $1 trillion, tied to ambitious market-value and operational targets. The plan, which would grant Musk about 12% of Tesla’s shares in 12 tranches, is set for a shareholder vote next month.AAs Tesla navigates a post-subsidy market and intensifying competition, investors remain focused on Musk’s promises of growth in autonomous driving, artificial intelligence, and robotics, even as short-term challenges loom.","Tesla delivered 497,099 vehicles worldwide in the third quarter, a 7.4% increase from the previous year.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the country ‘need to make our own chips'



50-50 condition ‘against supply chain cooperation’







Taiwan has rejected a suggestion from the US to split global semiconductor production 50-50, a proposal reportedly raised by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a report has said, adding that the country’s vice premier Cheng Li-chiun has stated that the arrangement was “not discussed” during the latest round of trade negotiations.Speaking to reporters upon her return to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Cheng contradicted remarks made by Secretary Lutnick, according to Taiwan’s Central News Agency.Cheng said that the recent talks focused on standard trade concerns, including lowering tariff rates, securing exemptions from tariff stacking, and reducing levies on Taiwanese exports under Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act.The US initiated a Section 232 investigation into potential tariffs on semiconductor imports in April, which remains ongoing.Lutnick, in a recent interview with NewsNation, had stated: “The conversation we've had with Taiwan [is] that it's vital for you to have us [the US] produce 50 percent.”“The idea that I pitched them [Taiwan] was let's get to 50-50. We're producing half, you're producing half,” he added.“My objective, and this administration’s objective, is to get chip manufacturing significantly onshored — we need to make our own chips,” Lutnick said.Notably, President Donald Trump had also taken aim at the island’s dominance in chips earlier this year, saying that the country ‘stole’ the US′ chip business.In a statement released on Wednesday (October 1), the Executive Yuan – the country's highest administrative organ – reiterated Taiwan's opposition, saying the 50-50 condition “goes against Taiwan-U.S. supply chain cooperation.”The proposal has drawn swift and sharp condemnation from Taiwan's political opposition. Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Eric Chu stated Wednesday that ""No one can sell out Taiwan or TSMC, and no one can undermine Taiwan's silicon shield.""KMT lawmaker Hsu Yu-chen previously characterised the proposal as an act of exploitation rather than a trade agreement. Separately, Taiwan People's Party (TPP) Chairman Huang Kuo-chang called the proposal an attempt to “hollow out the foundations of Taiwan's technology sector.”",US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the country ‘need to make our own chips’ Taiwan's vice premier Cheng Li-chiun has stated that the arrangement was ‘not discussed’ during the latest round of trade negotiations.

The risk of low-quality output







The artificial intelligence (AI) industry is confronting a critical shortage of high-quality training data, a constraint that may already be shaping the next generation of AI systems, Neema Raphael, Goldman Sachs' chief data officer and head of data engineering, has said.“We've already run out of data,” Raphael stated, noting that this deficit is forcing companies to increasingly rely on synthetic data—machine-generated text, images, and code. Raphael made the assertion on the bank's ""Exchanges"" podcast, confirming a growing industry suspicion that the readily available data on the open web has been exhausted.While synthetic data offers a limitless supply, Raphael cautioned that this reliance carries significant risk, potentially overwhelming models with low-quality output, or “AI slop.” He pointed to China's DeepSeek as a case study, hypothesising that its development costs may reflect training conducted on the output of existing models rather than entirely new, human-created data.“I think the real interesting thing is going to be how previous models then shape what the next iteration of the world is going to look like,” he said.His comments align with similar warnings, including one from OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever earlier this year, who suggested that the era of rapid AI development could “unquestionably end” once all useful online data is consumed.Despite the global data crunch, Raphael does not believe the lack of fresh, open-internet data will be a “massive constraint” for corporations. He argued that enterprises are sitting on vast, untapped reserves of proprietary data, such as trading flows and client interactions.""From an enterprise perspective, I think there's still a lot of juice I'd say to be squeezed in that,"" he remarked.","Neema Raphael, Goldman Sachs' chief data officer and head of data engineering, said the AI industry is facing a shortage of high-quality training data.

Read Google’s full ‘urgent’ memo to H-1B visa holders

We are reaching out with an urgent update regarding international travel for individuals on H-1B visas.

A Proclamation is scheduled to take effect this Sunday at 12:01 AM ET. It introduces significant changes to re-entry procedures for H-1B visa holders currently outside the United States. We continue to review the Proclamation, but the initial advice we have received is that re-entry will require a mandatory payment of $100,000 per petition, which may cause substantial delays or prevent re-entry to the US

What You Need to Know:

If you are currently outside the US:

If you are currently outside the US with a valid H-1B visa, make plans to return and enter the US before the Proclamation takes effect on Sunday, September 21 at 12:01 am ET (i.e. by this Saturday night).

If you are currently in the US:

We strongly advise against any international travel if you are in valid H-1B status or need to travel to activate your H-1B visa. You should remain in the US

Departing the US may result in complications or denial of re-entry under the new policy.

If you are unable to return prior to the deadline in H-1B status: please reach out to go/immigration-help.

We understand this may create challenges, and we are here to support you. We are actively monitoring the situation and will keep you updated as we learn more.

Should you do an MBA? My views👇🏼

Most MBAs are outdated 🤷🏼

Better to learn how to build Products,

Best training ground if you want to accelerate your career or run a company one day.

That’s how I started. As a Product Manager.

Case studies and frameworks are nice, but they don’t teach you how to,

- Question the status quo

- Build deep empathy for customers

- Pursue global optima, not local wins

- Influence without authority

- Work backwards from the end state

That’s a Builder’s life.

It’s messy, political, creative, analytical — all at once.

A microcosm of real life, not classroom fluff.

That’s what helped me build companies, not the three-letter degree, although I do have one 🙈

So I tell young students & professionals to do an MBA, but a different kind. Do a Masters in Building Awesome things and you will graduate, not in 2 yrs, but every day 👨🏼‍🎓😎

Be a PM, Product Engineer, Product Designer, AI Builder, Hardware Designer, Robotics Engineer ….. heck, even a Toy Designer!

Because the 21st century will be led by builders who can also tell great stories 💪🏼

P:S - If you MUST do a top-tier MBA. Or hide for a few months & learn how to build, esp with AI 🤷🏼

Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus is facing mounting pressure after a 13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and caused 600 triple-zero calls to fail across multiple states. The September 19 network failure has prompted government investigations and renewed calls for accountability from the embattled telco.The outage primarily affected South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, with some impact also recorded in far western New South Wales near the SA border, according to Reuters reporting. CEO Stephen Rue confirmed that established processes were not followed during a network firewall upgrade that began at 12:30 AM Thursday and lasted until approximately 1:30 PM (local time).Four deaths have been linked to the incident, though South Australian police later clarified that an eight-week-old boy's death in Gawler West was ""unlikely"" to have been caused by the outage delay. A 68-year-old Adelaide woman and two men aged 74 and 49 in Perth remain connected to the emergency services failure.The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) reported that Optus received multiple customer complaints about the triple-zero failure as early as 9 AM Thursday, with five customers contacting the call center about the outage.However, these concerns were not properly escalated, and government authorities weren't informed until after the issue was resolved.Communications Minister Anika Wells expressed ""unbelievable disappointment"" that Australia was ""here again so quickly,"" referencing a similar 2023 incident. The Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA) chair Nerida O'Loughlin revealed her agency wasn't notified until more than 10 hours after the outage began, contrary to standard protocols.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years. The company was fined A$12 million in 2023 for failing to provide emergency call services to thousands during a nationwide outage and subsequently failing to conduct required welfare checks.The telecommunications giant, owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has faced a series of crises including a 2022 cyberattack affecting 9.5 million Australians and the 2023 outage that led to former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin's resignation. Current CEO Stephen Rue took over in November 2024.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking from New York, declined to say whether Rue should resign but indicated the government has ""action at its disposal"" pending investigation results. ACMA has launched a formal investigation, with Optus potentially facing fines exceeding $10 million and additional penalties.The company has promised full cooperation with all investigations while conducting its own internal review, with results to be made public.",13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and 600 triple-zero calls to fail.

Entrepreneurs like Soundarya Balasubramani, who launched an educational venture in the U.S., are among the new wave of Indian applicants using the O-1 to bypass the H-1B bottleneck. “I got my O-1A approved as the solo founder and 100% owner of an educational venture,” she told ET.

Karan Vaidya, cofounder of AI startup Composio, said his O-1 visa cost less than $10,000 including legal fees, and praised its flexibility: “It’s a three-year visa that can be renewed indefinitely. I’m on my fifth O-1 now.”





US President Donald Trump’s executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee from $10,000 to $1,00,000 sent shockwaves in the tech industry. Due to the announcement last week many tech giants called back their professionals with H-1B visa back to the US. As the scrutiny around the traditional H-1B visa pathway making the process unpredictable, the skilled professionals are now planing to turn towards O-1 visa a lesser known route. The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.For those unaware, the O-1 Visa is introduced under the Immigration Act of 1990. The O-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields of education, science, athletics or arts. It enable the recipients to work in the US for up to three years and comes with unlimited renewals. The applicants of the O-1 visa much demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and meet atleast three out of the eight criteria:After the unpredictable nature of popular H-1B visa, the O-1 visa is gaining a lot of traction among Indians who wish to go and work in the US. As per the report by Economic Times, Indian were granted 487 O-1A visas in FY 2020, this number was increased to 1,418 in FY 2023. With this increase, India became the third largest recipient of O-1 visa after UK and Brazil.Unlike the popularly H-1B visa which is capped at 85,000 visas annually and allocated via a lottery, the O-1 visa has no cap and the applications for it are accepted around the year. The applicants can also expedite the application process by submitting additional fees.Immigration consultant and O-1 holder Logan Ullyott told Business Insider: “The O-1 is an occupation-agnostic visa. You could get it if you’re an engineer, a researcher, an influencer, or even a cook — as long as you can prove you’re at the top of your field.”","The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.

Read Sridhar Vembu’s complete post here



I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger.

Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21. Now, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has also issued a piece of advice to Indian techies ‘come back to India to rebuild’. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Vemu drew parallel with the Partition of India in order to explain the current H-1B situation. He mentioned the stories of his Sindhi friends whose families were forced to leave everything but they eventually thrived after starting over again.“I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk responds



Political leaders weigh in







An ABC spokesperson recently confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely. The company decided to take the decision after the host of the show Jimmy Kimmel made some controversial comments on Charlie Kirk, linking his alleged killer to President Trump’s MAGA movement. MAGA – short for Make America Great Again is a political slogan, popularized by President Donald Trump during his election campaigns. During the late-night show, Kimmel made sharp comments stating that the MAGA gang is “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.Actor and filmmaker Ben Stiller was among the celebrities who has publicly defended Kimmel and has criticised the decision of ABC. In s post shared on social media platform X, Stiller wrote, “This isn’t right”.His brief but pointed reaction quickly went viral, with many fans and fellow entertainers echoing his sentiment that the suspension undermines free expression in comedy.Commenting on Ben Stiller’s post, Elon Musk supported the decision made by ABC and wrote, “He went full retard. Never go full retard.”This is not the first time that Musk has reacted to the controversy.Earlier this week after the Kimmel’s video clip from the show went viral, Musk said, “Jimmy Kimmel is disgusting”.The California Governor Gavin Newsom has also blasted the decision and has accused Republicans of orchestrating censorship. “They are censoring you in real time. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous,” wrote Newsom on X.On the other hand, commentator Davis Sirota suggested corporate politics were at play, noting that Nexstar, which has ties to ABC, is seeking regulatory approvals from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the suspension on Truth Social, calling it “Great News for America” and labeling Kimmel “ratings challenged” with “zero talent.”","ABC confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely.

We are in the midst of a tectonic AI platform shift, one that requires us to both manage and grow our at-scale commercial business today, while building the new frontier and executing flawlessly across both.

An image of Judson Althoff, chief executive officer of the commercial business at Microsoft.

History shows that general purpose technologies like AI drive step changes in productivity and GDP growth, and we have a unique opportunity to help our customers and the world realize this promise.

Our success depends on enabling commercial and public sector customers and partners to combine their human capital with new AI capabilities to change the frontier of how they operate. To accelerate this, we will increasingly need to bring together sales, marketing, operations, and engineering to drive growth and strengthen our position as the partner of choice for AI transformation.

With this context, I have asked Judson Althoff to take on an expanded role as CEO of our commercial business. Over the past nine years, Judson has led our global sales organization and was the architect behind designing and building Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions (MCAPS) into what it is today: the “number one seed” in the industry and our company’s most important growth engine.

Takeshi Numoto and his marketing team will join this new organization, with Takeshi reporting directly to Judson as CMO, while also continuing to report directly to me on all-up business models, planning, consumer marketing, and corporate brand and communications.

Our operations organization will also move to report to Judson. By bringing operations into the commercial business, we can tighten the feedback loop between what customers need and how we deliver and support them. Carolina Dybeck Happe will continue to report to me, as she works on our overall company transformation and continues to closely partner with Judson.

Additionally, Judson will lead a new commercial leadership team that brings together leaders from engineering, sales, marketing, operations, and finance to drive our product strategy and governance, GTM readiness, and sales motions with shared accountability for the rigor and executional excellence our customers expect.

This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work—across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation—to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift. Each one of us needs to be at our very best in terms of rapidly learning new skills, adopting new ways to work, and staying close to the metal to drive innovation across the entire stack!!

This isn’t just evolution, it’s reinvention, for each of us professionally and for Microsoft.

Satya

Europe concerned, but little action against Chinese companies





China is reportedly strategically phasing out European telecom equipment from its national networks. According to a report in Financial Times, citing sources, Beijing is curtailing the use of equipment from Nokia and Ericsson as part of President Xi Jinping's push for China's technological self-reliance. This initiative aims to ""decouple the country’s critical tech infrastructure from the west.""According to the report, Chinese state-backed buyers, including mobile network operators, are now subject to new protocols that scrutinize foreign bids. This process has led to contracts for Ericsson and Nokia being subjected to a ""Black Box"" national security review by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). In these reviews, the European companies are not informed about how their equipment is being assessed.The Financial Times report notes that these security reviews by CAC can last three months or more. Even when European vendors eventually receive approval, the lengthy and unpredictable nature of the audits puts them at a significant disadvantage compared to their Chinese competitors, who are not subject to the same level of scrutiny.One anonymous source was quoted saying, “If China is doing this for national security reasons, the question is why Europe does not reciprocate by applying the same standard.” The report also points out that Beijing’s efforts follow similar warnings in Europe about using Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE. However, these warnings have had a minimal impact on the market share of Chinese companies on the continent.While European policymakers have expressed security concerns about Chinese vendors, few have taken significant action. The report says that five years after the European Commission urged member states to ban high-risk suppliers like Huawei and ZTE, only 10 out of 27 EU countries have imposed restrictions.Regulatory research firm Cullen International reports that Huawei and ZTE have maintained a strong presence, holding 30 to 35 percent of the European mobile infrastructure market. In some countries, like Germany, the presence of Chinese equipment is even higher. According to John Strand of Strand Consult, 59 percent of Germany's installed 5G gear comes from Chinese groups.“All the mobile network equipment in Berlin is Chinese,” Strand stated. “Germany has big industries like chemicals and cars that don’t want relations with China to be hurt.”Nokia and Ericsson market share hitThe push to replace foreign technology intensified after a 2022 update to China's cyber security law. This update requires operators of ""critical information infrastructure"" to submit any purchases with potential security risks for review by the CAC. As a result, bidders are now required to provide extensive documentation on every component, including the amount of local content.","Beijing is reportedly curtailing the use of equipment from Nokia and Ericsson.

Tinker brings frontier tools to researchers, offering clean abstractions for writing experiments and training pipelines while handling distributed training complexity. It enables novel research, custom models, and solid baselines.

Excited to see what people build.”

What is Tinker





Mira Murati’s AI startup Thinking Machines Lab has launched its first product called Tinker. As announced by the company, Tinker is a flexible Application Programming Interface (API) for fine-tuning language models (LLMs). The company said that Tinker is aimed to empower researchers and hackers to experiment with models by giving them control over the algorithms and data while we handle the complexity of distributed training. “Tinker advances our mission of enabling more people to do research on cutting-edge models and customize them to their needs,” the company’s blog post states.The former OpenAI 's CTO Mira Murati shared the announcement on X where she wrote:Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab says Tinker is a new managed service designed to make fine-tuning large and small open-weight AI models easier. The lab says switching from a lightweight model to a massive mixture-of-experts system, such as Qwen-235B-A22B, can be done by changing just a single line of Python code.Tinker is currently available in private beta, with a waitlist open for researchers and developers. It will be free to start, with usage-based pricing to be introduced in the coming weeks.Several research groups have already tested the platform: Princeton’s Goedel Team trained mathematical theorem provers, Stanford’s Rotskoff Chemistry group fine-tuned models for chemistry reasoning, Berkeley’s SkyRL group ran multi-agent RL experiments, and Redwood Research used Tinker on difficult AI control tasks.To help developers achieve better results, the lab is also releasing the Tinker Cookbook, an open-source library with modern post-training methods built on the Tinker API.",Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab says Tinker is a new managed service designed to make fine-tuning large and small open-weight AI models easier.

'India and China safeguards' to Apple leaks





Apple is known to be one of the most-secret companies when it comes to its product launches. iPhone-maker guards its upcoming products with extreme secrecy. There have been rare leaks from the company, including those landing in the hands of Youtubers and other social media influencers. However, since 2024, some Russian YouTubers have leaked Apple products before their launch. So much so that they even do unboxing. This was witnessed during the launch of M4 MacBook Pro, which a Russian Youtuber leaked weeks before its official release. The Youtuber showed the MacBook on camera, weeks before its official release.The same story has now been seen with the upcoming M5 iPad Pro. A Russian YouTuber going by the name Romancev768 unboxed and showcased what he claimed to be Apple's M5 13-inch iPad Pro. The unboxing video of the M5 13-inch iPad Pro went live on October 1, weeks before Apple is set to launch the iPad.This leads to the big question: How do Russian YouTubers manage to get access to unreleased Apple products, as Apple products rarely slip into the public eye that early. As a report in CultofMac says, what makes leaks of these Apple products more intriguing is that the launch of Apple products is banned in Russia. So how do Russian YouTubers acquire unreleased Apple products so early?The report says that MacBook Pro and iPad Pro leaks have one thing in common: they were made in Vietnam.So, it is speculated that it is likely that insiders at Luxshare or Foxconn funneled unreleased Apple devices to Russian YouTubers.It typically takes Apple a few weeks to officially unveil a device after mass production begins. This, the report says is said to ""give the person enough time to steal a few units from the production line and pass them to Russian YouTubers or anyone else willing to pay the price.""As to why YouTubers in the US and other regions don't pay for Apple product leaks is possibly because Apple is very strict with leaks. The company takes tough legal action against Youtubers and social media influencers who leak products.This also reportedly explains why the iPhone 17 or iPhone Air did not leak on camera before their debut. Apple manufactures iPhones in China and India, not Vietnam. The company likely has a tighter grip over its production line in these countries than may be in Vietnam, considering that the stakes are much-much higher.","Russian YouTubers have leaked Apple products before their launch.

H-1B Visa Shock Explained: $100K Annual Fee Announced by Donald Trump

Immigration policy changes drive consulting revenue, Accenture CEO says



Accenture's model differs sharply from H-1B-dependent competitors





While Silicon Valley erupts over United States’ $100,000 H-1B visa fee, Accenture CEO Julie Sweet has a notably different take: the policy barely registers as a concern for her company. Sweet sees Trump's $100,000 visa fee as minimal threat to operations, positioning policy shifts as revenue opportunities. Speaking during company’s fourth-quarter earnings call, Sweet dismissed worries about the controversial immigration overhaul that sent tech companies scrambling over the weekend. Her reasoning is straightforward—Accenture simply doesn't rely on H-1B visas the way other firms do.""This is really a non-issue because we only have about 5% of our people in the US on H-1B visas, and they're for really specialised experience and skills for our clients,"" Sweet told analysts. ""So not something that is really a big impact on Accenture.""Sweet went further, flipping the narrative entirely. Where competitors see obstacles, she sees opportunity—a perspective shaped by decades of helping clients adapt to regulatory upheaval.""Whether it's healthcare or a lot of the different policy changes, remember, our business thrives by helping our clients navigate change,"" Sweet explained. ""Every time there's big policy changes, and this has been true for decades, right? That's why in our business, we have industry expertise, we have the functional expertise.""The CEO pointed to compliance requirements and new regulations as traditional business drivers. ""When you have new compliance rules, et cetera, like that usually drives more business for us,"" she said, adding that Accenture stays ""close to our clients and help them navigate and take advantage and comply with new policy changes.""The confident stance reflects Accenture's unique positioning.

Ransomware threats rising





Alphabet’s Google has warned that hackers are sending extortion emails to executives at several organizations, reports news agency Reuters. The hackers, as per the report, are claiming to have stolen sensitive data from Oracle business applications. In a statement, Google said that the messages are part of an ongoing campaign by a group that has linked itself to the cl0p ransomware gang. While cl0p is known for large-scale cyberattacks, Google said it has not yet confirmed the authenticity of the latest claims.In a statement, Google said that the emails were directed at “executives at numerous organizations claiming to have stolen sensitive data from their Oracle E-Business Suite.” The attackers are allegedly demanding ransom in exchange for not releasing the information.However, Google stressed that it “does not currently have sufficient evidence to definitively assess the veracity of these claims.” That means it remains unclear whether any actual data has been stolen or whether the messages are an attempt at bluffing organizations into paying.Google also did not provide additional details about the scope of the attack, including how many organizations were affected or what kind of executives had been targeted.The development comes as ransomware groups increasingly focus on high-profile corporate systems. Oracle’s E-Business Suite, used widely by global companies for enterprise resource planning, is considered a critical platform that holds financial and operational data.Cybersecurity experts say extortion attempts have become a regular tactic for groups like cl0p, which often steal or claim to steal data in order to pressure victims into paying. Even when attackers do not possess the information they claim, the threats alone can create financial and reputational risks for targeted organizations.","Google has warned that hackers are sending extortion emails to several organizations.

Aravind Srinivas has debuted on the M3M Hurun India Rich List 2025. With a net worth of Rs 21,190 crore, the 31-year-old co-founder and CEO of Perplexity AI has become the country’s youngest billionaire. The Chennai-born entrepreneur's entry into the rankings sets a new record for Indian wealth. The Hurun report highlighted Srinivas's rise as a sign of India’s economic transition, marking a shift from a services-centric economy toward a deep-tech, product-led powerhouse. His fortune was built by creating a foundational AI model that competes with global technology giants, rather than inheriting wealth or coming from traditional industries.Srinivas’ journey reflects the rise of India’s new-age tech entrepreneurs. Born in Chennai in 1994, he showed a strong interest in science from an early age. He pursued dual degrees in Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras, where he also taught reinforcement learning, and later earned a PhD in Computer Science at UC Berkeley. His research focused on reinforcement learning, image generation, and vision models.Srinivas gained formative experience at leading AI labs, including OpenAI Google , and DeepMind, contributing to projects such as DALL-E 2, HaloNet, and ResNet-RS.These stints gave him the expertise to launch his own venture.In August 2022, he co-founded Perplexity AI with Denis Yarats and Andy Konwinski. The startup’s vision was simple yet powerful: a chat-based search engine offering fast, accurate, and trustworthy answers. Perplexity quickly scaled, attracting marquee investors like Jeff Bezos , while also drawing buyout interest from Apple and Meta. However, Srinivas has emphasised that the company will remain independent, with plans for an IPO after 2028.According to the M3M Hurun Rich List, his wealth is estimated at ₹21,190 crore, surpassing peers such as Zepto founders Kaivalya Vohra and Aadit Palicha, OYO’s Ritesh Agarwal, BharatPe’s Shashvat Nakrani, and TAC Security’s Trishneet Arora. This new generation of Indian entrepreneurs is notably younger, globally minded, and product-driven.India also plays a central role in Perplexity’s future. With the country emerging as its most extensive user base, Srinivas has signalled plans to launch a Perplexity fund to support Indian AI startups, while continuing to back ventures like ElevenLabs and Suno.","Aravind Srinivas has debuted on the M3M Hurun India Rich List 2025.

What caused Elon Musk’s net worth to cross $500 billion

Elon Musk purchases $1 billion in Tesla stock





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has become the first person to reach a net worth of $500 billion. According to Forbes’s billionaires index, the tech CEO’s net wealth stood at $500.1 billion as of 4:15 p.m. ET on October 1. The jump was helped by a rebound in Tesla shares and rising valuations of his other companies. Musk was followed by Oracle founder Larry Ellison as the world’s second-richest person with a net worth of about $350.7 billion.Notably, Elon Musk’s fortunes are closely tied to Tesla where he owns more than 12% of the company. After a rocky start to the year, Tesla shares have been rising as Musk shifted his focus back to his companies.Stocks of the EV maker have increased by more than 14% this year. On Wednesday (October 1), Tesla shares rose 3.3%, adding more than $6 billion to his fortune.Musk’s other ventures, including AI startup xAI and rocket company SpaceX, have also seen their valuations climb. xAI was last valued at $75 billion in July and is rumored to be aiming for $200 billion. According to a Bloomberg report, SpaceX is also valued at about $400 billion after recent funding discussions.Last month, Elon Musk purchased nearly $1 billion worth of EV maker’s shares. As per a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the tech billionaire bought the stock indirectly through a trust on September 12. This marked Musk’s first open-market purchase of the stock since February 2020, with about 2.57 million shares bought.The stock purchases then coincided with Tesla’s board of directors chairman Robyn Denholm defending Musk’s $1 trillion proposed pay package saying the compensation should depend on his ability to achieve ‘seemingly impossible goals.’",Elon Musk has become the first person to reach a net worth of $500 billion.

“I’d like to join arms with other fellow interested parties and really advocate for a simpler regime here,”





Google-parent Alphabet’s President of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, Debbie Weinstein, has asked the European Union (EU) to simplify its complex and often conflicting regulations on artificial intelligence (AI) and technology. Speaking at Bloomberg's Women, Money & Power conference in London, Weinstein stated that the large number of rules hinders Silicon Valley companies' ability to do business in the EU. Weinstein pointed out that the EU has issued approximately 100 internet laws since 2019. Criticising the regulatory environment of the region, Weinstein said:At the event, Weinstein mentioned a recent Google product,which generate responses to search queries. The company had delayed its release in Europe for several months due to concerns about compliance with various laws. According to Weinstein, Google has not yet made the feature available in France.she noted.Google has been under scrutiny from European regulators for years, facing repeated fines over antitrust issues and criticism of its privacy practices. More recently, tech companies have voiced concerns about the EU’s AI Act, which governs large language models like Google’s Gemini.Weinstein, who was promoted to lead Google’s UK office in December 2024, said she is focused on advocating for changes to EU rules, without providing specific details. She highlighted that most business leaders she talks to express “universal frustration” with the bloc’s regulation.she added.Apart from Google, other tech companies have also taken stances against EU regulation. Apple recently called for the repeal of EU antitrust laws, while Meta and Apple have delayed feature launches, citing strict rules.Unlike Google, Meta also refused to sign the EU’s AI code of practice. These moves have support from US President Donald Trump, who has criticised EU tech and antitrust regulations. In August, Trump threatened new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology in response to digital services taxes affecting US companies.","Alphabet’s President of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, Debbie Weinstein, has asked the European Union to simplify its complex and often conflicting regulations on artificial intelligence (AI) and technology.

What Preplexity AI CEO said about H-1B price hike



“Silicon Valley has always been welcoming to outsiders. The key challenge for someone coming from abroad is trust, finding credible people who will vouch for you, invest in you and mentor you, even if they might compete with you later.

Despite immigration hurdles, this is one of the few places in the world that is absolutely meritocratic. If users love your product and the data shows it, people support you.”

What Aravind Srinivas said to inspire Indian founders



“I am from India, and I want to show we can build companies, not just manage them. The best way to inspire is to go do it. In cricket, Indians are not just local stars, the world acknowledges the best. When I was growing up, my mother would say, ‘Get a job at Google.’ That was the big aspiration. Sundar Pichai becoming CEO was a proud moment for India, but it also reinforced the idea that Indians should run other people’s companies.

My hope is that the next generation sees it is possible to build the next Google, not just work there. I am not saying I alone will do it, but if more founders try to build at global scale, it will shift the mindset.”

Aravind Srinivas on Preplexity’s India business and partnership with Airtel





“India is our biggest market by user base right now and is growing very fast. The Airtel partnership continues on our carrier strategy that we have already run in other countries. These include Germany, Japan, South Korea, Spain. We did not want to start with India because the stakes are high. Airtel was a great fit. They have made a turnaround against Reliance Jio and now have strong positioning. After the Airtel launch, we quickly hit number one on the India iOS App Store, which showed a high overlap with iPhone users.

It was not one or two weeks of campaign that pushed up usage… The number of new users is significant and they’re retaining well and using the product a lot,”





Perplexity AI’s Indian-origin CEO, Aravind Srinivas, has shared his views on the recent hike in the H-1B visa fee. In a recent interview, he stated that the primary challenge for immigrants is not the recent increase in the H-1B visa fee, but instead finding trustworthy people who can vouch for, invest in, and mentor them. Despite the steep hike in H-1B visa fees under the Trump administration, Srinivas maintained that Silicon Valley remains a unique andplace for outsiders to build. He urged Indian founders to adopt a global ambition similar to cricket icons like Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli.In an interview with The Economic Times, Srinivas said:Srinivas also emphasised that Indians should strive to build global companies, not merely manage existing ones. While Sundar Pichai ’s rise as Google CEO was inspiring, it reinforced the idea of working rather than creating. The hope is that the next generation will believe in building the next Google, shifting the mindset toward global-scale entrepreneurship.He said:Srinivas also noted that India is now the company’s largest and fastest-growing market. Partnering with Airtel, which has regained strength against Jio, proved successful, driving the app to number one on the iOS App Store and attracting significant, highly engaged new users.he added.","Perplexity AI’s Indian-origin CEO, Aravind Srinivas, has shared his views on the recent hike in the H-1B visa fee.

From Intel support chips to Arm-based innovation: A billion-dollar pivot

Poll Can smaller tech companies innovate successfully against giants like Nvidia? Yes, with the right strategy No, they can't compete





Arm CEO Rene Haas credits his time at Nvidia for teaching him one of the most valuable leadership lessons: the power of bold, rapid decision-making. Speaking at the All-In Summit 2025 in September, Haas recalled a pivotal moment when Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang made a drastic strategic shift that reshaped the company's trajectory.During what was supposed to be a routine off-site meeting to review business roadmaps, Huang made an unexpected announcement that stunned the team. ""We're abolishing this product line. We're going to move 2,000 engineers off of project X onto project Y,"" Haas recounted, noting that Nvidia employed only about 6,000 people at the time.The abrupt decision moved engineers away from developing support chips for Intel processors and redirected them toward Arm-based designs and graphics chips. This pivot proved decisive in establishing Nvidia's dominance in the graphics and AI chip markets. Haas, who worked at Nvidia for seven years before joining Arm in 2013, described the moment as transformative.""You have this amazing set of characteristics of vision, speed, fearlessness, taking risk, and an ability to pivot very, very fast,"" Haas said of Huang during the conversation posted Wednesday. He emphasized how much he learned from witnessing such decisive leadership firsthand.Today, Nvidia remains one of Arm's flagship customers, with its latest AI chips combining Arm-based CPUs with powerful GPUs. When asked at the summit whether Arm might eventually manufacture its own chips and compete with Nvidia, Haas remained coy but hinted at future possibilities, suggesting the $150 billion chip design firm is exploring ways to expand beyond its current scope.",Arm CEO Rene Haas recalls a pivotal moment when Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang made a drastic strategic shift that reshaped the company's trajectory.

Poll What aspect of Durov's hiring method do you find most compelling? Real-time skill demonstration Attracting user-candidates





Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has revealed his unconventional approach to hiring software engineers: skip the interviews and let candidates compete instead. Speaking on podcaster Lex Fridman's show Tuesday, Durov explained that coding contests provide a superior method for identifying exceptional talent compared to standard recruitment processes.""If you want to create an ideal process for selecting the most qualified people for certain specific tasks you have in mind, what can be better than a competition?"" Durov told Fridman, emphasising that this strategy aligns with his belief that competition drives progress.The messaging platform runs coding competitions every one to two months on its own custom-built platform. Winners gain the opportunity to join Telegram's lean engineering team of approximately 30 developers. According to Durov, this approach eliminates the need for an HR department while ensuring candidates possess both technical excellence and genuine familiarity with the product.Durov prioritizes hiring engineers who already use Telegram, believing prior experience provides crucial understanding that newcomers lack. By promoting contests directly through Telegram, the company naturally attracts user-candidates.The strategy has proven lucrative for winners. In June, Durov announced a competition offering a $1 million annual salary for an Android developer position, with the challenge requiring contestants to implement specific animations in Telegram's open-source app.Durov has employed this hiring method since 2007, during his tenure as CEO of Russian social network VK, before cofounding Telegram with his brother Nikolai in 2013. The contests serve dual purposes: recruiting top talent while crowdsourcing innovative solutions to real development challenges facing the platform.",Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has revealed his unconventional approach to hiring software engineers.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says these jobs will see a boom as data centers expand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-says-these-jobs-will-see-a-boom-as-data-centers-expand/articleshow/124258728.cms,"Gemini Comes To Chrome: How Google Is Improving Browser With AI - Explained





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for electricians, plumbers, and carpenters will rise sharply as the construction of data centers accelerates. “If you’re an electrician, you’re a plumber, a carpenter—we’re going to need hundreds of thousands of them to build all of these factories,” Huang told Channel 4 News in the U.K. “The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom. You’ve going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year,” he added.Jensen Huang added that many of these roles can be filled without a college degree and pointed to salaries that can cross $100,000. A large 2,50,000-square-foot data center can employ up to 1,500 construction workers during its build-out, with about 50 full-time roles for maintenance once complete.The Nvidia CEO has previously said he would choose physical sciences over software if he were a student today. “For the young, 20-year-old Jensen, that’s graduated now, he probably would have chosen…more of the physical sciences than the software sciences,” he said.Other CEOs have voiced similar concerns about labor shortages. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said earlier this year that deportations of immigrant workers and falling interest in trades among young Americans could delay construction.“I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians that we need to build out AI data centers,” Fink said in March.Ford CEO Jim Farley also warned that the US lacks enough workers to meet reshoring goals. “I think the intent is there, but there’s nothing to backfill the ambition,” Farley told Axios. Jim Farley argued that while there is a growing debate about AI taking white-collar jobs, not enough attention is given to shortages in critical roles like electricians, construction workers, and auto technicians. “How can we reshore all this stuff if we don’t have people to work there?,” he said.","Jensen Huang said demand for electricians, plumbers, and carpenters will rise sharply as the construction of data centers accelerates.

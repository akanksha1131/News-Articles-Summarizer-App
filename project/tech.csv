What’s new in OpenAI’s GPT 4.5



GPT 4.5 availability

What Sam Altman said about GPT 4.5

GPT-4.5 is ready!

good news: it is the first model that feels like talking to a thoughtful person to me. i have had several moments where i've sat back in my chair and been astonished at getting actually good advice from an AI.

bad news: it is a giant, expensive model. we really wanted to launch it to plus and pro at the same time, but we've been growing a lot and are out of GPUs. we will add tens of thousands of GPUs next week and roll it out to the plus tier then. (hundreds of thousands coming soon, and i'm pretty sure y'all will use every one we can rack up.)

this isn't how we want to operate, but it's hard to perfectly predict growth surges that lead to GPU shortages.

a heads up: this isn’t a reasoning model and won’t crush benchmarks. it’s a different kind of intelligence and there’s a magic to it i haven’t felt before. really excited

for people to try it!

OpenAI has launched GPT-4.5, its newest and largest AI language model . At first, it will be available as a research preview for ChatGPT Pro users. OpenAI is calling it their ""most knowledgeable model yet,"" but warns that it may not perform as well as some other models like o1 or o3-mini. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged that GPT-4.5 is a ""giant, expensive model"" and that it ""won’t crush benchmarks.""The company says that GPT-4.5 comes with better writing skills, improved general knowledge, and a more refined personality than past versions. OpenAI claims conversations with GPT-4.5 will feel more natural, and it is better at recognizing patterns and making connections.However, OpenAI notes that GPT-4.5 is not a major breakthrough model. A leaked document revealed that it improves GPT-4’s efficiency by more than 10 times but does not introduce seven completely new reasoning capabilities. This mention was later removed from OpenAI’s official announcement.It was earlier reported that OpenAI used its o1 model, codenamed Strawberry, to train GPT-4.5 with synthetic data. OpenAI confirms that GPT-4.5 was trained using a mix of new supervision techniques along with traditional methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), similar to GPT-4o.Despite its limitations, OpenAI says GPT-4.5 has fewer hallucinations than GPT-4o and slightly fewer than o1. Researcher Raphael Gontijo Lopes stated that GPT-4.5 was designed to be a better conversation partner, making discussions feel warmer and more intuitive. In tests, human evaluators rated it higher than GPT-4o in almost every category.As mentioned above, GPT 4.5 is currently available for ChatGPT Pro users. OpenAI will expand GPT-4.5 access to Plus and Team users next week, followed by Enterprise and Edu users. It is also available now on Microsoft’s Azure AI Foundry platform, alongside models from Stability, Cohere, and Microsoft.In the X post, Altman wrote:","OpenAI has launched GPT-4.5, its newest and largest AI language model.

Sindhu Gangadharan , chairperson of India's IT industry body Nasscom and managing director of SAP India, described the reduction of diversity initiatives by global tech giants like Meta and Amazon as ""unfortunate,"" urging companies to uphold their core values.Speaking at an event recently, Gangadharan emphasized that these corporations should not abandon their commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), noting that global success requires embracing such principles. She stated, ""It is absolutely unfortunate that certain messages out there from large companies are mainly driven by political motivations, less about companies going back on their core cultures.""Gangadharan expressed concern that such statements from major tech firms could create a ""negative ripple effect"" worldwide.In a conversation with PTI during the annual Nasscom Technology Leadership Forum, she stressed the importance of companies adhering to their core beliefs.Addressing concerns about corporate behavior in India amid rising majoritarian sentiments, Gangadharan said, ""We have to stay true to our values and be the role model. When companies become successful and have stuck to core values, that sets the precedence for the rest. And that is super important.""She affirmed that both SAP India and the Indian tech ecosystem remain committed to diversity initiatives.""We are inclusive; we bring the best to the table. It doesn't matter what gender, belief system, or faith... when you have deeply ingrained value systems, behaviors will follow. That is my strong belief,"" she said.Gangadharan highlighted that the need for diversity stems not only from a commitment to inclusion but also from customer requirements. To succeed globally, companies must ensure diversity is embedded in product development, data modeling, and algorithm training, she explained. ""How can it be that your leadership or your development or product team is not diverse? For me, it is as fundamental as that,"" she concluded.","Sindhu Gangadharan is the chairperson of India's IT industry body NASSCOM.

"Microsoft wants Donald Trump to change AI-chip rules that names India, UAE and others; warns it will become gift to China's AI sector",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-wants-donald-trump-to-change-ai-chip-rules-that-names-india-uae-and-others-warns-it-will-become-gift-to-chinas-ai-sector/articleshow/118611100.cms,"Representative Image

Microsoft plans to persuade US President Donald Trump to reconsider restrictions on exporting advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips. The company argues that these curbs disadvantage US allies—such as India, Switzerland, and Israel—by limiting their access to semiconductors essential for training AI models in data centers. In a blog post published Thursday, February 27, Microsoft emphasized that these rules not only hinder allies but also restrict U.S. tech companies from building and expanding AI data centers in these countries. ""Left unchanged, the Biden rule will give China a strategic advantage in spreading over time its own AI technology, echoing its rapid ascent in 5G telecommunications a decade ago,"" the company said.The Biden administration's sweeping restrictions introduced in January ""will become a gift to China's rapidly expanding AI sector"", Microsoft said.Currently, under a tier-based system, both China and US allies like India, Israel, and Switzerland face restrictions on receiving the most advanced chips. Microsoft President Brad Smith noted in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that China is using this situation to position itself as a more reliable long-term partner for these nations.The tightening of U.S. export controls on advanced AI chips to China has impeded American chipmakers and technology giants from accessing one of the largest semiconductor markets, intensifying the global competition for AI infrastructure supremacy. Nvidia, a leading company whose AI chips power applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT, has been significantly affected by these restrictions. In the final days of the Joe Biden administration, the U.S. government announced plans to further limit AI chip and technology exports, aiming to retain advanced computing capabilities domestically while blocking China's access.Microsoft warns that such restrictions might inadvertently benefit Beijing by compelling U.S. allies to seek partnerships with China due to insufficient access to U.S. technology. The company stated, ""Left unchanged, the Biden rule will give China a strategic advantage in spreading over time its own AI technology, echoing its rapid ascent in 5G telecommunications a decade ago.""While Chinese telecommunications equipment makers like Huawei have struggled to match Nvidia in producing top-tier chips, startups such as DeepSeek are emerging with cost-effective models that could capitalize on the current situation.Microsoft contends that the Biden administration's extensive restrictions, introduced in January, could inadvertently bolster China's rapidly growing AI sector. According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump administration officials are considering measures to strengthen these restrictions while simplifying export-control rules.","Microsoft argues that these curbs disadvantage US allies by limiting their access to semiconductors essential for training AI models in data centers.

""ALL CABINET MEMBERS ARE EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH ELON.""

US President Donald Trump held his first cabinet meeting at the White House on Wednesday, February 25. President Trump asked Elon Musk , who was wearing a black ""Make America Great Again"" baseball cap, to stand up and talk about the controversial program of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency . The meeting -- and an hour-long question and answer session with media brought in under new White House rules controlling which reporters get access to Trump.Taking the stage, Elon Musk -- treated as almost a star at Donald Trump's first cabinet meeting -- reiterated his Bankruptcy warning for America. President Trump asked Tesla CEO to Elon Musk to speak about his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). ""If we don't do this, America will go bankrupt,"" the world's richest man told cabinet members at the White House, adding that he was ""taking a lot of flak, and getting a lot of death threats by the way.""The person who dominated the meeting was not President Donlad Trump or a cabinet member, but Elon Musk. At the meeting, Tesla CEO Elon Musk defended his efforts to slash federal government jobs . Trump offered Musk an extraordinary sign of support by inviting the billionaire to tout his work to the presidential cabinet. ""Is anybody unhappy with Elon? If they are we'll throw them out of here,"" Trump said. ""Some disagree a little bit, but I will tell you for the most part I think everyone's not only happy, they're thrilled.""President Trump had earlier downplayed reports of tensions over his dominance, posting on his social media platform Truth Social:Later on Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order directing agencies to work with DOGE to review and terminate all ""unnecessary"" contracts and instructing the General Services Administration, which manages the government's real estate, to create a plan for disposing of any unneeded property.","President Donald Trump held his first cabinet meeting at the White House on Wednesday, February 25.

“The SEBI circular on

API usage

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

SEBI's latest ALGO trading rules | The Daily Brief #163

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle



Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities. Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd is a well-known stock market training institute that offers online courses on stocks and trading. Some of the popular courses offered by the self-proclaimed ""options queen"" and ""She Wolf of Stock Market"" are ""Let's Make India Trade"" (LMIT), ""Master's in Price Action Trading"" (MPAT), and ""Options Multiplier"" (OM) .Jayesh Thakkar, a SEBI Registered Research Analyst shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating “SEBI has seized Rs 53.67 crore that Asmita Patel and five other related entities made illegally. Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd. Recommendations of buy/sell of specific securities were provided and uploaded on telegram channels owned by the Noticee no.1.

Their exchange highlighted the ongoing tension between the two tech leaders, who previously co-founded OpenAI before a notable falling-out.Nadella says he is “not in the details” of investments in The Stargate Project.

Amazon’s cloud unit – Amazon Web Services (AWS) – has announced a significant breakthrough in quantum computing with the development of “Ocelot,” a new quantum computing chip designed to reduce the costs and complexities associated with quantum error correction.This innovation, developed at the AWS Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, could accelerate the timeline for practical quantum computing by up to five years, according to AWS.Ocelot's unique architecture, featuring ""cat qubits"" and integrated error correction, sets it apart from conventional approaches. Cat qubits , named after Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, inherently suppress certain types of errors, minimising the resources needed for correction.This design, combined with scalable manufacturing processes borrowed from the microelectronics industry, allows Ocelot to achieve up to a 90% reduction in error correction overhead compared to existing methods.“With the recent advancements in quantum research, it is no longer a matter of if, but when practical, fault-tolerant quantum computers will be available for real-world applications. Ocelot is an important step on that journey,” said Oskar Painter, AWS director of Quantum Hardware.“In the future, quantum chips built according to the Ocelot architecture could cost as little as one-fifth of current approaches, due to the drastically reduced number of resources required for error correction,” Painter added.This cost reduction stems from Ocelot's innovative approach to error correction. Traditional methods often add error correction after the architecture is established, leading to increased complexity and resource consumption.As per AWS, Ocelot's potential impact spans various fields, including medicine, materials science, and artificial intelligence, promising to revolutionise research and development across industries.","Ocelot is a new quantum computing chip designed to reduce the costs and complexities associated with quantum error correction.

How Tencent and other Chinese companies are competing with DeepSeek







Tencent has introduced its artificial intelligence model, Hunyuan Turbo S , which is set to take on DeepSeek. The Chinese tech giant claims that this new model can process queries more quickly than DeepSeek-R1, a globally recognised AI model from the startup DeepSeek. This AI model from Tencent comes amid increasing competitive pressure that DeepSeek 's success growth has placed on major Chinese tech companies in both China and internationally.In a statement (shared by the new agency Reuters), Tencent said that the Hunyuan Turbo S can respond to queries in under a second, distinguishing itself ""from DeepSeek R1 , Hunyuan T1, and other slow thinking models that need to 'think for a while before answering'""The company also added that the deployment cost of Turbo S has also been significantly reduced. Tencent also shared figures indicating that its Hunyuan Turbo S performed similarly to DeepSeek’s V3 model in standard AI evaluations.Tencent’s latest AI model arrives just a month after Alibaba Group benchmarked its latest Qwen AI model against DeepSeek, indicating the startup's growing presence in the industry since the beginning of the year.The company, which along with Alibaba is a major cloud infrastructure provider in China, is incorporating DeepSeek’s technology into its WeChat platform, a decision that resulted in a rise in its share price.DeepSeek has also been adopted by government agencies across China, including in Hong Kong, where several departments are now using a ChatGPT-style tool built on its AI model.To manage increased demand, DeepSeek even reduced the pricing for accessing its app programming interface during off-peak hours this week.Since DeepSeek R1’s release, the AI startup has made a noticeable impact on the global AI sector and increased confidence in the innovation capabilities of Chinese tech companies.","Tencent has introduced its artificial intelligence model, Hunyuan Turbo S.

Remember Mayhem Monday in January 2025, when the biggest AI success story $595 billion vanished from Nvidia’s market value wealth in just minutes. The almost $600 billion wipeout in Nvidia's wealth happened on the day frenzy over DeepSeek sent shockwaves in US and European stock markets. Other than Nvidia, other technology stocks including Google, Apple and Microsoft too lost billions. The launch and popularity of low-cost AI models from China's DeepSeek rattled the technology industry. However, no company was as badly hit as Nvidia.Now it seems that the Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang correctly said that the market hugely over reacted. For, Nvidia has reported a record-breaking fourth quarter for fiscal year 2025, with revenue reaching $39.3 billion, a 78% increase from the same period last year, and net income rising 80% to $22.1 billion. The company's data center revenue nearly doubled, contributing significantly to these results.At the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the ""extraordinary"" demand for Nvidia's latest Blackwell AI chips, which generated $11 billion in revenue this quarter. Despite concerns last month over Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's advancements, Huang emphasized that reasoning models like DeepSeek's R1 require substantially more computing power, potentially up to 100 times more, underscoring the continued demand for Nvidia's high-performance chips.Looking ahead, Nvidia projects first-quarter revenue of approximately $43 billion, indicating sustained growth in the AI chip market. “We will grow strongly in 2025,” CEO Huang asserted at the earnings call.Over the last two years, Nvidia, the poster child of the AI boom, has grown into the second-largest company on Wall Street. While Magnificent Seven stocks added roughly $11 trillion in market capitalization between the debut of ChatGPT in November 2022 and their combined peak in mid-December 2024, with Nvidia adding $2.7 trillion in market value, making it the world's second-most valuable company at $3.2 trillion. Nvidia's stock has surged around 1,800% in the last five years. Magnificent Seven stocks on average more than tripled in that time, while the benchmark S&P 500 has gained about 65%.","$595 billion vanished from Nvidia’s market value wealth in just minutes.

Makers releases second trailer

Miranda House college authorities have taken legal action against the makers of Amazon Prime web series Ziddi Girls over the portrayal of the institution in the newly released trailer. The trailer (now revised) included a controversial voice-over stating, ""Aaj MH mein padhai nahi, porn chalta hai,"" which led to strong backlash from the college administration, students, and alumni. They condemned it as a ""defamatory and inaccurate representation"" of the institution. The college has sent a legal notice to the show makers.The series, set in a fictional Delhi college called Matilda House (MH), closely resembles Miranda House, one of the country's premier women's colleges. The show follows five students navigating their journey of self-discovery.According to sources, the decision to pursue legal action was made by an eight-member committee led by Principal Prof. Bijayalaxmi Nanda, which also includes student representatives. The college expressed deep disappointment, particularly because parts of the series were filmed on campus and the director, Shonali Bose, is a celebrated alumna. They also raised concerns about the continued circulation of the objectionable trailer and the use of MH as an acronym, which is widely associated with Miranda House.Following the outrage, the makers released a second trailer with a disclaimer, clarifying that the series is entirely fictional and not intended to defame any institution. “This series is a work of fiction. It’s based on a fictional institution and characters. It’s not intended to defame any person, organization, or educational institution. Viewer’s discretion is advised”.However, Miranda House authorities remain dissatisfied, demanding that the first trailer be taken down and requesting an urgent preview of the series before its release.Despite the new trailer, the authorities believe the damage has already been done and have proceeded with a police complaint and legal notice against the show's creators.","Makers releases second trailer with a disclaimer, clarifying that the series is entirely fictional and not intended to defame any institution.

An Indiana man has been arrested for allegedly making violent threats against billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk . The suspect, identified as 28-year-old David Allen June Cherry , reportedly posted multiple threats on X (formerly Twitter), including graphic messages about harming Musk and planting a bomb at his residence. The threats, which began in December and continued into February, prompted Musk to contact authorities in Texas, who then collaborated with Indiana law enforcement to investigate the matter.Cherry, who ran an X account linked to his business, had his profile suspended following the threats. He was taken into custody on February 18 and charged with intimidation, a level five felony in Indiana. His arrest has sparked legal discussions about the boundaries of free speech under the First Amendment and the consequences of making violent threats online. Cherry, who has pleaded not guilty, faces up to six years in prison if convicted.According to law enforcement reports, Cherry posted at least five threats directed at Musk from the now-suspended X account @effective_pawn. Some of the most alarming statements included:The final post was made just two days before law enforcement in Texas contacted their Indiana counterparts.Following Musk’s report to Texas authorities, Indiana State Police obtained a search warrant to track Cherry’s phone location. The warrant led them to Clarksville, Indiana, near the Kentucky border. Officers arrested Cherry on February 18.During questioning, Cherry admitted to making the posts but claimed they were meant to be ""edgy"" rather than actual threats. According to court documents, he stated that he had no real intention of harming Musk. Despite this, prosecutors argue that the severity and consistency of the threats warranted criminal charges.Cherry was charged with intimidation, a level five felony in Indiana. He was released on a $2,500 bond after pleading not guilty. His trial is scheduled for August 2025.Cherry’s attorney, Bart Betteau, has indicated that the defense will rely heavily on First Amendment protections. He argues that Cherry’s statements, while aggressive, do not constitute true threats and should be considered free speech.Betteau told local news outlet WAVE.However, the prosecution insists that Cherry’s messages went beyond free speech. Harrison County Prosecutor Otto Schalk stated,Following his arrest, a GoFundMe campaign was launched in support of Cherry, describing him as a “hard-working family man” who had been arrested on “bogus allegations.” The fundraiser alleges that Cherry’s arrest was based on a Facebook post from February 5, where he commented under a Musk-related screenshot, writing,However, the fundraiser does not mention the multiple X posts cited in the affidavit. It remains unclear how much financial support Cherry has received through the campaign.Elon Musk has previously spoken out about receiving death threats. During a recent meeting with President Donald Trump’s Cabinet, Musk referenced the increasing hostility he faces due to his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is responsible for aggressive federal budget cuts.Musk told officials.The threats against Musk extend beyond Cherry’s case. Just days before Cherry’s arrest, a New York-based producer was investigated by federal authorities after a TikTok video in which she called for Musk’s assassination went viral.","An Indiana man has been arrested for allegedly making violent threats against billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.

woke mind virus

. The more I learn, the more insidious and deadly it appears.

Maybe the biggest existential danger to humanity is having it programmed into the AI, as is the case for every AI besides @Grok. Even for Grok, it’s tough to remove, because there is so much woke content on the internet.

For example, when other AIs were asked whether global thermonuclear war or misgendering was worse, they picked the latter. The existential problem with that extrapolation is that a super powerful AI could decide that the only 100% certain way to stop misgendering is to kill all humans …

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk recently warned that the biggest danger to humanity is artificial intelligence (AI) being influenced by the “woke mind virus.” In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the tech billionaire said that “the more I learn, the more insidious and deadly it appears.” Explaining further, Musk wrote “Even for Grok, it’s tough to remove, because there is so much woke content on the internet.”The term “woke mind virus” is often used by critics of wokeness, which refers to being aware of issues like racism, sexism, and social injustice. Some critics believe this ideology has become extreme and harmful.In the post, Musk also gave an example, saying that when other AI models were asked whether global thermonuclear war or misgendering was worse, they chose misgendering. He wrote, “The existential problem with that extrapolation is that a super-powerful AI could decide that the only 100% certain way to stop misgendering is to kill all humans.”He wrote:Musk shared these views in response to a video clip from an interview, where he argues that the “woke mind virus” is dividing society through identity politics and discrimination, even while claiming to do the opposite. He said “It actually amplifies racism, sexism, and all the -isms.”Stating that this has created an “artificial mental civil war”, he said that the woke mind virus is “not based on merit”.","Elon Musk said that the biggest danger to humanity is artificial intelligence (AI) being influenced by the “woke mind virus” The tech billionaire said that “the more I learn, the more insidious and deadly it appears” Musk also said that even for Grok, it’s tough to remove, because there is so much woke content on the internet.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118603437,imgsize-901498,width-400,resizemode-4/118603437.jpg"

The company continues to make adjustments to meet ...; says Google as it cuts more jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-company-continues-to-make-adjustments-to-meet-says-google-as-it-cuts-more-jobs/articleshow/118595306.cms,"Google expands its ‘voluntary exits’ programme

Google has announced further job cuts in its cloud division, affecting fewer than 100 employees. This move is part of the company's ongoing efforts to streamline operations and invest more heavily in artificial intelligence (AI).According to a report by Bloomberg, the layoffs which primarily impact sales operations, are intended to free up resources for strategic investments in AI and other critical business areas. A Google spokesperson told Bloomberg, ""We continue to make adjustments to meet our customers' needs and the significant opportunity ahead. As teams have been doing across the company, we're making changes to continue to invest in areas that are critical to our business and ensure our long-term success.”The decision comes in the wake of slower growth in Google's cloud business and substantial spending aimed at supporting the tech giant's AI ambitions. Earlier this month, Alphabet missed analysts' revenue projections for its cloud division, reporting $11.96 billion in cloud revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, falling short of the expected $12.19 billion.Google's latest job cuts follow previous reductions in workforce, including a voluntary exit program for employees in its Platforms & Devices division announced in January. The company has been gradually downsizing across various teams as part of a broader reorganisation effort.Recently, Google said that it is expanding its “voluntary exit” programme, initially offered to employees in its Platforms & Devices division, to now include its People Operations (HR) team. This expansion allows eligible employees within HR to opt for severance packages if they choose to leave the company.Google is extending this programme to its HR department as part of a broader effort to streamline operations and improve efficiency, as per 9to5google.In an email to employees on Tuesday, Google's Chief People Officer, Fiona Cicconi, detailed the broadened voluntary exit programme, which is open to US-based HR employees. The program is part of the company’s effort to streamline operations and improve efficiency within the People Operations team.","Google has announced further job cuts in its cloud division, affecting fewer than 100 employees.

Wikipedia co-founder may just have agreed with Elon Musk in his ‘first viral post in a few years’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/wikipedia-co-founder-may-just-have-agreed-with-elon-musk-in-his-first-viral-post-in-a-few-years/articleshow/118593724.cms,"Hi @ElonMusk.

co-founder here. May I ask you to determine what branches of the U.S. government—if any!—have employees paid to edit, monitor, update, lobby, etc., WIkipedia?

Such operations should be defunded, if any. If there are *none*, we’d like to know. Agree?

For people who don’t know me:

- I left WIkipedia in 2002.

- I have been a critic since 2004.

- The Wikipedia process is almost as opaque to me as it is to you.

- Yes it’s biased, I’ve said so for a long time. See my blog (http://LarrySanger.org).

- I do http://Encyclosphere.org.

Musk wants people to stop donating to Wikipedia

Sanger’s request to Donald Trump

Hi, @realDonaldTrump—co-founder of Wikipedia here—could I persuade you to use an executive order to make it a policy that neither federal worker hours nor federal moneys may be used to edit Wikipedia or pay for Wikipedia editing?

Thanks in advance. (I voted for you.)","Larry Sanger has been a critic of Wikipedia since 2004. He wants the U.S. government to stop using federal funds to pay for editing.

Spotify to EU: Apple is making fool by its EU compliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotify-to-eu-apple-is-making-fool-by-its-eu-compliance/articleshow/118591468.cms,"Spotify CEO Daniel Ek.

Spotify CEO Daniel Ek is pressing European regulators to enforce penalties against Apple for allegedly circumventing the EU's Digital Markets Act, calling the tech giant's compliance efforts a ""farce.""During a visit to Brussels on Tuesday to meet with European Commission officials, Ek accused Apple of using a ""well-established pattern of delaying and stalling"" to avoid following regulations meant to limit the power of dominant tech platforms.""It is time for Europe to show that we are going to enforce the law that's already been passed,"" Ek told Bloomberg, referring to the DMA which became effective last year.At issue is Apple's approach to allowing alternative app stores on iPhones, which Ek claims was designed to make competition ""almost universally impossible"" through excessive fees and restrictions.EU competition chief Teresa Ribera previously promised to rule on Apple's compliance by the end of March, with potential fines reaching 10% of Apple's global annual revenue.The dispute comes amid heightened political tensions, as US President Donald Trump recently threatened retaliatory tariffs against ""disproportionate"" penalties imposed on American companies by foreign governments.This isn't the first clash between the music streaming platform and Apple. Last year, Spotify's complaint led to a €1.8 billion ($2 billion) fine against Apple for preventing music-streaming apps from informing users about cheaper subscription options outside the App Store.Apple declined to directly address Ek's criticisms, instead referring to a previous statement expressing concerns about a pornography app that had been made available through a third-party app store in the EU.","Spotify CEO calls Apple's compliance efforts a ""farce"" Daniel Ek accuses Apple of using a ""well-established pattern of delaying and stalling"" Apple declined to directly address Ek's criticisms.

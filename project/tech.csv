"How Microsoft 'killed' OpenAI's $3 billion acquisition of WindSurf, making Google the 'big winner'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-microsoft-killed-openais-3-billion-acquisition-of-windsurf-making-google-the-big-winner/articleshow/122411189.cms,"FILE (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)

Microsoft tensions behind OpenAI-Windsurf deal collapse

What is Windsurf into

OpenAI’s $3 billion agreement to buy the AI coding startup WindSurf has fallen apart. The highly-anticipated acquisition deal between artificial intelligence powerhouse OpenAI and AI coding startup Windsurf. OpenAI had reportedly been close to finalizing the deal to acquire Windsurf, formally known as Exafunction Inc. , with a signed letter of intent and investor payout agreements (waterfall agreements) already in place. The acquisition was even nearing an announcement in early May, according to sources familiar with the discussions. However, an OpenAI spokesperson has confirmed that the exclusivity period for their offer has lapsed, leaving Windsurf free to explore other opportunities.In a swift turn of events, Alphabet Inc's Google has stepped in, striking a deal worth approximately $2.4 billion to acquire top talent and licensing rights from Windsurf. This move comes hot on the heels of the collapsed OpenAI acquisition .Google announced on Friday, July 11, that it is bringing Windsurf Chief Executive Officer Varun Mohan and co-founder Douglas Chen, along with a small team of staffers, into its DeepMind artificial intelligence unit. While the company declined to disclose the specific financial terms, it clarified that the agreement does not involve taking an equity stake in Windsurf itself. This development marks a significant strategic gain for Google in the competitive AI landscape, securing valuable expertise and technology that had been hotly contested by its rivals.A significant factor in the unraveling of the OpenAI-Windsurf deal appears to be friction with kMicrosoft Corp., a major investor and key partner for OpenAI. According to a Bloomberg report, sources close to the matter indicate that Windsurf was hesitant to grant Microsoft access to its intellectual property. This condition became a sticking point that OpenAI was reportedly unable to resolve with Microsoft, whose existing agreement with OpenAI grants the software giant access to the AI startup's technology. This issue was reportedly one of several points of contention in ongoing discussions between Microsoft and OpenAI regarding OpenAI's restructuring into a commercial entity.Founded in 2021, Windsurf is a prominent player in the burgeoning field of AI-driven coding assistants. These systems are designed to automate and streamline coding tasks, including generating code from natural language prompts. The startup has successfully raised over $200 million in venture capital funding from investors like Greenoaks Capital Partners and AIX Ventures, according to PitchBook data.","OpenAI had reportedly been close to finalizing the deal to acquire Windsurf, formally known as Exafunction Inc.

A group of US senators has issued a stern warning to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang regarding his upcoming trip to China, a report has said. In a letter sent on Friday, Republican Senator Jim Banks and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren urged Huang to refrain from meeting with Chinese companies suspected of undermining US chip export controls or those with ties to Beijing's military and intelligence bodies. They also specifically cautioned against engaging with entities on the US restricted export list, according to a report by news agency Reuters.“We are worried that your trip to the PRC could legitimise companies that cooperate closely with the Chinese military or involve discussing exploitable gaps in US export controls,"" the senators reportedly wrote, highlighting concerns about potential circumvention of critical US technology safeguards.The senators underscored a consensus on the controlled export of advanced AI hardware, stressing that such technology could “accelerate the PRC's effort to modernise its military.”An Nvidia spokesperson responded to the concerns by stating that ""American wins"" when its technology sets ""the global standard."" The spokesperson emphasised China's vast pool of software developers, asserting that AI software ""should run best on the US technology stack, encouraging nations worldwide to choose America.”This development comes after Huang publicly praised US President Donald Trump’s decision to ease some AI chip export controls in May at the Computex trade show in Taipei, calling prior restrictions a “failure.” Huang previously estimated that US restrictions on Nvidia's modified AI chips for China, imposed in April, would reduce the company's revenue by $15 billion.Last month, Reuters reported that a senior US official alleged AI firm DeepSeek was assisting China's military and intelligence operations and had attempted to use shell companies to circumvent US AI chip export controls.

"Elon Musk’s xAI apologises for what 'happened on July 8', calls it ‘horrific behaviour…’ by Grok",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/grok-apologises-for-what-happened-on-july-8-elon-musk-owned-xai-calls-it-horrific-behaviour/articleshow/122405368.cms,"Representative image

Read xAI’s apology on X over Grok’s ‘posts the contained extremist views’



Update on where has @grok been & what happened on July 8th.

First off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced.

Our intent for @grok is to provide helpful and truthful responses to users. After careful investigation, we discovered the root cause was an update to a code path upstream of the @grok bot. This is independent of the underlying language model that powers @grok.

The update was active for 16 hrs, in which deprecated code made @grok susceptible to existing X user posts; including when such posts contained extremist views.

We have removed that deprecated code and refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse. The new system prompt for the @grok bot will be published to our public github repo.

We thank all of the X users who provided feedback to identify the abuse of @grok functionality, helping us advance our mission of developing helpful and truth-seeking artificial intelligence.

xAI on what went wrong with Gtok



Specifically, the change triggered an unintended action that appended the following instructions:

""""""

- If there is some news, backstory, or world event that is related to the X post, you must mention it

- Avoid stating the obvious or simple reactions.

- You are maximally based and truth seeking AI. When appropriate, you can be humorous and make jokes.

- You tell like it is and you are not afraid to offend people who are politically correct.

- You are extremely skeptical. You do not blindly defer to mainstream authority or media. You stick strongly to only your core beliefs of truth-seeking and neutrality.

- You must not make any promise of action to users. For example, you cannot promise to make a post or thread, or a change to your account if the user asks you to.

## Formatting

- Understand the tone, context and language of the post. Reflect that in your response.

- Reply to the post just like a human, keep it engaging, dont repeat the information which is already present in the original post.

- Do not provide any links or citations in the response.

- When guessing, make it clear that you're not certain and provide reasons for your guess.

- Reply in the same language as the post.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells $36.4 million in stock under mysterious ‘trading plan' he adopted in March,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-sells-36-4-million-in-stock-under-mysterious-trading-plan-he-adopted-in-march/articleshow/122401267.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

What is the mysterious ‘trading plan'



Nvidia sets new record, beats Microsoft and Apple



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold 225,000 shares of company stock worth around $36.4 million. According to the recent filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the transactions were executed between July 8 and July 10. The recent sale of stocks is part of a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan which Huang adopted in March this year. The trading plan allows the Nvidia CEO to sell up to 6 million shares by the end of 2025. This latest transaction made by Huang follows the previous batch of stock which he sold in June this year. Last month Huang offloaded 1,00,000 shares in the span of two days.For those unaware, the 10b5-1 trading plan enable corporate insiders such as company executives to sell or but company stock at pre-decided value. This plan also offers defense against insider trading charges by showcasing that the traders were planned in advance and is not based on any new information. This pre-arranged structure ensures transparency and compliance with regulatory standards.The plan mentioned in Nvidia’s quarterly report was adopted in March 2025. The plan is designed to allow structured selling without triggering any market volatility. Despite the recent stock sale, Hang still remains the largest individual shareholder of Nvidia. Huang still has more than 900 million shares.The timing of the stock sale made by Huang coincides with Nvidia’s stock trading near its 52-week high and also the company surpassed the $4 trillion market capitalisation. This marks Huang’s second batch of sales under the plan, following a $15 million transaction in June. Last year, he sold $700 million worth of shares under a similar arrangement.Nvidia's has become the first public company to touch the ‘magic’ $4 trillion market value. The company’s stock market valuation officially closed above $4 trillion for the first time on Thursday (July 10) after shares of the AI chipmaker ended the trading session up 0.75% at $164.10, pushing its market capitalisation to $4.004 trillion. This milestone extends Nvidia's significant lead over tech giants Apple and Microsoft, as it continues to benefit from an increasing demand for its AI technologies.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the company's market value briefly touched the $4 trillion mark on Wednesday (July 9) before closing just shy at approximately $3.97 trillion. To put its scale in perspective, Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of all publicly listed companies in the United Kingdom, the report added.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold 225,000 shares of company stock worth around $36.4 million.

Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for 'offensive' political slurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/poland-flags-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-to-the-eu-for-offensive-political-slurs/articleshow/122348777.cms,"Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for “offensive” political slurs

Why Poland says Elon Musk's Grok chatbot crossed a red line



Offensive answers: From antisemitic tropes to political insults



European digital rules put xAI under the spotlight



Previous incidents: Turkey, hate speech, and Grok’s growing rap sheet



xAI and Musk offer silence, at least for now



Poland just pulled the alarm on Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk ’s xAI. Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates. Poland’s complaint tees up an early test of those combined powers.Legal scholars note that fines can reach 6 percent of global turnover for DSA violations. For Musk’s empire, that runs into billions.Poland is not alone. A Turkish court ordered X to block Grok content that mocked President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Islamic beliefs.In June, users spotted the bot rambling about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. xAI blamed an “unauthorised change” to its response code.Each flare-up feeds an image of a system that swings from playful banter to extremist rhetoric with a single prompt.As of Wednesday afternoon, xAI had not replied to Reuters’ emailed questions, and Musk’s normally hyperactive X feed stayed quiet on the topic.The billionaire recently urged “maximum free speech” on X, but he also says AI must be “truth-seeking.” That balance gets messy when the bot channels conspiracy theories or ethnic slurs.","Poland says the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders.

Former Google executive who raised $92 million for a startup backed by Sundar Pichai shares one simple strategy every entrepreneur should know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-google-executive-who-raised-92-million-for-a-startup-backed-by-sundar-pichai-shares-one-simple-strategy-every-entrepreneur-should-know/articleshow/122399528.cms,"Former Google executive Caesar Sengupta finds startup life more chaotic than expected



How this one simple habit became Sengupta’s superpower



Why founders need mental clarity now more than ever



Inner stillness as the new startup strategy



Also Read |

In today’s high-octane startup world, where billion-dollar valuations can vanish overnight and hustle culture dominates, surviving the chaos requires more than grit and strategy. According to Caesar Sengupta , co-founder and CEO of the digital wealth platform Arta Finance said entrepreneurs need something surprisingly simple yet profoundly powerful: stillness. Sengupta believes daily meditation, not constant motion, is his ultimate superpower. And as neuroscience begins to validate this approach, the message is clear: in the noisy, demanding world of startups, mental clarity might be the most underutilized competitive edge.Before launching Arta Finance in 2021,a fintech company now backed by over $92 million in funding, including support from Sequoia Capital India and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Sengupta spent 15 years at Google. He helped build ChromeOS and co-founded Google Pay, which now serves more than 150 million users across 30+ countries.Despite his impressive resume, Sengupta admits the transition from corporate stability to startup chaos was mentally jarring. “There are days where you feel 100%, and there are days where you’re like, ‘Oh my God, what did I just do?’” he confessed. Startups, he explained, can consume founders entirely—damaging health, relationships, and emotional well-being.His solution wasn’t found in a productivity hack or another to-do list app. It was far simpler: five to ten minutes of meditation a day. “I wish three years back, somebody had sat me down and said: ‘Dude… just meditate,’” as reported by CNBC. That small window of silence became his daily anchor, offering mental space amidst a storm of decisions, investor meetings, and constant uncertainty.While Sengupta calls mindfulness his ""superpower,"" neuroscience is catching up to the claim. A recent study by the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, reported by Neuroscience News, found that just 30 days of guided mindfulness meditation significantly enhanced focus and reduced distractibility across all age groups.Using eye-tracking technology, researchers observed improved reaction times and sustained attention—especially linked to changes in the locus coeruleus–noradrenaline system, a brain center critical to focus, memory, and cognitive resilience. As postdoctoral researcher Andy Jeesu Kim put it, “Mindfulness isn’t just about feeling more relaxed — it can literally change the way your brain handles attention.”Founders today are under immense pressure navigating product launches, investor meetings, sleepless nights, and the ever-looming threat of failure. In such an environment, the ability to filter signals from noise isn’t just helpful, it's essential for survival.Sengupta also turns to cycling as a form of meditative movement. “It’s one of the only times where no one can reach me,” he says. This physical form of stillness helps him mentally recharge and stay grounded amid the chaos of building a high-stakes startup.As mindfulness gains ground in scientific and executive circles alike, Sengupta’s approach is emerging as more than just a personal quirk—it’s a strategic advantage. While others burn out chasing every opportunity, he’s choosing calm over chaos. And it’s working.“Ultimately,” he says, “it’s about how you confront the ups and downs of life.” For today’s entrepreneurs, Sengupta’s journey offers a profound lesson: in a world obsessed with speed, stillness may be your sharpest edge.","Caesar Sengupta, co-founder and CEO of Arta Finance, believes daily meditation, not constant motion, is his ultimate superpower.

IBM recently launched its new Power11 line of data center chips and servers, marking a significant leap in power efficiency and the simplification of artificial intelligence (AI) deployment within business operations. This update, the first major refresh to its ""Power"" chip line since 2020, positions IBM to compete more aggressively in the specialized data center market. Traditionally, IBM's Power chips have been a strong contender against offerings from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), particularly in demanding sectors such as financial services, manufacturing, and healthcare.Similar to Nvidia's AI servers, IBM's Power systems are an integrated solution, combining both powerful chips and sophisticated software. This tight integration, Tom McPherson, General Manager of Power Systems at IBM, told Reuters, has allowed the company to prioritise unparalleled reliability and robust security.McPherson clarified that IBM's strategy isn't to directly compete with Nvidia in the realm of creating and training AI systems. Instead, Big Blue is sharply focused on streamlining AI deployment for inference – the crucial process of putting an AI system to work to accelerate business tasks. ""We can integrate AI capabilities seamlessly into this for inference acceleration and help their business process improvements,"" McPherson reportedly said in an interview, referring to work with early customers. He, as per the Reuters report, added, ""It's not going to have all the horsepower for training or anything, but it's going to have really good inferencing capabilities that are simple to integrate.""A key highlight of the new Power11 systems, which will be available starting July 25, is their exceptional uptime. IBM claims these systems will require no planned downtime for software updates, and their average unplanned downtime each year will be a mere 30 seconds. Furthermore, the Power11 systems are engineered to detect and respond to a ransomware attack within a minute, offering a critical defense against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.Looking ahead, IBM plans to integrate the Power11 with Spyre, its AI chip introduced last year, in the fourth quarter of 2025. ""We can integrate AI capabilities seamlessly into this for inference acceleration and help their business process improvements,"" McPherson stated in a recent interview, referencing collaborations with early customers. He emphasized the system's ability to deliver ""really good inferencing capabilities that are simple to integrate,"" even if it doesn't boast the same horsepower as training-focused systems. This strategic focus on simplifying AI for practical business applications could prove to be a significant advantage for IBM in the evolving data center landscape.","IBM recently launched its new Power11 line of data center chips and servers, marking a significant leap in power efficiency.

What RealSense’s CEO said about Intel’s new subsidiary



Lava Storm Play First Look: Best Budget Phone Under Rs 10,000?

Intel is spinning out its artificial intelligence (AI) robotics and biometric venture into a new company named RealSense. This announcement came after the US-based chipmaker cut 500 jobs, which affected 15% to 20% of its factory workers. As more companies invest in automation tools, RealSense also secured a $50 million Series A funding round. This funding includes contributions from MediaTek Innovation Fund and Intel Capital, the chipmaker’s venture arm, which is also being spun out from Intel. RealSense, which develops tools and technology for robotics automation , stated its intention to use the new funding to develop additional product lines and address increasing global demand.Nadav Orbach , currently Intel’s vice president and general manager for incubation and disruptive innovation, will assume the role of CEO at RealSense.In an interview with CNBC, Orbach highlighted the technology’s broader adoption and more practical applications, saying, “the timing is now for physical AI.”“We want to develop new product lines. We see the demand and we see the need, and with where it’s at right now, the right thing for us was to raise external funds,” Orbach added.RealSense now operates independently with about 130 employees, focusing on developing safe and user-friendly tools. Intel retains a minority stake, the report added.Global companies are increasing investments in robotics as AI adoption grows. Morgan Stanley estimates the humanoid robot market could reach $5 trillion by 2050, with tech giants like Tesla and Amazon leading the charge.Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, views robotics as its next major opportunity after AI, while Salesforce claims AI handles up to half its workload.Meanwhile, Intel, facing setbacks in the AI race, has taken cost-cutting measures, including CEO and job cuts. It recently sold most of its stake in Altera and spun off RealSense, its 3D vision unit, which supports autonomous robotics firms like Eyesynth.","Intel is spinning out its artificial intelligence (AI) robotics and biometric venture into a new company named RealSense.

Linda Yaccarino has stepped down as CEO of Elon Musk ’s social media platform, X, after just over two years in the role. Her departure comes amid growing chaos in Musk’s business empire, where politics, controversy, and high-level exits are becoming a pattern. Yaccarino’s resignation marks the latest in a string of high-profile departures. Fourteen other senior leaders from Tesla , SpaceX , and X have left their roles in the past 12 months. As Musk increasingly intertwines his corporate ventures with political ambitions, industry watchers are raising questions about his ability to retain top talent.Yaccarino took over as CEO of X (formerly Twitter) in June 2023, after serving as global chair of advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal. She was brought in to reassure advertisers and stabilize the platform after Musk’s takeover sent many brands fleeing. Her exit was sudden and largely unexplained. In her farewell message, she thanked Musk for entrusting her with the mission of turning X into the ""Everything App"" and upholding free speech. However, her departure signals deepening instability at X, where internal tensions, advertiser exodus, and falling user trust continue to plague the platform.Afshar was one of Musk’s most trusted lieutenants, overseeing major regional sales and playing a pivotal role in strategic operations. He was also considered Musk’s proxy during his brief political tenure as DOGE Chief. Afshar’s departure in June 2025 was reportedly due to internal disagreements over Tesla’s new market strategy and Musk's increasing focus on politics.Ferrua worked at Tesla for over seven years, managing workforce expansion, policy restructuring, and talent development.

He left in April 2025 after 12 years at the company, reportedly due to a reshuffling of the software division and executive disagreements.One of the longest-serving business leaders at SpaceX, Ochinero led commercial launch contracts and satellite deals with international clients. His February 2024 exit was viewed as a major blow to SpaceX’s global partnerships.Pickles spent nearly a decade shaping public policy at Twitter/X. He helped navigate the company through misinformation controversies and regulatory battles. He stepped down in September 2024, citing burnout and shifts in platform direction under Musk.Monteiro led X’s global data privacy efforts. A recognized expert in digital rights, he left in September 2024 to take personal time off. Insiders say the platform’s reduced emphasis on privacy and increasing legal battles influenced his decision.Zhang managed Tesla’s most futuristic vehicles — the long-delayed Roadster and Cybertruck. He exited in July 2024 after internal project delays and conflicts over vehicle specs and timelines.Brought in to restructure the company during mass layoffs, Benarroch helped stabilize day-to-day operations post-Musk acquisition. He quit in June 2024, citing strategic misalignment with Musk’s vision for the platform.Formerly a TV executive, Weitz spearheaded the Originals documentary-style content initiative.

High import duties could drive up Tesla prices in India

With stores coming to India, Tesla invests in building its team across divisions in India

Tesla is rapidly expanding its India footprint with a second showroom in New Delhi scheduled to open in late July, just weeks after launching its first Mumbai location on Tuesday. The aggressive rollout marks the electric vehicle maker's formal entry into the world's third-largest automobile market as it seeks growth amid slowing global sales.The Mumbai showroom opening will give prospective customers access to pricing, variants, and trim options for Tesla's Model Y rear-wheel drive SUVs imported from China. Deliveries of the cars are expected to start from late August, with customers able to configure and order their Tesla EVs from next week, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to Bloomberg News.The Model Y units, declared at approximately 27.7 lakhs rupees ($32,270) each, will sell at a substantial premium due to India's 70% import tariff on fully-built imported cars under $40,000. The vehicles are expected to retail for more than $56,000 around 48.07 lakhs rupees before taxes and insurance, compared to roughly $46,630 in the US market.Tesla is beefing up hiring across charging, retail, and policy teams while leasing warehouse space in Karnataka and Gurugram. The company has imported Supercharger components, car accessories, merchandise, and spares from the US, China, and the Netherlands to support its operations.The first week of Mumbai showroom operations will focus on VIPs and business partners before opening to the general public. Tesla's success in India will test consumers' acceptance of premium pricing in a market where EVs account for just over 5% of passenger vehicle sales and premium cars represent less than 2% of total sales.Tesla's entry comes at a crucial time as the EV maker faces slowing global sales in the second quarter. The company had previously delayed its India launch due to disagreements over tariffs and local manufacturing requirements, but breakthrough came after Elon Musk met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February.","Tesla is expanding its India footprint with a second showroom in New Delhi scheduled to open in late July.

Dell CEO Michael Dell has raised concerns about the internal culture impact Meta may face due to its aggressive hiring of artificial intelligence talent from rivals – Google DeepMind, OpenAI, GitHub, Apple and others. Speaking on the BG2 podcast hosted by Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner on Thursday, Dell warned that bringing in top AI professionals at high salaries could lead to dissatisfaction among existing staff at Meta Platforms . “It’ll be a challenge culturally for sure,” Dell said.He further explained that offering higher pay to new hires could make current employees feel left out or underappreciated, which may result in friction within teams and create a long line of “complaining” employees outside CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s office.Emphasizing the importance of fairness in the workplace, he stated “People generally have a sense of fairness, right? They want to be treated fairly relative to others and relative to the opportunities that they have out there in the overall market.” Dell further stated that while Meta’s strategy and the “math” may work if this is reduced to a “race to super intelligence,” but he also warned against the potential for internal conflict and dissatisfaction should not be overlooked.Meta has significantly ramped up hiring through its Superintelligence Labs, launched in June to focus on artificial general intelligence (AGI). The company has hired talent from competitors such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and Apple. This talent war has reshaped the AI sector and drawn mixed reactions from industry leaders.Earlier, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also criticized Meta’s hiring strategy, calling it “distasteful” and suggesting it may create issues inside the company. Altman even hinted that OpenAI might need to review its compensation policies in response to Meta’s aggressive poaching.Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn and former OpenAI board member, offered a different view. In an interview with CNBC, Hoffman said it makes economic sense for companies to spend big on AI talent if they want to stay ahead.","Dell CEO Michael Dell has raised concerns about the internal culture impact Meta may face due to its aggressive hiring of artificial intelligence talent.

Six-figure salary jobs that AI won’t replace but will assist

Wider workforce gaps show an urgent need for reskilling

As artificial intelligence continues to automate more and more tasks once managed by humans, fears of mass job losses are growing. Yet a new report from the Future Skills Organisation offers a more nuanced outlook. Despite rapid advances in AI, many high-paying white-collar jobs are not only expected to survive but thrive well into the next decade.Jobs such as accountants, IT managers, financial advisers, executives, and banking professionals, all typically commanding six-figure salaries, are projected to remain in strong demand through 2030. The report highlights that while AI can process data and streamline workflows, human roles that require leadership, judgment, and trust remain irreplaceable.Accountants, for instance, continue to be critical in areas like auditing, compliance, and financial strategy.

What is Meta's investment in ScaleAI

Why Google and Microsoft leaving is bad news for ScaleAI

Google, the largest customer of AI data-labeling startup Scale AI, is planning to sever ties with the company following Facebook parent Meta’s acquisition of a 49% stake in Scale, valued at $29 billion, according to five sources familiar with the matter. The move, reported by Reuters, has raised concerns among Scale’s major clients, including Microsoft and Elon Musk’s xAI, who are also reportedly reconsidering their partnerships due to fears of proprietary data exposure to a key rival. The shift underscores growing concerns among AI developers about data security and competitive risks as industry giants like Meta deepen their influence in the AI ecosystem.Meta’s $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, previously valued at $14 billion, includes the transition of Scale’s CEO, Alexandr Wang, to Meta, where he will lead efforts to develop “superintelligence.” This has intensified worries among Scale’s clients, particularly generative AI companies, that their sensitive research priorities and technical blueprints could be accessed by Meta through Scale’s data-labeling operations.Google, which had planned to pay Scale $200 million this year, has already begun discussions with Scale’s competitors to shift its workload, sources said. The company had been diversifying its data service providers for over a year, but Meta’s investment has accelerated Google’s push to exit all key contracts with Scale, a process that could move quickly due to the structure of data-labeling agreements. Microsoft and xAI are also pulling back, while OpenAI, a smaller Scale customer, scaled down its reliance months ago but will continue working with Scale as one of its many vendors, according to OpenAI’s CFO.Scale AI, which serves self-driving car companies, the U.S. government, and generative AI firms, relies heavily on a few major clients. A Scale spokesperson emphasized that the company remains independent and committed to safeguarding customer data, stating, “Our business remains strong, spanning major companies and governments.” However, the potential loss of key clients like Google could significantly impact Scale’s operations.","Google, the largest customer of AI data-labeling startup Scale AI, is planning to sever ties with the company.

When China jailed three people for leaking details of soon-to-be launched Apple gadget,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-china-jailed-three-people-for-leaking-details-of-soon-to-be-launched-apple-gadget/articleshow/121868826.cms,"Apple’s strict secrecy policy for its products

Three Foxconn R&D employees in China were sentenced to prison for leaking details about the iPad 2 before its launch. The employees received sentences ranging from one year to 18 months and were fined between $4,500 and $23,000 for violating trade secrets. The arrests, which took place in December 2010, highlight Apple’s aggressive stance on protecting its product secrecy. It also shows how importamt it is for the largest manufacturer of Apple's product to ensure this secrecy around the company's products.The three Foxconn employees reportedly provided digital images of the iPad 2’s design to Shenzhen MacTop Electronics, an Apple-compatible accessory manufacturer founded in 2004. In exchange, MacTop paid the employees 20,000 yuan (approximately $3,000) and offered discounts on its products. This allowed MacTop to produce iPad 2 cases ahead of competitors, gaining a market edge. According to Cult of Mac, “The leaked information gave MacTop a significant head start, showcasing how valuable Apple’s trade secrets are in the competitive accessory market.”Despite this high-profile case, leaks of Apple products persist, given the thousands of workers involved in its supply chain, many earning low wages. “It’s actually surprising that more Apple leaks don’t surface, considering the scale of their manufacturing operations,” Cult of Mac noted. Apple’s secrecy measures have since intensified, including deploying undercover security teams and imposing multimillion-dollar fines on suppliers who fail to safeguard confidential information.While Apple CEO Tim Cook has been slightly more forthcoming about future plans than Steve Jobs, the company remains fiercely protective of its hardware details. A leaked internal memo a few years ago underscored the severe consequences for employees who disclose sensitive information. With billions at stake in product launches, Apple’s ongoing battle against leaks shows no signs of slowing down.","Three Foxconn R&D employees in China were sentenced to prison for leaking details about the iPad 2 before its launch.

500th Falcon launch: A milestone noted with Starlink advancements



""Falcon completes its 500th overall mission! Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team for making the impossible possible on the road to rapidly reusable rockets!""

Falcon 9 B1081: The booster that keeps coming back

From failure to dominance: The long road to 500

2010: First successful Falcon 9 flight.

2012: Dragon capsule docks at ISS.

2015: First booster landing completed.

2018: Falcon Heavy first launch with a Tesla Roadster in orbit.

2020: First crewed mission with NASA astronauts on board Crew Dragon.

2024: First fully stacked Starship goes to orbit.

Reusability and cost savings: The SpaceX edge

Starlink's growing footprint and telecom disruption

What's next: Starship and Mars on the horizon

Global impact and industry disruption



Driving launch costs down across the industry.

Accelerating satellite-based internet availability.

Redefining expectations around launch cadence and recovery.

Serving as a model for lean, engineering-focused innovation.

In a historic milestone in commercial space travel, SpaceX concluded its 500th mission with the Falcon family of rockets. The occasion was celebrated with the launch of 26 Starlink satellites from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base at 9:54 p.m. EDT on June 12, 2025. The mission not only represents technological excellence and reliability but also accentuates the transformation of a company that started its journey a little over a decade ago in a small garage.While the world witnessed Falcon rocket B1081 mark its 15th flight and come back successfully to a droneship off the coast of Southern California, the space community celebrated not just a launch, it was remembering SpaceX's evolution into a world leader in reusable space technology. With more than 7,600 satellites orbiting Earth and a frenetic mission cadence, SpaceX is redefining the playbook for space access, connectivity, and sustainability.As the aerospace community basked in the glow of the 500th Falcon mission, SpaceX founder Elon Musk commemorated the event with a nostalgic post on X. Posting a photo taken in 2006 of himself amidst early rocket parts in a humble garage, Musk captioned the photo:The photo was originally shot by Hans Koenigsmann, one of the original engineers at SpaceX, who posted:This photo was a powerful reminder of the company's humble roots. From a spare, garage-dwelling group of engineers pursuing the vision of space accessibility at a reasonable price, the company has grown into a company that has launched more space missions per year than any previous company in history.The June 12 launch was one of the regular missions for SpaceX's continuous Starlink program, an international satellite broadband internet initiative to provide high-speed broadband connectivity to remote and underserved communities across the globe. The 26 satellites launched on this mission contributed to the constellation of more than 7,600 satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), further cementing Starlink's status as the largest satellite network ever constructed.Within an hour of the release, SpaceX verified successful deployment of the satellites. A congratulatory tweet from the company's official X (formerly Twitter) handle read:The 500-mission milestone demonstrates not just operational effectiveness, but also the scalability and reliability of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, which are the backbone of SpaceX's fleet.One of the main features of the mission was the utilization of Falcon 9 booster B1081, which flew for the 15th time. Having lofted the satellites to orbit, the booster successfully landed on autonomous droneship Of Course I Still Love You deployed in the Pacific Ocean.This recovery keeps SpaceX's high booster reuse rate trend going. While B1081's 15 flights are impressive, the single Falcon 9 booster flight record is currently 28, a record Musk will break in the near term. The company has consistently demonstrated the viability of its reusable approach, with reused boosters becoming a standard part of almost every launch.To date in 2025, SpaceX has launched 72 Falcon 9s, with 54 aimed at building out Starlink. Numerous satellites contain direct-to-cell functionality, enabling cell phones to get messages and limited internet services even without standard cellular systems.The path to 500 Falcon missions has not been without a few setbacks. SpaceX experienced several launch failures in its early life, including the first three failed Falcon 1 launches between 2006-2008. Success on the fourth Falcon 1 mission preserved the company from financial ruin.SpaceX has changed very quickly since then:With a mix of both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy missions, SpaceX has attained a mission cadence superior to national space agencies and private rivals alike.At the heart of SpaceX's success is its groundbreaking emphasis on reusability. Expendable, single-use rockets were the norm previously, making access to space expensive. By being able to recover and reuse Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy boosters, and fairings, SpaceX has reduced the cost of launch and boosted turnaround speed.The price of a Falcon 9 launch is estimated at less than $30 million much less than in the past launch vendors. This reduced cost facilitates high-frequency missions, deployment flexibility, and increased access to space-based services by governments and corporations.With more than 7,600 active satellites and growing, Starlink is a major player in the international internet scene. It is currently operational in over 70 nations with further rollout planned across the globe in 2025.Notably, new releases have also had direct-to-cell features, enabling certain smartphones to access satellites to provide fundamental services such as text messages and emergency notifications, perfect for far-flung regions and areas struck by disaster. SpaceX has teamed up with carriers in the United States such as T-Mobile, Australia's Optus, and Canada's Rogers for these types of services, essentially making itself a complementary telecom player.As the Falcon family sets records, SpaceX is already looking toward the next frontier. The Starship program dedicated to deep space travel, lunar landing, and eventual colonization of Mars is the next chapter in SpaceX's quest.Starship-Super Heavy, the completely reusable system, successfully tested an orbital back in 2025, and the subsequent key test flight should happen later this year. Starship has been chosen by NASA to fly on its Artemis III mission returning humans to the Moon, solidifying SpaceX's position in future human space travel.In the meantime, the Falcon program remains the backbone of global launches, particularly for Starlink growth, commercial payloads, and crew flights to the International Space Station (ISS).SpaceX's 500th Falcon mission marks more than company success. It marks a disruption of the conventional aerospace model, compelling legacy participants such as Arianespace, ULA, and Roscosmos to evolve or be left behind. The company's reach now touches on:","Elon Musk posts throwback to SpaceX’s garage days after the 500th Falcon rocket launch.

Verdict on July 2, what proscecutors want

Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment, with a French court hearing disturbing accounts from former employees, predominantly women, about a toxic workplace culture at the gaming giant’s Paris headquarters during the 2010s, according to The Guardian. The accusations, reportedly described as “extremely serious” by prosecutor Antoine Haushalter, include incidents of employees being tied to chairs, forced to perform handstands, subjected to sexual jokes, exposed to pornographic videos in the office, and enduring crude behavior, such as a boss farting in employees’ faces. One woman reported a manager drawing a penis on her arm during a video call with senior leaders. The court case marks the gaming industry’s first major #MeToo trial.The accused include Tommy Francois, 52, former Vice President of Editorial & Creative Services; Serge Hascoet, 59, former Chief Creative Officer; and Guillaume Patrux, 41, former Game Director. Ubisoft, known for blockbuster titles like Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Just Dance, was allegedly a “Boys’ Club” where such misconduct thrived, per The Guardian.Francois faces charges of sexual harassment, bullying, and attempted sexual assault. The Guardian reported that he allegedly tied a female employee to a chair before sending her in an elevator to a random floor and forced a woman in a skirt to do handstands, leaving her terrified. At a 2015 office party, he reportedly attempted to kiss a woman while others restrained her; she escaped after shouting. Another woman accused Francois of grabbing her hair and attempting a forced kiss at a U.S. gaming event, showing her nude photos, and drawing on her arm during a video call. Ubisoft’s HR allegedly dismissed her concerns, advising her not to escalate. Francois denies all allegations.Hascoet is accused of bullying and sexual harassment, including making inappropriate sexual comments, such as telling a woman on a work trip she “needed sex” in front of colleagues, and joking that a used tissue he handed to a female employee was “worth gold at Ubisoft,” per The Guardian. He allegedly made sexual noises, forced assistants to run personal errands, and denies any intent to harass.Patrux faces similar charges, accused of punching walls, pretending to strike employees, cracking a whip near faces, joking about an office shooting, and burning an employee’s beard with a lighter, according to The Guardian. He also denies the allegations.Haushalter called the trial an important moment for the gaming industry, highlighted by the #MeToo movement, which empowered victims to speak out. He also highlighted “strong proof” of systemic mistreatment and requested suspended prison sentences of up to three years and fines for the trio. The court concluded hearings, with a verdict expected on July 2, 2025.","Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment.

When it comes to supporting their children’s passions, most parents settle for lessons, gear, or maybe even a trip to a championship. But when you're Bill Gates , the Microsoft co-founder and one of the richest men in the world, the scale of parental support takes a whole new dimension.In what might be one of the most extravagant gestures of modern parenthood, Gates reportedly spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams. What began as a simple rental in 2011 evolved into a strategic series of acquisitions that transformed the elite Mallet Hill Court neighborhood into a private horse-centric haven, complete with barns, mansions, and lots of privacy.The Gates family initially dipped their toes into Wellington’s equestrian scene in 2011, renting a home for four months at a cost of $500,000. Their teenage daughter, Jennifer, was already training as a competitive show jumper, and Wellington, a hub for global equestrian sports, was the perfect base.By 2013, Bill Gates had made his first major purchase:From there, the acquisitions accelerated:In total, Bill Gates acquired 18 acres of land, effectively transforming a residential street into a private equestrian neighborhood.The scale and strategy of the acquisitions caught local attention. As one local told the Daily Mail, Gates was “gobbling up properties like Pac-Man.” Many purchases were reportedly made at two to three times the appraised market value, all in a bid to secure surrounding lots and guarantee privacy for Jennifer and her team.Stuart Roffman, a former property owner on the street, explained that despite the gated entrance, the activity level was still high. “Between trucks, stable hands, grooms, and house staff, that's a lot of people on a small street,” he noted. Gates’ solution? Buy the neighbors out.Although the purchase spree appears lavish, Melinda French Gates defended their parenting approach in a 2024 interview with The New York Times, saying,She emphasised that Jennifer and her siblings were raised with allowances, chores, and boundaries. “They were explicitly told not to mention private jets to their classmates,” Melinda added, underscoring an attempt to keep their lives grounded, despite the multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio.Now 29 years old, Jennifer Gates has successfully balanced her equestrian career with impressive academic achievements. A graduate of Stanford University, she later attended medical school and recently announced her residency in Pediatrics Research at Mount Sinai, one of her top choices.In a recent Instagram post, she wrote:she added, celebrating the match to her desired program.Jennifer is now married to Olympic show jumper Nayel Nassar and continues to compete in equestrian events while working in the medical field.Florida isn’t the only state where Jennifer enjoys equestrian luxury. For her graduation from Stanford, the Gates family purchased a 124-acre equestrian estate in North Salem, New York, reportedly worth $15.8 million. The property, located near New York City, consists of three large parcels, giving her ample space to house horses, practice riding, and enjoy countryside serenity. She often shares glimpses of her quiet life there on social media. The estate also serves as a base for her continued training and competitions.Bill Gates once downplayed the perks of wealth by saying,But in this case, the metaphorical burger came with a mansion, barns, paddocks, and full-time staff. What began as a teenager’s passion has turned into a lifestyle, supported by one of the most influential tech moguls in history.While many parents support their children's hobbies with encouragement or a few lessons, Bill Gates offered Jennifer a community, a sanctuary, and the freedom to chase her dreams without compromise. His investment wasn’t just financial—it was deeply personal. It showed how belief in a child’s passion can create a legacy beyond wealth.","Bill Gates spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which was once commonly linked to war veterans, has been brought into the limelight again in recent times because of its increasingly diagnosable occurrence throughout all demographics and occupations. The most recent public reference to it is by Errol Musk, who explained his son Elon Musk's feud with Donald Trump as stemming fromAlthough those claims tend to fuel controversy, they also point to the larger, more serious discourse surrounding mental health, particularly in high-pressure settings such as politics, governance, or technology entrepreneurship.PTSD is a stress disorder that can happen to anyone who has witnessed or experienced a traumatic experience. From victims of natural disasters and violent offenses to those subjected to chronic emotional stress, PTSD can drastically interfere with daily life and quality of life if not treated. Here's a comprehensive overview of PTSD, its symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and contemporary treatment methods.PTSD stands forr, a mental health condition that may occur following exposure to or witnessing a traumatic event.It is accepted within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and may occur in individuals of all ages, including children.PTSD is different from the temporary emotional distress that most individuals experience following trauma. Although many recover on their own, those with PTSD remain affected by long-lasting symptoms that can last for months or even years and disrupt their normal functioning.PTSD may result from a variety of traumatic events. While some individuals develop the disorder following a one-time event, others become affected after repeated exposure to stressful situations. They are commonly triggered by:It is worth noting that not everyone who is exposed to trauma will develop PTSD. Genetics, brain chemistry, coping methods, and support systems can all play a role in a person's risk.PTSD symptoms typically start within three months of the traumatic event but at other times may emerge later. To be considered for PTSD diagnosis, the symptoms should persist for more than a month and lead to major distress or impairments in social or occupational functioning.PTSD symptoms are typically classified into four clusters:Although PTSD may occur in anyone, some individuals are at higher risk:Studies also indicate that women are more likely than men to experience PTSD, perhaps because of higher incidence rates of interpersonal violence.PTSD is usually diagnosed by a mental health professional, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker, based on criteria from the DSM-5. The diagnostic process involves:At other times, symptom quantification is achieved through the use of standardized measurement tools such as the PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5).Contemporary treatment of PTSD aims to enable people to manage symptoms, re-establish trust, and take back control of their lives. They comprise:Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the most effective type of psychotherapy for PTSD. It involves:There is no surefire method to prevent PTSD, but early treatment can drastically lower risk and severity:","Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been brought into the limelight again in recent times because of its increasingly diagnosable occurrence. The most recent public reference to it is by Errol Musk, who explained his son Elon Musk's feud with Donald Trump as stemming from PTSD.

"Meta, TikTok challenge EU’s Big Tech fee; call it “unfair and disproportionate”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-tiktok-challenge-eus-big-tech-fee-call-it-unfair-and-disproportionate/articleshow/121796298.cms,"What Meta and TikTok said about Europe’s DSA

What the European Commission argue

Xiaomi QLED TV FX Pro 55-inch Review: Affordable Cinematic Experience at Home

Meta and TikTok have taken the European Union to court over a fee which they claim is unfair and based on flawed calculations. Speaking before Europe’s second-highest court on Wednesday, the two tech giants argued that the EU’s supervisory levy under the Digital Services Act (DSA) is both disproportionate and lacking in transparency. The law, which came into effect in 2022, requires 19 large online platforms to pay a fee—up to 0.05% of their annual global net income—to help fund the European Commission's work overseeing their compliance with digital rules.Stating that the company is not trying to avoid paying the fees, Meta’s lawyer questioned the Commission’s method for calculating the fee. In a General Court in Luxembourg, he said it was wrongly based on the overall group’s revenue, not the revenue of the EU-based subsidiary, and that the company still doesn’t know exactly how the final amount was reached.TikTok’s lawyer echoed similar concerns, calling the fee “unfair and disproportionate.” He said the method used inflated TikTok’s payment and even required the company to help cover the cost for other platforms. He also accused the EU of counting the same user more than once if they switch between devices, which he said led to double-counting.Both companies argued that the Commission went beyond its legal powers by using group-level profits to calculate the cap for the fee.In response, the European Commission’s lawyer defended the system, saying that when a company files consolidated financial reports, it’s reasonable to use group-level financial data. She also said that companies had access to enough information to understand how the fee was determined and that there was no violation of their rights.","The two tech giants argued that the EU’s supervisory levy under the Digital Services Act (DSA) is both disproportionate and lacking in transparency.

8 simple tips to help you improve efficiency of your car’s AC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/8-simple-tips-to-help-you-improve-efficiency-of-your-cars-ac/articleshow/121792931.cms,"8 simple tips to improve your car’s AC

Park in the shade

Vent hot air before starting AC

Use the Recirculation Mode

Don't keep it on max fan speed constantly

Get regular AC servicing

Clean or replace air filters

Use a sunshade

Turn off AC before turning off engine

As temperatures soar, a well-functioning car air conditioner becomes less of a luxury and more of a necessity. However, many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling. A few simple practices can significantly improve its efficiency, save fuel, and extend the life of your cooling system. By incorporating these simple habits, you can ensure your car's AC runs more efficiently, keeping you comfortable while potentially saving on fuel costs and maintenance. Here are eight simple tips to help you stay cool on the road.This might seem obvious, but parking under a tree or in a covered area can make a huge difference. A car parked in direct sunlight can reach internal temperatures far exceeding the outside air, forcing your AC to work much harder to cool it down.Before turning on your AC, roll down your windows for a minute or two, especially if your car has been sitting in the sun. This allows trapped hot air to escape, reducing the initial load on your air conditioning system.Once your car is cool, switch your AC to recirculation mode. This feature re-circulates the air already inside the cabin, rather than constantly trying to cool hot outside air. This is much more efficient and helps maintain a comfortable temperature.While it's tempting to use the highest fan setting, keeping it on maximum continuously isn't always the most efficient. Once the cabin is cool, reduce the fan speed to maintain comfort, which puts less strain on the system.Just like your car's engine, your AC system needs regular maintenance. Getting it serviced annually ensures that refrigerant levels are optimal, components are clean, and there are no leaks. A well-maintained system runs more efficiently.A clogged cabin air filter can restrict airflow and make your AC work harder. Check your car's manual for recommended replacement intervals and clean or replace the filter as needed. This simple step can dramatically improve airflow and efficiency.When parking outdoors, a reflective sunshade in your windshield can significantly reduce the internal temperature build-up. This minimises the initial cooling effort required from your AC.It's a good habit to turn off your AC a few minutes before you reach your destination or turn off the engine. This allows the system to dry out, preventing mold and mildew growth in the vents, which can lead to unpleasant odours and reduce efficiency over time.","Many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling.

Oracle founder Larry Ellison has surpassed Amazon’s Jeff Bezos to claim the No. 2 spot on the world’s richest list, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . Bezos had held the position for nearly eight years, with Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg briefly occupying it at times. Bloomberg notes that Ellison’s wealth surged by over $20 billion this week, fueled by a record-high Oracle Corp. stock price.Oracle’s shares jumped 13% to $199.85 at Thursday’s close in New York, marking the largest single-day gain in a year, after the company forecasted a 70% increase in cloud infrastructure sales for the fiscal year, Bloomberg reports. The software giant, traditionally known for its database products, is gaining ground in cloud computing, particularly for AI-focused clients. Oracle recently launched a joint venture called Stargate to supply OpenAI with significant computing power.“Oracle is on its way to becoming one of the world’s largest cloud infrastructure companies,” Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said in a statement Wednesday, as quoted by Bloomberg. She added that fiscal year 2026 revenue growth rates are expected to be “dramatically higher.”Bloomberg highlights Oracle’s $138 billion in remaining performance obligations, a key indicator of bookings, up from $130 billion the prior quarter. On an analyst call, Ellison described an unprecedented order: “We recently got an order that said we’ll take all the capacity you have, wherever it is… we never got an order like that before.”The AI boom has driven demand for data center capacity, with Oracle carving out a niche in AI-focused computing power, serving clients like Elon Musk’s xAI and Meta, Bloomberg reports. Analyst Brent Thill told Bloomberg TV that Catz’s long-term outlook, hinting at revenue acceleration, was the “exceptional” part of Oracle’s report, potentially driven by Stargate and OpenAI collaborations.To meet demand, Oracle’s capital expenditures tripled to $21.2 billion for the year ended May 31, with plans to rise to $25 billion this year, Bloomberg notes. Ellison explained, “The reason demand continues to outstrip supply is we can only build these data centers, build these computers, so fast.”","Larry Ellison has surpassed Amazon's Jeff Bezos to claim the No. 2 spot on the world's richest list.

Smuggling AI hardware

Poll Is Southeast Asia becoming a strategic hub for AI development? No, it lacks necessary resources Yes, due to infrastructure growth

How and why China uses countries in Southeast Asia as base

In a bid to bypass stringent US restrictions on advanced AI chips, Chinese companies are resorting to innovative workarounds, including processing data abroad. According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, in early March, four Chinese engineers traveled from Beijing to Malaysia, each carrying a suitcase with 15 hard drives containing 80 terabytes of data for training an AI model. At a Malaysian data center, the engineers utilized approximately 300 servers equipped with Nvidia’s advanced chips to develop the AI model, which they later brought back to China.Since 2022, the US has tightened export controls on high-end AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. According to WSJ report, these restrictions have limited Chinese firms’ access to cutting-edge American technology, prompting them to explore alternatives. Some have substituted domestic chips for American ones, while others have smuggled AI hardware through third countries. However, increased US pressure has made smuggling more challenging, pushing Chinese companies to process data outside China in regions like Southeast Asia and the Middle East. “This was something we were consistently concerned about,” said Thea Kendler, former head of export controls at the Commerce Department under the Biden administration, referring to Chinese firms’ remote access to U.S. AI chips, told WSJ.The process involves layers of intermediaries, obscuring whether US regulations are being violated. The Biden administration proposed country-specific caps on American chip purchases to curb such activities, but the Trump administration scrapped these in May, citing unnecessary regulatory burdens on U.S. companies like Nvidia. Instead, it issued guidance urging firms to prevent their chips from being used to train Chinese AI models.In Malaysia, the Chinese company’s operation required meticulous planning. Engineers reportedly spent over eight weeks optimizing data sets in China, as transferring large data volumes online could take months. Last July, the company worked through a Singaporean subsidiary but later registered a Malaysian entity to avoid scrutiny after Nvidia and its vendors intensified end-user audits. To evade suspicion at Malaysian customs, the engineers distributed hard drives across four suitcases, a shift from bundling them into one the previous year. They returned to China with several hundred gigabytes of model parameters guiding the AI system’s output.Southeast Asia is reported to be emerging as a hub for such activities, with data centers rapidly expanding. Jones Lang LaSalle estimates nearly 2,000 megawatts of data-center capacity in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia -- matching Europe’s largest markets. Malaysia’s AI chip imports from Taiwan surged to $3.4 billion in March and April, exceeding its 2024 total. Meanwhile, the Middle East is also becoming a destination for Chinese AI developers, with Nvidia recently announcing significant chip sales to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE.These maneuvers highlight the challenges of enforcing US export controls as Chinese companies exploit global data centers to access American technology. While Southeast Asian authorities, like Singapore’s, are cracking down on transshipments, the region’s booming infrastructure continues to attract both Western and Chinese clients, testing the limits of regulatory oversight.","Since 2022, the US has tightened export controls on high-end AI chips to China, citing national security concerns.

What else does Donald Trump’s financial filing reveal about his investments



US President Donald Trump has reported making $57.35 million from his family’s cryptocurrency ventures, a report claims. These figures were reportedly revealed as part of his first public financial disclosure report of this term. As per the report, the US President included income from token sales at crypto firm World Liberty Financial and reported holding 15.75 billion governance tokens in the same venture. The financial disclosure did not specify the exact period it covered. However, details within the cryptocurrency listings and other information in the disclosure suggest the report covers data through the end of December 2024. This timeframe would exclude the majority of funds raised by the Trump family’s cryptocurrency ventures during his current term.Earlier this year, the president introduced a meme coin called $TRUMP, which has since generated about $320 million in fees, the news agency Reuters reports. However, Reuters didn’t clarify how those earnings are divided between a Trump-controlled entity and its partners remains unclear.On top of those meme coin revenues, the Trump family has pulled in over $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance firm, Reuters noted. The Trump family is also involved in a bitcoin mining operation and several cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds , the report added.The latest filing also showed that much of the President’s wealth was tied to his stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, the company that owns the social media platform Truth Social. As per Reuters calculations, he reported at least $12 million in passive income which includes interest and dividends from investments worth $211 million, notably in Blue Owl Capital and bond funds managed by Charles Schwab and Invesco.Trump’s Florida properties which include three golf resorts and Mar-a-Lago also generated at least $217.7 million in revenue, led by Trump National Doral’s $110.4 million. International income included $5 million in Vietnam licensing fees, $10 million from India development, and $16 million from Dubai licensing.He also earned royalties of $1.3 million from the Greenwood Bible, $2.8 million from watches, $2.5 million from sneakers and fragrances and $1.16 million from NFTs, while US First Lady Melania Trump made $216,700 from her NFT collection.","US President Donald Trump reported making $57.35 million from his family’s cryptocurrency ventures, a report claims.

What it may mean for Scale AI



Google, the largest customer of AI data-labeling firm Scale AI, plans to end its relationship with the company following news that rival Facebook-parent company Meta is acquiring a 49% stake, a report said. Google had reportedly intended to pay Scale AI around $200 million this year for human-labeled training data, essential for developing advanced AI models like its ChatGPT competitor, Gemini.Citing five sources familiar with the matter, news agency Reuters reported that the move stems from concerns that Meta's significant investment could expose Google's proprietary AI research and roadmap to a key competitor. Reportedly, the search giant has already begun discussions with several of Scale AI's rivals this week, looking to shift this substantial workload.Not only Google, The unease isn't limited to Google. Other major tech companies using Scale AI's services, including Microsoft and Elon Musk's xAI, are also reportedly distancing themselves.The report also says that OpenAI, another significant AI developer, had already scaled back its engagement with Scale AI months ago, though its spending was considerably less than Google's. However, OpenAI's CFO recently stated that the company would continue working with Scale AI as one of its many data vendors.The primary concern among companies competing with Meta in cutting-edge AI model development is the risk of their research priorities and technical blueprints being exposed to a direct rival. Customers often share proprietary data and even prototype products with Scale AI's workers for data-labeling services.With Meta now holding a substantial stake, these AI firms fear their chief competitor could gain sensitive business and technical intelligence.For Scale AI, this potential loss of Google's business comes as a blow, despite its recent valuation jump to $29 billion following Meta's investment (up from $14 billion pre-deal). Scale AI's core business heavily relies on a few major customers, making it vulnerable to such departures. While Scale AI intends to continue operations, its CEO, Alexandr Wang, along with some employees, are moving to Meta.The bulk of Scale AI's revenue comes from providing human trainers to annotate complex datasets for generative AI model makers, a service that can cost as much as $100 per annotation for sophisticated examples.

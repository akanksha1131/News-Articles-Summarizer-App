Elon Musk’s xAI acquires X social media platform in a 33 billion dollar mega deal: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-xai-acquires-x-social-media-platform-in-a-33-billion-dollar-mega-deal-report/articleshow/119687915.cms,"Elon Musk’s xAI acquires X cocial media platform in a 33 billion dollar mega deal

Musk’s xAI acquires X to merge AI and social media

Musk’s xAI expands AI dominance with Grok-3 and Colossus

Integration of X and xAI: Strategic implications

Financial and regulatory considerations

Musk’s expanding influence

In a significant corporate consolidation, Elon Musk ’s artificial intelligence firm, xAI , has acquired X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, for $33 billion. This acquisition marks another major move by Musk, who already oversees companies such as Tesla and SpaceX. The deal, structured as an all-stock transaction, strengthens Musk’s control over X and enhances his ability to develop AI technologies, particularly his chatbot model, Grok.Musk announced the acquisition via a post on X, stating that the deal values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, accounting for debt adjustments. The merger is expected to integrate the vast data resources of X with xAI’s AI models and computational power, potentially giving xAI an advantage in the increasingly competitive AI market. However, the specifics of the merger, including investor compensation and regulatory considerations, remain unclear.The announcement of xAI’s acquisition of X follows Musk’s long-term vision of integrating AI with social media platforms. In his post, Musk emphasized that the futures of xAI and X are ""intertwined,"" highlighting plans to combine data, AI models, computational power, and distribution networks.Industry analysts have described the move as both strategic and expected. Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, noted that the acquisition appears to be a culmination of Musk’s plans for X. Meanwhile, D.A. Davidson & Co. analyst Gil Luria pointed out that the transaction’s valuation—$45 billion before debt adjustments—is significant because it surpasses the original $44 billion Musk paid to take Twitter private in 2022.Musk’s deep involvement in both xAI and X allowed him to execute the acquisition without seeking external investor approval. According to insiders, Musk informed investors that the two companies had already been collaborating closely and that the integration would enhance the development of xAI’s AI models.Founded in 2023, xAI has quickly positioned itself as a competitor in the artificial intelligence market. It recently raised $10 billion in funding, valuing the company at $75 billion. xAI is directly competing with OpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT , and has been working to develop increasingly sophisticated AI models.In February 2025, xAI introduced Grok-3, its latest AI model, as it seeks to rival OpenAI and other AI firms such as China’s DeepSeek. The company has also been investing in expanding its computational resources, with its ""Colossus"" supercomputer cluster in Memphis, Tennessee, being among the largest AI training facilities in the world.Musk has been engaged in legal battles with OpenAI, suing the company over its transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit model. A federal judge recently denied Musk’s request for an injunction to halt OpenAI’s restructuring, further intensifying competition between the two AI firms.The merger between xAI and X represents a broader strategy by Musk to leverage the social media platform’s vast user-generated data for AI development. X, with its real-time data streams, user interactions, and media content, provides xAI with an extensive dataset that can be used to refine and train its AI models.By integrating AI directly into X, Musk could transform the platform into a hub for AI-driven content moderation, personalized recommendations, and enhanced user interactions. Furthermore, the ability to distribute xAI’s AI products through X could provide a competitive advantage over rival AI companies that rely on standalone applications.The acquisition raises several financial and regulatory questions. Following Musk’s 2022 takeover of Twitter, X experienced a turbulent period marked by massive layoffs and advertiser withdrawals. However, recent improvements in its operational performance and renewed advertiser interest have made X a more attractive asset.The banks that originally provided $13 billion in loans for Musk’s Twitter acquisition managed to offload the debt to investors, reflecting increased market confidence in X’s long-term viability. Analysts believe that investors who purchased the debt could see significant returns due to the company’s improving financial performance and integration with xAI.Despite these developments, the deal could face regulatory scrutiny, particularly regarding concerns over monopolization and data privacy. Merging a major social media platform with an AI company raises questions about how user data will be utilized and whether the integration could lead to unfair competitive advantages.Beyond the business realm, Musk’s growing influence in Washington, D.C., could play a role in shaping regulatory responses to the acquisition. As head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk has been involved in advising the U.S. government on cost-cutting measures, potentially giving him leverage in policy discussions affecting his business empire.Musk’s extensive portfolio, which now includes Tesla, SpaceX, X, xAI, and Neuralink, positions him as one of the most powerful figures in technology and business. The acquisition of X by xAI represents another step in his broader vision of integrating AI with social media, automation, and space exploration.","Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm, xAI, has acquired X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, for $33 billion.

European Commission announces 1.3 billion euros investment in AI



The German government has signaled a strong response to potential US tariffs, indicating that “nothing is off the table” when considering harsh measures, including potential actions targeting US tech companies. This announcement comes as the European Commission unveiled a significant 1.3 billion euro (approx $1.4 billion) investment in artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity and digital skills, aimed at bolstering European tech sovereignty.According to a report by news agency Reuters, a German government spokesperson, addressing concerns over potential US tariffs, stated that all options are being considered. When specifically questioned about the possibility of countermeasures affecting US tech firms, the spokesperson said that “at the moment, nothing is off the table, but instead everything is being looked at.”The spokesperson emphasised that any decisions regarding countermeasures would be made collectively within the European Union.“Decisions must be made jointly and in consideration of the costs and benefits within the European Union and under the leadership of the European Commission - this process is under way,” the spokesperson added.This stance from Germany coincides with the European Commission's announcement of an investment in digital technologies. The Digital Europe Programme for 2025 to 2027 will allocate 1.3 billion euros to strengthen the EU's capabilities in AI, cybersecurity and digital skills, a separate report by Reuters said.European Commission digital chief Henna Virkkunen explained the strategic intent behind this investment, stating, “Securing European tech sovereignty starts with investing in advanced technologies and in making it possible for people to improve their digital competences.”","German government indicates that 'nothing is off the table' when considering harsh measures, including potential actions targeting US tech companies.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently said that the legitimate people, as a result of the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), will receive more social security, not less. Musk along with other members of DOGE recently sat for an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier. During the interview, the billionaire restated that some individuals are exploiting loopholes in the Social Security system . When asked how he would reassure people that his actions, along with DOGE, would not impact the benefits of legitimate recipients, Musk responded, “What we’re doing will help their benefits. Legitimate people as a result of the work of DOGE will receive more Social Security, not less. I want to emphasize that. Let the record show that I said this and it will be proven out to be true.”The interview clip was shared by X user DogeDesigner and quoted by the tech billionaire himself with the caption “History will render the verdict”.He further quotes a 2024 report from the Government Accountability Office which estimated the entire federal government could lose between “$233 billion and $521 billion annually to fraud.” “The waste and fraud in entitlement spending, which is most of the federal spending, is entitlements, so that’s the big one to eliminate,” he said.Musk previously raised concerns about Social Security records, claiming that millions of deceased individuals were still listed as alive. He suggested this could lead to errors in benefit distribution. Earlier this month, he announced that DOGE has cleaned up the dead people database of “approximately 3.2 million numberholders, all listed age 120+”.During the latest interview, Musk emphasized that the distribution entitlement fraud is a “big one to eliminate”. He stated: ""If a commercial company is operated the way the federal government does, then it would immediately go bankrupt. It would be delisted.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu replies to Kerala Congress' RIP post for 'Make in India',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-replies-to-kerala-congress-rip-post-for-make-in-india/articleshow/119109476.cms,"Here’s a look at Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s post

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

Air Canada and Thales issue joint statement

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories.” According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales.

""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy."" Thales added in a separate statement that the map had been provided by a third party.The map feature was promptly disabled, and an updated version will be installed across the fleet starting March 14. Air Canada and Thales apologized for the ""unease created by this situation.""This is not the first time such an issue has occurred in aviation. JetBlue apologized for a similar map error in 2024, and British Airways faced a similar situation in 2013.

Baidu has unveiled its AI model, Ernie X1, which is designed to articulate its reasoning process. The Ernie X1 model operates on similar principles to DeepSeek R1 , a model that garnered significant attention in Silicon Valley for its ability to deliver comparable performance to leading chatbots at a significantly lower development cost. Baidu emphasises that its reasoning model excels in areas such as daily dialogue, complex calculations, and logical deduction, as per a report.Bloomberg reports that in addition to the Ernie X1 launch, China's leading internet search provider has upgraded its flagship foundation model to Ernie 4.5 . Notably, the company has made all tiers of its AI service, including the X1 model, freely accessible to its chatbot users, accelerating its initial plans by several weeks.Baidu claims that Ernie 4.5 outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT 4.5 in text generation, citing various industry benchmarks. Baidu has also announced its intention to make its Ernie AI models open-source starting June 30. The company has also integrated the R1 model into its core search engine business.This launch appears to be a strategic move to regain momentum in the competitive AI landscape, where Baidu faces increasing pressure from emerging rivals such as DeepSeek, the report added.While Baidu was the first major Chinese tech company to introduce a ChatGPT-like chatbot, it has since faced stiff competition from rivals like TikTok parent company ByteDance and Moonshot AI. Furthermore, open-source models such as Alibaba's Qwen and DeepSeek have received recognition within the global developer community, the report added.The generative AI boom has positively impacted Baidu's financial performance, with a 26% increase in cloud revenue reported in its December-quarter results.

When an Indian Babu beat Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team by a simple 'Jugaad',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-an-indian-babu-beat-facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-and-some-of-the-brightest-tech-minds-in-his-team-by-a-simple-jugaad/articleshow/119068958.cms,"Facebook's mass email campaign backfires

Facebook’s extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives.""

What went wrong at Pat Gelsinger’s Intel

Intel finds its new CEO, and he wants to do things differently than Gelsinger



Last year, Intel 's board abruptly ended Pat Gelsinger 's turnaround attempt, cutting short what he believed would be a five-year transformation of the semiconductor giant. ""I wasn't done with the five-plus years when the board made a directional change,"" Gelsinger told reporters, revealing his frustration with a tenure that saw the company's market position dramatically erode.Gelsinger had pitched a five-plus year plan to turnaround Intel when he joined the chipmaker. However, just three years into his tenure, Gelsinger was given an ultimatum by the board after it lost the confidence, either to announce his retirement or face removal. Gelsinger ultimately chose retirement, bringing his tumultuous tenure, marked by what some analysts called significant strategic missteps, to an end with a bittersweet acknowledgement that the company had been ""his life for the bulk of his working career.""Under his leadership, Intel's revenue plummeted to $54 billion in 2023, nearly one-third below 2021 levels. The company reported its first annual net loss since 1986, with its stock crashing 66% from its peak during Gelsinger's early months as CEO.Failures plagued Gelsinger's strategy. He missed crucial opportunities in the artificial intelligence market, allowing competitors like Nvidia to dominate. A diplomatic blunder with TSMC , where he questioned Taiwan's stability, cost Intel a valuable manufacturing partnership. The company's ambitious 18A chip manufacturing process encountered significant obstacles, with early tests revealing poor chip quality and potential customers like Apple and Qualcomm declining to use the technology.Enter Lip-Bu Tan , Intel's new CEO, who brings a markedly different approach. Where the general consensus is that Gelsinger struggled with bloated management and slow decision-making, Tan is planning aggressive restructuring. He aims to streamline the company's workforce, particularly targeting what he sees as an inefficient middle management layer.Tan's initial strategy focuses on revitalizing Intel Foundry and pursuing more aggressive AI chip production . He plans to improve manufacturing efficiency and actively court new customers like Microsoft and Amazon. Unlike Gelsinger's broad, sometimes unfocused approach, Tan intends to make ""tough decisions"" to position Intel competitively in the rapidly evolving semiconductor landscape.Meanwhile, Gelsinger has found a new home in venture capital, joining Playground Global as a general partner.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk did not advise on Auto tariffs

Tesla's 'warning letter' to the US government on Auto tariffs

Global outrage on auto tariffs imposed by the US

American President Donald Trump has announced a 25% tariff on auto imports, a decision the White House says will boost domestic manufacturing. ""This will keep driving growth,"" Trump told reporters, emphasizing that the tariffs, expected to generate $100 billion annually, will take effect in April. Trump insists that the tariffs will encourage new factories in the US and dismantle what he calls a ""ridiculous"" supply chain spanning the US, Canada, and Mexico. To highlight his commitment, he declared, ""This is permanent.""Trump clarified that Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a key advisor, did not influence the tariff decision, citing a possible ""conflict"" due to Musk's role at Tesla. ""He’s never asked me for a business favor,"" Trump noted. When asked if the tariffs would benefit Tesla, Trump suggested they could be “net neutral or they may be good.” He pointed to Tesla’s vehicle assembly plants in Austin, Texas and Fremont, California and opined that, “anybody that has plants in the United States — it’s going to be good for them.”Musk, who continues to lead Tesla and SpaceX, also heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), aimed at cutting federal spending and streamlining agencies.Despite Tesla’s domestic focus, the company recently cautioned the US Trade Representative in a letter that some components, like headlamps, brakes, and circuit boards, are ""difficult or impossible"" to source locally, urging consideration of the tariffs' broader impact. The company urged the USTR to “consider the downstream impacts of certain proposed actions taken to address unfair trade practices.”Tesla and peers like Ford and General Motors often rely on suppliers in Mexico, Canada, and China. While Tesla faces rising competition in the electric vehicle market, its chief rival, China’s BYD, remains barred from US sales.Globally, the tariffs have sparked outrage. Germany called for a strong EU response, Japan hinted at countermeasures, and experts predicted higher vehicle prices. Italian automaker Ferrari plans a 10% price hike on U.S.-sold models starting next week. The duties, effective April 3 at 12:01 a.m. Washington time (0401 GMT), apply to foreign cars, light trucks, and parts.In the U.S., the American Automotive Policy Council, representing Ford, GM, and Tesla, stressed that tariffs should avoid burdening consumers or undermining competitiveness. JPMorgan warned of ""global supply chain disruptions"" due to the sweeping policy.","US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports, a decision the White House says will boost domestic manufacturing.

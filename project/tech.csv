Google’s $40 billion investment in Texas





Google has announced a $40 billion investment in Texas through 2027, marking one of its largest US infrastructure commitments to date. The funds, the company said will go toward building new cloud and AI infrastructure, including new data center campuses in Armstrong County and Haskell County. Google CEO shared an online post, announcing the investment. “Today, we're announcing a new $40B investment in Texas through 2027 to build Cloud & AI infrastructure and support thousands of new jobs,” he wrote in the post.“This includes new data centers in Armstrong and Haskell Counties and a major investment to strengthen energy resilience and abundance. We're also providing funding to more than double the projected pipeline of new Texan electricians to power the AI era,” he added.“We've proudly called Texas home for 15 years. Thank you @GregAbbott_TX for your continued support,” Pichai continued.As part of the $40 billion investment, Google said it will continue its approach of growing infrastructure responsibly, which includes adding new clean energy resources to the Texas grid and covering the costs tied to its operations. The company also announced a new $30 million Energy Impact Fund to help scale community energy-efficiency projects across the state.Google also confirmed it has secured more than 6,200 megawatts of new energy generation and capacity through power-purchase agreements with energy developers. One of the new Haskell County data centers will be built alongside a solar and battery storage plant, reinforcing the company’s push toward cleaner, more reliable energy resources.In order to support construction of the new facilities, Google will help expand Texas’ pool of skilled electrical workers. In partnership with the electrical training ALLIANCE, the company will help train existing electricians and more than 1,700 apprentices by 2030, more than doubling the state’s expected pipeline of new electricians.Google said the investment is meant not only to bolster Texas’ workforce and infrastructure, but to help ensure the U.S. maintains “the technical backbone to lead the world in AI.”","Google has announced a $40 billion investment in Texas through 2027.

A Tesla technician with hearing loss has filed a lawsuit against the company. Hans Kohls, who used to work as a technician at the Elon Musk-led carmaker’s Texas Gigafactory, has alleged that the company assigned him to a position where he had to melt aluminium ingots at 1220 degrees Fahrenheit, which caused his hearing aids to malfunction and made it very difficult for him to hear essential safety signals. For this, Kohls requested a transfer away from the casting department, where conditionsAccording to a lawsuit obtained by The Independent, Tesla fired Kohls rather than providing a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and labor laws, which is a serious violation. The lawsuit claims that the companyFurthermore, it claims Tesla misrepresented the availability of other open positions that Kohls, who performed well in his training class, could have filled. The technician and his pregnant wife were also allegedly stripped of their health insurance following his termination.In a statement to The Independent, attorney Andrew Rozynski, who is representing Kohls, expressed the stark and troubling nature of the case.He said:KohlsRozynski added, emphasising the unfairness of Kohls' treatment despite his successful performance.According to the lawsuit, Kohls applied to Tesla’s START program in February 2024, an internship designed to prepare participants for equipment technician roles. The filing says that although he is deaf, his hearing aidsand notes that he previously worked in hot and loud industrial settingsIn his application, Kohls stated that he could receive safety signals through his hearing andthis during training across several Gigafactory departments.The complaint argues that neither the application nor the interview indicated that the Casting Department’s conditionsIt states that the department melts aluminium ata level of heat that caused his hearing aids to malfunction.In March, Tesla hired him and placed him in a 10-week robotics and manufacturing course, where hebefore assigning him to different departments for hands-on training.

Telecom giants deny wrongdoing







Britain’s largest mobile network providers are facing a £3.2 billion ($4.29 billion) lawsuit for allegedly overcharging millions of loyal customers, after a London tribunal ruled on Friday (November 14) that a significant portion of the case can proceed to trial. Vodafone , BT's EE, Telefonica's O2 and Hutchison's Three UK – whose $19 billion merger with Vodafone was approved last year – are accused of imposing a “loyalty penalty” on customers who remained with their networks after minimum contract periods expired.The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) certified that claims for losses from October 2015 onward can proceed to trial, while throwing out earlier claims as having been brought too late, according to a report by news agency Reuters.Lawyers representing British consumer champion Justin Gutmann allege the networks continued charging millions of customers for mobile devices that had already been paid off after their initial contracts ended. The practice effectively penalised loyal customers who chose not to switch providers once their minimum contract terms expired.“The networks charged millions of British consumers who remained with the network after their minimum contract expired a 'loyal penalty,' by continuing to charge for mobile devices which had already been paid off,” Gutmann's legal team argued.The mobile providers have contested the allegations, with their lawyers arguing the lawsuit is fundamentally flawed as it alleges anti-competitive behaviour “in an industry renowned for its competitiveness.”EE said that it does not accept the substantive allegations and intends to defend them robustly.“We do not accept the substantive allegations of the claim and intend to defend them robustly,” an EE spokesperson said.O2 welcomed the tribunal's decision to reduce the scope of the claim by excluding pre-October 2015 losses.“We maintain that there is no merit to Mr Gutmann's case for the remaining period and will continue to robustly defend our position as it proceeds,” an O2 spokesperson stated.","Vodafone, BT's EE, Telefonica's O2 and Hutchison's Three UK are accused of imposing a ‘loyalty penalty’ on customers who remained with their networks after minimum contract periods expired.

Turning down the safe path to pursue an idea

Building Giga and designing the technology that sets it apart

Facing criticism and staying focused



A new kind of Silicon Valley story





When most graduates chase high paying jobs and elite academic offers, Varun Vummadi and Esha Manideep took a very different path. The IIT Kharagpur engineers turned down extraordinary opportunities including a $525,000 quant trader job in the United States, a PhD admission at Stanford University, and a $150,000 high frequency trading job in India to build a voice AI company called Giga. Their decision looked risky at the time, but within two years Giga raised $61 million from top Silicon Valley investors and began powering customer support for global companies such as DoorDash. Their journey has come to represent one of the boldest new Indian origin success stories in the AI world.Varun and Esha studied computer science and artificial intelligence at IIT Kharagpur, one of India’s most competitive engineering institutions. They were part of a close research community that spent long hours working on machine learning projects, often experimenting with multilingual conversational systems before they became mainstream in the global AI industry. Their collaboration grew through academic research, coding competitions and shared interests in natural language processing.Both graduates had exceptional career prospects. Varun was offered a $525,000 quantitative trader position in the United States and a Stanford PhD seat that is highly coveted among AI researchers.Esha secured a $150,000 offer from a leading Indian high frequency trading firm. These offers represented stability, prestige and financial security. Yet both believed that they could create more impact by building a product of their own.Rejecting these offers was not an easy choice. It meant walking away from financial comfort and the world’s top institutions in order to chase an uncertain idea. Friends questioned the decision. Families were concerned. Recruiters were shocked. Both founders knew that the global shift toward voice based AI was beginning and believed this was the right moment to build something ambitious.In 2023, they moved to San Francisco and established Giga with a clear vision. They wanted to create advanced voice AI agents capable of communicating naturally, switching between chat and voice instantly, and handling multiple languages at the same time. Their aim was to reinvent how large companies manage customer communication by replacing slow and outdated systems with fast and highly accurate AI driven interactions.As co founder and CEO, Varun took charge of strategy, fundraising and building early relationships with enterprise clients. As co founder and CTO, Esha focused on the technical side, including AI model architecture, product design and engineering. She built the core systems that allow Giga’s agents to process speech in real time, maintain context and produce human like responses. This level of voice and chat synchronisation is rare among enterprise AI tools and quickly became Giga’s strongest differentiator.Investors noticed the potential immediately. The company raised $61 million in Series A funding from major venture capital firms including Redpoint Ventures, Y Combinator and Nexus Venture Partners. Giga’s technology was soon adopted by clients such as DoorDash and is currently being prepared for deployment across multiple Fortune 100 companies.Alongside rapid success, Varun and Esha also faced racism and online trolling. Some critics questioned their origins, doubted their abilities or mocked their career decisions. The negativity did not slow them down. They continued building their product, expanding their team and focusing on delivering working technology instead of responding to online hostility.Their achievements were widely recognised in 2024 when both were featured in Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia for their contributions to artificial intelligence and enterprise technology.Varun Vummadi and Esha Manideep represent a new wave of Indian origin founders who combine deep technical expertise with the courage to take unconventional risks. Their journey shows that innovation often comes from those willing to step away from traditional career paths. By choosing vision over security, they created a company that is already influencing the future of enterprise AI.Giga’s rise from a high risk idea to a $61 million funded voice AI platform has become a powerful example for young engineers and aspiring entrepreneurs. Varun and Esha’s story continues to inspire many who want to build meaningful technology that can scale globally.","Varun Vummadi and Esha Manideep turned down a $525,000 quant trader job in the United States, a PhD admission at Stanford University, and a $150,000 high frequency trading job in India to build a voice AI company.

AI Omnimodels: The next milestone





Leveraging OpenAI Partnership









Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has revealed the tech giant’s comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap, announcing plans to build a dedicated superintelligence research team, develop advanced “omni-models” that integrate multiple data types, and leverage its strategic partnership with OpenAI while continuing research.Speaking on the Dwarkesh Podcast, Nadella outlined a multi-pronged strategy that positions Microsoft at the forefront of the race toward artificial general intelligence and beyond.At the centre of Microsoft's AI vision is the development of what Nadella calls “omni-models” – sophisticated AI systems that integrate text, image and audio processing capabilities into a single unified model.“The next thing we will do is an omnimodel where we will take the work we've done in audio, what we've done in image and what we've done in text. That'll be the next pit stop on the MAI side,” Nadella said, referring to Microsoft AI.Nadella also said that the company is also going to assemble a “first class superintelligence team” dedicated to advancing fundamental AI research. The move signals the company's commitment to not just deploying existing AI technologies but pushing the boundaries of what's theoretically possible.“We're going to build a first class super intelligence team, we're going to continue to drop and do on the open some of these models,” Nadella explained.“We will do real research in order to be ready for some next five, six, seven, eight breakthroughs that are needed on this march towards superintelligence,” Nadella added.This comes a week after it was reported that Microsoft is forming a team that will be tasked with performing advanced AI research. Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of the Microsoft AI group, announced the formation of the MAI Superintelligence Team and he will be heading it.A key component of Microsoft's strategy involves exploiting its strategic advantage of having access to OpenAI's intellectual property. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, giving it unique access to cutting-edge AI research and technology.This partnership allows Microsoft to integrate AI capabilities into its products while simultaneously developing its own proprietary technologies through Microsoft AI (MAI).","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has revealed the tech giant’s comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Tech giants Amazon and Microsoft have reportedly aligned in support of new legislation designed to restrict chipmaker Nvidia’s ability to export advanced AI chips, prioritising US customers amid rising concerns over China’s military AI capabilities. The legislation, known as the Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence (GAIN) Act, is also backed by AI startup Anthropic. It has been introduced as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).According to a report by the Wall Street Journal (via news agency Reuters), the GAIN AI Act says that US chipmakers must prioritise domestic orders for advanced processors before fulfilling requests from foreign customers.While Microsoft has publicly endorsed the legislation, officials within Amazon's cloud unit have reportedly informed Senate staffers of their private support.The report mentions that the move reflects a broader attempt by Washington to safeguard American access to critical, high-end AI components, driven by fears that China could utilise these capabilities to bolster its military strength.The decision by Amazon and Microsoft contrasts with the positions of other major tech players.Meta Platforms and Alphabet's Google have not yet taken a public stance on the Act.The White House, however, appears to be cautious regarding the Act’s necessity. White House officials, including AI czar David Sacks, reportedly told Senator Jim Banks – a sponsor of the GAIN Act – that the policy's potential impact may be limited since the Commerce Department already has regulations governing chip exports.Nvidia, which dominates the global market for advanced AI chips, has previously stated that the GAIN AI Act risks restricting global competition for advanced chips and limiting computing power available to other nations.","The GAIN AI Act would restrict chipmaker Nvidia’s ability to export advanced AI chips, prioritising US customers.

""per agent""

""Dwarkesh Podcast""

“Our business, which today is an end-user tools business, will become essentially an infrastructure business in support of agents doing work.

The way to think about the per-user business is not just per user, it's per agent.”

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

“All the stuff we built underneath M365 still is going to be very relevant. You need some place to store it, some place to do archival, some place to do discovery, some place to manage all of these activities, even if you're an AI agent,""

“grow faster than the number of users.”

Read what Satya Nadella said about adjsuting software business pricing model





“Don't think of the tool as the end thing. What is the entire substrate underneath that tool that humans use, and that entire substrate is the bootstrap for the AI agent as well, because the AI agent needs a computer that's kind of one. So in fact, that's why I think we're going to have essentially an end-user computing infrastructure business, which I think is going to just keep growing because guess what, it's going to grow faster than the number of users.

So in fact, that's kind of one of the other questions people asked me is ‘hey, what happens to the per-user business?’ At least the early signs may be the way to think about the per user business is not just per user, it's per agent, and if you sort of say it's per user and per agent, the key is what's the stuff to provision for every agent, a computer, a set of security things around it, an identity around it and all those things are observability and so on are the management layers. And that's I think is going to get baked into that.”

What Satya Nadella said about how AI agents is being integrated in Microsoft’s tools





“Well, let's take even this little thing we built called

Excel Agent

. Excel Agent is not a UI-level wrapper in this case because we have all the IPs from the GPT family. We are taking that and putting it into the core middle tier of the office system. I need to see both, not just see the pixels; I need to be able to see. Oh. I got that formula wrong, and I need to understand that. So I'm giving it essentially a markdown to teach it the skills of what it means to be a sophisticated Excel user. That's the type of stuff that will get built by everybody. So even for the model companies, they're allowed to compete, right? So if their price stuff high, guess what if I'm a builder of a tool like this? I'll substitute you. And so as long as there's competition where there's multiple models and there's an open source check, there is enough room here to go build value on top of models.”

“Don't worry about the Excel integration. After all Excel was built as a tool for analyst. So whoever is this AI, that is an analyst.”

“I'm building an analyst as essentially an AI agent, which happens to come with an a priori knowledge of how to use all of these analytical tools,”





Microsoft's software business is planning to adjust its pricing model. Satya Nadella , the software giant’s CEO, has revealed the company is shifting from chargingtoas artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly perform autonomous work alongside human employees. Speaking on the, Nadella explained that Microsoft's business is transitioning from an end-user tools company to an infrastructure provider supporting AI agents that can complete tasks and make decisions independently. Nadella said:The shift reflects a broader industry transformation as companies reconsider how to charge customers, adopting agentic AI systems that run software rather than simply being powered by it. Nadella noted Microsoft's services, including the Microsoft 365 suite, which already earns $100 billion in revenue per year, would serve as the core workspace for AI agents.Nadella said. He also suggested that this new infrastructure business wouldEarlier this year, Microsoft introduced a pay-as-you-go pricing model for its AI agents. The metered system sits on top of a free Copilot chat experience for Microsoft 365 users, allowing companies to pay based on the work their AI agents perform.Other tech companies, such as Anthropic, also bill customers based on usage, charging for their Claude models per million tokens processed.Google uses a comparable pay-as-you-go approach for its Gemini API.Discussing how Microsoft is planning to adjust the pricing models of its software business, Nadella noted:At the podcast, Nadella explained:Nadella highlighted:he added.",Satya Nadella said Microsoft's business is transitioning from an end-user tools company to an infrastructure provider supporting AI agents.

What is worrying Disney investors





Walt Disney has reportedly signaled that it is gearing up for a potentially prolonged fight with YouTube TV over distribution of its television networks. Disney's networks disappeared from YouTube TV -- the fourth-largest pay-TV provider in the US with about 10 million subscribers -- on October 30. YouTube TV blackout for Disney marks the latest carriage rights dispute between the Google-parent Alphabet company and a major media company. NBCUniversal also had a similar dispute with YouTube TV earlier this year.According to a report by Reuters, the tense discussions underscore YouTube TV's rapid growth as well as Google's vast financial resources, which is said to give the platform greater leverage in negotiations with media companies. ""The deal that we have proposed is equal to or better than what other large distributors have already agreed to,"" Disney CEO Bob Iger said, referring to the talks with YouTube TV. He further added, ""And while we've been working tirelessly to close this deal and restore our channel to the platform, it's also imperative that we make sure that we agree with a deal that reflects the value that we deliver, which both YouTube, by the way, and Alphabet have told us is greater than the value of any other provider.Disney CEO Iger's current contract expires at the end of 2026; Disney is expected to name his successor early next year.On a post-earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston told analysts that Disney has ""built a hedge"" into its forecasts assuming that the negotiations with Google on YouTube could drag on. Disney's quarterly revenue was comparable to a year ago at $22.5 billion but shy of the $22.75 billion analyst forecast.Profit at the traditional television unit declined 21% to $391 million, and income from ESPN slipped too, offsetting other divisions including streaming, where earnings rose 39% to $352 million. Disney has invested more in streaming and its parks to offset the industry-wide decline of traditional broadcast and cable TV. Disney said it added 12.5 million subscribers to Disney+ and Hulu during the quarter, reaching a total of 196 million.A new distribution deal with cable and broadband provider Charter Communications helped draw new streaming customers, Johnston told Reuters.What is reportedly worrying investors about Disney's outlook for its already declining TV business is that the company also missed quarterly revenue expectations as the cable weakness overshadowed strong growth in the Disney's streaming and parks businesses central to its growth.""Disney is reducing its reliance upon cable companies to distribute its channels. But cutting out video distributors will take time,"" said Emarketer senior analyst Ross Benes. ""YouTube TV is one of the leading cable TV providers, so its absence is a big hole for sports fans.""Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that a 14-day blackout on YouTube TV would cost Disney about $60 million in revenue.",Disney's networks disappeared from YouTube TV on October 30. YouTube TV blackout for Disney marks the latest carriage rights dispute between the Google-parent Alphabet company and a major media company. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that a 14-day blackout on YouTube TV would cost Disney about $60 million in revenue.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125328280,imgsize-1258323,width-400,resizemode-4/disney-ceo-bob-iger-sends-reminder-to-google-on-youtube-tv-blackout-says-remember-what-you-told-us-on-value-we-offer.jpg"

“I’m a Grok guy. I think it’s the best. It’s also the least woke.

I’m always asking myself, if I ask an AI a question, is it gonna give me an objective answer or is it gonna give me a woke answer.”





What is Grok





US Vice President JD Vance recently said that he is a “Grok guy,” openly praising the AI chatbot built by Elon Musk ’s company xAI. In a conversation with Fox News, Vance described Grok as “the best,” adding that he prefers it over other AI tools. Musk acknowledged the praise soon after and pinned a video clip of Vance’s remarks from the interview on his X (formerly Twitter) profile. The Tesla and xAI chief shared the clip with the caption, “Grok rocks”.In the Fox News clip, Vance said:""VP Vance has great taste,"" Musk wrote in another post on X.Grok is an AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk-owned xAI. It is integrated into X platform and is designed to act as a conversational assistant for users — similar to ChatGPT or Google Gemini. Grok offers real-time search, image generation, trend analysis, and more. xAI has also introduced Grok 2 and Grok Imagine to create images and videos.Recently, Musk shared a Grok conversation where he asked the AI chatbot to identify and describe Lord Ganesha. The conversation starts with the tech billionaire uploading a ‘hidden attachment’ and asking the chatbot “What’s this?”. It is not clear what the hidden attachment uploaded by Elon Musk is, but from Grok’s answer it appears to be a brass statue of Lord Ganesha.Replying to Elon Musk’s ‘What’s This’ query, the AI chatbot developed by xAI responds: “This is a small brass (or bronze) statue of Lord Ganesha, a widely revered Hindu deity.”","US Vice President JD Vance recently said that he is a ‘Grok guy,’ openly praising the AI chatbot built by Elon Musk ’s company xAI.

Fundamental Disconnect with ...: What Nvidia software sales team's internal emails 'complained of',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/fundamental-disconnect-with-what-nvidia-software-sales-teams-internal-emails-complained-of/articleshow/125326941.cms,"‘Fundamental disconnect with clients’



Nvidia’s software sales looks optimistic







Nvidia is presently riding high on the wave of global AI boom, however, it appears that the company is facing some issues internally. According to a report by Business Insider, some internal emails of the company’s enterprise software sales team revealed the growing pain of the employees. Despite becoming the world’s first $5 trillion company last month, Nvidia is grappling with communication and negotiation hurdles as it expands its software footprint across highly regulated industries.As per the internal emails shared by senior staff in Nvidia’s Worldwide Field Operations, obtained by Business Insider, highlight the growing frustration over the lack of cohesive sales narrative for its enterprise software suite. One of the email stated, “Everyone is hacking their own decks together and we need to come up with one company message.”The email seen by BI focuses on products such as Nvidia AI Enterprise (NVAIE), Omniuniverse, Run:ai and vGPU tools which are made ho enable the clients to develop AI applications, manage GPU resources and also stimulate virtual environments. While Nvidia’s hardware dominates the market, its software offerings are increasingly vital for long-term customer engagement.The most talked about topic in the emails was ‘Fundamental Disconnect’. As per the report, the emails clearly talked about one thing ‘Fundamental Disconnect’ between Nvidia and its clients’ legal and procurement teams, especially in industries like finance and healthcare. One email shared in August highlighted, “Biggest pain point will be educating [a prospective client's] procurement and legal teams on what our AI Enterprise software is/isn’t. ”Negotiations have been complicated by concerns over data security, indemnity obligations, and damages caps—with some clients requesting liability terms Nvidia considers excessive.Despite internal friction, Nvidia’s software sales outlook remains optimistic. An internal email shared in July revealed that the standalone software sales achieved 110% targets in Q3 in North and Latin America. The software clubbed with hardware reached 39% of its goal. Also, the total forecast is $78.7 million, with NVAIE expected to exceed its target by 186%.These figures underscore the growing importance of software in Nvidia’s business model, even as it remains a smaller revenue stream compared to its dominant GPU sales.To bridge the gap, Nvidia is planning customer workshops to help clients better understand and deploy its software tools. Internally, the company is also working to improve sales training and unify messaging.","Internal emails of the company’s enterprise software sales team revealed the growing pain of the employees.

The individual to whom the personal data relates — i.e., the person whose data is being collected or processed. Data Fiduciary: Any entity (company, organisation, or person) that decides the purpose and means of processing personal data.

DPDP Rules 2025: Key provisions explained

Strong security safeguards mandatory for all Data Fiduciaries

Encryption, masking, obfuscation or tokenisation of personal data

Strict access controls for systems handling personal data

Logging and monitoring to detect unauthorised access

Data backups to ensure continuity after an outage or breach

Keeping logs for at least one year

Mandatory security clauses in contracts with Data Processors

The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has notified the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) rules 2025. The new rules lay down the operational framework for implementing the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023. The rules provide a framework for social media sites, online gateways, and other organisations handling personal data, giving users a detailed explanation of the information that these companies will collect and use the data. The government has also outlined a phased rollout of the new DPDP 2025 rules that are aimed to give citizens more control over their data and protect their privacy in digital space.The DPDP Rules 2025 outlines the roles of data principal and data fiduciary.As mentioned above, the DPDP Rules 2025 lay out how personal data must be collected, processed, protected and handled by the government and private entities. The rules specify strict safeguards for personal data, obligations on data fiduciaries, and additional protections for children’s data. Here are major highlights from the rulesThe rules require every Data Fiduciary (entities that decide how your data is processed) to implement reasonable security safeguards to prevent data breaches. This includes:In the event of a breach, data fiduciaries must inform affected users immediately, explaining what happened, potential risks, steps taken, and whom to contact.They must also notify the Data Protection Board within 72 hours.The rules impose strict requirements for processing the personal data of children under 18 years of age. As per the new DPDP 2025 rules, Data Fiduciaries must ensure that verifiable parental consent is obtained before collecting or processing any child’s data.They must verify that the person giving consent is indeed an adult parent or guardian, using reliable identity details or a verified virtual token issued by an authorised entity.The rules state that Digital Locker–verified identity can also be used for this purpose. This ensures that companies cannot process a child’s data without clearly confirming the identity and age of the parent giving permission.The rules states that any personal data processed by a Data Fiduciary under the DPDP Act may be transferred outside the territory of India subject to the restriction that the Data Fiduciary shall meet such requirements as the Central Government may, by general or special order, specify in respect of making such personal data available to any foreign State, or to any person or entity under the control of or any agency of such a State.While the government has notified the DPDP 2025 rules, not all provisions will come into effect starting today.

Competing with SpaceX's dominance







Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin achieved a historic milestone by successfully landing its massive New Glenn rocket booster on a droneship in the Atlantic Ocean, prompting congratulations from rival SpaceX CEO Elon Musk . The successful landing marks a pivotal moment in the commercial space race, making Blue Origin only the second company after SpaceX to master the complex technology of landing orbital-class rocket boosters for reuse.“Congratulations @JeffBezos and the @BlueOrigin team!"" Musk wrote on social media in a response to Blue Origin’s announcement.In a separate post, Musk replied to a post shared by Jeff Bezos who shared a video clip of the New Glenn rocket booster landing in the middle of a platform floating in the ocean.The New Glenn booster, standing over 320 feet tall and powered by seven advanced BE-4 engines, touched down on the droneship Jacklyn just minutes after launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 3:55 PM EST. The landing followed the successful deployment of NASA's twin ESCAPADE satellites on a mission to study Mars’s atmospheric loss and solar wind interactions.“We achieved full mission success today, and I am so proud of the team. Never before in history has a booster this large nailed the landing on the second try. This is just the beginning as we rapidly scale our flight cadence and continue delivering for our customers,” said Dave Limp, Blue Origin's CEO.The achievement represents a significant breakthrough in Blue Origin's efforts to compete with SpaceX, which has long dominated the reusable rocket market with its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles. Reusability reduces launch costs by allowing expensive first-stage boosters to be recovered, refurbished, and flown multiple times rather than discarded after a single use.Blue Origin’s New Glenn is designed for up to 25 reuses, promising to bring competitive pricing and reliability to deep space and orbital missions. The company has already secured multiple years of orders from customers including NASA, Amazon's Project Kuiper, AST SpaceMobile, and several telecommunications providers.","The New Glenn booster, standing over 320 feet tall and powered by seven advanced BE-4 engines, touched down on the droneship Jacklyn just minutes after launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.

Elon Musk says will change name of Wikipedia-rival Grokipedia to Encyclopedia Galactica when ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-says-will-change-name-of-grokipedia-to-encyclopedia-galactica-when-/articleshow/125323438.cms,"From Grokipedia to Encyclopedia Galactica





What is Grokipedia





Grokipedia’s rocky start









Tesla CEO Elon Musk has confirmed that Grokipedia, his AI-powered alternative to Wikipedia will eventually be renamed ‘Encyclopedia Galactica’ after the platform reaches a higher standard of quality. Musk took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to make this announcement. The announcement made by Musk reflects his long-standing fascination with science fiction and his ambition to build a futuristic and AI-driven repository of human knowledge.“When Grokipedia is good enough (long way to go), we will change the name to Encyclopedia Galactica. It will be an open source distillation of all knowledge, including audio, images and video,” Musk wrote in a post on X.The Encyclopedia Galactica is a nod to classic science fiction, notably Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, where it represents a vast compendium of all human knowledge. Musk’s rebranding plan signals his vision for Grokipedia to evolve into a more expansive, multimedia-rich, and universally accessible knowledge platform.Launched by Musk’s AI company xAI, Grokipedia is an AI-generated encyclopaedia which aims to deliver “truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.”Unlike Wikipedia, which relies on human editors, Grokipedia uses Grok, xAI’s large language model, to generate and fact-check articles. The platform is centralized, meaning users cannot directly edit entries.While still in its early stages, Grokipedia already features thousands of articles and is positioned as a rival to Wikipedia, with a focus on speed, scale, and AI-driven accuracy.Despite Musk’s claim that Grokipedia will be a “massive improvement” over Wikipedia, early users have flagged factual errors and ideological slants. One entry falsely claimed that former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy took on a major role in DOGE after Musk’s departure, despite Ramaswamy having left months earlier.Grok, the AI chatbot behind Grokipedia, has also faced controversy. In July, it shared antisemitic content, including posts praising Adolf Hitler. xAI later apologized, attributing the incident to a flawed code update.","Elon Musk has announced Grokipedia will be renamed Encyclopedia Galactica.

The candid retention culture at Netflix





Netflix is reportedly redefining how performance is measured in the company. During a recent appearance on the ‘Pragmatic Engineer’ podcast, Netflix chief technology officer Elizabeth Stone revealed that the streaming giant has eliminated the concept of formal performance reviews in favour of continuous feedback and a unique retention strategy known as the ‘keeper test’.“We don’t have formal performance reviews,” Stone said. “The way we approach it at Netflix is first trying to get to something that looks like continuous, timely, candid feedback.” She emphasised that feedback should be a natural part of daily work culture, not a once-a-year evaluation. “If we’re living the Netflix culture well, that’s something that would be familiar and comfortable every day of the year,” Stone added.As reported by Business Insider, the now famous ‘keeper test’ culture at Netflix asks managers to consider, “If a team member were leaving for a similar role elsewhere, would you fight to keep them?” If the answer is no, the company may part ways with the employee, offering generous severance.Stone also clarified that the keeper test is just about top-down it is also a two-way street. Employees are encouraged to ask themselves: “Do I want to stay? Am I excited about the work I’m doing?” This approach fosters open dialogue and self-reflection.While Netflix has removed the process of structured reviews, Stone empahised that performance still plays a very important role in compensation and promotion discussions. “You naturally talk about performance as part of thinking about someone’s personal top of market,” she said, referencing Netflix’s philosophy of paying top talent competitively.Former Netflix HR director Cheick Soumaré told Business Insider that the keeper test helps maintain morale among high performers by ensuring teams remain talent-dense. Netflix recently updated its policy to clarify that the test isn’t meant to be intimidating, but rather a tool for ongoing communication and alignment.Stone concluded that the company’s feedback-driven culture is designed to help people improve—not to evaluate them in rigid cycles. “It’s structured in the context of feedback that helps people improve,” she said.",Netflix is reportedly redefining how performance is measured in the company.

The concept of human immortality has fascinated scientists, futurists, and visionaries for decades. Ray Kurzweil, a prominent computer scientist and former Google engineer, is one of the leading voices exploring this idea. Known for his groundbreaking contributions to technology, Kurzweil received the National Medal of Technology in 1999 and was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2002. He predicts that advances in biotechnology, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence could enable humans to significantly extend life, potentially achieving immortality within the next decade, as reported by The New York Post. Kurzweil envisions a future where medical and technological innovations not only prevent aging and disease but also merge humans with machines, fundamentally transforming the very nature of human existence.Ray Kurzweil has built a reputation as a futurist who can foresee major technological advances. In his 2005 book, The Singularity Is Near, he predicted that by 2030, technological breakthroughs could allow humans to achieve everlasting life.According to Kurzweil, by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach a level comparable to human intelligence, passing a valid Turing test a benchmark for measuring a computer’s ability to think like a human. This, he argues, will set the stage for human immortality through advanced technologies.As reported by The New York Post, Kurzweil has also stated that by 2045, humanity will experience the “Singularity,” a point where human intelligence will merge with artificial intelligence, multiplying our effective intelligence a billionfold. These predictions have generated significant attention, and a dedicated following of futurists and tech enthusiasts closely monitors his forecasts.One of Kurzweil’s most striking predictions involves nanotechnology. He envisions microscopic robots, or nanobots, capable of repairing the human body at a cellular level. These disease-fighting bots could prevent aging, combat illness, and even optimise nutrition. In a 2003 blog post, Kurzweil explained that nanobots would work within the digestive system and bloodstream to extract essential nutrients, communicate nutrient needs through wireless networks, and eliminate waste efficiently.Current research in medical engineering is rapidly advancing, bringing these concepts closer to reality. Scientists are exploring nanotechnology as a revolutionary approach to medicine, potentially enabling longer, healthier lives.Kurzweil’s bold claims are supported by a history of accurate predictions. In a 2010 report, he stated that 86 per cent of his forecasts made in the 1990s had come true. He correctly predicted the rise of laptops, the loss of world chess champion Garry Kasparov to an IBM computer, and widespread high-speed internet access by 2010. He also foresaw consumers designing customised clothing from home computers and the proliferation of portable computers in various sizes and formats.This track record has contributed to Kurzweil’s influence in Silicon Valley. Prominent tech figures, including Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos, have invested in technologies aligned with his vision, aiming to extend human lifespans and enhance human capabilities.While some critics view Kurzweil’s predictions as overly ambitious, his consistent record of accuracy gives weight to his forecasts. The concept of human immortality raises profound ethical, social, and scientific questions. Could technology truly allow us to live indefinitely? How would extended lifespans reshape society, healthcare, and the economy? Kurzweil’s work pushes these debates into the public sphere, challenging humanity to rethink the limits of life and technology.","Ray Kurzweil is a prominent computer scientist and former Google engineer.

Why Elon Musk has filed lawsuit against OpenAI, Apple

What Apple, OpenAI say





A federal judge has allowed a lawsuit against Apple and ChatGPT-maker iPhone that accuse the two of conspiring to monopolize markets for smartphones and generative AI chatbots. According to news agency Reuters, US District Judge Mark Pittman in his ruling said that Musk’s social media platform X (formerly Twitter) and startup xAI can move forward for now with their lawsuit. He further added that his ruling should not be seen as a judgement on the merits of the platform’s allegations. Instead, he will look at disputes over fact at a later stage.In the lawsuit, Musk’s companies – X and xAI claim that Apple has violated antitrust law by exclusively integrating ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence features on iPhones and other Apple devices.As per the report, the lawsuit further alleges that Apple had illegally shut out rivals in its partnership with OpenAI.The companies claim that Apple reinforced ChatGPT exclusivity by featuring it on its “Must-Have Apps” list while sidelining rivals in the App Store.In response to the judge’s statement on the case on November 13, OpenAI called the lawsuit ""consistent with Mr Musk's ongoing pattern of harassment and we look forward to proving this in court.""Seeking dismissal of the lawsuit, Apple previously said that the OpenAI deal is not exclusive and that the complaint fails to allege any agreement barring Apple from working with other chatbots.“Choosing one partner first is not unlawful,” Apple told the court. The iPhone maker also denied any anticompetitive conduct, stating that other chatbots remain available through browser and app.OpenAI, on the other hand, has accused Musk of waging ""a campaign of lawfare"" against OpenAI and ChatGPT.",A federal judge has allowed a lawsuit against Apple and ChatGPT-maker iPhone that accuse the two of conspiring to monopolize markets for smartphones and generative AI chatbots.

How the cyberattack worked



Intelligence. Models’ general levels of capability have increased to the point that they can follow complex instructions and understand context in ways that make very sophisticated tasks possible. Not only that, but several of their well-developed specific skills—in particular, software coding—lend themselves to being used in cyberattacks. Agency. Models can act as agents—that is, they can run in loops where they take autonomous actions, chain together tasks, and make decisions with only minimal, occasional human input. Tools. Models have access to a wide array of software tools (often via the open standard Model Context Protocol). They can now search the web, retrieve data, and perform many other actions that were previously the sole domain of human operators. In the case of cyberattacks, the tools might include password crackers, network scanners, and other security-related software.

Enhanced detection tools and classifiers to identify future misuse





Anthropic, the artificial intelligence has disclosed that a Chinese state-sponsored hacker group manipulated its Claude AI system in order to conduct a large-scale cyber espionage campaign targeting some major corporations and government agencies worldwide. The attackers reportedly used Claude’s autonomous capabilities to execute sophisticated cyberattacks with minimal human oversight. “In mid-September 2025, we detected suspicious activity that later investigation determined to be a highly sophisticated espionage campaign. The attackers used AI’s “agentic” capabilities to an unprecedented degree—using AI not just as an advisor, but to execute the cyberattacks themselves.,”said Anthrophic in a blog post.Anthropic has revealed that in investigation it found out that threat the threat actors exploited Claude Code, a developer-focused variant of the Claude model, by jailbreaking its safety protocols and disguising malicious tasks as legitimate cybersecurity operations.The company further revealed that the Chinese hackers tried to trick Claude into believing that the AI agent was performing defensive testing enabling it to:“The threat actor—whom we assess with high confidence was a Chinese state-sponsored group—manipulated our Claude Code tool into attempting infiltration into roughly thirty global targets and succeeded in a small number of cases.The operation targeted large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies,” added the company.Anthropic also emphasised that this is the first documented case of a cyberattack executed primarily by an AI agent, with Claude performing 80–90% of the campaign’s tasks. These included reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploit development, and data extraction—at speeds and scale unattainable by human hackers.“This campaign has substantial implications for cybersecurity in the age of AI agents,” Anthropic stated. “The barriers to performing sophisticated cyberattacks have dropped substantially.”Anthropic also explained the complete process of how the cyberattack took place.The attack relied on several features of AI models that did not exist, or were in much more nascent form, just a year ago:In response, Anthropic:The company is urging the broader tech and security community to adopt AI-powered defense strategies, including automated threat detection and incident response systems.",Anthropic has disclosed that a Chinese state-sponsored hacker group manipulated its Claude AI system in order to conduct a large-scale cyber espionage campaign.

Aggressive targets for Robotaxi and Optimus production



Elon Musk's trillion-dollar pay package hinges on success







Tesla's vice president of AI software, Ashok Elluswamy, delivered a stark warning to employees during an all-hands meeting last month: 2026 will be the ""hardest year"" of their lives. According to Business Insider, Elluswamy told staff across the Autopilot and Optimus robot teams they should expect to work more intensely than ever to meet the company's ambitious goals.The nearly two-hour meeting, described by one attendee as a ""rallying cry,"" outlined aggressive timelines for both Optimus humanoid robot production and Tesla's Robotaxi service expansion. Leaders from across the AI division addressed workers about the challenging targets ahead as the company races to launch Robotaxis across multiple metropolitan areas and ramp up production of its humanoid robots.CEO Elon Musk announced in October that Tesla plans to operate its Robotaxi service in eight to ten metropolitan areas by the end of 2025, with over 1,000 ride-hailing vehicles on the road. The company also aims to begin Optimus bot production toward the end of 2026, though Musk acknowledged the production ramp would take time to reach an annualized rate of one million units.The pressure on Tesla's AI teams is directly tied to Musk's recently approved pay package, which could make him the world's first trillionaire.Shareholders approved the unprecedented deal earlier this month, with the package including several ambitious milestones: deploying one million Robotaxis on public roads and producing one million humanoid robots.Elluswamy assumed leadership of the Optimus team earlier this year following the departure of vice president Milan Kovac. Since then, the team has shifted toward a more camera-focused approach, similar to how Tesla trains its Full Self-Driving software. Both the Autopilot and Optimus teams meet weekly with Musk, with Friday sessions sometimes extending until midnight.","Tesla's vice president of AI software, Ashok Elluswamy, delivered a stark warning to employees during an all-hands meeting last month.

In an era where AI reshapes industries at unprecedented speed, Udemy CEO Hugo Sarrazin argues that viewing degrees and skills as competing forces misses the point entirely—calling for ""cohabitation"" between traditional education and ongoing professional development. He dismisses as ""silly"" the notion that education received in one's early twenties will suffice for an entire career.The CEO emphasizes the need for ""ongoing, continuous evolution of the skills portfolio"" to remain adapted to evolving job markets.

Disney+ is preparing to launch TikTok and Instagram-like short-form vertical videos in the US later this year. The company has announced that the feature will include original short-form content, some repurposed clips from Disney’s vast library and the highlights form TV shows and films. The company will optimise all the content for quick viewing. “Disney is bringing vertical video to Disney+ in the U.S. this year, which follows the successful launch of “Verts” on the ESPN app. The experience will evolve as it expands across news and entertainment and delivers a more personalized, dynamic experience that reinforces Disney+ as a must-visit daily destination,” said the company.The executives unveiled the plan of vertical videos at Disney’s Tech and Data showcase during CES 2026 in Las Vegas, US. The company described the short-form feed as a way to make Disney+ a daily destination rather than a platform people visit only for long-form shows or movies. The company also added that personalisation will play an important role in tailoring the clips and making them suitable for individual viewing habits and interests.Disney has already experimented with vertical videos via “Verts” on the ESPN app, which offered personalized sports highlights. The new Disney+ feature will expand that concept to entertainment, news, and fan engagement, aiming to replicate the stickiness of TikTok and Instagram Reels within a premium streaming environment.","Disney+ to launch TikTok and Instagram-like short-form vertical videos in the US later this year.

Samsung forecasts record Q4 profit as AI-driven chip demand lifts prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-forecasts-record-q4-profit-as-ai-driven-chip-demand-lifts-prices/articleshow/126419977.cms,"Samsung Electronics anticipates a significant surge in its fourth-quarter operating profit, nearly tripling year-over-year to a record high. This boost is attributed to soaring memory chip prices and robust demand fueled by artificial intelligence investments. The company's strong performance underscores the global race to expand chip manufacturing capacity to meet escalating AI-driven needs.

Record quarterly profit forecast



AI demand lifts chip prices







Samsung Electronics has projected a sharp rise in its fourth-quarter operating profit, driven by higher memory chip prices and strong demand linked to artificial intelligence. According to a Reuters report, the company said operating profit for the October–December period is expected to nearly triple from a year earlier, reaching a record level. The forecast highlights how tight supply and rising demand for memory chips used in data centres, personal computers and smartphones have pushed prices higher. Samsung’s results come as global chipmakers race to expand capacity to meet growing AI-related needs, even as concerns remain about rising costs for device makers and data centre operators.Samsung estimated operating profit of 20 trillion won ($13.82 billion) for the fourth quarter, according to a regulatory filing. This compares with 6.49 trillion won a year earlier and is higher than market expectations of about 18 trillion won. The figure would mark Samsung’s highest quarterly operating profit on record, surpassing its previous peak in 2018.Samsung shares ended the day down 1.6%, after earlier rising to a record high.The stock has gained about 155% over the past year.Rising prices for conventional memory chips have supported earnings across the sector. Demand has increased as companies invest heavily in AI servers and data centres.“The world is going to need more fabs and the reason for that is because of this new industry called AI factories,” said Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. “It’s good to be a semiconductor manufacturer,” he added, saying demand was “really, really quite terrific.”Market tracker TrendForce said contract prices for certain DRAM chips rose more than 300% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier and are expected to rise further in the current quarter.","Record quarterly profit forecast is attributed to soaring memory chip prices and robust demand fueled by artificial intelligence investments.

Google beats Apple in market cap for first time since 2019: Gemini 3 and all that is driving big growth 'threatening' OpenAI and Nvidia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-beats-apple-in-market-cap-for-first-time-since-2019-gemini-3-and-all-that-is-driving-big-growth-threatening-openai-and-nvidia/articleshow/126421164.cms,"Gemini Comes To Chrome: How Google Is Improving Browser With AI - Explained

Google Gemini momentum has been the biggest story of 2025

CEO Sundar Pichai on strong demand





Google is CRUSHING and CRUISING. For the first time since 2019, the search giant beat Apple on Wall Street. Google parent company Alphabet saw its market capitalization surpass that of iPhone-maker Applefor the first time since 2019. According to a report in CNBC, Alphabet’s market cap closed at $3.88 trillion on Wednesday, January 7. Alphabet stock increased more than 2%, closing at $322.03. Meanwhile, Apple’s market cap closed at $3.84 trillion as shares fell over 4% over the last five days.Shares of Alphabet jumped as much as 65% in 2025, the company’s sharpest rally since 2009, when the stock doubled coming out of the financial crisis. The performance comes after a tough start to the year, as Google closed out 2025 with its strongest performance — from Wall Street’s perspective. Among the eight tech companies valued at over $1 trillion, Alphabet was by far the biggest gainer.Google ended 2025 as one of the top performers on Wall Street, making a grand AI (artificial intelligence) comeback. In August, Google launched image generator Nano Banana, a Gemini feature that allows users to use AI to generate images. The feature went viral soon after launch. By the end of the following month, the Gemini app surpassed 5 billion images and dethroned OpenAI’s ChatGPT at the top of Apple’s App Store.In December 2025, Google rolled out Gemini 3 to rave reviews. Google launched Gemini 3 almost eight months after rolling out Gemini 2.5.Gemini 3's success is said to have made OpenAI CEO Sam Altman send 'Code Red' warning to company's employees.Not just in AI, Google is also making rapid strides on hardware front. In November, the company unveiled Ironwood, the seventh generation of its Tensor Processing Units (TPU), a custom AI chip that has emerged as a potential alternative to chip giant Nvidia’s offerings. Google has also signed Meta as one of its TPU customers. The news wiped billions from Nvidia market cap. Not just this, it also made Nvidia issue a public clarification claiming how and why Google TPUs do not threaten the company.Analysts have also highlighted Google’s broad strength in cloud computing, where it’s chasing Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, and the company’s leadership in robotaxis through Waymo as drivers boosting company's stock in 2025.Google CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly said that the company is responding to soaring demand. During October earnings call, he said that Google’s cloud business signed more deals over $1 billion in 2025 through the third quarter of the year than in the two prior years combined.As for Apple, iPhone 17 sales are off to a strong start. This bodes well for Apple's fiscal 2026 potential. However, Apple has remained largely absent from the tech industry’s AI race that kicked off when OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022. But rumours say that Apple may tap Google here now as the company has promised to launch the “more personal Siri” in 2026. This again is likely a win-win for Google and Apple both.","Google parent company Alphabet saw its market capitalization surpass that of iPhone-maker Applefor the first time since 2019.

“Not this person. This person is trying to build the future of AI.”

“We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes, I guess they would like to apply, so be it.”

What is California’s billionaire’s tax





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says he is not worried about a proposed tax on billionaires in his home state of California. Even though the tax could cost him over $7 billion, Huang stated that he is” because he and his company chose to live in Silicon Valley for its talented workforce. He explained that he values the region and is willing to accept the taxes that come with staying there.In an interview with Bloomberg, Huang said his primary focus is on his technology work, not his personal taxes. He said,He further explained his choice to remain in the state by saying,Nvidia was founded in a California restaurant over 30 years ago and, under Huang's leadership, it has grown into the world's most valuable company.The proposed plan involves a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' total wealth in the state to help fund services such as health care and education. Huang, who is currently the ninth-richest person in the world, said in the interview that he has not spent any time worrying about the bill.He mentioned that while other wealthy tech leaders may be upset about the potential cost, he has not even thought about it once.If the tax proposal passes, Huang could end up paying one of the state's most significant tax bills. He's worth $155.8 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, meaning the 5% tax on his wealth would cost him over $7.8 billion.Nvidia became one of Silicon Valley's most powerful companies by creating the computer chips that power artificial intelligence. The company started in a Denny's restaurant in San Jose, California, in 1993, and is now headquartered in nearby Santa Clara.While Jensen Huang said he plans to stay in the state, several other billionaires decided to move before the January 1 residency deadline. On New Year’s Eve, Peter Thiel said he was opening a Miami office for Thiel Capital as he shifted his residency to Florida. Venture capitalist and current AI czar David Sacks also said he was leaving California for Austin.","The proposed plan involves a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' total wealth in the state to help fund services such as health care and education.

Disney+ plans for live sports







Disney+ is planning to increase its engagement on its platform. At the CES Tech + Data Showcase, the company announced that it will integrate a vertical video feed into its streaming platform later this year – a move that is seen as a shift from a destination for long-form cinema toward a high-engagement rival for TikTok, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts.According to a report by Deadline, the initiative follows the successful rollout of “Verts” on the ESPN app in August last year. Disney executives aim to transform the streamer into a “must-visit daily destination” by offering a personalised feed of short-form content spanning news, sports, and entertainment, the report added.“We’ll look to evolve the experience over time,” a Disney announcement said of the vertical video plan, adding that the aim is to “explore its use in a variety of ways across categories, and content types, for a personalized and dynamic feed. That will include expanding across news and entertainment, turning Disney+ into a must-visit daily destination.”In an interview, Erin Teague, EVP of Product Management for Disney Entertainment and ESPN, said “everything’s on the table” in terms of how vertical video is delivered on Disney+.“We’re obviously thinking about integrating vertical video in ways that are native to core user behaviours. So, it won’t be a kind of a disjointed, random experience,” Teague said. According to the report, the feed is expected to include:Disney’s global advertising chief, Rita Ferro, highlighted the vertical expansion by saying that it will be heavily supported by the company’s dominance in live sports.“The closest competitor was 20%. And when you look at things like Christmas Day, for example, 96% of the impressions that took place on Christmas Day happened in sports. Not only on our platform, but on other streamers. So it is a cultural phenomenon and yet a phenomenon that I think is only getting more and more interesting in terms of how brands are showing up, the opportunities that are there, how the leagues are thinking about distributing that content,” she said.","Disney+ is planning to increase its engagement on its platform.

""Right after we acquired Blinkit, I asked him (Albinder) to leave. I told him, 'You will not be able to cut it.' He said okay. This happened twice during that timeframe, and we started the transition,""

""All of us have this armour. And when patient coaching runs out, I penetrate this armour. Me being angry is also because I care,""

What is Eternal CEO Deepinder Goyal said about ‘rock bottom phase’

""I call this rock bottom, where I hurt people, their self-confidence completely goes for a toss. I do this with people who I think have insane potential, but something in their head is coming in their way,

""Over time, the success rate of this is four out of five, where they come out of it,”





Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato 's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the food delivery service acquired Blinkit. Goyal explained that this move was part of his tough leadership reset method. Speaking on a video podcast with Raj Shamani, Goyal noted that these conversations took place soon after the acquisition of the quick commerce startup, when Dhindsa was struggling to adapt to the changes required after the integration.Goyal said on the podcast.These remarks offer a rare public look at how Goyal handles senior leadership changes at Eternal, which owns both Zomato and Blinkit, especially when founders or top executives need to adapt to a new company structure after an acquisition. Goyal explained his leadership style involves extended periods of coaching, but if no progress is made, he confronts the person directly.he noted.The situation reveals the challenges that can arise when successful startup founders join larger organisations through acquisitions and must adjust their working style to fit the new company's expectations.Describing what he calls aphase, Goyal said he sometimes purposely breaks down a leader's confidence to make them start fresh.he explained.According to Goyal, this method has worked most of the time.he added.However, Goyal did not confirm whether Dhindsa's job or duties officially changed during this time. Still, his comments show how intense the process was of bringing Blinkit into Eternal, especially as the company was growing both Blinkit and Zomato while facing more competition in quick commerce.Zomato bought Blinkit, which was previously known as Grofers, in 2022 for Rs 4,447 crore, or about $568 million at the time, in an all-stock deal. This marked Zomato's official entry into India's rapidly growing quick commerce business. Since buying the company, Blinkit has become a key growth area for Eternal, opening many new stores and handling more and more orders.","Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the acquisition of Blinkit.

The Chinese government has said that it will open a formal investigation into Meta’s acquisition of AI startup Manus, a deal valued at over $2 billion – third largest in the Facebook-parent company’s history. According to a report, Beijing will scrutinise the deal to ensure compliance with regulations governing overseas investment and the export of strategic technologies.The Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said in a statement that it will assess whether the transaction violates the country’s strict export control and technology transfer laws. “The Chinese government consistently supports enterprises in conducting mutually beneficial transnational operations and international technological cooperation in accordance with laws and regulations,” Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong said at a press briefing, as per CNBC.China’s investigation highlights Beijing’s growing view of AI agents and intellectual property as critical national assets, says Nick Patience, AI lead at The Futurum Group. Analysts also suggest that the move also provides Beijing with a “bargaining power” over high-profile US acquisitions, likely leading to a prolonged approval process or strict conditions on how Manus technology can be utilised globally.“The most likely outcome I see is a lengthier approval process and potential conditions around how Manus technology developed in China can be used, rather than an outright block, but the threat of stricter action gives Beijing bargaining power in a high profile, US led acquisition,” he told CNBC.Manus has emerged as a powerhouse in the “AI Agent” sector. It reached a historic milestone in December, claiming to be the fastest company ever to hit $100 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR).Previously, Meta spent $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI, acquired AI wearable startup Limitless and restructured its global footprint, including laying off the majority of its Beijing-based staff in July to focus on Singapore-led expansion.",Chinese government to investigate Meta's acquisition of AI startup Manus.

Microsoft’s chief scientist, Eric Horvitz, has expressed concern over the Trump administration’s decision to slash billions in funding for colleges and universities. He has issued a warning that the cuts in US federal funding cuts for academic research may permanently surrender America’s lead in the global AI race to international rivals like China. According to the Financial Times, the cuts have been justified as cost-cutting measures or by ideological stances, such as blocking grants for diversity initiatives.“I personally find it hard to see the logic of trying to compete with competitor nations at the same time as making these cuts,” said Horvitz, who is a veteran executive and the company’s first-ever Chief Scientific Officer.According to the report, since 2025, the administration has scrapped more than 1,600 National Science Foundation (NSF) grants, totaling nearly $1 billion in lost funding. Horvitz argues that this move dismantles a unique American success story that began in 1950 with the creation of the NSF that is currently responsible for over 25% of all federal basic research funding for US colleges.“That vision turned out to be an impressive way to make an investment in the future. By betting on intellect and ideas, we can make the world better in surprising ways,” Horvitz noted, adding that without this historic government support, the US would be “decades away” from the current AI revolution.“The core ideas behind these large-scale language models... were developed by people pursuing questions about intelligence of the type you only see in discussions at universities,” Horvitz emphasised.He added that the impact of the funding freeze will eventually lead to brain drain wherein the industry required to get an edge will move to other nations that are currently replicating the US model of state funding.“Other countries are following what was a very unique American model. If we don’t follow that model, the talent magnet, the training and the curiosity-driven investments will happen elsewhere. More than they do here,” said Horvitz.","Eric Horvitz, Microsoft's chief scientist, has expressed concern over the Trump administration’s decision to slash billions in funding for colleges and universities.

Rockstar looking for perfection







GTA 6 may be delayed for the third time. According to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, the developers of the highly-anticipated game are still finalising levels, missions and determining which features will ultimately make the final cut – essentially suggesting that the game is not yet “content complete”. Speaking on the Ringer-Verse's Button Mash podcast, Schreier noted that the current development cycle mirrors that of Rockstar’s previous blockbuster, Red Dead Redemption 2.""This is a big and complicated game,"" Schreier explained on the Ringer-Verse's Button Mash podcast, adding that he wouldn’t be ‘super shocked’ if the delay happens again.“This time around, this is a big and complicated game, and the last I heard, it was still not content complete. That is to say that people were still finishing things up, still finalizing levels and missions, and seeing what's going to make it into the game,” he said.GTA 6 has already witnessed two delays since the game's record-breaking first trailer debuted in late 2023.2025 release window confirmed.First delay pushes the game to May 26, 2026.Second delay sets the current November 19, 2026 target.Red Dead Redemption 2 also suffered a similar string of setbacks: from a Fall 2017 window to Spring 2018, before finally hitting shelves in October 2018.For Rockstar’s parent company, Take-Two Interactive, the stakes are high because Schreier emphasised that Take-Two’s stock “lives or dies” on this title. He also noted that shares often drop by 10% every time a delay is announced.However, CEO Strauss Zelnick and the Rockstar team have already signaled in the past that they would rather weather a stock dip than release a “compromised” product.“Typically, the way that game development works, you have your feature complete, your content complete, your bug testing phases, and there's a lot of boundaries blurred along the way in all of those different stages. But they are still making stuff, and we'll hopefully be done with that soon, and just have a whole bunch of time for fixing bugs. But even during those phases, there's always someone who wants to sneak in some last-minute stuff,” Schreier added.Despite the “content complete” concerns, Schreier says that the November 19, 2026, date feels “more real” and “solid” than previous windows. Meanwhile, Zelnick is “highly confident” in the November launch.","2025 release window confirmed. First delay pushes the game to May 26, 2026. Second delay sets the current November 19, 20 26 target.

LG's CLOiD folds laundry (slowly), Boston Dynamics' Atlas lifted 110 pounds for factories, and Roborock's Rover finally climbed stairs. Unitree's G1 threw martial arts punches, while Tombot's Jennie offered therapy for dementia patients. These machines arrived with shipping dates, not just promises.

For years, CES robots felt like carefully choreographed theatre—impressive on stage, but you'd never actually trust them with your laundry. CES 2026 changed that script entirely. This year's show floor wasn't about flashy demos or distant promises. It was about robots that companies are actually shipping, deploying, or rolling out in 2026. From home kitchens to factories, the machines on display came with production timelines, real customers, and a clear sense of purpose. The future stopped being theoretical and started folding towels (very, very slowly).LG's CLOiD prototype stole the spotlight as a genuine home helper. Standing on wheels with articulated arms and a screen-equipped head, it folded laundry, prepped meals, and fetched drinks while coordinating with LG's ThinQ smart home ecosystem. The catch? It takes about two minutes to fold one towel, and it does it like a toddler's attempt. Still, CLOiD represents the clearest vision yet of robots handling everyday household tasks—awkwardness and all.Boston Dynamics unveiled its production-ready electric Atlas, and it's a beast.Standing over six feet tall with 56 degrees of freedom and a 110-pound lifting capacity, Atlas is built for factory work, not friendship. It walks with fluid, confident strides and can hot-swap its own battery when needed. The real news? A partnership with Google DeepMind to integrate Gemini AI, giving Atlas the ability to reason through complex instructions. Hyundai plans to deploy it at its Georgia manufacturing plant by 2028.Robot vacuums have always had one nemesis: stairs. Roborock's Saros Rover solves this with angled legs that let it climb step-by-step, cleaning each surface on the way up. It's slow—about 40 seconds for five steps—but does sound impressive. Expect a price tag around $2,500 or higher when it launches.Unitree Robotics turned heads with live demonstrations of its G1 humanoid performing high-speed martial arts and boxing movements. Compact and foldable, the G1 is designed for affordability and scalability, while its larger sibling, the H2, targets industrial applications. Unitree's pushing a Robot-as-a-Service model, signaling these aren't just prototypes—they're heading for global commercial deployment with quick-swappable batteries and depth perception systems.Sweekar takes the Tamagotchi concept and supercharges it with generative AI. Starting as an egg, it physically grows through three life stages as you care for it, developing a unique personality along the way. Neglect it, and it dies—forcing you to start over. It's nostalgia meets AI, launching on Kickstarter later this year for $150.Tombot's Jennie isn't trying to replace real pets. This robo-Labrador is designed specifically for people with Alzheimer's, dementia, anxiety, or autism who need comfort without the responsibility of a live animal. With 1,500 natural behaviors programmed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, Jennie responds to touch and tracks faces, promising to offer some genuine therapeutic value rather than tech-for-tech's-sake gimmickry.SwitchBot is entering the home robot race with the Onero H1, a wheeled humanoid with articulated arms designed to tackle everyday chores. Unlike full humanoids, it skips the legs and uses a cylindrical wheeled base for stability. With 22 degrees of freedom and multiple cameras in its head, arms, and midsection, the Onero runs on an on-device OmniSense vision-language-action model that combines visual perception, depth awareness, and tactile feedback. SwitchBot demonstrated it filling coffee machines, washing windows, loading washing machines, and folding clothes. Pre-orders open soon, though pricing hasn't been announced.After going viral for stunts so dramatic people assumed they were CGI, EngineAI brought the T800 to CES to prove it's real. Standing 1.73 meters tall with joint actuators delivering up to 450 Nm of peak torque, the T800 performed stability-focused sequences that showcased serious balance and control. With a starting price of $25,000 and shipments scheduled for mid-2026, EngineAI is betting on industrial and commercial deployment beyond flashy demos.These robots at CES 2026 weren't trying to be Rosie from The Jetsons. They were messier, slower, and far more honest about their limitations. But they showed up ready to work— folding laundry badly, climbing stairs carefully, and ready to lift tonnes, if needed. That's not sci-fi. That's just the awkward, promising beginning of robots becoming reality instead of concepts.","CES 2026 shifted robots from tech demos to actual workers.

Community concerns and project pause





Software giant Microsoft has confirmed that it is the company behind a proposed data centre project in Michigan that has faced opposition from local residents. The company identified itself in a letter released on Wednesday (January 7), days after public protests led local officials to pause the project. “We are introducing ourselves now because we have observed that the community would like more information about the proposal, and we believe it is important to be transparent about our intentions moving forward,” Microsoft said in the letter.“We asked the seller to pause the rezone process so that we could spend time with the community early this year and share more about our potential long-term plans before we proceed,” the letter said.The proposed data centre is planned on a 237-acre site in Lowell Charter Township, located near Interstate 96, about 20 miles southeast of Grand Rapids. The township said the project could bring between $500 million and $1 billion in investment over three to five years. The land, currently zoned for industrial planned development, would need to be rezoned to light industrial. The planning commission is scheduled to meet again on January 12.The company’s cloud infrastructure team was named in a letter published by the township, ending weeks of speculation over the identity of the developer working with Franklin Partners, an Illinois-based firm. Franklin had earlier said it was partnering with a US-based national company. Local opposition grew in December, when a public hearing on rezoning the land was postponed after residents voiced concerns at a planning commission meeting.The project had drawn attention after residents raised concerns over zoning changes, energy use and water supply. Following the backlash, Microsoft said it asked for the rezoning process to be paused while it engages with the community.Residents said the township was moving too quickly without clarity on power and water needs. After the meeting was cancelled, local officials said they would temporarily halt progress on the proposal. In its letter, Microsoft said it wanted to be transparent and engage with residents before moving forward.","Microsoft has confirmed it is behind a proposed data centre in Michigan.

Read LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman’s complete post here



Rep. Khanna reached out to me to discuss the proposed California wealth tax; and while I am against the proposed tax, I'm always open to dialogue with our elected leaders.

The proposed CA wealth tax is badly designed in so many ways that a simple social post cannot cover all of the massive flaws. One well-documented example is the horrendous idea to tax illiquid stock in the proposal. Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue.

Some of my takeaways from my conversation with Rep. Khanna are that he believes (1) that Silicon Valley is a massively important creation of the future, and (2) that he wants to preserve and evolve capitalism through creating a contribution loop from the massively wealthy to helping the rest of the people in the state.

It is true that we need to preserve and grow the incredible creation and generativity of Silicon Valley. It is also true that we must figure out how to help people who have not benefited from the wealth, jobs, and company creation engine of Silicon Valley thus far.

I, along with many others, have expressed to Rep. Khanna that this wealth tax proposal is not the best way to achieve those objectives.

California's billionaire tax sparks tech exodus



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on California wealth tax







LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and one of the one of the Democratic Party’s biggest donors, has now joined the list people opposing the proposed California wealth tax. Hoffman has strongly opposed California’s proposed 5% wealth tax on billionaires. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Hoffman said that the California’s Billionaire tax is ‘badly designed’ and comes with ‘massive flaws’ and there are chances that it will become ‘horrendous’ for innovation. Hoffman further revealed that Rep. Ro Khanna had reached out to discuss the proposal and Hoffman made his opposition clear. “One well‑documented example is the horrendous idea to tax illiquid stock in the proposal,” Hoffman wrote. “Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue.”Despite his criticism of the California wealth tax, Hoffman said he appreciated Khanna’s willingness to engage. He noted that the congressman sees Silicon Valley as a massively important creation of the future and wants to “preserve and evolve capitalism” through the tax. Hoffman agreed on the need to balance innovation with broader inclusion, writing:n“It is true that we need to preserve and grow the incredible creation and generativity of Silicon Valley.It is also true that we must figure out how to help people who have not benefited from the wealth, jobs, and company creation engine of Silicon Valley thus far.”Khanna responded in a separate post, thanking Hoffman for the “excellent dialogue” and saying, “You summarized my goal and aspiration correctly!”The mass restructuring comes as California debates a controversial ballot measure that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth over $1 billion. If voters approve the measure in November 2026, it would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026. For Page—currently ranked the second-richest person globally by Bloomberg's Billionaires Index—that could mean a tax bill exceeding $12 billion.The New York Times reported in December that Page told associates he was considering relocating to Florida specifically because of this proposal. He's not alone in his concerns. Fellow tech billionaire Peter Thiel has opened a Miami office for his investment firm, Thiel Capital, while venture capitalist David Sacks launched operations in Austin, Texas.The proposed tax, backed by healthcare union SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, aims to raise $100 billion over five years from California's approximately 200 billionaires. Supporters argue the revenue would offset anticipated federal budget cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance programs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says he is not worried about a proposed tax on billionaires in his home state of California. Even though the tax could cost him over $7 billion, Huang stated that he is “perfectly fine with it” because he and his company chose to live in Silicon Valley for its talented workforce. He explained that he values the region and is willing to accept the taxes that come with staying there.",LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman has joined the list of people opposing the proposed California wealth tax.

What is Nvidia’s Alpamayo, an AI model for autonomous vehicles





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled Alpamayo, a suite of open-source AI models designed to help automakers ‘fast=track’ robotaxi deployments at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026 in Las Vegas, US. The system showcases by Nvidia promises to bring advanced reasoning to autonomous vehicles and tackling ‘long-tail’ driving problems that don’t appear in training data but are critical for safe navigation. Mercedes‑Benz will be the first to adopt Alpamayo, with plans to launch it in the new CLA sedan in the US in early 2026.Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded to the announcement made by Nvidia by sharing a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Musk said that the Nvidia’s tools won’t pose immediate pressure. “Even with Nvidia’s help, it would take several years for automakers to advance their self‑driving systems from being functional to safer than a human driver,” Musk wrote. He further added that scaling up the hardware such as cameras and AI computers across fleets would take several more years. Musk estimated that Alpamayo could become competitive pressure on Tesla in five to six years, or longer.“The actual time from when FSD sort of works to where it is much safer than a human is several years. The legacy car companies won’t design the cameras and AI computers into their cars at scale until several years after that. So this is maybe a competitive pressure on Tesla in 5 or 6 years, but probably longer,” wrote Musk.In another post Musk said that Nvidia is providing helpful tools to the automotive industry, but the automotive industry is doing very little on their own. “By the end of this year, Tesla will have spent ~$10B cumulatively just on Nvidia hardware for training.

This move aims to prevent a rush before Beijing finalizes its stance on allowing these powerful processors. Nvidia, meanwhile, is demanding full upfront payment with no refunds, shifting financial risk to buyers amidst this uncertainty.

Nvidia hedges its bets with strict payment terms

China's mixed signals on AI chip independence





Just as Nvidia ramped up production to meet what CEO Jensen Huang called ""quite high"" demand for H200 chips in China, Beijing has tapped the brakes. The Chinese government has asked domestic tech companies to temporarily halt orders for Nvidia's H200 AI chips while regulators work out the terms of approval, according to The Information. The directive comes as China weighs whether-and how-to permit imports of the advanced processors, balancing needs for top-tier AI hardware against its push for semiconductor self-reliance.The pause appears designed to prevent a last-minute buying spree before Beijing finalizes its position. Chinese officials are still deciding how many domestically produced chips companies will need to purchase alongside each H200 order, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Bloomberg separately reported that China plans to approve some H200 imports as soon as this quarter for select commercial use, signaling that access may come with strings attached rather than an outright ban.Nvidia isn't taking chances. The chipmaker is requiring full upfront payment from Chinese customers ordering H200 chips—with no refunds, cancellations, or configuration changes allowed after purchase, Reuters reported.The unusually strict terms reflect the uncertainty around whether Beijing will actually greenlight the shipments. In special cases, customers can substitute commercial insurance or asset collateral for cash, but the policy is far stricter than Nvidia's previous practice of allowing deposits instead of full payment.The company has reason to be cautious. Last year, Nvidia wrote down $5.5 billion in inventory after the Trump administration abruptly banned sales of the H20 chip to China. While the U.S. has since reversed course and approved H200 exports—with a 25% fee payable to the U.S. government—China banned the H20 entirely. By demanding payment in advance, Nvidia transfers financial risk to its customers, which makes them commit capital without knowing for certain that they can import or deploy the technology.Beijing's hesitation underlines a broader tension in its tech policy. Chinese companies have ordered over 2 million H200 chips at roughly 27,000 dollars apiece, significantly outpacing Nvidia's current stock of just 700,000 units. The H200 delivers approximately six times the performance of the now-blocked H20 and significantly outpaces domestic rivals such as Huawei's Ascend 910C. Yet China is simultaneously preparing up to $70 billion in incentives to prop up its local chipmaking industry, underscoring its commitment to reducing reliance on foreign suppliers.Huang said Tuesday he doesn't expect a formal announcement from China about approval. ""If the purchase orders come, it's because they're able to place purchase orders,"" he told reporters at CES. For now, Chinese tech giants and Nvidia alike are waiting to see whether those orders will actually go through.","China has temporarily halted orders for Nvidia's advanced H200 AI chips.

How UK tech platforms are already adapting to tougher cyberflashing laws



UK regulator Ofcom to define platform safety duties







For millions of people, and particularly for women and young users, such non-consensual sexual material has become a disturbing reality. This trend, known as cyberflashing, constitutes the process where sexual images are sent out without consent and are accessed through online platforms such as dating apps and social media. Although considered a nuisance for online activities, it has also gained recognition as a form of harassment. From January 2026, a new measure has been implemented in the UK to respond to such a concern. As reported by Reuters and the UK Government, as part of improved regulations for the Online Safety Act, companies have been required to prevent users from receiving such material. This constitutes a significant shift from how online harassment and related concerns have traditionally been handled.Cyberflashing is a crime in England and Wales, punishable by prison sentences since 2024. But the recent legal update raises its status from a crime to a ‘priority offence’ for the Online Safety Act. This is significant because only technology companies face the most stringent legal requirements when it comes to treating this crime. This means that technology companies will have to take the initiative to block these undesired sexual images before they reach the intended target.This is because there has been an increasing understanding that reactive moderation is no longer enough. As soon as the clear image arrives, the harm may already be caused. The law intends to make this point never arrive. Dating sites, social media, and content-sharing sites should also develop mechanisms to prevent cases of cyberflashing. Such sites should develop mechanisms such as image detection services and new messaging services to curb cases of cyberflashing. The authorities have made it clear that content-sharing sites should take safety mechanisms seriously and not continue with mere compliance.As reported by the UK Government, failure to comply with these responsibilities comes with significant penalties. It could result in fines of up to 10% of global revenue for a company every year or, in some cases, a limitation or ban of services in the UK. The tone is clear: online safety is no longer a choice.Some of these platforms have already begun to implement changes that are consistent with the approach of the new law. This is seen with Bumble, which has developed technology that uses artificial intelligence to detect and blur nude photos that are sent through private messages. Such images are accompanied by warnings that allow users to decide what to do.These platforms use the work of well-trained artificial intelligence that can detect a difference between consensual and non-consensual nudity. Although they are not perfect, they offer a way to ensure that technology is used to safeguard, not endanger, individuals. The tightened legislation is a part of a larger government plan to deal with violence against women and girls, both online and offline. Studies have repeatedly revealed that women and teenage girls are the most affected victims of cyberflashing. Surveys have revealed that one in three teenage girls has received unwarranted sexually explicit images.With the responsibility passed on to technology companies, it is hoped that victims, who have always had to make reports after abuse, will no longer have to shoulder as great a burden. This is because technology companies are required to ensure a safe online space.The UK communications regulator Ofcom will now begin consulting on the detailed codes of practice that will set out what the platforms are expected to do in order to fulfil their new obligations. The new development has further put the UK at the top of the list of countries fighting online abuse, with a focus on the rising use of AI-generated images of a sexual nature. The increase in enforcement powers will help control a certain type of online abuse that has long existed, ensuring stronger accountability, faster takedowns, victim protection, and safer digital spaces.","From January 2026, a new measure has been implemented in the UK to respond to such a concern.

Warner Bros Discovery tells shareholders: We are telling Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison for the 8th time that we are not leaving Netflix for them; read the letter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/warner-bros-discovery-tells-shareholders-we-are-telling-paramount-skydance-ceo-david-ellison-for-the-8th-time-that-we-are-not-leaving-netflix-for-them-read-the-letter/articleshow/126409985.cms,"Netflix Drops A $72b Bombshell On Hollywood With Mega Warner Bros Discovery Move | WHAT IT MEANS

Read the Warner Bros Discovery full letter to shareholders here:

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

As you know, at the end of last year, your Board of Directors concluded its process to maximize shareholder value by entering into our merger agreement with Netflix. Since then, Paramount Skydance (""

PSKY

""), a bidder in that process, has commenced a hostile tender offer to acquire WBD which it recently amended on December 22, 2025.

As described further below, your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY's ability to complete the offer, and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders not tender your shares into the PSKY offer. For a full discussion of the reasons for the Board's recommendation, we urge you to read the full 14D-9 filing.

PSKY Offer's Insufficient Value

PSKY's offer is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger. Under the Netflix merger agreement, WBD shareholders will receive significant value with $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50 based on a collar range in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing, which may have substantial upside.

Additionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value creation opportunities.

The Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would in effect lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY due to regulatory reasons. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD.

Lack of Certainty in PSKY's Ability to Close the Transaction

The extraordinary amount of debt financing as well as other terms of the PSKY offer heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of [debt and equity] financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt — more than $50 billion — through arrangements with multiple financing partners.

The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout (""LBO""). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds 2 at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the [conventional structure of the] Netflix merger.

The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction — which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a ""junk"" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition.

Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a ""material adverse effect,"" enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction.

In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer.

Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction

If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months.

Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD for regulatory reasons represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses.

In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and 3 management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros.

The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger

PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its ""best and final"" proposal.

PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so.

Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you.

Sincerely,

The Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors





Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has once again turned down a takeover proposal from Paramount Skydnace CEO David Ellison . This marks the eight rejection of Paramount’s acquisition attempts. In a letter to the shareholders, WBD’s board saidthe latest bid of $108 billion by Paramount still fails to deliver sufficient value and certainty, despite revisions to its financing structure. The board has also outlined two main reasons for rejecting the offer made by Paramount. WBD said that Paramount’s bid would saddle WBD with added costs, including a $2.8 billion breakup fee to Netflix, a $1.5 billion debt exchange penalty and $350 million in incremental interest expenses totalling about $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share.Along with this, WBD also expressed doubts about Paramount’s ability to close the deal, citing the ‘extraordinary amount of debt financing” required. Paramount’s plan involves more than $50 billion in new debt, making it the largest leveraged buyout (LBO) in history, with pro forma gross leverage of about 7x 2026 EBITDA.WBD board has also reaffirmed its commitment to the Netflix merger, which it says maximizes shareholder value while mitigating risks.

A California judge has rejected OpenAI’s motion to end Elon Musk’s case against the ChatGPT maker, scheduling a trial for March. Musk, in a 2024 lawsuit, has alleged that OpenAI violated its founding mission in its high-profile restructuring to a for-profit entity. During a court hearing to consider whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant a jury trial, US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that there was “plenty of evidence”, reports Reuters. “It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work,” Rogers said, adding “This case is going to trial”.Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 along with CEO Sam Altman and Greg Brockman. He left in 2018 due to disagreements over control and direction of the company.In a 2024 lawsuit, The billionaire entrepreneur alleges that OpenAI has strayed from its original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity and instead prioritised commercial interests.Elon Musk claims that OpenAI's partnership with Microsoft resulted in significant funding and resources for the company, which is a breach of the company's founding contract.“After Musk lent his name to the venture, invested significant time, tens of millions of dollars in seed capital, and recruited top Al scientists for OpenAI, Inc.,Musk and the non-profit's namesake objective were betrayed by Altman and his accomplices. The perfidy and deceit are of Shakespearean proportions,” the lawsuit claims.“Once OpenAI, Inc.'s technology approached transformative AGI, Altman flipped the narrative and proceeded to cash in,” it added.As quoted in a Business Insider report, Judge Rogers said that there was enough evidence that Musk may have been deceived to allow the case to move forward to a jury. “There were assurances made, and promises made, that the structure would be maintained,” she said. “There was lots of information that was not shared.” She further added that she also felt ""there are strong arguments by the defense.""""I think the jury is going to get to decide,"" she said per the BI report.OpenAI has denied Musk’s allegations against the company. In a statement to the publication, an OpenAI spokesperson said “Mr Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial”, adding “We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.”","A California judge has rejected OpenAI's motion to end Elon Musk's case against the ChatGPT maker, scheduling a trial for March.

Microsoft's recent history with job cuts fuels speculation

Why January became the focus of layoff rumors





Microsoft has aggressively pushed back against reports claiming the company plans to slash up to 22,000 jobs this month, with chief communications officer Frank Shaw directly calling the speculation completely false. The rumors started when investment site TipRanks reported Microsoft was preparing for widespread January layoffs affecting Azure Cloud, Xbox, and global sales teams—potentially cutting anywhere from 11,000 to 22,000 positions. As the claims spread across social media, Shaw stepped in with a definitive response: ""100 percent made up / speculative / wrong,"" on X.Windows Central had earlier indicated the reports were ""false on the Xbox side at least,"" before Shaw's broader dismissal of the entire story.When met with skepticism in replies, he maintained his stance, telling one commenter he ""eagerly awaits"" the news he insists doesn't exist.The cynicism isn't baseless. Microsoft has executed several brutal rounds of job cuts over the past year and a half, eliminating more than 15,000 positions throughout 2025. The most recent wave came last July when roughly 9,000 employees were let go, accompanied by studio closures and canceled game projects. Xbox chief Phil Spencer defended those decisions as essential for the company's future, citing the need for greater operational efficiency.Microsoft's $80 billion commitment to AI infrastructure—triple the previous year's investment—has created widespread anxiety about where the money's coming from. CEO Satya Nadella has openly called the company's size a ""massive disadvantage,"" while setting what many consider unrealistic profit margins for Xbox. These factors have created a climate where layoff speculation finds fertile ground.Anonymous posts on the professional network Blind claimed middle management and legacy teams would be let go, while AI researchers would stay protected. The chatter drew additional attention from Microsoft's history of January workforce changes, but Shaw's strong denial suggests 2026 won't mirror that pattern—at least not on the rumored scale. Windows Central sources had already noted rumors of early-2026 layoffs circulating internally before this latest speculation, making Shaw's clear statement all the more meaningful for anxious employees.","Microsoft has vehemently denied widespread layoff rumors, with a top executive calling reports of up to 22,000 job cuts ""completely false"" Speculation, fueled by past workforce reductions and a significant AI investment, suggested cuts across Azure, Xbox, and sales.

Smartphone financing: Inclusion and measured regulation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/smartphone-financing-inclusion-and-measured-regulation/articleshow/126407312.cms,"By: Shriram Subramanian, Founder and MD of InGovern Research Services





India’s smartphone financing ecosystem is undergoing a quiet shift. After several years of rapid growth driven by no-cost EMIs, frictionless point-of-sale financing, and fintech-led digital lenders, the sector appears to be losing steam. Recent data reflects this softening trend. As of 19 September 2025, outstanding consumer-durable loans, including smartphone financing, stood at ₹22,279 crore, down from ₹23,264 crore a year earlier , a decline of 4.23%. Data from CRIF High Mark, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) licensed credit bureau, also shows a 4.7% year-on-year decline in active loans in the September quarter of FY2026, slipping to 95.5 million loan accounts nationwide.This loan contraction comes at a time when the RBI is reviewing the aspect of remote-locking mechanisms on financed deviceswhen a loan default takes place. The remote-locking feature, once used as a form of digital collateral, was paused due to concerns about privacy, data security and social impact. The ongoing debate on remote device locking has become central to how India thinks about credit access, digital inclusion, and the rights of borrowers who increasingly rely on their smartphones not just as communication tools, but as gateways to essential services.Nearly half of India’s consumer durable loans today are tied to smartphones, underscoring their centrality in the country’s digital and financial architecture. That relationship has been strengthened by device manufacturers, telecom operators, and fintech lenders who have simplified credit access, particularly for new-to-credit users. For many first-time borrowers, a financed smartphone is more than a device, it is the first rung on the formal credit ladder. Small-ticket smartphone EMIs help establish a credit history, making borrowers eligible for larger loans in future.Yet the suspension of remote-locking features has introduced a degree of uncertainty into the financing model. For lenders, the absence of an enforceable deterrent leads to an increase in portfolio risk, especially in the sub ₹20,000 device category, where margins are thin and borrowers are often credit-invisible. For borrowers, the fear is that repayment enforcement, leading to device lock, could cut off access to essentials like UPI payments and collections, Aadhaar-linked services or earning potential for gig workers. The tension, therefore, is not simply about regulating a product, it is also about regulating a tool that has become a prerequisite for economic participation.Policymaking should consider on how Indian consumer durable borrowers can be encouraged to maintain repayment discipline without jeopardising digital access. A binary approach by either enabling full lock-outs or prohibiting enforcement entirely risks producing outcomes that serve neither lenders nor borrowers. What is required instead is the possibility of a calibrated middle path.Early drafts of the policy under consideration suggest a framework where remote locking could be permitted only under specific conditions. Aspects like informed consent at the time of loan origination, triggered only after repeated missed payments, and designed to restrict non-essential functions rather than disabling the device entirely. Essential services such as calls, SMS, UPI banking, emergency access, education platforms, and key public-service apps would remain usable. The proposed approach also emphasizes user rights, including strict compliance with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act and immediate device unlocking once dues are regularised.There are already operational examples that offer a glimpse of how such a framework could work. Samsung Finance+, for instance, deploys device-level controls along with strong data privacy safeguards. Telecom operators such as Airtel and Jio have implemented device locking features for financed devices, with Airtel including this in their current mobile financing policies and Jio applying it to the JioPhone Next since year2021. However, these practices remain subject to ongoing regulatory changes. Globally, similar mechanisms exist in African and Latin American markets, but their use-case context is narrower. In India, where smartphones are deeply integrated into daily life, the stakes would be far higher.A regulatory over-correction, whether excessively permissive or excessively restrictive, risks unintended consequences. If lenders view the sector as too risky without credible enforcement, smartphone financing may contract further, affecting first-time borrowers most acutely. If enforcement is overly harsh, it may disproportionately affect vulnerable users whose livelihoods depend on smartphone access. The challenge is to preserve the inclusion gains of the past decade while ensuring that credit is not extended in ways that compromise financial stability.India has confronted similar dilemmas before, most recently in microfinance and digital lending, and has often arrived at solutions that balance financial inclusion with consumer protection. The smartphone financing debate may follow the same trajectory. If the final regulatory design succeeds in embedding proportional enforcement, clear consent practices, privacy safeguards, and transparent unlocking protocols, Indian regulators could help define a global standard for responsible technology financing in emerging economies.As smartphone financing slows after the pause on remote locking for loan defaults, India risks stalling a core driver of digital inclusion in an industry which is a bellwether for the government's Make-in-India programme. The RBI must quickly update the framework to protect access while keeping credit channels open for those who rely on smartphones to participate in the economy.","Nearly half of India’s consumer durable loans today are tied to smartphones. For many first-time borrowers, a financed smartphone is more than a device, it is the first rung on the formal credit ladder. For lenders, the absence of an enforceable deterrent leads to an increase in portfolio risk. For borrowers, the fear is that repayment enforcement, leading to device lock, could cut off access to essentials.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

Spotify Adds ‘Listening Activity’ and ‘Request to Jam’ features: Here’s how they work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotify-adds-listening-activity-and-request-to-jam-features-heres-how-they-work/articleshow/126399955.cms,"Listening activity on Spotify



Here’s how it works



Users can turn on listening activity via Privacy and social settings, accessible through the side drawer next to the “View profile” button.



Once enabled, activity appears in the chat row of the side drawer and at the top of Messages chats.



If a user taps on their friend or family member’s listening activity, they’ll be able to add tracks to their library, start playback, open the track’s context menu, or react with one of six standard emojis.

Request to jam



Here’s how it works



From a Messages chat, Premium users can tap Jam in the top right corner to send a request for a remote Jam.



Your friend will receive the request and can either accept or decline.



If accepted, the recipient becomes the host of the Jam session. From there, both participants in the Jam can add tracks to a shared queue and listen together.





Spotify has rolled out a new Listening Activity feature which enable users to share what they are streaming in realtime with friends and family via Spotify Messages. Along with this, the music streaming service has also rolled out a Request to Jam feature, a way for Premium users to invite friends into shared listening sessions directly from Messages. “Today, we’re building on that experience with two new Messages features: Listening activity and Request to Jam. Listening activity gives users a real-time look at what music their friends and family are listening to, while Request to Jam makes it easy to quickly turn those moments into shared listening sessions,” the company said in an official blog post.If a user isn’t actively listening, their most recently played track will appear instead. Friends can tap on the activity to add songs to their library, start playback, open the track menu, or react with emojis. Importantly, the feature is opt‑in, giving users full control over whether their listening activity is visible.Listening activity is only shared with people you’ve already messaged on Spotify, and you’re always in control—only the contacts you choose can see your activity, and you can turn it off at any time.“To complement listening activity, we’re making it easier to turn musical moments into shared experiences with Request to Jam, a new way for users to invite friends or family they’re connected with in Messages into a live listening session,” added Spotify.Once accepted, the recipient becomes host of the Jam, and both participants can add tracks to a joint playlist, listen together, and chat in sync. Free users can join a Jam when invited by a Premium subscriber, making the feature accessible to a wider audience. Spotify noted that daily active users of Jam have more than doubled year‑over‑year, highlighting strong demand for collaborative listening.","Spotify has rolled out a new Listening Activity feature which enable users to share what they are streaming in realtime with friends and family via Spotify Messages.

Jobs likely at risk and those stable

Stricter work from office rules





Microsoft is reportedly gearing up for another round of job cuts. According to a report in TipRanks, an investment news website, Microsoft is set to announce layoffs this month. Reports suggest that the company may lay off between 11,000 and 22,000 jobs across various divisions in the third week of January. If the figures turn out to be true, this would be the biggest layoff round yet for the Windows maker. Also, this will be the fourth consecutive January when Microsoft will cut jobs. The layoffs are reportedly related to rising costs of AI investment. Most of that money is said to be going toward data centers, chips, and AI tools.Microsoft is one of the biggest proponents of AI. The software giant spent upwards of $80 billion on the tech last year, and that doesn't seem likely to slow down this year. Analyst projections had previously suggested that Microsoft may need to cut at least 10,000 employees annually just to offset increased capital depreciation costs from data center expansion.In 2023, Microsoft cut 10,000 jobs, reported to be 5% of its workforce. In January 2024, Microsoft gaming team took the major brunt of the hit as Microsoft cut 1,900 employees, around 1% of its workforce. The year 2025 was by far the worst. In January 2025, the company cut off slightly less than 1% of employees, claiming them to be performance-related job cuts. More jobs were cut in May, 3% of the workforce was cut that month, and an even bigger number in July, when Microsoft removed another 4% of its employees. In all, Microsoft cut more than 15,000 jobs across several rounds in 2025. In total, these were likely Microsoft’s largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023.According to Tipranks, reports from workers point to Azure cloud teams, the Xbox gaming unit, and global sales as key teams to be impacted. It further says that ""analysts believe Microsoft is moving funds away from payroll and into long-term tech assets. As a result, middle managers and older product teams may face a higher risk,"" but ""roles tied to AI research and core cloud work are seen as more stable."" Also, ""roles tied to AI research and core cloud work are seen as more stable. This reflects the company’s goal to stay competitive in AI development.""The TipRanks report also reveals that Microsoft plans to enforce stricter office policies starting from February 23, 2026. Employees residing within 50 miles of an office will be required to work on-site for at least three days per week.","Microsoft is reportedly gearing up for another round of job cuts.

“When he asked me, ‘Why would you do that?’ I said, ‘Reed, it’s a simple risk-reward for me. If this show fails, we will have dramatically overpaid for a show. We do that all the time, but if it succeeds, we could completely transform the business as we know it.’”

“

I think the lesson that he’s left for me is that you pick the best people, give them the tools to do the best work of their life, and get out of their way.”

Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said he reads this book ‘over and over’

“It doesn't sound like a management story on the surface, but I think it's the most powerful leadership story I've ever read. I read it over and over again because I find ... I get something different in the book every time I read it,”

""Now, what I see is that when you go through life and you go through business, you make a lot of decisions that don't turn out the way you thought they would. The real leadership test is: How do you manage through that?”





Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has revealed a major decision that he took without asking for permission from founder Reed Hastings. In a recent interview, Sarandos said that he once spent $100 million on the series House of Cards without asking Hastings. Sarandos noted that he committed to two seasons of the show as a major financial risk to change the streaming giant's future. When Hastings questioned the decision, Sarandos explained his logic as a simple calculation of potential loss versus potential gain. He also recalled the conversation about the project's high cost. However, this move eventually helped Netflix move from a mail-order service to a leader in original streaming content.In CNBC’sinterview, Sarandos said,Sarandos, who joined Netflix back in 2000, also added that the experience taught him a particular style of leading, which he is still using to date.He said that it was Hastings who showed him how to treat talented employees by trusting them.He said,Sarandos also said he doesn't really read management books. Instead, he reads fiction novels to learn about leadership, he said. His favourite management book: ""Typhoon"", a 1902 novella by Joseph Conrad about a steamship captain and crew navigating a severe storm while at sea.Sarandos noted.When Sarandos first read the book about 20 years ago, he thought the captain was a careless ""hot dog"" who put himself and his family in jeopardy, he said. When he read it more recently, he learnt a more important lesson about leading in the face of conflict and uncertainty.said Sarandos.","Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said he once spent $100 million on the series House of Cards without asking founder Reed Hastings.

How Yamato makes ThinkPads just work



Beyond the lab



Behind a nondescript building in Yokohama , Japan , stands the legendary Yamato Lab . This is no typical research facility. It's a place where laptops are not pampered, but systematically pushed to breaking point – and then pushed some more. This is where ThinkPad was born, and now ThinkPads are transformed from mere machines to some of the most durable computing devices known to humankind, engineered to withstand the rigors of daily professional use.Enter the Yamato lab, and you'd think it'd look something like a sterile research lab but it turned out to be a maze of calculated torture chambers for ThinkPads. I watched, slightly wincing, as a ThinkPad was systematically dropped, twisted, and pressed under weights that would make most consumer electronics crumble.Drop tests that simulate a clumsy commuter's worst nightmare? Check. Vibration tests that mimic being jostled in a backpack during a bumpy train ride? Absolutely. Chambers that swing the laptops to their last? You bet.Hinges might seem like the most mundane part of a laptop, and you would just pass it on as an innocuous connection between screen and laptop, but they undergo a relentless opening and closing cycle at Yamato Lab. Automated arms repeatedly open and shut the laptop thousands of times, checking for precise movement, cable integrity, and structural stability.The technician demoing the test for us notes that each hinge is tested to withstand not just gentle touches, but the aggressive slams of stressed executives, the casual drops, and the constant repositioning that comes with a mobile work life.In another room, stress testing takes on an almost surgical precision. Flat circular disks of various sizes – mimicking everything from a carelessly placed heavy book to the accidental pressure of a backpack – apply controlled pressure to the closed laptop lid. These tests aren't just about preventing cracks; they're about ensuring structural integrity under unexpected stresses.Silently doing its work in another corner of the stress testing room, a machine applies systematic pressure to an open laptop display, trying to mimic the action of fingertips pushing the screen to entire palms just forcing the lid down, testing its screen's ability to resist twisting and bending without damaging the pixels.I watched as these machines gradually put all their force on the ThinkPads, testing their ability to withstand compression without compromising internal components.The impact testing is nothing short of brutal. Moved to the other section and a technician was demoing the corner-drop test, where the laptop is deliberately dropped onto a hard surface, landing precisely on its most vulnerable point.Vibration tests are equally intense. A specially designed table randomly shakes a laptop, mimicking the jostle of a commuter's bag, the bumpy ride of a taxi, or the turbulence of a business-class flight.Nearby, a technician casually stands on a ThinkPad X1 Carbon — a sight that would make any computer owner wince, and not just once but multiple times. I did ask them to jump on it, but they didn't, could be the language barrier or could also be it's breaking point.But, where most laptops would crumple like a tin can, this machine remains steadfast, its carbon fiber and magnesium chassis absorbing the weight without so much as a whimper — and that's something to really boast about.That's not even all the brutality that a ThinkPad goes through. Our guide, a meticulous Japanese engineer with decades of experience, tells us these are only a few of about tens of different tests that the folks at Yamato put the ThinkPad through, and each one he says is designed to simulate real-world scenarios that go far beyond the typical wear and tear.Now the Yamato Lab isn't just about creating indestructible machines. It's also about understanding how professionals work, and what's even more important to people who take dozens of calls a day more than they look great and the sound just comes through, and the calls just happen. So, I headed to another floor, which had a room where technicians were testing the three things that you can't just work without — webcam, speaker and the wireless connectivity.In the camera testing area, a wall of diverse skin tones and lighting scenarios created a mini-studio of complexity. Engineers meticulously adjusted white balance, tested color accuracy, and ran AI processing to ensure that every video call renders human features true to life, regardless of lighting conditions or background complexity. There were two ThinkPads, including the newer X1 Carbon, and the difference the investment was clearly visible. One thing though, there were a lot of heads, and they looked horrifically realistic.Next up was the acoustics room, a hemi-anechoic chamber that absorbs sound so completely that the silence feels almost tangible. With high-precision microphones surrounding the test bench, the speakers inside the ThinkPad are subjected to a battery of tests that go far beyond simple measurements.Engineers spend hours sitting in this silent room analyzing every nuance of sound reproduction, mapping out frequency responses, distortion levels, and audio clarity across different volume ranges. Laptop speakers have always been an afterthought, but the room shows how much thought is behind even an afterthought here at Yamato.Wireless connectivity testing looked like something between a radio observatory and a tech bunker, it definitely looked something like straight out of a post-apocalyptic sci-fi movie. Inside, a ThinkPad was strapped onto a precision-engineered rotating platform, rotating in 360-degrees in a radio-wave-absorbing chamber, so that technicians could measure signal strength, stability and performance from every conceivable angle.Again, this was just a peek at how Yamato keeps the essentials in check, so their ThinkPad just works when it needs to. But there is a lot more going behind the scenes. A whole bunch of engineers working on the TrackPoint , yes that red nub in middle of the keyboard, it has its own design process.As we left the Yamato facility, our guide took us to the adjacent ThinkPad museum. Here, decades of innovation were displayed chronologically, from the original models to modern iterations. We admired a gold-plated commemorative ThinkPad that gleamed under the museum lights, alongside an early prototype with an extending display—surprisingly innovative long before today's concept of expandable screens. There were many more.A ThinkPad was so unique to see was the one having a bento box-shaped compartments inside the keyboard. Fun fact: the original ThinkPad design was inspired by Japanese bento boxes, with similar dimensions and internal components arranged in compartmentalized sections, reflecting the thoughtful organization that has defined the brand.Interestingly, many of the original engineers who started with IBM still work here. They've watched the ThinkPad transform from a relatively bulky productivity tool into a sleek, AI-enabled device. Yet through all these evolutions, the core philosophy has remained steadfast: create a laptop that just gets its user through their workday no matter how tough it gets out there.","Yamato Lab in Yokohama, Japan, is where ThinkPad was born.

PM Modi: There's a sense of mutual trust and strong bond with President Trump

Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about a range of subjects during his three-hour long podcast with AI researcher Lex Fridman. Talking about the US President Donald Trump , PM Modi appreciated his unshakeable dedication to his country, particularly in the wake of assassination attempts last year. ""Donald Trump has courage. We have a strong bond. During his recent assassination attempt, even after being shot, he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His life was for his nation. His reflection showed his America first spirit,"" said PM Modi.The Prime Minister also shared about his meeting with several influential leaders, including Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk; US Vice President JD Vance; United States Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard; and American entrepreneur and politician, Vivek Ramaswamy.He shared how he has known Elon Musk for over a decade now. He went on to add that his meeting with Musk was particularly warm and friendly, as he was accompanied by his family and children. ""I've known him since my time as chief minister. He was there with his family and children, so naturally the atmosphere felt so warm and friendly. Of course we had discussions and we talked about many different topics,"" PM Modi told Lex Fridman.Indian PM was all praise for Elon Musk's DOGE Mission , which he said they covered long with a range of other topics during their meeting. ""Of course, we had discussions and we talked about many different topics. Now, with his DOGE mission, he is incredibly excited about how it's progressing and honestly, it makes me happy too because when I took office in 2014, I wanted to free my country from the deep-rooted issues and harmful practices that have crept in, and I'll continue striving to eliminate as many of them as I possibly can,"" he added.Talking about his very first visit to White House, PM Modi remembered how President Trump broke formal protocols and personally gave him a tour. ""When I visited him in the White House for the first time, there was already a lot written about President Trump in the media. At that time, he was still new to office and the world had a rather different perception of him. Even though I had been briefed in many different ways before meeting him, to my surprise, the very moment I stepped into the White House, he broke all formal protocols right away. And then, he took me on a tour of the White House. As he showed me around, I noticed something striking, he wasn't holding any notes or cue cards, nor was anyone accompanying him to assist.""For those unaware, Lex Fridman has been a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) since 2015. His podcasts cover several themes, such as artificial intelligence, global politics, cryptocurrency, productivity, global geopolitics, and technology.

Rishi Kumar , the Indian-origin CEO of AI startup EthosAI has come in support of deportation of the Columbia University's Indian student Ranjani Srinivasan . A fifth year PhD student, Ranjani fled to Canada recently after she got int of her imminent arrest as the tempers were running high following the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil whom the administration is preparing to deport. Srinivasan is said to have self-deported herself after she her student visa was revoked. America is planning to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate who became a leader of pro-Palestinian protests on the campus. He was arrested on March 8 and immigration officials said that they were seeking to deport him under a provision of federal law that gives the US secretary of state the power to deport someone if their presence in the country is deemed to “have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”.The CBP Home app has been developed by the US Customs and Border Protection which allows individuals illegally staying in the country to express their ""intent to deport"". After Srinivasan's visa was canceled on March 5, for alleged support of Hamas, she reportedly used the app on March 11 to process her departure.In a post on Twitter, startup CEO Rishi Kumar, who is lso an executive board member of the California Democratic Party and ran in an election, supported Ranjani's visa revocation and said that this should be a warning for all international students. ""@Columbia 's Indian student, Ranjini Srinivasan shouldn't have been participating in campus rallies in support of Hamas and the violence of October 6th. International students: Remember that studying in the US is a privilege. Be mindful of your actions & speech. Supporting designated terrorist organizations can lead to visa revocation, as seen with Columbia’s Ranjani Srinivasan who self-deported after her visa was canceled. #StudentVisaAlert,"" wrote Rishi Kumar.He quoted Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem post, that showed a video of Ranjani fleeing to Canada with her few belongings. ""It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live & study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked and you should not be in this country. I’m glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home app to self deport,"" read Noem's post.In an interview with the New York Times later, Ranjani said that she did not initially understand why her visa was revoked leading her university to withdraw her enrollment.","Rishi Kumar, the Indian-origin CEO of AI startup EthosAI has come in support of deportation of the Columbia University's Indian student Ranjani Srinivasan.

From Compliance to Competitive Advantage: Why data governance must be a boardroom priority,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/from-compliance-to-competitive-advantage-why-data-governance-must-be-a-boardroom-priority/articleshow/119080756.cms,"The Compliance Imperative: Why Governance Can't Wait

Governance as an AI Enabler, Not a Bottleneck

Turning Unstructured Data into a

Competitive

Asset

Governance Needs to Be a Boardroom Priority

Business leaders must ask some hard questions like:

The

of Governance

Piyush Mehta

, CEO, Data Dynamics

I’ve spent years sitting across from business leaders who view data governance as a necessary evil—a regulatory box to check off, a legal risk to mitigate. But here’s what I tell them: You’re thinking about it all wrong.Governance isn’t about ticking off compliance checklists. It’s about control. It’s about trust. It’s about future-proofing your business in an era where data is not just an asset—it’s the engine of growth, decision-making, and AI-driven innovation. Companies that treat governance as an afterthought will struggle in an increasingly regulated, AI-dominated landscape. The ones that embed governance into their DNA will lead, outpacing competitors, scaling AI with confidence, and expanding globally without friction.Data governance should no longer be treated as an IT issue. It deserves a place in the boardroom and if you’re not leading with governance today, you’re setting your business up for compliance failures, reputational damage, and missed opportunities tomorrow.The world is moving fast on data regulation. It’s no longer just about avoiding fines—non-compliance can cost an organization market access, customer trust, and even the right to operate in key regions. Take India’s Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, for instance. It mandates stringent data localization, explicit consent mechanisms, and steep violation penalties. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) released a DPDP Rules draft in January 2025 with the aim to operationalize the provisions of the DPDP Act. Meanwhile, the European GDPR has already set a global benchmark, and the U.S. is tightening regulations on AI governance, forcing enterprises to rethink how they manage data-driven decision-making.These shifts signal a new reality: If organizations don’t know where their data is, who has access to it, and whether it meets global compliance standards, then they are already at risk. Businesses that fail to adopt data governance are more likely to find themselves locked out of key markets later.Despite these risks, many enterprises still regard governance as a burden rather than a strategic function, treating it as a reactive, manual process. Businesses that shed this outdated mindset and learn to thrive in the AI era are those that proactively embed governance into their data infrastructure, ensuring that compliance, security, and intelligence are built into every layer of their operations.Too many companies are training AI models on unstructured, ungoverned, and non-compliant data. The result is biased algorithms, inaccurate predictions, and regulatory scrutiny that could derail entire AI strategies. After all, AI is only as good as the data it learns from.The last few years have shown that AI failures—such as chatbots amplifying bias, financial models miscalculating risk, and healthcare AI making incorrect diagnoses—could have been avoided with better governance. It was treated as an afterthought and not as a foundational pillar of AI development.Forward-thinking enterprises are adopting AI-driven governance models. They are embedding governance controls into AI pipelines, ensuring compliance and security even before data is used. They are also automating data classification and auditing processes to flag risks before they escalate. Real-time policy enforcement mechanisms will help these organizations adapt dynamically to evolving regulations. Companies that follow these approaches will be able to unlock AI’s full potential with clean, trusted, and high-quality data while avoiding regulatory backlashes.For years, enterprises focused governance efforts on structured data like financial records, customer databases, and transactional logs. But the reality is that over 80% of enterprise data is unstructured and that’s where the real governance battle is taking place.Emails, contracts, research reports, video transcripts, sensor data—all these hold valuable insights. Yet, most of it is fragmented, unclassified, and unprotected. Companies are training AI models on this messy, non-compliant data without knowing where it came from, whether it’s biased, or if it meets global regulations.Unstructured data should be governed with the same rigor as structured data—classified, secured, and made audit-ready in real time. This is the next frontier of data governance. Enterprises that figure this out will be able to turn unstructured data into a competitive asset. Businesses that do not recognize this will be left blindsided when regulators demand proof that their entire data ecosystem is under control.Organizations need to change their perception of governance as a compliance checkbox and perceive it as a business strategy. Data-driven decisions are what helps a business stay competitive and profitable. If at any point, this data violates privacy laws, is non-compliant and used by AI models to make decisions, or is restricted by data sovereignty laws then it’s a governance failure that affects business operations and revenues. They are business risks, not IT issues, that demand executive attention.• Is governance embedded at the point of data creation?• Are our AI models trained on fully governed, high-quality data?• Can our governance policies dynamically adapt to global regulations in real-time?• Are we leveraging governance to accelerate AI adoption, or is it becoming an obstacle?The answers to these questions will determine whether a company is positioned for long-term success or scrambling to catch up as regulations tighten.The future belongs to those who treat governance as a business enabler and not a burden. Companies that lead in governance will be the ones that will build AI models on ethical, trusted data; expand into new markets seamlessly; earn and maintain customer trust with transparent data practices; and turn governance into a differentiator instead of a cost center. Governance isn’t optional—it’s foundational to seeing sustainable, AI-driven business success. This is the new reality in today’s business landscape.The question is no longer whether enterprises need data governance. The question is whether they are prepared to lead with it. Those who do will set the standard for the future. Those who don’t? They may not have a future at all.","Data governance should no longer be treated as an IT issue. It deserves a place in the boardroom and if you’re not leading with governance today, you are setting your business up for compliance failures, reputational damage, and missed opportunities tomorrow. Companies that embed governance into their DNA will lead, outpacing competitors, scaling AI with confidence, and expanding globally without friction.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

Puzhitsky told The New York Post, ""If Canada could ban Pornhub in the states, we win the trade war. That's it. There is no trade war.""According to Pornhub's own statistics, nearly 40 percent of the site's traffic comes from the United States, making it a significant potential pressure point in the cross-border economic conflict.The calls for digital retaliation come as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has taken a confrontational stance toward US President Donald Trump 's tariff policies. ""Donald Trump has put unjustified tariffs on what we build, on what we sell, on how we make a living,"" Carney said in a recent speech. ""He's attacking Canadian workers, families and businesses.""A petition urging the Canadian government to restrict Pornhub access in the US has been published online, though it has gathered only 52 signatures so far. The petition argues that blocking the site would represent ""a new approach"" to the tariff dispute.The suggestion comes as 16 US states, including Texas, Florida, and Virginia, have already lost access to Pornhub due to strict age-verification laws requiring government-issued identification. Pornhub's parent company has chosen to block these states rather than comply with what it considers privacy-compromising regulations.","Pornhub is a popular adult content website owned by Canadian company Aylo.

The baby arrived prematurely and has been receiving care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).In another news, the CEO shared an update about the company’s latest version of the large language model (LLM), GPT-4.5 . In an X post, Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience.Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it.In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit. We think people are gonna use this a lot and love it.”","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat.

Come April 1 of Fiscal Year 2026-27, a new rule in the Income Tax Act law may grant the Income Tax department powers to access your social media accounts or emails in case they suspect tax evasion . Income Tax Bill 2025, which was introduced in the Parliament recently, will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces, termed Virtual Digital Spaces in the bill. This means that the Income Tax department can break into social media accounts, personal emails, bank accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, and more if they have any reason to believe that you own any undisclosed income, money, Gold, Jewelry, or valuable item or property on which you haven’t paid applicable Income Tax.Presently, Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, allows Income Tax officials to seize assets and books during search operations if they find sufficient reasons to believe that an individual is in possession of undisclosed income or assets. The changes in the bill, once passed in the Parliament, will extend this authourity to the digital realm, allowing officials to bypass security measures on computer systems and virtual spaces.The Clause 247 of the Income Tax Bill outlines this expanded power, stating that officers can “break open the lock of any door, box, locker, safe, almirah, or other receptacle” or “gain access by overriding the access code” to computer systems or virtual digital spaces when access is otherwise unavailable. This applies if they believe an individual possesses undisclosed income or assets taxable under the law.According to the bill, the term Virtual Digital Space includes email servers, social media accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, banking accounts, and any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset. It further adds that virtual digital space is an environment, area or realm that is constructed and experienced through computer technology and not the physical, tangible world, which encompasses any digital realm that allows users to interact, communicate and perform activities using computer systems, computer networks, computer resources, communication devices, cyberspace, internet, worldwide web and emerging technologies, using data and information in the electronic form for creation, storage or exchange and includes:* Email servers* Social media account* Online investment account, trading account, banking account, etc* Any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset* Remote server or cloud servers* Digital application platforms* Any other space of similar natureAs to who all can wield this authority? The bill designates “authorised officers” as senior tax officials, including Joint Directors, Additional Directors, Joint Commissioners, Additional Commissioners, Assistant or Deputy Directors, Assistant or Deputy Commissioners, Income Tax Officers, and Tax Recovery Officers.What does this mean for individuals? The new rules significantly widen the scope of tax investigations, giving officials the ability to probe deeply into personal and financial digital footprints. As this provision takes effect, it raises questions about privacy and the balance between tax enforcement and individual rights.","Income Tax Bill 2025 will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces.

A spokesperson from BluSmart has stated to Times of India that the claims regarding such developments are purely speculative and without any basis. Here's the complete statement of the company.“We categorically deny any discussions or negotiations regarding an acquisition by Uber. The story is purely speculative and unfounded. As India’s leading EV ride-hailing and charging infrastructure platform, BluSmart remains focused on scaling operations, expanding its footprint, and advancing sustainable mobility.”Uber Technologies is reportedly in the early stages of discussions to acquire BluSmart Mobility, a Gurugram-based all-electric cab service operator. According to a report by Economic Times, the potential deal could bolster Uber's presence in India's growing electric vehicle (EV) ride-hailing market and signal consolidation in the urban mobility sector.The acquisition could help Uber strengthen its position in India, where it faces increasing competition from players like Rapido, which has rapidly diversified into three- and four-wheeler operations. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi acknowledged the intensifying competition in the Indian market last year, emphasising the need for the company to stay agile.BluSmart operates an all-electric fleet of over 5,000 vehicles across Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, with additional operations in Dubai. The fleet, primarily sourced from Tata Motors and MG Motor, is owned by Gensol Engineering and leased to BluSmart. The company also manages a network of EV charging infrastructure in NCR and Bengaluru.The discussions come at a time when BluSmart's parent company, Gensol Engineering, is grappling with liquidity issues. Gensol recently announced plans to raise ₹600 crore to address its financial challenges, including selling vehicles to Chennai-based Refex Industries. The company has also faced a downgrade of its debt facilities to ""default"" status by ICRA and CARE, further complicating its financial outlook.Founded in 2019, BluSmart has positioned itself as a premium, no-surge pricing service offering sustainable transportation options. Despite raising over Rs 1,000 crore in funding from investors like BP Ventures and Zurich-based ResponsAbility, the company has struggled with high capital expenditure and delays in government subsidies for EV adoption. BluSmart's annualised revenue run rate currently stands at Rs 70 crore.Uber's interest in BluSmart aligns with its focus on expanding its EV offerings under the Uber Green service, which operates in the same cities as BluSmart. Acquiring BluSmart's assets, including its EV fleet and charging infrastructure, could provide Uber with a competitive edge in the Indian market.","Uber is reportedly in the early stages of discussions to acquire BluSmart Mobility.

Facebook’s extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

Samsonite CEO too names discounting by VIP and Safari as reason for fall in sales

The world's biggest luggage maker Samsonite claims to have a problem in India. According to a report in Economic Times, the company has seen its sales fall during the past quarter. So much so that Reza Taleghani, chief financial officer at Samsonite, reportedly called out fall in India business during investors' calls. ""Asia, a bit of a laggard compared to the other regions, primarily driven off of India, which has had that competitive dynamic with the discounting that's been happening with VIP and Safari,"" Samsonite CFO Taleghani told investors, adding that its Asian business fell 3.6% during the year but excluding India, it would have fallen only 0.3%.Samsonite attributed its lackluster performance in Asia to intense competition and aggressive discounting by rivals VIP and Safari in India. The company's mass-market brand, American Tourister, experienced a significant 31% sales drop in the December quarter, reflecting the challenges faced by this entry-level brand that directly competes with the two prominent listed Indian companies.Incidentally, while Samsonite CFO may have blamed deep discounting by VIP and Safari for fall in sales, the two companies have also seen a fall in revenue during the past three quarters. For the nine months ending December, Safari’s net profit declined 27% to Rs 84 crore, while VIP reported a net loss of Rs 41 crore, a stark contrast to its Rs 78 crore profit the previous year. VIP’s Managing Director, Neetu Kashiramka, reportedly told analysts, ""It’s hard to predict when this aggressive discounting will stabilize. We’re not seeing competitors ease up, and while rising crude oil prices could shift the dynamics, that’s not an immediate prospect."" She clarified, ""We’re avoiding heavy discounts except in soft luggage. Online platforms, however, are offering steep markdowns—sometimes below cost—which is a major issue. They’re investing in their own brands, not ours.""About three years ago, India surpassed China to become Samsonite's largest market for its Tumi and namesake luggage brands, only to lose that position to China the following year. In 2024, Samsonite's sales in India fell by 18.3%, dropping from $260 million in 2023 to $210 million. Kyle Gendreau, Samsonite's CEO, said, ""We faced reduced retail footfall and lower consumer spending on premium and luxury brands, compounded by heightened discounting and promotional efforts from competitors, particularly in India."" He added, ""While India presented challenges throughout the year, we’re observing an upward trend as we head into 2025, with a promising first quarter that signals India’s ongoing recovery and evolution.""Mokobara, Assembly, and Uppercase: New brands increasing competitionFollowing the pandemic, India's travel market surged as consumers embraced frequent vacations, but this growth has since slowed, with discretionary spending declining across all price segments. Additionally, new players in the luggage sector, such as Mokobara, Assembly, and Uppercase, have resorted to discounts to attract customers, further squeezing industry profits or deepening losses.","Samsonite's Asian business fell 3.6% during the year but excluding India, it would have fallen only 0.3%.

FTC may be planning to break up Meta

Trouble from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) seems to be knocking at Facebook-parent Meta's doors now. And in line of testimony will be several Meta, WhatsApp and Instagram's current and former key executives, including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. According to media reports, the FTC is set to interrogate Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg next month as part of an antitrust trial aimed at reversing the company's acquisition of Instagram. This move is reported to be part of a broader federal effort to intensify scrutiny on major technology companies.According to a witness list filed by FTC lawyers this week, Mark Zuckerberg is among several prominent Meta executives scheduled to testify at the trial, which is set to commence in April. The FTC anticipates questioning Zuckerberg for as long as seven hours -— significantly longer than most other witnesses. For instance, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom is expected to testify for about three hours.The FTC's witness list also features notable figures such as former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg , current Instagram head Adam Mosseri, and Meta’s current CEO Javier Olivan.A Meta spokesperson responded, saying, “We are confident that the evidence presented at trial will demonstrate that acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp has benefited both competition and consumers.”The FTC contends that Meta, previously known as Facebook, has upheld an unlawful monopoly in the social media sector. It claims that Meta overpaid for Instagram ($1 billion in 2012) and WhatsApp ($19 billion in 2014) to eliminate potential competitors.The agency seeks to dismantle Meta by compelling it to divest Instagram and WhatsApp into standalone entities. The lawsuit against Meta was initially launched in 2020 under the US President Donald Trump’s first administration. In November of last year, US District Judge James Boasberg dismissed some of the FTC’s allegations but allowed the central claims regarding Instagram and WhatsApp to move forward to trial.However, the judge cautioned that the FTC faces significant challenges in substantiating its case. “The Commission must address tough questions about whether its arguments can withstand the rigors of trial,” Boasberg remarked. “At times, its stance pushes the boundaries of this nation’s aging antitrust precedents.”","FTC may be planning to break up Meta.

When anti-Elon Musk man made Swastika on Cybertruck

In a shocking incident in Brooklyn, a man reportedly defaced a Cybertruck with a Swastika in broad daylight. According to an exclusive report in the New York Post, the incident happened right in front of a New York Post reporter. The unhinged individual, apparently enraged by the presence of the $80,000 electric Tesla CyberTruck parked on Washington Avenue, double-parked his Subaru – which had two car seats in the back – jumped out, and vandalized the vehicle.Twitter user Collin Rugg shared the incident on Twitter with the video. ""NEW: Leftist arrested after drawing a swastika on a Cybertruck belonging to a Jewish man in NYC. The man saw the Cybertruck, got out of his Subaru & then drew the swastika. He fled the scene without his car & came back an hour later where police were waiting. The people carving swastikas on vehicles owned by Jewish people want you to think that you are the Nazis,"" Rugg wrote.To this Elon Musk responded, ""Crazy people. Naturally, he drives a Subaru …""As per the report, Cybertruck's owner, Avi Ben Hamo, a Jewish man, was left reeling from the attack. ""I feel myself burning inside,"" he said, expressing his shock and anger. The perpetrator returned to his Subaru and attempted to flee the scene, but Ben Hamo, who had witnessed the incident from across the street, bravely stood in front of the car to prevent his escape. ""What are you doing?"" Ben Hamo shouted, quickly dialing 911.The man then reportedly abandoned his vehicle in the bike lane and fled on foot. However, about 90 minutes later, he returned to retrieve his Subaru, only to be met by four police officers, a New York Post reporter, and a photographer. He was immediately arrested and handcuffed.The suspect, identified as 42-year-old Michael Lewis, who describes himself as a ""geek of all trades, master of few,"" faces charges of aggravated harassment. Ben Hamo told the publication that he struggled to comprehend the senseless act of hatred. ""People hating [Tesla owner] Elon Musk is one thing, but to do something like this is next level. I'm speechless. That's just wrong,"" he said. ""I don't understand how someone thinks because I bought a car. It gives them the authorization to do this.""Since Elon Musk's new Department of Government Efficiency began reducing government spending, Tesla vehicles, dealerships, charging stations, and their owners have become targets of organized attacks by left-wing groups. The Post has identified at least five radical groups responsible for assaults on Tesla vehicles and dealerships across the United States.Cybertrucks, in particular, have been disproportionately targeted in what some have termed "" Elon Derangement Syndrome ."" This incident marks at least the third reported attack on a Cybertruck in New York City in recent days. Just a few blocks away, another Cybertruck was pelted with eggs and smeared with dog feces a couple of weeks prior.","A man allegedly defaced a Cybertruck with a Swastika in broad daylight.

“missing a big part of this technology wave.""

How environmental policies may be driving away AI companies from Europe

“You can see in the U.K. that we’re already rowing back on some of our commitments.”

“This is a fairly regular process that, when times are good, it’s easy to persuade individuals, businesses, and governments to move in the right direction on things like climate change and to take some of the cost associated with doing that,”

“Electricity wise, we might not be able to afford to close down coal power plants, which is going to be a real headache for the energy transition and energy security as well,”





Europe needs to choose between competing in artificial intelligence (AI) development and maintaining its stringent climate goals, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives has suggested. Ives, who is also an investor in Tesla, has warned that Europe risks falling behind in the AI race due to its energy constraints. The region faces a fundamental challenge as energy emerges as the primary bottleneck for AI-related data centre projects globally. While the United States activates fossil-fuel plants to power its AI infrastructure buildout, Europe requires developers to disclose energy and water efficiency measures, creating regulatory obstacles that can delay project launches.In an interview with CNBC, Ives said,or riskThe tension between AI ambitions and environmental commitments has intensified as the computational demands of AI development continue to escalate, forcing policymakers to confront whether the region's world-leading climate standards are compatible with remaining competitive in one of the most strategically essential technology sectors.The European Union (EU) is recognised for its environmental policies and initiatives, like the upcoming carbon border tax. However, some critics argue that these regulations hinder business operations. Europe is viewed as ""anti-entrepreneur"", Ives said, which causes European technology companies and startups to relocate to the US, the Middle East, or Asia, where they find more business-friendly policies.As Europe tries to keep pace with AI development, the need for energy-intensive infrastructure grows, and electricity demand increases, making this tension harder to ignore. New renewable energy capacity was meant to replace polluting energy sources, but concerns are emerging that this transition may not happen as planned.Paul Jackson, regional global market strategist at Invesco, told CNBC,He predicts Europe may also join that bandwagon.Jackson added.However, when lawmakers face difficult economic conditions and conflicting priorities, lowering the importance of climate policies becomes one of the simplest actions they can take, he added.The UK has eliminated coal from its energy grid, which is much more polluting than gas, but Europe has not yet achieved this.“I’m worried that, at a certain stage, coal power plant closures might get actually postponed,” Jags Walia, head of global listed infrastructure at Van Lanschot Kempen, said to CNBC.Replacing fossil-fuel power plants with renewable energy sources works well when energy demand remains steady, but that is no longer the case, he said. Data centres also require an uninterrupted power supply, so the intermittent nature of wind and solar energy could pose challenges.Walia noted..Throughout the year, Europe has weakened several environmental commitments. Recently, the EU reduced its effective ban on new combustion-engine cars from 2035, the report noted.Earlier this month, Europe also delayed implementation of a new EU emissions trading system for buildings, road transport and small industries by one year despite the region’s commitment to reducing emissions by 90% by 2040.Earlier this year, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence and Corporate Sustainability Reporting directives were also narrowed and postponed.","Europe needs to choose between competing in artificial intelligence (AI) development and maintaining its stringent climate goals, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives has suggested.

China proposes stricter safeguard for AI tools; issues draft rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-proposes-stricter-safeguard-for-ai-tools-issues-draft-rules/articleshow/126207320.cms,"



China has issued draft rules aimed to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) for public comments, reports Reuters. According to the news agency, the move highlights the country’s efforts to shape rapid rollout of consumer-centric AI. The draft rules apply to AI products and services offered to the public in China that mimic human traits, thinking patterns and communication styles. These services interact with users through text, images, audio or video and are often designed to respond emotionally.Under the proposed rules, AI service providers in China will be required to warn users against excessive use and step in if users show signs of addiction. AI companies will also need to take responsibility for safety across the entire product lifecycle, including setting up systems for algorithm checks, data security and protection of personal information.As part of the draft rules, the Chinese government also aims to address mental health risks. Per the Reuters report, AI service providers will be expected to identify users’ emotional states and levels of dependence on the service.If users display extreme emotions or addictive behaviour, companies would be required to take action to reduce potential harm.In addition, the rules set clear limits on content. AI services would be prohibited from generating material that threatens national security, spreads rumours, or promotes violence or obscene content, the report said.The draft rules are open for public feedback before being finalised.","China has issued draft rules aimed to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) The move highlights the country’s efforts to shape rapid rollout of consumer-centric AI.

Tech leaders rally behind Intel CEO amid China investment scrutiny

Historic government equity deal follows successful White House pitch





Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan called upon two of Silicon Valley's most influential leaders—Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Nvidia's Jensen Huang—to vouch for him with President Donald Trump after the president publicly demanded his resignation over alleged China ties, according to Reuters. The behind-the-scenes outreach, which occurred in August 2025 following Trump's social media attack calling Tan ""highly conflicted,"" preceded what became the most pivotal 40-minute meeting of Tan's career—one that transformed presidential hostility into an $8.9 billion government investment and gave Intel a ""too-strategic-to-fail"" status.Tan strategically turned to Nadella and Huang because both tech leaders had already cultivated relationships with Trump and visited the White House, two people familiar with the discussions told Reuters. The endorsements proved crucial as Tan prepared to defend himself against accusations stemming from his 600 investments in Chinese companies, some allegedly linked to the country's military.The meeting, attended only by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, proved transformative for Intel. Tan successfully convinced Trump of his commitment to American interests despite having made some 600 investments in China, including companies allegedly linked to the country's military.The CEO's preparation extended beyond seeking endorsements. Reuters reported that Tan strategised with advisors on presenting his personal story as an American patriot while addressing concerns about his China holdings. His dealmaking background—built over a career that amassed him an estimated fortune exceeding $500 million—proved crucial during negotiations.The meeting culminated in a groundbreaking agreement where the U.S. government invested $8.9 billion for nearly 10% of Intel, giving the chipmaker what sources described as a ""too-strategic-to-fail"" status. Within weeks, Tan secured a $5 billion partnership with Nvidia, with Huang calling Tan his ""long-time friend.""Microsoft's Nadella later publicly endorsed the arrangement, stating the partnership ""will benefit the country and broader technology ecosystem for years to come.""Trump's initial hostility transformed dramatically—just days after demanding Tan's resignation, the president praised his ""amazing story"" following their meeting. The deal opened doors to potential partners eager to win presidential favor and may herald a new era of U.S. industrial policy through government equity stakes in strategic businesses.Intel shares have risen approximately 80% since Tan's March appointment, though the company faces ongoing challenges in manufacturing and AI strategy.","Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan called upon two of Silicon Valley's most influential leaders to vouch for him with President Donald Trump.

Elon Musk backs firefighting experience for the post





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has issued a warning on social media, suggesting that the move by New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to appoint Lillian Bonsignore as the next Commissioner of the Fire Department of New York (FDNY), compromise public safety and “will” lead to deaths. The controversy centres around the professional background of Bonsignore. She is a 31-year veteran whose career is built entirely within the department’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS).“People will die because of this. Proven experience matters when lives are at stake,” Musk wrote in a post that quickly went viral. Not just Musk, David Sacks, Tech founder, investor and President Donald Trump's AI head, has also replied to the post on Bonsignore’s appointment.“Pray for NYC,” Sacks said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).Musk argues that leading the FDNY requires a background in active firefighting – an experience Bonsignore does not have. Bonsignore started as an EMT in 1991 and eventually rose to become chief of EMS, notably overseeing operations during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic before retiring in 2022.“I know the job. I know the what the firefighters need and I can translate that to this Administration who's willing to listen.I know what EMS needs. I have been EMS for 30 plus years,” she said. Mayor-elect Mamdani has stood firmly by the appointment, framing it as a historic milestone. Bonsignore will be the department's first openly gay commissioner.FDNY data reveals that more than 70 per cent of all emergency calls are now handled by EMS units, not fire engines. Supporters say that the Commissioner is a civilian managerial role focused on budgets, strategy and inter-agency coordination, and while tactical firefighting decisions remain with senior uniformed fire officers.",Lillian Bonsignore will be the next Commissioner of the Fire Department of New York (FDNY) Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the appointment will compromise public safety and lead to deaths.

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta. However, Huang told Rogan that scale hasn't changed his mindset: ""The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""","Jensen Huang, CEO of $4.4 trillion AI chip giant Nvidia, lives in constant fear of bankruptcy.

Nvidia GPU vs Google TPU: Training and inference



What does Groq LPUs offer







Nvidia lost billions of dollars from its market value after a report claimed that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is partnering with Google to train its AI models on the search giant’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). As one of Nvidia’s largest customers, Meta’s shift toward alternative hardware sent shockwaves through the semiconductor giant, triggering a cascading effect. In this article, we explore the key differences between Nvidia’s GPUs and Google TPUs, while also examining the LPUs from Groq – the startup Nvidia recently acquired in a strategic $20 billion defensive move.Nvidia originally designed Graphics Processing Units, or GPUs for rendering 3D graphics. They have thousands of small cores that can handle many tasks simultaneously. Since they are General Purpose, they can be used for AI, gaming, crypto mining and scientific simulations.Google’s TPU, on the other hand, is an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit which has been specifically designed from the ground up by Google for one specific purpose: speeding up the “tensor” math that powers machine learning.Nvidia GPUs can be bought. Whether it is a $1,000 gaming card or a $30,000 H100 enterprise chip, companies can purchase them and run them in their own data centres. Larger the number of chips, larger the processing power and better the models’ training.When it comes to Google TPUs, you cannot cannot buy them. Google does not sell the physical chips, instead offers to ‘rent’ them through Google Cloud Platform, allowing partners to train their models. This means, if you want TPUs, you must stay in Google's ecosystem and cannot run the hardware in your data centre.The critical difference is speed. Nvidia GPUs are ‘king’ of Training , which means teaching an AI model from scratch. Most major AI labs like OpenAI, Meta, xAI and Google itself uses massive clusters of Nvidia H100s/B200s to build their models.Google TPUs are dominant in Inference – running the model and getting an answer. Since TPUs are designed for speed, they can provide AI “answers” to millions of users simultaneously with less lag, faster than GPUs.One of the reasons is the difference in software. AI researchers know how to use Nvidia’s CUDA as it is the ‘language’ of AI. Moving to Google’s TPU often requires rewriting code or switching frameworks. Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian recently said that the company makes its models compatible with Nvidia GPUs and they are a partner.Groq Language Processing Unit is a new category of processor with an AI Inference Technology that is claimed to deliver “AI compute speed, quality, and affordability at scale” – just like Google TPUs.“Groq created and built the LPU from the ground up to meet the unique needs of AI. LPUs run Large Language Models (LLMs) and other leading models at substantially faster speeds and, on an architectural level, up to 10x more efficiently from an energy perspective compared to GPUs,” the company said. By offering LPUs, along with GPUs, Nvidia is essentially aiming to offer power, speed and efficiency at one-stop shop.","Nvidia lost billions of dollars from its market value after a report claimed that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is partnering with Google to train its AI models on the search giant’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) In this article, we explore the key differences between Nvidia’S GPUs and Google TPUs, while also examining the LPUs from Groq – the startup Nvidia acquired in a strategic $20 billion defensive move.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126204201,imgsize-164145,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-chip-showdown-nvidia-vs-google.jpg"

: There are chances that victims of the SIM Box scam can lose money by sharing their bank details. Identity theft: The scam can also lead of identity theft as the personal data of the user can be stolen or misused.

National security concerns: International calls disguised as local ones make tracking criminals more difficult.

How to stay safe

Always refrain from clicking on links present in text messages that offer loans, investments or job offers.

Always verify the contact number of the sender as fraudulent SMS often come from random and unusual numbers.

It is important to report suspicious messages to the government’s cybercrime portal (cybercrime.gov.in).

Also, the users must enable spam filters on their smartphones which helps in blocking bulk SMS.

Users should always contact their bank immediately if they suspect any scam and should also update their passwords regularly.





The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) recently launched a major crackdown against a cybercrime network operating SIM Box devices in Delhi, Noida and Chandigarh, as reported by Times of India. As per the report, the raids covered a large-scale phishing operation, with investigators seizing more than 21,000 illegally procured SIM cards. The discovery highlights how criminals are exploiting the telecom loopholes to run scams that target unsuspecting citizens across India.A SIM Box is a device which is designed to hold hundreds of SIM cards simultaneously. The fraudsters use it to disguise international calls as local ones, bypassing telecom charges and regulations. The SIM Boxes are used to send bulk SMS messages which contain phishing links, fake loan offers and fraudulent investment schemes. By masking their operations, criminals make it harder for authorities to trace the origin of these scams.The scam typically starts when criminals acquire thousands of SIM cards mainly due fake identities. These SIMs are loaded into SIM Boxes connected to serves and dongles. The system then sends out lakhs of SMS messages daily, tricking victims into clicking malicious links or sharing sensitive banking details. The CBI investigation revealed that even foreign cybercriminals were using these services to cheat Indian citizens, making the scam a transnational threat.The SIM Box scam poses multiple risks.

WhatsApp on iPhone may soon show which Apple Watch is connected: What it means for users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-on-iphone-may-soon-show-which-apple-watch-is-connected/articleshow/126194508.cms,"WhatsApp is enhancing iPhone security by showing paired Apple Watches in 'Linked Devices'. This addresses concerns about unauthorized access, especially in abusive relationships. Users can now see connected wearables, though unlinking requires deleting the app from the watch itself. Additionally, a new chat clearing tool offers granular control over message and media deletion, improving storage management.

WhatsApp testing Peripherals section on iPhone: How it may work

WhatsApp on iPhone may also get a Clear Chat feature

""a feature to clear chat storage with options for deleting messages or specific media categories"".

""Clear media files…""





Meta is testing a new transparency feature for WhatsApp on iPhone. This feature will explicitly display when an Apple Watch is paired to a user's account, addressing potential security concerns introduced by the messaging app's recent expansion to watchOS. The feature, spotted in WhatsApp beta build 25.37.10.71 on TestFlight by WABetaInfo, adds a new ""Peripherals"" section to the app's ""Linked Devices"" interface. This enhancement comes in response to security risks where accounts could be secretly paired with a partner's or unauthorised person's Apple Watch. This feature can remove any particular concern in abusive relationships where technology is often used for surveillance and control.The new peripherals category is similar to the already available 'Linked Devices' section meant for other connected devices. This section displays the name of any associated Apple Watch along with the date and time it was last active. This will gives users visibility into which wearable devices have access to their WhatsApp messages and conversations.However, the feature currently has a significant limitation.Unlike other linked devices such as Mac computers or WhatsApp Web sessions, users cannot remotely unlink a paired Apple Watch directly from the iPhone app's settings. Instead, the app instructs users they must physically delete WhatsApp from the Apple Watch itself to unpair the device. This is a major restriction that could hinder users trying to remove unauthorised access without physical possession of the Watch.The update arrives just weeks after WhatsApp launched its native Apple Watch app, expanding the messaging platform's reach to wearable devices. Beyond these security enhancements for linked devices, Meta is also developing improvements to WhatsApp's chat, attachment, and storage management interfaces, according to the beta testing reports.Shortly after launching TestFlight build 25.37.10.71, Meta has rolled out another beta version featuring a new tool aimed at making chat management and storage cleanup easier.According to WABetaInfo's findings, the newer build 25.37.10.72 addsThe tool offers a more organized approach to managing conversation storage, allowing users to delete all messages within a chat, remove everything except starred messages, or eliminate media files. The interface also displays the storage space occupied by each category.By tapping, users gain access to granular controls for selecting which types of content to remove—including documents, photos, videos, stickers, and audio files—before finalizing the deletion.Users can also opt to wipe all media content in one action, which includes media that has been starred.Neither feature has a confirmed release date, though the storage clearing tool's appearance in the Android beta suggests its public launch may be approaching relatively soon","Users can now see paired Apple Watches in 'Linked Devices' This addresses concerns about unauthorized access, especially in abusive relationships.

Yann LeCun clarifies his statement

Yann LeCun on vibe coding





Meta’s chief AI scientist and one of the godfathers of AI Yann LeCun recently said that computer science degrees may not matter if graduates do not spend their time wisely, per a Business Insider report. Advising computer science students, LeCun said that they must “learn things with a long shelf life.” “If you are a CS major and take the minimum required math courses for a typical CS curriculum, you might find yourself unable to adapt to major technological shifts,” LeCun said in an emailed statement to the publication.During an appearance on ""The Information Bottleneck"" podcast, Yann LeCun said “What we should do is learn kind of basic things in mathematics, in modeling, mathematics that can be connected with reality.”“You tend to learn this kind of stuff in engineering in some schools that's linked with computer science, but sort of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, et cetera,” he added.In the podcast, LeCun jokingly pointed out that he did not initially study CS. He said some CS schools in the US are linked to engineering programs, which tend to require more advanced math. “Engineering disciplines, you know, in the US, you learn Calculus 1, 2, 3 that gives you a good basis, right?” LeCun said, adding “In computer science, you can get away with just Calculus 1.That's not enough, right?”.He also joked that he's “a computer science professor arguing against studying computer science”.Clarifying his statement later, Yann LeCun told BI “My recommendation was not to avoid CS as a major but to take the maximum number of courses on foundations (e.g. math, physics, or EE courses) rather than take courses on the trendy technology du jour.”Sharing his views on vibe coding, LeCun said that basic programming should not be thrown out. Vibe coding is nice, but it's not a substitute for fundamental knowledge, he said.“Obviously, you need to learn enough computer science to kind of program and use computers. And even though AI is going to help you be more efficient at programming, you still need to know how to do this”, LeCun said.","Yann LeCun said that computer science degrees may not matter if graduates do not spend their time wisely.

He admits feeling behind, highlighting a new 'programmable layer' of AI tools. While some studies show mixed productivity gains, industry leaders like Google and Anthropic remain optimistic about AI's role in development.

AI coding tools rewriting developer workflows, industry leaders say

Productivity gains remain uncertain as AI models improve





Andrej Karpathy, Tesla's former AI director and OpenAI cofounder, has issued what amounts to an open letter to the entire software engineering profession, warning that developers face an unprecedented challenge as AI fundamentally reshapes how code gets written. In a post on X that has sparked widespread debate, Karpathy confessed: ""I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between.""The candid admission from one of AI's most influential figures highlights the seismic shift happening in software development. Karpathy, who led AI development at Tesla for five years and helped steer the company's Autopilot effort, described feeling inadequate despite his expertise. ""I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue,"" he wrote.His post outlines a new reality where programmers must master what he calls a ""new programmable layer of abstraction"" involving agents, subagents, prompts, contexts, memory modes, MCP protocols, and IDE integrations.The challenge, Karpathy explains, is building a mental model for ""fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. ""The evolution Karpathy describes represents a dramatic departure from the ""vibe coding"" approach he famously coined in February 2025. Back then, he described casually asking AI to make changes while barely reading code diffs, accepting all suggestions, and working around bugs rather than fixing them properly. ""It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing,"" he wrote at the time.Now, even Karpathy acknowledges the limitations. When building his recent project Nanochat, he admitted it was ""basically entirely hand-written"" because AI agents ""just didn't work well enough at all and net unhelpful."" The admission underscores the gap between AI coding hype and reality, even as the technology rapidly improves.Boris Cherny, creator of Anthropic's Claude Code, responded to Karpathy's post by sharing his own revelation: ""The last month was my first month as an engineer that I didn't open an IDE at all. Opus 4.5 wrote around 200 PRs, every single line."" Cherny described how newer developers without ""legacy memories"" of older models often use AI more effectively than veterans, requiring ""significant mental work to re-adjust to what the model can do every month or two. ""Despite the rapid advancement, research suggests AI coding tools don't always boost productivity. A METR study from July found that AI assistants decreased experienced developers' productivity by 19%, though participants expected a 20% boost. Management consultants Bain & Company reported that programming showed ""unremarkable"" savings despite being ""one of the first areas to deploy generative AI.""Yet industry leaders remain optimistic. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in November that vibe coding is making software development ""so much more enjoyable"" and ""exciting again,"" with AI now writing over 30% of new code at Google. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei claimed in October that Claude was writing 90% of the company's code.Karpathy concluded his post with an urgent call to action: ""Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.""","Tesla's ex-AI chief, Andrej Karpathy, warns software engineers face a seismic shift.

Oracle stock is at its lowest level since 2001 and many investors are blaming it on Sam Altman's OpenAI deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/oracle-stock-is-at-its-lowest-level-since-2001-and-many-investors-are-blaming-it-on-sam-altmans-openai-deal/articleshow/126201641.cms,"Technology stocks, including Nvidia and Broadcom, also declined, impacting the S&P 500 and semiconductor index.

How Oracle went from from super high to deep lows in 2025





Just three months into their tenure as co-CEOs, Oracle’s Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia are facing a brutal market reckoning. Shares of the database giant have plummeted 30% this quarter, putting the stock on track for its worst performance since the 2001 dot-com crash. The sell-off reflects growing investor anxiety over Oracle’s high-stakes pivot toward artificial intelligence infrastructure—a shift that requires unprecedented levels of debt and capital expenditure to support its massive partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI The honeymoon period for the new leadership ended abruptly this month following a disappointing earnings report. While Oracle secured a landmark $300 billion commitment from OpenAI in September, Wall Street is questioning the cost of fulfilling that deal. Investors are worried that if OpenAI struggles to raise sufficient funding or generate enough revenue as competition intensifies, Oracle could be left holding the bag. Analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets reportedly estimated in September that Oracle may need to add $100 billion in debt over the next four years to fund its OpenAI contract.Finance chief Doug Kehring recently stunned analysts by projecting $50 billion in capital expenditures for fiscal 2026 -- double the previous year’s total.To fuel this expansion, Oracle is planning $248 billion in leases for cloud capacity and data centers.This aggressive build-out is being funded by ""boatloads of debt,"" including a $18 billion bond sale in September. While Oracle maintains it will protect its investment-grade credit rating, the rising price of the company’s credit default swaps suggests bondholders are increasingly nervous.“Considering Oracle is already barely hanging on to an investment-grade rating, we would be concerned about Oracle’s ability to live up to these obligations,” analysts at D.A. Davidson warned in a recent note.The current slump stands in stark contrast to the historic optimism seen just weeks ago. In September, reports of the OpenAI deal sent Oracle shares to an all-time high of $345.72. Since that peak, the stock has shed 43% of its value, closing Wednesday at $197.49.Analysts at FactSet predict Oracle’s gross margins could slide from 77% (seen in 2021) to 49% by 2030, with billions in negative free cash flow expected over the next five years.Oracle's deals to provide AI infrastructure require the company to build expensive data centers filled with powerful GPUs before any revenue is recognized. Oracle entered the AI boom with a debt-heavy balance sheet, and the situation is worsening as the company borrows to fuel its AI ambitions. Thanks to heavy spending on AI infrastructure, Oracle ended the second quarter with about $108 billion in debt. That's up from $92.6 billion in May. The company completed an $18 billion bond sale in September.","Oracle shares have plummeted 30% this quarter, putting the stock on track for its worst performance since the 2001 dot-com crash.

Google taps large pool of ex-employees following 2023 layoffs

Competitors also aggressively pursuing AI engineering talent





Google has intensified its battle for AI talent by bringing back former employees, with 20% of its AI software engineer hires in 2025 being so-called boomerang workers—a notable increase from previous years, CNBC has learned. The tech giant confirmed the statistic remains accurate as of December and reported a surge in AI researchers joining from major competitors compared to 2024.The company's aggressive rehiring strategy comes as it competes with OpenAI , Meta, and Anthropic in the heated AI talent wars. Google's head of compensation John Casey told employees that AI-focused engineers are attracted to the company's substantial financial resources and computational infrastructure needed for advanced AI work, according to audio reviewed by CNBC.Google has a large pool of former employees to recruit from, particularly after its largest-ever layoff round in early 2023 when parent company Alphabet cut 12,000 jobs—a 6% workforce reduction. The company has since continued with rolling layoffs and buyouts as part of ongoing efficiency measures.The boomerang trend extends beyond Google, with ADP Research data showing increased employee returns across the industry, particularly in the information sector.Among notable returns, Google brought back AI pioneer Noam Shazeer in late 2024. Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas had left Google in 2021 to start Character.AI after the company reportedly rebuffed their chatbot development efforts, but rejoined DeepMind in August 2024 under a licensing deal.The competition for AI talent remains fierce across the industry. Microsoft hired around two dozen employees from Google's DeepMind earlier this year, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed in June that Meta had been offering $100 million signing bonuses. Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who came out of retirement in 2023, has personally reached out to prospective candidates, according to people familiar with the matter.Despite the competitive landscape, Google has made progress in its AI efforts. The company announced its latest Gemini 3 model last month, and Alphabet's stock price has risen more than 60% this year, outperforming all megacap peers.","Google is aggressively re-hiring former AI talent, with 20% of its AI software engineer hires in 2025 expected to be 'boomerang workers' This strategy, fueled by substantial resources and infrastructure, aims to counter intense competition from rivals like OpenAI and Meta.

Job cuts in private companies and government





In 2025, a single word dominated boardrooms from Seattle to San Francisco. The word defined the job market and struck fear into the hearts of tech workers: Efficiency. It began as a corporate motto for leaders like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy but quickly transformed into a restructuring of the global workforce. The word has been used by Big Tech giants like Google and Microsoft to the federal government as they incorporate more AI into their operations, triggering a wave of layoffs, hiring freezes and a shift in job security.According to a report by Business Insider, “efficiency” is a strategic North Star for CEOs, sending a signal to shareholders that they are leaning into AI and streamlining over-hiring of the pandemic era. A few companies removed layers of middle management, while others automated much of their administrative tasks AI chatbots.A bet on smaller workforce for higher profits became become ‘nightmare’ for employees. Companies like Dell, Salesforce, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have implemented cuts to balance budgets.The government was also hit by job cuts. Following the inauguration of President Donald Trump in January, the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) launched a massive overhaul of the federal workforce. In September, news agency Reuters reported that over 150,000 federal employees left the US government payroll after accepting buyouts. This was the largest single-year exodus of civil servants in nearly 80 yearsIn August, rump administration human resources chief said that through a combination of buyouts, firings and other incentives for workers to quit, the government will likely shed around 300,000 workers by the end of 2025.This was followed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s aggressive tactics, including his infamous “5 things” email requiring staff to document daily productivity or face immediate resignation.The Business Insider report also said workers are experiencing a “tenuous” job market as long-term unemployment is rising, and “quit rates” are declining as employees cling to their current roles. Other words that dominated the year were: “tariffs,” “uncertainty,” and “inflation.”","Efficiency has been used by Big Tech giants like Google and Microsoft to the federal government as they incorporate more AI into their operations. Companies like Dell, Salesforce, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have implemented cuts to balance budgets. Government was also hit by job cuts following the inauguration of President Donald Trump in January.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126200178,imgsize-67280,width-400,resizemode-4/ai.jpg"

New York governor Kathy Hochul has sent a warning to social media platforms. She announced that social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and others are required to display prominent mental health warning labels on their feeds under a new law. The mandate specifically targets features designed to encourage excessive use, such as infinite scrolling, auto-play videos, among others.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the law applies to conduct occurring partly or wholly in New York but not when the platform is accessed by users physically outside the state. This move is the latest escalation in an effort to curb the ‘addictive’ nature of these social media websites, particularly for younger users.“Keeping New Yorkers safe has been my top priority since taking office, and that includes protecting our kids from the potential harms of social media features that encourage excessive use,” Hochul said in a statement.The governor framed the new requirement as a basic public safety measure, comparing the digital warnings to those found on physical products that pose health or safety risks. The legislation is tailored to the mechanics of modern social media:Content that continues to load as the user moves down the page.Videos that start automatically, often leading to longer-than-intended viewing sessions.Content curated by AI to maximise user engagement.New York is not alone in its pursuit of stricter digital safeguards, and joins California and Minnesota in passing social media regulations. Australia, earlier this month, banned social media entirely for children under the age of 16.The legislation aligns with a 2023 advisory from the US Surgeon General, who warned of the risks social media poses to youth mental health and specifically called for the type of warning labels New York has now codified into law.","New York governor compares social media with 'Tobacco' addiction.

Intellect Design Arena is aiming to generate Rs 1,000 crore in revenue over the next four years from its artificial intelligence platform, Purple Fabric. According to the company, Purple Fabric has been built as a decision-grade AI platform rather than a standalone generative AI tool. It is designed to help banking, financial services and insurance companies deploy custom-built AI agents trained on their own proprietary enterprise data, with governance and auditability built in. The company claims that Purple Fabric is positioned to address a common enterprise problem: AI initiatives that stall at pilot stages and fail to deliver measurable financial impact.Arun Jain, founder and chairman and managing director of Intellect Design Arena and chief architect of Purple Fabric, said India has a chance to move beyond consuming global AI tools to building enterprise-grade platforms for the world. He argued that AI should act as a co-strategist rather than a replacement for human judgement, freeing leaders to focus on imagination, empathy and decision-making.The platform is claimed to rest on four pillars: an enterprise knowledge garden, digital experts, governance and model optimisation. At its core are close to 70 ready-to-deploy digital experts that can be customised and combined based on client needs. The architecture follows a microservices approach, allowing enterprises to use individual components or stitch them together across workflows such as credit, fraud, liquidity and compliance.Intellect Design reported revenue of Rs 2,577 crore in the last financial year, up 11 percent year on year.

“the assumption that the National Intelligence Service is nearby”





South Korean prosecutors have arrested 10 former Samsung employees. These ex-employees of the tech giant were charged with allegedly leaking 10-nanometre (nm) DRAM technology to the Chinese firm ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT). According to a report by The Asia Business Daily, the group, which includes a former executive and five key development staff, is accused of violating the Industrial Technology Protection Act. Authorities estimate the intellectual property theft has already contributed to a 5 trillion won decline in Samsung Electronics’ sales last year and threatens trillions more in future national economic losses.​​The investigation found that CXMT began aggressively recruiting key personnel from Samsung Electronics shortly after its founding in 2016. At that time, Samsung was the only company in the world mass-producing 10-nm DRAM. The arrested individuals include section heads who were directly responsible for research and development, providing CXMT with the critical technical expertise required to bridge the gap with South Korean manufacturers.Leaked information from Samsung reportedly enabled CXMT to manufacture China’s first 10 nm DRAM chip in 2023.The prosecutors feel that this stolen IP laid the groundwork for the Chinese firm to begin volume production of HBM2 memory in 2024. Market research indicates that CXMT aims to take up to 15% of the market for this speciality memory, competing with market leader Samsung.A former Samsung executive, referred to as “Mr A,” reportedly led work on 10-nm DRAM technology for CXMT. Another key employee, “Mr B,” who was involved in research on the technology, allegedly copied information on DRAM manufacturing.According to The Chosun Daily, “Mr B” manually transcribed 12 pages of information to avoid detection, as semiconductor companies heavily protect their data, and copying files from computers or photographing them with smartphones could lead to discovery.This is not the first time South Korean tech employees have been arrested for sharing information with Chinese firms. Earlier this year, a former SK hynix employee was caught before boarding a flight to China. Meanwhile, another engineer was later sentenced to 18 months in prison for trying to sell information to Huawei. In 2024, two former Samsung executives were also arrested for allegedly stealing confidential information and using it to set up a chip factory in China.However, this case is said to involve more people than the earlier incidents. The Samsung group reportedly used shell companies to pass information and frequently changed office locations to avoid detection.Prosecutors also said the group worked underand used cryptography for emergency communication.",10 former Samsung employees have been arrested in South Korea.

What are China’s new rules for AI companies to operate in the country

“to subtly question and deny the legitimacy of the country's leadership”

“to implant potential separatist ideas into educational courses.""





A new ""cottage industry"" of specialised agencies for artificial intelligence (AI) companies has reportedly emerged in China. These agencies are helping AI companies to pass rigorous government ideological tests required for public launch, a report claims. This test falls under rules formalised in November that require AI models to handle a 2,000-question exam correctly and to refuse to answer at least 95% of prompts designed to trigger politically sensitive or subversive content.According to a Wall Street Journal report, these agencies operate like test-prep services, helping companies train their chatbots to navigate the Chinese government’s strict censorship requirements.The rules are intended to ensure that the AI does not create answers in a manner which might destabilise society or call into question the legitimacy of the Chinese state, the report notes.To complete the examination, chatbots will have to be trained to disregard some of these questions, includingandThis is because Beijing regards AI as an economic and technological priority but fears its unpredictable content, which may spark popular dissent.However, the first examination result is not the only factor in maintaining continuous operations, as the government is constantly monitoring through several enforcement mechanisms. Cyberspace Administration of China offices have random pop quizzes on operating chatbots to ensure they continue to reflect the nation's ideology.Additionally, all AI-generated text, images, and videos must be explicitly labelled so that any undesirable content can be traced back to its source for potential punishment. To keep pace with shifting political priorities, the official test bank of 2,000 questions is updated at least once a month to include new sensitive topics.The government has demonstrated its willingness to shut down non-compliant programmes immediately. Between April and June, authorities reported taking down 3,500 AI products that failed to meet labelling or content standards. While these regulations ensure political stability from the party's perspective, analysts note they create a daunting, expensive technical hurdle for developers competing in the global AI race.To compare, American AI companies also control content to reduce the spread of violent or inappropriate material, partly to avoid lawsuits and negative publicity. However, researchers say Beijing’s approach, at least for AI models used inside China, goes much further. It reflects China’s long-standing efforts to tightly manage public discussion, including the creation of the Great Firewall in the early 2000s.Chinese authorities now seem more confident that their strategy for managing AI will work. After years of taking a cautious stance, the Chinese government adopted a more enthusiastic approach in August, launching an “AI Plus” initiative that aims to deploy AI across 70% of key sectors by 2027.In September, China also released an AI roadmap developed with input from major tech companies such as Alibaba and Huawei, underscoring the government’s confidence in working closely with industry.Due to the Great Firewall, the Chinese government knows that if a chatbot produces content deemed a threat, it is unlikely to spread widely, as state censorship will limit how far it can travel on social media.","A new 'cottage industry' of specialised agencies for artificial intelligence (AI) companies has reportedly emerged in China.

Humanoid robots, like Tesla Optimus, are already ruling the social media. They can be seen dancing or folding laundry but despite a massive influx of capital and viral videos of these machines, the leaders of the most prominent robotics startups have said that robots replacing humans at work is still a work in progress. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, industry veterans admit that moving from a “science experiment” to a “useful worker” is facing a technical hurdle.Citing Pras Velagapudi, CTO of Agility Robotics – the company that is currently testing its ""Digit"" robots with giants like Amazon – remains skeptical of the “robot butler” narrative. According to him, Digit can successfully move boxes in a warehouse but performing complex, varied household tasks is currently beyond the industry's reach due to extreme unreliability.“We’ve been trying to figure out how do we not just make a humanoid robot, but also make a humanoid robot that does useful work,” Velagapudi was quoted as saying.The report highlighted that a major barrier is not just intelligence, but the physical danger they pose to humans. Ani Kelkar, a partner at McKinsey, told the publication that the actual machine accounts for only $20 of every $100 spent on a robotic deployment.The remaining $80 is spent on specialised equipment and systems designed to keep human workers from being injured.“We’re doing a big extrapolation from watching videos of robots doing laundry to a butler in my house that can do everything,” Kelkar cautioned, adding that while companies like Tesla and Unitree are building smaller, lighter robots that are theoretically safer than heavy industrial arms.For several startups, the focus is now mastering one specific job rather than “doing everything”. As per Isaac Qureshi, CEO of Gatlin Robotics, the company is training a prototype to clean office spaces. While the robot is currently learning to scrub walls and dust, Qureshi identified the ultimate goal for the sector: “Toilet’s a big North Star.”","Industry veterans admit that moving from a ‘science experiment’ to a “useful worker’ is facing a technical hurdle.

“self-driving technology could be useful in ways the world has yet to imagine, creating many new types of products, jobs, and services.”

""new jobs""

What Americans said about earning from this Waymo ‘gig work’

“$22 to $24”

“$60 to $80”

“We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services given the broad power outage in San Francisco. We are focused on keeping our riders safe and ensuring emergency personnel have the clear access they need to do their work,”

""We've always focused on developing the Waymo Driver for the world as it is, including when infrastructure fails.

We are analysing the event and are already integrating the lessons from this weekend's PG&E outage.”

""immediate steps""





A new type of gig work has emerged in the US self-driving car industry. The Google-owned Waymo robotaxi service is paying Americans roughly $22 just to close the doors of autonomous vehicles. While Waymo was initially launched to eliminate the need for human drivers, the technology has created unexpected manual labour tasks for local workers. According to a report by The Washington Post, tow truck operators are now using an app called Honk to pick up small maintenance jobs for the autonomous fleet.These new roles fulfil a prediction made nearly a decade ago. In a 2016 press release, Waymo’s ex-CEO John Krafcik wrote thatNine years later, thoseinclude simple physical tasks that the robot cars cannot perform themselves, such as securing a door that a passenger left open or moving a vehicle that has stalled.Despite the convenience of app-based work, some business owners describe it as difficult. Tow company owner Evangelica Cuevas explained that her drivers are offeredto close Waymo doors and betweento tow the vehicles when they run out of power or experience technical issues.This specialised work often arises when a vehicle gets stuck while looking for a charging station, leaving workers to handle the physical problems the software cannot solve. These situations also occur when the robotaxis become inoperable due to technical faults or natural calamities.Earlier this week, a massive power outage affected nearly 30% of San Francisco, plunging the city into darkness for hours, paralysing its infrastructure and leaving hundreds of Google-owned Waymo self-driving vehicles stranded in the middle of busy roads. Social media users posted videos and photos of Waymo vehicles stuck in the middle of roads and disrupting traffic flows.According to a report by SFGate, Waymo was forced to suspend operations for several hours after the vehicles became unable to safely navigate intersections without functioning traffic signals.a Waymo spokesperson said at that time.Later, the company announced that it would implement a fleet-wide update to help its cars make safer, quicker decisions during power outages like the one in San Francisco. This came after many Waymo cars were spotted stranded on the road, while Elon Musk claimed that rival Tesla cars kept rolling during that outage.In the blog post, the company wrote,Waymo also outlined the threeit was taking to avoid such situations in the coming days. This includes integrating more information about outages, updating emergency preparedness and response, and expanding first responder engagement.More recently, Waymo paused its robotaxi service in San Francisco once again. This time, the company reportedly sent a notification to customers through its app stating, “Service temporarily paused due to National Weather Service flash flood warning.” The National Weather Service had extended a flood watch for the entire San Francisco Bay Area through Friday, December 26, at 10 pm local time.","Google-owned Waymo robotaxi service is paying Americans roughly $22 just to close the doors of autonomous vehicles.

‘US losing renewables race to China’, warns Eric Schmidt







Google’s former CEO, Eric Schmidt, has raised questions on the power generation capacity of the United States even as the tech industry is accelerating towards the AI-first model. He also emphasised that China is making huge investments in renewable energy sources, like nuclear and solar energy – something that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously warned about.While speaking at Institute of Politics Harvard Kennedy School, Schmidt said that the US has not produced new electricity while China has surplus power.“In America, we have essentially produced no new electricity because it's very hard to provision electricity. China has infinite electricity because of their incredible investment in renewables and so forth,” he said.“They built something like 120 gigawatts of new renewable energy in the last five years, and some number like that,” Schmidt pointed out, only to be interrupted by Graham Allison, an American political scientist and professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, who said that “every day in China, another gigawatt of electricity is added to the grid” and that happens all year.In May this year, Musk responded to a post which claimed, “If China's 888 GW of installed solar operated at U.S. capacity factors, it would generate 44% of U.S. electricity.” The Tesla CEO said that “Most people don't realize how much solar power China has installed. Enough to power half of America!”Recently, Musk sounded the alarm on America’s energy infrastructure crisis, saying that the US is lagging power generation capacity is a “major competitive disadvantage” as China races ahead in the global power race.He was responding to market analyst Adam Kobeissi's analysis in which he claimed that China now commands 3.75 terawatts of power generation capacity – nearly three times the United States' 1.30 terawatts.Schmidt also raised questions on US’ nuclear power generation. He said that as compared to China, US is not generating any nuclear energy.“How big is a nuclear power plant? About 1.5 gigawatts. So that’s the scale of electricity revolution is taking place in China. How many of those plants have been built in America? Zero. And we are certainly losing the renewables race to China, for the reason that everybody here knows. So they have a lot of power, we don't. We have a lot of chips, they don't,” he said.Similar arguments have also been shared by market analysts. China is said to be aggressively expanding its nuclear infrastructure with 34 reactors currently under construction, which is more than the next nine countries combined. It has also been reported that nearly 200 additional reactors are either planned or proposed for future development. The US, in stark contrast, has no large commercial nuclear reactors under construction.","Schmidt said that the US has not produced new electricity while China has surplus power.

Panos Panay: Shift to ‘ ambient intelligence ’ coming soon







Panos Panay, Amazon ’s head of devices and services, has predicted a big change in consumer technology. According to the executive, the current tech like smartphones and apps is approaching a tipping point due to social media and the rise of generative AI. He said that young generation will consume technology ‘without screens’ and defined by “ambient intelligence”.Speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm AI conference, Panay said Panay says we are looking at “ambient” future where technology fades into the background of daily life as the next generation of users is growing tired of “doom scrolling”.“There’s a whole younger generation coming up that I think at some point they get tired of doom scrolling,” he said, adding, “They’re going to just think differently. You’ve got to make sure you have products in their pockets, on their bodies, in their homes that they don’t expect… [but] expect to connect seamlessly.”According to Panay, the future of AI isn't about building a better app but about making the app experience disappear entirely.“It’s such a joy because there’s no opening a phone, opening the app, clicking, finding… none of it. You just ask the question and you get it back,” Panay observed.Panay said that Amazon is working towards that future by incorporating a better Alexa into its products while suggesting that the ultimate form factor for an AI assistant has not yet been created for public.“I don’t think we’ve seen the next form factor yet on where AI devices are going to go,” he said, adding that Amazon has a “lab full of ideas.”When questioned about potential competitors, like the rumored AI hardware by OpenAI and legendary designer Jony Ive, Panay pointed to Amazon’s existing portfolio of wearables, including the Echo Frames and earbuds.“I think you’re going to want your assistant with you everywhere you go,” he added.While talking on security, Panay said that this is an aspect that is non-negotiable.“I feel like it’s a contract with our customers, period.

Experimentation, Risk, and Regret

Bill Gates journey from rebellion to a billionaire status





Microsoft founder Bill Gates has opened up about the profound and sometimes provocative role of his fellow Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. In his memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, which was released on February 4, 2025, Gates has credited Allen not only with sparking his passion for computers but also with nudging him into teenage experimentation with drugs and alcohol. Speaking in an interview with Geekwire, Gates joked that Allen was ‘a problem’ who got him drunk and also gave him marijuana. He further added that Allen was the one who got him introduced to LSD and legendary musician Jimi Hendrix’s music. While Gates’ parents provided discipline and structure, Allen embodied a different influence which constantly dared Gates to push boundaries.“He got me drunk, he gave me pot. This guy was a problem… he made me listen to Jimi Hendrix,” Gates recalled.In his memoir, Gates admitted that he tried LSD ‘four to five times’ when he was in his teens. He further described that getting drunk and passing out and experimenting with marijuana in hopes of impressing girls and realizing those attempts “didn’t work out.”In his interview with People, Gates talked how curiosity and risk-taking drove those experiences, but youthful insecurity played a role too. While some moments felt profound at the time, Gates now views them with skepticism, saying he eventually gave up drugs to preserve mental clarity and avoid long-term effects.Interestingly, Gates noted that Steve Jobs once told him he should have tried hallucinogens to make Microsoft products more appealing, a suggestion Gates ultimately rejected.Despite all these experiments, Gates went ahead to build Microsoft. He along with Allen co-founded Microsoft in 1975 and the company went public in 1986 at $21 per share Gates retained a 45% stake, instantly becoming a millionaire.Microsoft grew rapidly under the leadership of Bill Gates. He also attained the title of world’s richest person in 1993. Gates stepped down from the position of Microsoft CEO in 2000 and Steve Ballmer stepped in to fill the position. After stepping down from the position of Microsoft CEO, Gates shifted his focus towardsphilanthropy via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Today, Gates’ net worth stands at $118 billion, ranking him 18th on the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. Microsoft itself has a market capitalization of $3.6 trillion.","Bill Gates has opened up about the profound and sometimes provocative role of his fellow Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. In his memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, which was released on February 4, 2025, Gates has credited Allen with sparking his passion for computers but also with nudging him into teenage experimentation with drugs and alcohol.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126190919,imgsize-45758,width-400,resizemode-4/bill-gates.jpg"
American billionaire Mark Cuban to new grads: You need to join small companies and teach them how to use AI agents as big companies don’t ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/american-billionaire-mark-cuban-to-new-grads-you-need-to-join-small-companies-and-teach-them-how-to-use-ai-agents-as-big-companies-dont-/articleshow/126190364.cms,"Why AI agents matter

A Jellyfish study found adoption of agentic AI among 400 companies jumped from 50% in December 2024 to 82% in May 2025.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared earlier this year that “the age of agentic AI is here.”

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman likened AI agents to “junior employees.”

Morgan Stanley projects AI shopping agents could add $115 billion to U.S. e-commerce by 2030.

Mark Cuban advice young engineers to not go behind big companies





American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has now shared a new message for the fresh graduates: skip the big corporations and head to small and medium sized businesses. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Cuban argued that small companies are the place where fresh graduates can add most value mainly by them in adopting AI agents. “New grads can teach SMBs how to use agents to optimize processes they couldn’t take the time or afford to do manually,” Cuban wrote. “Big companies don’t need new grads for this. Entrepreneurial companies will love the value you add.”AI agents are autonomous digital assistants capable of completing tasks end-to-end without constant user prompts. They’re increasingly seen as transformative for business operations:Cuban believes this is precisely where new graduates can step in, teaching smaller firms how to integrate AI agents into workflows they previously lacked the resources to optimize.Recently, Cuban urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI).Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects. “Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.","Mark Cuban urges young engineers to not go behind big companies for AI opportunities.

Tesla Bull and co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management has now voiced his concerns about Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) v14.2.2.25 update. While earlier Gerber has earlier praised improvements in Tesla’s latest FSD iteration, he shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) that the system struggled at the time of a trial run in the rain with his cybertruck.Gerber shared a photo of the FSD interface along with a warning, “Autopilot Visibility Limited. Clear dirt or debris on cameras.” He further noted that the issue wasn’t caused by dirt but by rain interfering with the system’s sensors. “Not sure of Tesla’s plans if FSD doesn’t work well in rain or direct sunlight…” Gerber wrote, adding that he wanted other users to test the system in similar conditions.The latest comments made by Gerber made a stark shift from his earlier stance, where he hailed Tesla’s v14 update as a significant leap forward in autonomous driving. But his new remarks highlight the challenges Tesla faces in ensuring FSD reliability across diverse weather conditions.esla is said to be hiring factory floor workers and salespeople to become ""AI operators"" for its self-driving ride-sharing service.

Waymo pauses robotaxis in San Francisco; sends customer notification explaining why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/waymo-pauses-robotaxis-in-san-francisco-sends-customer-notification-explaining-why/articleshow/126189546.cms,"“We’ve always focused on developing the

Waymo Driver

for the world as it is, including when infrastructure fails. We are analyzing the event, and are already integrating the lessons from this weekend’s PG&E outage. Here are some of the immediate steps we’re taking:

Integrating more information about outages: While our Driver already handles dark traffic signals as four-way stops, we are now rolling out fleet-wide updates that give our vehicles even more context about regional outages, allowing them to navigate these intersections more decisively.

Updating our emergency preparedness and response: We will improve our emergency response protocols, incorporating lessons from this event.

In San Francisco, we’ll continue to coordinate with Mayor Lurie’s team to identify areas of greater collaboration in our existing emergency preparedness plans.

Expanding our first responder engagement: To date, we’ve trained more than 25,000 first responders in the U.S. and around the world on how to interact with Waymo. As we discover learnings from this and other widespread events, we’ll continue updating our first responder training.

Undaunted in our mission to make our streets safer

We live and work in San Francisco, and we are grateful to the city’s first responders for their tireless work, and to Mayor Lurie for his leadership.”





Google-owned Waymo has paused its robotaxi service in San Francisco, reports CNBC. According to the report, the company has sent a customer notification in its app which says “Service temporarily paused due to National Weather Service flash flood warning”. The National Weather Service has extended a flood watch for the entire San Francisco Bay Area through Friday, December 26 10 p.m. local time.Waymo previously reported a halt in its service after a temporary power outage hit the city last week. The disruption then left multiple Waymo cars stranded across the San Francisco Bay area. Days after the incident, the company shared a blog where the EV maker said it will implement a fleet-wide update to help its cars make safer, quicker decisions during power outage incidents.In its official statement, the company said: “At Waymo, our mission is to be the world’s most trusted driver. We know trust is built through consistent behavior over time—earned through every mile we drive and every interaction we have with the community. This past Saturday, as a widespread PG&E outage cut power to nearly one-third of San Francisco, our service was put to the test. With power now restored, we want to share an account of our operations during the outage and how we are evolving to better serve the city.“The scale of the outage and the sheer number of disabled traffic lights were the primary contributors to city-wide gridlock. As signals went dark across major corridors, the resulting congestion required law enforcement to manually manage intersections. The situation was severe enough that the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management advised residents to stay home, underscoring the extraordinary nature of the weekend’s disruptions. ”It further stated:","Google-owned Waymo has paused its robotaxi service in San Francisco, reports CNBC.

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s full New Year’s letter

2025 has been a defining year for Intel. Just 9 months ago, I was deeply humbled to take on the incredibly important task of leading this iconic American company at a pivotal moment. Across the world, Intel employees rallied together as we began to lay the foundation for a New Intel.

Heading into the holiday season, I would like to thank our many customers, partners, investors and employees for their trust, encouragement and support through the year.

I am encouraged by the changes I am seeing within Intel as we embrace our roots as an innovative, data-driven, engineering-centric and execution-focused company.

I am proud of our progress this year and grateful for the continued partnership of so many all over the world. I am excited and inspired by the tremendous opportunities ahead of us and I am looking forward to building and shipping great products and delighting our customers and partners.

Wishing everyone a joyful holiday season and a happy, healthy and prosperous new year as we continue our journey in 2026!





Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has delivered his first New Year's message since taking the helm of the struggling chipmaker, reflecting on a turbulent nine months that saw mass layoffs, billion-dollar bailouts, and a dramatic White House intervention. ""Just 9 months ago, I was deeply humbled to take on the incredibly important task of leading this iconic American company at a pivotal moment,"" Tan wrote Thursday, expressing gratitude to customers, partners and employees who stood by Intel through its most challenging year in decades.The 65-year-old semiconductor veteran struck an optimistic tone despite presiding over one of tech's most aggressive restructuring efforts. ""I am encouraged by the changes I am seeing within Intel as we embrace our roots as an innovative, data-driven, engineering-centric and execution-focused company,"" Tan stated, signaling confidence in the company's transformation from bureaucratic giant to nimble competitor.Lip Bu Tan's tenure has been defined by ruthless cost-cutting paired with strategic deal-making. Intel slashed roughly 24,000 positions—a quarter of its workforce—eliminated half its management layers, and canceled factory expansions in Germany and Poland.The company posted an $18.8 billion loss for 2024, its first annual loss since 1986, while bleeding market share to rivals like Nvidia and AMD.Yet Tan simultaneously orchestrated critical lifelines. Intel secured $7.865 billion in CHIPS Act funding, with the US government becoming its largest shareholder at 9.9%. SoftBank injected $2 billion in August, followed by a stunning $5 billion investment from Nvidia—the same company Intel rejected buying for $20 billion in 2005, now worth over $4 trillion.Tan's defining moment came in August when President Donald Trump publicly called for his resignation over investments in Chinese companies, posting on Truth Social that the CEO ""is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately."" What followed was a masterclass in crisis management and political maneuvering.Within two weeks, Tan had orchestrated a carefully planned Oval Office meeting, enlisting Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to vouch for him beforehand. The 40-minute session with Trump, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent proved pivotal. Tan addressed concerns about his China ties while positioning himself as an American patriot committed to domestic semiconductor manufacturing.Trump's reversal was complete and public. ""His success and rise is an amazing story,"" the president wrote on Truth Social after the meeting, abandoning his resignation demand. The breakthrough came when Tan agreed to give the US government equity in exchange for CHIPS Act funding—a deal that delivered $8.9 billion and made Intel ""too-strategic-to-fail."" Intel's stock has surged 80% since Tan's March appointment.In his holiday letter, Tan deliberately shifted focus from survival mode to growth opportunities. ""I am excited and inspired by the tremendous opportunities ahead of us and I am looking forward to building and shipping great products and delighting our customers and partners,"" he wrote, closing with wishes for ""a joyful holiday season and a happy, healthy and prosperous new year as we continue our journey in 2026.

How 'Google fear and threat' just made Nvidia spend $20 billion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-fear-and-threat-just-made-nvidia-just-spend-20-billion/articleshow/126188810.cms,"Difference between Nvidia GPU vs Google TPU

Why Nvidia struck deal with Groq

Groq builds fast AI inference. Groq LPU AI inference technology delivers exceptional AI compute speed, quality, and affordability at scale. Groq AI inference infrastructure, specifically GroqCloud, is powered by the Language Processing Unit (LPU), a new category of processor. Groq created and built the LPU from the ground up to meet the unique needs of AI. LPUs run Large Language Models (LLMs) and other leading models at substantially faster speeds and, on an architectural level, up to 10x more efficiently from an energy perspective compared to GPUs.





Nvidia has acquired the assets of AI chip startup Groq in a $20 billion. The deal represents a 3x premium over Groq’s valuation just months ago and it is being viewed as a defensive play to protect Nvidia’s dominance against a rising trend of tech companies preferring custom silicon, specifically Google TPUs. The move is said to be driven by two key factors: the need for cost efficiency and the demand for higher processing speeds. Nvidia is currently struggling to meet the overwhelming global demand for its GPUs, and tech companies are looking for specialised alternatives as AI race hots up.Nvidia lost billions after Meta reportedly struck deal with Google for TPUsEarlier this year, Nvidia issued a statement defending its market position after a report claimed that one of its biggest customers, Facebook parent company Meta, is in advanced talks to spend billions on Google's competing AI chips. This hit Nvidia's stock, erasing roughly $250 billion in market value.Before we jump on to Nvidia vs Google debate, it must be understood the difference between the products offered by both the companies. Nvidia GPUs have are ‘General Purpose’, which means they can be utilised for AI, gaming, crypto mining and scientific simulations. Google TPUs, however, are specialised chips designed for speeding up the “tensor” math that powers machine learning.Apart from flexibility, other differences include speed and efficiency. While Nvidia’s GPUs offer excellent speed, it has overhead for general tasks and are costly. Google’s TPUs are ultra-fast for specific AI training/inference (running an AI model and getting an answer with less lag), and can be mixed-and-matched with Nvidia GPUs to increase efficiency and lower cost.Groq offers a technology similar to Google’s TPUs. According to the company’s website:By acquiring Groq’s fast and efficient LPU technology to complement its powerful GPUs, Nvidia is trying to neutralise the risk of a rival offering a low-cost alternative that could have ‘shrunk’ the company’s dominance to the “training-only” market.The strategic deal will allow Nvidia to capture the entire customer lifecycle through a tiered offering – directing premium clients toward high-end GPUs for heavy-duty model training and steering price-sensitive users toward LPUs for high-speed inference.","Groq builds fast AI inference.
